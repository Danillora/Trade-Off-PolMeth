Abstract = {This paper argues that a fundamental failing in the debate on the
   decline of American economic power is not taking globalization
   seriously. With the rise of transnational corporations (TNCs),
   transnational modular production networks, and the globalization of
   corporate ownership, we can no longer give the same relevance to
   national accounts such as balance of trade and GDP in the twenty-first
   century as we did in the mid-twentieth. Rather, we must summon data on
   the TNCs themselves to encompass their transnational operations. This
   will reveal, for example, that despite the declining global share of
   United States GDP from 40\% in 1960 to below a quarter from 2008 onward,
   American corporations continue to dominate sector after sector. In fact,
   in certain advanced sectors such as aerospace and softwareeven in
   financial servicesAmerican dominance has increased since 2008. There are
   no serious contenders, including China. By looking at the wrong data,
   many have failed to see that American economic power has not declinedit
   has globalized.},

Title = {International Law and Public Attitudes Toward Torture: An Experimental
   Study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},
Pages = {105-140},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Domestic approaches to compliance with international commitments often
   presume that international law has a distinct effect on the beliefs and
   preferences of national publics. Studies attempting to estimate the
   consequences of international law unfortunately face a wide range of
   empirical and methodological challenges. This article uses an
   experimental design embedded in two U.S. national surveys to offer
   direct systematic evidence of international law's effect on mass
   attitudes. To provide a relatively tough test for international law, the
   surveys examine public attitudes toward the use of torture, an issue in
   which national security concerns are often considered paramount.
   Contrary to the common contention of international law's inefficacy, I
   find that legal commitments have a discernible impact on public support
   for the use of torture. The effect of international law is also
   strongest in those contexts where pressures to resort to torture are at
   their highest. However, the effects of different dimensions in the level
   of international agreements' legalization are far from uniform. In
   contrast to the attention often devoted to binding rules, I find that
   the level of obligation seems to make little difference on public
   attitudes toward torture. Rather, the relative precision of the rules,
   along with the degree to which enforcement is delegated to third
   parties, plays a much greater role in shaping public preferences. Across
   both international law and legalization, an individual's political
   ideology also exerts a strong mediating effect, though in varying
   directions depending on the design of the agreement. The findings have
   implications for understanding the overall impact of international law
   on domestic actors, the importance of institutional design, and the role
   of political ideology on compliance with international agreements.},

   it is conceived pragmatically as a set of ideals that guide interactions
   concerning cross-border problems. It argues that a will to believe in
   cosmopolitanism can be rationally justified by historical achievements
   and present tendencies in social conditions. Cosmopolitan beliefs are
   warranted, first, by demonstrating the empirical relevance of
   cosmopolitan ethics as a `living option' in a new era of interaction and
   interdependence. Second, a pragmatic reorientation of cosmopolitan
   theory is conducted to widen the basis for identifying cosmopolitan
   action and permit a reconstruction of its ideals appropriate to today's
   pluralistic world. Finally, cosmopolitan ideals of equality, critical
   intelligence, and intercultural dialogue are developed as guides to
   addressing cross-border problems, drawing on the issue of climate change
   to illustrate how they become operative. A pragmatic faith in these
   ideals is thus justified by empirical hypotheses concerning the
   historical tendencies and latent potentialities of human experience,
   rather than metaphysical premises attached to a supernatural force or
   universal Reason.},

Abstract = {Scholars disagree whether local decision making is inherently more
   democratic and sustainable than centralized governance structures. While
   some maintain it is, due to the incorporation of local knowledge,
   citizen decision makers' closeness to the issues, and the benefits of
   participatory democracy, others find it as susceptible to issues of
   corruption and poor implementation as any other scale. We argue that
   with wetlands, a natural resource with critical local benefits, it is
   imperative to incorporate local governance, using the U.S. state of
   Connecticut as an example. Despite the American policy of No Net Loss,
   the local benefits of wetland resources cannot be aggregated on a
   national scale. Each local ecosystem needs wetland resources to ensure
   local ecological benefits such as flood control and pollution remission,
   as well as the substantial economic benefits of recreation. We
   illustrate the benefits of local control of wetlands with data from the
   American state of Connecticut, which consistently surpasses the federal
   wetland goal of No Net Loss due, we argue, to the governance structure
   of town-level wetlands commissions. A national policy such as No Net
   Loss, where wetlands are saved or created in designated areas and
   destroyed in others, is insufficient when it ignores critical benefits
   for localities. The Connecticut system using local volunteers and unpaid
   appointees is a successful method for governing common-pool wetland
   systems. In the case of Connecticut, we find that local decision making
   is not a trap, but instead an effective model of sustainable, democratic
   local governance.},

Title = {A Civil Rather than Criminal Offence? Forced Marriage, Harm and the
   Politics of Multiculturalism in the UK},

Abstract = {Research Highlights and Abstract The British preference for civil
   remedies, rather than criminal measures, regarding forced marriage is
   examined and an explanation for this approach, put forward. The
   reluctance in the UK to criminalise forced marriage is traced, in part,
   to the influence that multicultural ideals have had on current British
   approaches to the practice. The state's tendency to conceptualise the
   harms of forced marriage principally in terms of a violation of choice
   (rather than as a matter of long-term violence against women), is also
   identified as significant to the British preference for civil remedies,
   over criminal legislation. A critical feminist analysis of UK government
   papers, policy documents, and Hansard debates, relating to the 2005
   public enquiry on the criminalisation of forced marriage and to the
   Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007, is undertaken. British
   discussions on the proposal to criminalise forced marriage are noted as
   lacking consideration of arguments that identify criminal legislation as
   a critical means of combating violence against women. The question is
   raised as to whether, by adopting such an approach, the state may be
   giving rise to a two-tier system of rights, in which minority group
   women are afforded a lesser protection of their human rights, as a
   result of their racial or cultural background.
   This article examines the preference for civil, rather than criminal,
   measures that has emerged as the favoured policy approach for dealing
   with forced marriage in Britain. In particular, the article considers
   why, following much public and parliamentary debate, the option to
   criminalise forced marriage was rejected by UK lawmakers. It suggests
   that one explanation for this approach is the influence that
   multiculturalism, as a set of political ideals, has had on British
   policy on forced marriage in recent years. The article also identifies
   as significant the limited conception of the harms of forced marriage
   apparent in much UK government discourse, which fails to identify the
   practice principally as a form of violence against women, and therefore
   as a custom that should be subject to criminal legislation. It draws on
   a critical feminist analysis of UK government papers and policy
   initiatives dealing with forced marriage during the period of 1999-2007,
   in order to make this case. It concludes by raising the question of
   whether, in adopting a civil remedy approach, the state may be affording
   some women less protection of their human rights than others.},

Abstract = {This article explores the links between classical realists such as Hans
   J. Morgenthau, Reinhold Niebuhr or Arthur Schlesinger Jr, and early
   pragmatists such as John Dewey or Sidney Hook. Arguing that the question
   of how to save the creative potential of democracy from the stifling
   homogeneity of modernity was at the heart of both schools of thought, it
   treats Early Pragmatism as a window through which perhaps the most
   crucial question of Classical Realism may come to life: How to make
   publicity a vehicle of foreign-policy restraint in an age of mass
   politics?},

Journal = {WORLD POLITICS},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {There is a strong scholarly consensus that domestic revolutions create
   conditions ripe for international conflict. Traditionally scholars have
   treated revolutions as events, after which there is a period of time
   during which international conflict is more likely. Yet some states
   experience significant international conflict only during and in the
   immediate aftermath of a revolution, whereas other states continue to
   engage in conflict for many years and even decades afterward. This
   article seeks to explain the persistence of conflict for some but not
   all revolutionary states by differentiating the concept of revolutionary
   leaders from that of revolutions as events, both theoretically and
   empirically. The author shows that existing theories linking revolution
   to international conflict underemphasize an important mechanism through
   which revolution leads to conflict: by selecting conflict-prone leaders
   through the dynamics of revolutionary politics. He argues that
   revolutionary politics allow leaders with certain characteristics,
   including high risk tolerance and strong political ambition to alter the
   status quo, to obtain executive office because individuals without these
   characteristics generally do not succeed in leading revolutions. Having
   obtained power, revolutionary leaders have aggressive preferences that
   make their states more likely than nonrevolutionary states to instigate
   international conflict.},

Abstract = {The literature on government responsiveness to societal issues is
   extensive but provides a mixed assessment of effectiveness. We examine
   this issue in the case of policy addressing effective and safe
   management of research and development in the emerging field of
   nanotechnology. Specifically, we examine the agenda setting effects of
   the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act (the Act),
   a piece of legislation designed to be implemented by a network of actors
   in the nanotechnology research and development policy subsystem. We
   adopt a public values lens in our examination of discourse related to
   societal concerns. Policy documents from Congress, an agency, and
   federal funding recipients are examined. Findings suggest a narrowing of
   public values discourse around more specific societal concerns in the
   documents crafted after the Act was passed.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Volume = {57},
Number = {3},
Pages = {545-555},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Despite its theoretical and empirical importance, no studies to date
   have examined the deterrent value of democratic allies. To fill this
   void, this study concentrates precisely on this issue. The general
   premise is that challengers select targets based on their expectations
   about the reliability of their allies. These expectations are, in turn,
   based on the magnitude of political costs that an ally's leader would
   pay for failing to honor its international commitments. In democracies,
   the domestic audience would punish a leader for failing to defend an
   ally, but only if they care about the issue at stake. For this reason, I
   argue that democratic allies only effectively deter challenges against
   those partners that are of a greater strategic importance. In the
   absence of such strong interests, targets with democratic allies are
   more likely to be challenged. I find strong support for this argument in
   a quantitative test from 1816 to 2002. This study also suggests that the
   findings from previous tests of democratic alliance reliability may need
   to be interpreted through the lenses of sample selection bias.
   Challengers initiate disputes when democratic allies have low interests,
   suggesting the potential for a biased sample that primarily includes the
   most unreliable democratic allies.},

Abstract = {Although case studies exist of the influence of non-governmental
   organisations in international environmental negotiations, theoretical
   conclusions remain scattered, and the separation in previous literature
   between the study of environmental non-governmental organisations
   (ENGOs) and business and industry non-governmental organisations
   (BINGOs) reduces the generalisability of conclusions. The conclusions
   drawn in both fields are brought together and the resulting explanatory
   framework is applied to empirical material from the negotiations on
   reform of the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism, comparing
   the influence of environmental non-governmental organisations and
   business and industry non-governmental organisations. The explanatory
   factors identified in previous research generally play out in favour of
   BINGOs as compared to ENGOs. The structural influence of business and
   industry non-governmental organisations seems to have resulted in a
   larger influence on the outcome of the negotiations, which may be
   problematic from a democratic point of view as private economic
   interests and public interests frequently diverge.},

Abstract = {This article examines the `cultural repertoires' of neo-Biafran
   separatist Igbo groups in south-eastern Nigeria, pointing to the ways in
   which cultural repertoires, narratives and emblems are deployed to forge
   a separatist ethno-political project in a multi-ethnic state. The
   neo-Biafran movement reveals the robustness of political resistance and
   the existence of multiple frameworks through which ethno-nationalist
   groups resist and challenge extant power structures of the state in the
   quest for self-determination. The article argues that ethnic groups have
   the capacity to initiate their own `cultural repertoires' in order to
   construct group identity, identify forms of external identity (the
   `other') and shore up the boundaries of their own collective group
   identity. Myths of origin, narratives of the past, images and symbols
   are rooted in certain cultural repertoires, and are elaborated,
   interpreted, invented and reinvented to produce political identities
   that are complex and fluid in the struggle for political power.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {413-428},

Abstract = {To legitimize separation from Moldova, Transnistrian elites have been
   constructing a civic Transnistrian nation, subsuming local ethnic
   Russian, Ukrainian, and Moldovan identities. This article first
   identifies changes to the Transnistrian nation-building strategy: from
   an emphasis on Moldovan nationhood in the early 1990s to oppose
   Romanianization in Chisinau, to Transnistrian nationhood mainly after
   Moldovanism was adopted in Chisinau in 2001. It then shows how this
   multiethnic nation is being constructed, with a particular emphasis on
   the place of Transnistrian Moldovans. While the Moldovan identity
   category is being institutionalized as a part of the Transnistrian civic
   nation, its ecological niches are being emptied of Romanian/Bessarabian
   attributes and invested with Russianness. As a result, Moldovan now
   seems an empty identity category in Transnistria.},

Abstract = {Recent reinterpretations of the history of socialist Yugoslavia, which
   broke up at the time of the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe
   (1989-1991), have revived old and opened new controversies concerning
   the character and policy of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ) at
   the time of the establishment of the Federal People's Republic of
   Yugoslavia (FNRJ) following the Second World War. One of them credits
   the absolutization of Josip Broz Tito's charisma for the establishment
   and functioning of KPJ rule. The main aim of this article is to
   challenge such claims by providing an analytical account of the
   formative years of socialist Yugoslavia based upon primary archival
   sources. These sources illustrate that rather than Tito's omnipotence,
   the decisive factor in the functioning of KPJ power was the
   clientelistic structure of hierarchical party and state organization.
   This paper argues that the establishment of clientelistic group-rational
   behavioral patterns in the KPJ structure and state organization drove
   the institutionalization of loyalty between the patron, the Politburo of
   the Central Committee of the KPJ (KPJ CC Politburo), and the client, the
   communist nomenklatura, an organized social network of party cadres
   occupying all significant functions in the society. The social origin of
   the members of the nomenklatura, that is, the new worker-peasant class
   organized at the level of federal units, was the basis for the
   legitimacy and functioning of KPJ power from 1945 through 1952. The
   revolutionary authority of the KPJ, which had been won through the
   partisan anti-fascist people's liberation struggle during the Second
   World War, legitimized itself in this period through clientelistic
   structural dynamics in the political system of a people's democracy. In
   order to explore these arguments, this article applies a
   generic-structural historical analysis to the dynamics of the social and
   political KPJ structures in 1945-1952 Yugoslavia.},

Abstract = {The April 20, 2010, BP Deepwater Horizon blowout riveted citizen and
   elected officials' attention on coastal oil spills in ways not seen
   since the ill-fated 1989 Exxon Valdez crisis. A commonly voiced lament
   included why was the tragedy not prevented? Why the seemingly poor
   safety practices and who is to blame? Could a spill of such catastrophic
   proportion happen elsewhere in the future? Applying a spill prevention
   causation framework developed through the examination of other major
   near-shore incidents over a 23-year period, the author finds Deepwater
   Horizon exhibited a pattern of shortcomings evident in these other
   spills. These shortcomings are rooted in policy imperfections, a weak
   regulatory regime, organizational deviance in lieu of integrity, and
   interorganizational structure deficiencies.},

Abstract = {Driven by the Ohrid Framework Agreement (OFA), decentralisation in
   Macedonia is a policy choice for spurring national cohesion rather than
   an economic instrument for the more efficient delivery of services. The
   OFA resulted in a new Macedonian Constitution with policies related to
   the decentralisation process and equitable representation of
   communities. This paper aims first to estimate the spending efficiency
   of Macedonian municipalities in service delivery from their own
   resources and, second, to ascertain the determinants of that efficiency.
   The ethnic fragmentation of municipalities is taken into account as a
   possible determinant of efficiency, which represents a novelty in such
   types of studies. We employ the DEA-VRS, Kernel and SFA estimation
   techniques to control for the robustness of our estimates. Our findings
   show that on average Macedonian municipalities exhibit low efficiency in
   service delivery, although there are significant variations among
   municipalities. The ethnic fragmentation of municipalities together with
   the population density, own tax revenues and political affiliation of
   the mayor with the leading political coalition at the state level
   explain differences in their efficiencies. More fragmented
   municipalities tend to be less efficient when providing services to
   citizens.},

Abstract = {A suitable quality level of the main functions and tasks of municipal
   administrations is a fundamental condition for the existence and
   development of every activity, not only for market-oriented
   organisations but also the public sector. Slovenian municipalities have
   not adopted a general policy on quality and it is therefore difficult to
   speak of the optimisation of work in a municipal administration, the
   efficiency and rationality of work, cost reduction, nor to evaluate the
   performance of an administration and the individual civil servants it
   employs. The authors of this article present the results of an empirical
   research project on administrative capacity carried out among the
   directors of Slovenian municipal administrations in both 2007 and 2012
   and an analysis of the topic in the context of reorganisation of local
   administrations. By means of the Administrative Capacity Index (ACI),
   they evaluate the degrees of individual municipalities' administrative
   capacities and establish at what population size a municipality can be
   regarded as administratively capable.},

Abstract = {The relationship between energy security, neoliberalism and climate
   change in the development of UK energy policy from 2003 to 2011 is
   discussed, with a particular focus on nuclear power. A securitisation'
   discourse has been associated with the promotion of nuclear interests,
   although the government policy storylines have been associated as much
   with changing party political priorities as with justifying instrumental
   policy objectives. However, the extent to which neoliberal electricity
   arrangements will be overridden in the wake of the securitising agenda
   is uncertain, due to the embedded nature of neoliberal practices.},

Abstract = {The relationship between political conservatism and leftright
   orientation was examined in 15 Western European and 13 former communist
   Central and Eastern European countries using the data from European
   Social Survey Round 3 (N = 46,103) and Round 4 (N = 50,601).
   Cross-culturally validated values were used to measure the two potential
   aspects of conservatism: resistance to change and acceptance of
   inequality. Both of these aspects were positively related to right-wing
   orientation in Western countries. In the former communist countries, the
   relationships were positive, negative, and nonexistent; they differed
   between the countries and varied between 2006 and 2008. The results
   indicate that conservatism can be related to left-wing or right-wing
   orientation depending on the cultural, political, and economic situation
   of the society in question. The results also show that despite the
   shared communist past, former communist Central and Eastern Europe is a
   diverse region that should be treated as such also in research.},

   different policy areas that each case study focuses on. It gauges the
   magnitude and direction of domestic change at the level of policy and
   governance in each political economy. In order to show how the case
   studies unpack the relationship between the EU input and domestic change
   in public policies, the article explains how the prevalent ideas,
   dominant interests and structuring institutions co-determine the nature
   of domestic change in political economies.},

Abstract = {Using data from an original two-wave panel survey of California high
   school students and a two-wave panel survey of high school students in
   Chicago, we find that different pedagogical approaches influence
   different forms of civic and political engagement. Specifically,
   controlling for prior levels of engagement and demographic factors, we
   find that open discussion of societal issues promotes engagement with
   political issues and elections. In contrast, service learning
   opportunities increase community-based and expressive actions. Both
   kinds of opportunities promoted commitments to participatory
   citizenship. These patterns can teach us about the kinds of
   opportunities (both in school and out) that can shape adolescents' civic
   and political development.},

Abstract = {The discourse on globalization has largely focused on its profound
   effects on states and societies rather than on the everyday lives of
   people. This paper explores the ordinary, everyday politics of people by
   examining the impact of globalization on local communities. Using
   ``everyday politics{''} as framework, this paper describes how the
   people of Rapu-Rapu, an island municipality located in Southern Luzon,
   Philippines, have been affected by mining over the years. Overall,
   mining has not brought about benefits to the communities. It has
   negatively affected environmental quality and has led to loss of
   livelihood. More significantly, mining has caused tension among the
   people, dividing them into ``pro-mining{''} and ``anti-mining{''} camps.
   This paper narrates the different ways by which people have responded to
   the consequences of mining - from passive acceptance to active protests.},

Abstract = {The primary objective of this article is to advance the development of
   early warning of intrastate conflict by combining country-level
   structural and events data in a logistic regression model calibrated and
   validated using split-sample cases. Intrastate conflict is defined by
   the occurrence of one or more highly destabilizing events collectively
   termed a crisis of interest (COI). Two separate two-year periods between
   1990 and 2005 were examined in twenty-five globally dispersed countries.
   COIs occurred in about 6 percent of all the half-monthly periods
   examined. While model accuracy (total correct predictions of COI and
   non-COI) usually exceeded 90 percent, the model did not generate
   sufficiently high and consistent precision (correct number of COI over
   total predicted) and recall (correct number of COI over total observed)
   for practical use.},

Abstract = {As the major players in globalization, firms often operate in states
   where human rights may not be respected. Without direct intent, firms
   may be complicit in human rights violations. In 2008, John Ruggie, the
   United Nations (UN) Special Representative on business and human rights,
   developed a framework for policymakers to protect human rights and for
   executives to respect human rights. On 16 June 2011, the UN Human Rights
   Council endorsed Ruggie's ``Guiding Principles{''} (GPs) for
   implementing this framework. This article describes how firms, states,
   and to a lesser extent nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), have
   responded to this delineation of the human rights responsibilities of
   business. This article makes four key points: 1) the GPs are an
   important advance in global governance; 2) the process of developing the
   GPs was a model of transparent, inclusive twentyfirst century
   governance, although the public is generally unaware of the issue or the
   new policy; 3) the GPs are a creative and broad rethinking of how to
   evaluate the human rights performance of corporations; and 4) the GPs
   are unlikely to have much influence unless policymakers educate their
   national firms and their citizens regarding the human rights
   responsibilities of business and press these executives to act.},

Abstract = {The definition of rape in international law is in flux, as the
   controversy over the differences between a ``mechanical{''} and a
   ``conceptual{''} definition has shown. This article explores the
   intersection of three contradictory premises about the narrative
   testimony of rape that arises from the problem of defining the crime. It
   explores this intersection through the frames of legal theory, visual
   theory, and narrative texts, drawing its examples from the Rwandan
   genocide, where the correlation of narrative testimony to the production
   of images shaped a rich vein of philosophical inquiry into the nature of
   witnessing.},

Abstract = {Stakeholder negotiation processes are increasingly used in environmental
   management, but are often difficult due to values differences among
   stakeholders. These values can be reflected in the language used by
   stakeholders, which may lead to conflict in negotiation processes. This
   study investigated whether there are widespread differences among
   Colorado water stakeholders in how they define the term conservation, a
   key value and policy term, and whether this leads to conflict in
   negotiations. Using multiple methods in a cross-sectional case study,
   use of the term and possible policy implications were analyzed.
   Stakeholder respondents in this study who had experienced difficulty in
   water negotiations also perceived a higher degree of miscommunication in
   their negotiations. The most important finding presented here suggests
   that clarity of language and transparent discussion of key
   value-representative terms may aid in stakeholder negotiations, and that
   minority stakeholders may be more aware of values and language
   differences than their majority counterparts.},

Abstract = {The media in Latin America are characterized by an extremely high level
   of market concentration, resulting in the representation of a narrow set
   of perspectives. Movements that would challenge the hegemony of the
   dominant social classes are portrayed as dangerous and reckless. The
   election of ``bad left{''} governments with strong majorities through
   the very representative institutions that those in the media claim to
   defend has created a dilemma for those who oppose social change. Unable
   to discredit the results of the elections, the private media have sought
   to attack the legitimacy of these governments from below by framing
   their supporters as mindless followers or as dangerous, irrational mobs.
   All of this highlights the fact that the current structure of the media
   in Latin America denies individuals from the lower strata the right to
   be heard and, more generally, denies the public the right to the
   information pluralism that is required for democracy to function.},

Abstract = {Voluntary environmental programs have emerged as important instruments
   of environmental policy. Despite considerable scholarly scrutiny, there
   remain debates about whether they reduce pollution among participants,
   and their overall impact at the country level. We present a
   cross-national analysis of the efficacy of ISO 14001, the most widely
   adopted voluntary environmental program in the world. While several
   single country studies have explored the effect of ISO 14001
   participation on pollution reduction at the facility level, this is the
   first article to assess (i) national level pollution reduction effects
   of ISO 14001 participation levels, (ii) across a large number of
   countries, and (iii) across two pollutants. We examine whether all else
   equal, the national level uptakes of ISO 14001 are associated with
   reductions in air emissions (sulfur dioxide, SO2) and water pollution
   (biochemical oxygen demand, BOD). Because firms, regulators, and
   environmental groups tend to focus more on visible types of pollution
   than less visible ones, we hypothesize that ISO 14001 uptake will be
   associated with more pronounced reductions in air pollution (visible) in
   relation to water pollution (less visible). Our analyses of pollution
   levels for a panel of 138 (72 for BOD) countries for the 19912005 period
   suggest that a 1 percent increase in aggregate levels of ISO 14001
   adoption is associated with about a 0.064 percent reduction in SO2
   emissions, all else equal. In contrast, we do not find a statistically
   significant relationship between ISO 14001 adoption levels and changes
   in water pollution (BOD).},

Abstract = {CAPITAL AND OPPOSITION IN AFRICA COALITION BUILDING IN MULTIETHNIC
   SOCIETIES By Leonardo R. Arriola Under what conditions can opposition
   politicians with ethnic constituencies form electoral coalitions? In
   Africa's patronage-based political systems, incumbents form coalitions
   by using state resources to secure the endorsement of politicians from
   other ethnic groups. Opposition politicians, however, must rely on
   private resources to do the same. This article presents a political
   economy theory to explain how the relative autonomy of business from
   state-controlled capital influences the formation of multiethnic
   opposition coalitions. It shows that the opposition is unlikely to
   coalesce across ethnic cleavages where incumbents use their influence
   over banking and credit to command the political allegiance of
   business-the largest potential funder of opposition in poor countries.
   Liberalizing financial reforms, in freeing business to diversify
   political contributions without fear of reprisal, enable opposition
   politicians to access the resources needed to mimic the incumbent's
   pecuniary coalition-building strategy. A binomial logistic regression
   analysis of executive elections held across Africa between 1990 and 2005
   corroborates the theoretical claim: greater financial autonomy for
   business-as proxied by the number of commercial banks and the provision
   of credit to the private sector-significantly increases the likelihood
   of multiethnic opposition coalitions being formed.},

Abstract = {Peter Hall's 1993 article came at the same time as a parallel body of
   literature was developing, some building explicitly, some only
   implicitly, on similar ideas. I review some literature on policy
   communities, ideas, and the nature of policy change before exploring the
   statistical distribution of budget changes at three levels of
   aggregation. The similarity of these results suggests that a single
   process may be at work rather than different processes for first-,
   second-, and third-order change, as Hall's original formulation has it.
   As Hall suggests, these processes typically generate only marginal
   adjustments but occasionally create fundamental change. The degree of
   discredit to the status quo may be an important unexplored variable in
   explaining the ability of policy reformers to enact marginal,
   substantial, or fundamental policy changes. In sum, this article shows
   the similarities and mutual value of Hall's approach with others that
   would appear to be starkly contrasting.},

Abstract = {Many analysts have focused on the Tunisian protests and the economic and
   political grievances that fueled them. Equally central, however, was the
   role played by the military leadership and the decision to forgo using
   force to actively suppress the protesters. Contrary to arguments that
   stress the reflexively apolitical or professional nature of the
   military, or its leaders' normative commitment to supporting the
   protesters, this article explains how the decisions made reflected
   political calculations and served the military's organizational
   interests. Although heralded as the savior of the revolution, the
   Tunisian military acted out of its own organizational self-interest in
   defecting from the Ben Ali regime.},

Abstract = {In this article we describe in detail the Bayesian perspective on
   statistical inference and demonstrate that it provides a more principled
   approach to modeling public administration data. Because many datasets
   in public administration are population-level, one-time unique
   collections, or descriptive of fluid events, the Bayesian reliance on
   probability as a description of unknown quantities is a superior
   paradigm than that borrowed from Frequentist methods in the natural
   sciences where experimentation is routine. Here we provide a thorough,
   but accessible, introduction to Bayesian methods and then demonstrate
   our points with data on interest group influence in US state
   administrative agencies.},

Abstract = {No matter how unlikely it may seem, radical Leftists and Islamists have
   come closer in recent years. Drawing on substantial ideological
   interchange, and operating at both state and non-state levels, the two
   movements are building a Common Front against the United States and its
   allies. In this article, we use framing theory to examine the
   contemporary convergence of political Islam and the radical Left. Both
   radical Leftists and Islamists have utilized the master frame of
   anti-globalization/anti-capitalism and the master frame of
   anti-colonialism/anti-imperialism to elicit support from the widest
   possible range of people. The emerging Red-Green alliance presents a
   complex challenge that will require careful attention from U.S. and
   European policymakers.},

Abstract = {This paper extends punctuated-equilibrium theory to the local level by
   investigating how local political institutions influence local emergency
   management policy processes in county governments in Florida, U.S. The
   results show that county governments with a reformed form of government
   and home rule charter prioritize emergency situations more quickly in
   the policy process resulting in larger-scale budget changes than
   counties that have a traditional commission form and no home rule
   authority. Higher level of punctuation in counties with reformed
   political institutions is explained by political and administrative
   incentives of county mayors and managers, as well as political and
   fiscal discretion from state government.},

Abstract = {Despite the electoral success of Silvio Berlusconi's two political
   parties, little theoretical and empirical work has been done on Forza
   Italia (FI) and the Popolo Della Liberta (PDL People of Freedom). This
   article aims to fill these gaps. Following a short overview of the
   history of FI and the PDL, it discusses how scholars have conceived of
   Forza Italia. Building on the criteria of Joseph LaPalombara and Myron
   Weiner for the definition of a political party, a first operational
   definition is then offered of the term most used to classify FI and the
   PDL: the personal party'. On the basis of this, the article considers
   whether the PDL is another personal party akin to Forza Italia. This is
   done, first, by briefly considering the party statute and communications
   and, second, by examining the views expressed in interviews conducted
   across Italy with PDL elected representatives and ordinary party
   members.},

Abstract = {Political scientists are increasingly exploring the psychological
   underpinnings of voting behavior using field experimental techniques.
   Research in psychology demonstrates that positive reinforcementwhat I
   describe as positive social pressuremotivates prosocial behavior. A
   distinctive feature of the current study is the focus on key subgroups
   of voters, namely unmarried women and minorities. Attention to these
   voter subgroups allows us to build upon findings reported in previous
   studies that leave questions about the generalizability of the reported
   effects of positive social pressure to key demographic subgroups of
   voters largely unanswered. This article reports the results of a
   large-scale randomized field experiment designed to investigate the
   impact of positive social pressure on voter turnout. The experiment was
   conducted during the November 2009 gubernatorial election in New Jersey,
   and the results suggest positive social pressure mobilizes voters.
   Moreover, the effects appear to be robust across subgroups of voters,
   including minorities and unmarried women, and both lower- and
   higher-propensity voters.},

Title = {Decentralisation of public service delivery in the Central Himalayas:
   The myth of community participation},
Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-32},

Abstract = {This paper attempts to examine whether decentralisation of decision
   making and implementation improves efficiency of public service delivery
   in the mountain and the marginal areas, such as the Central Himalayas,
   or is efficiency in the sector, at present, best achieved through a
   centralised top-down planning and management approach? It challenges
   some of the claims made by the advocates of participatory modes of
   planning, where the World Bank-sponsored Swajal Project in India
   (1996-2002) is cited as a case of best practice. The survey based study
   of the Swajal village communities found that intra-community conflict
   and interest group politics disrupt and suborn community deliberation,
   decision making and hamper true representativeness. It explored the
   politics of community participation, examining the question of true
   representatives and comprehensive participation of a community. Findings
   indicate that the traditionally marginalised sections of the village,
   the women and the backward castes still do not have adequate
   representation. The communities do not show the resilience and capacity
   for decision making necessary for the effectiveness as agents in
   decentralisation. So far, the process of decentralisation in the public
   service delivery sector, especially in the water sector in the region,
   has merely created new winners and losers, instead of resulting in
   substantial political devolution of control to communities. (C) 2013

Abstract = {This article explores the relationship between suicide bombings and
   public cleric statements in Pakistan between 20002010. It establishes
   that bombings and statements increase over time, that cleric statements
   vary according to the bombing target, and that police and military
   targets most frequently garner clerics' attention. An adaptation of
   Kaplan, Mintz, and Mishal's (2006) maximum likelihood estimation method
   determines whether cleric statements affect the bombing rate. The
   analysis shows that pro-suicide statements have a far greater effect on
   the bombing rate than anti-suicide statements, both in the magnitude of
   increased bombings and by the length of time over which they exert
   influence.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The International Court of Justice (ICJ), as the principal judicial
   organ of the UN, plays an important role in peaceful resolution of
   international disputes. Traditionally, relations between Islamic law
   states, international law, and courts have been relatively tense due to
   the inherent link between Islamic law and the Islamic faith. Yet,
   several Islamic law states recognize the ICJ's compulsory and
   compromissory jurisdiction. This article asks: Why do some Islamic law
   states extend support to the International Court of Justice, while
   others turn away from the Court? I argue and empirically demonstrate
   that specific characteristic of Islamic law can explain variation of
   Islamic law states' preferences towards the ICJ. After providing
   original data on the characteristics of Islamic legal structures, I
   systematically compare pertinent rules of international law and Islamic
   law, focusing on similarities and differences between the two. Islamic
   law features such as respect for legal scholarship and peaceful
   resolution of disputes are compatible with principles embraced by the
   ICJ. Islamic law states that incorporate these norms are supportive of
   the Court. In contrast, Islamic law states that directly adopt sharia as
   the law of the land and incorporate sharia in their education systems
   are less open to the ICJ's adjudication.},

Abstract = {This review article examines four recent books published on terrorism
   and insurgent warfare. It argues that the narrative developed from the
   early 1970s within terrorism studies or terrorology was considerably
   different from the discussion of terrorism in the post-1945 period and
   tended to marginalize the role of states in fomenting terror. The
   article looks at depictions of terrorism in both art and film as well
   the recent historiography of terrorism. The article argues that far more
   emphasis needs to be placed on the role of the French Revolution in the
   gestation of terrorism in the nineteenth century; by contrast the
   emphasis on late nineteenth century Russian terrorism has been rather
   exaggerated as many terrorist movement (such as that in 1880s Chicago)
   owed little to the Russian connection. Finally the article shows that
   the connection between terrorism and political nihilism has been
   overplayed and that few terrorist movements (as opposed to some
   terrorist theorists) were driven by a nihilist agenda.},

Abstract = {Promoting certain kinds of gender equalitysuch as promoting and
   supporting female participation in paid work or male engagement with
   unpaid care workis costly. Yet, there has been little examination in
   gender and policy research of the economic determinants of gendered
   policy change. In this article we investigate, using graphs and
   descriptive analysis derived from three data sets, whether the
   agenda-setting possibilities of feminist policy actors pushing for
   redistributive gender policy are constrained by economic conditions. Our
   hypotheses are that it is easier to get costly gender equality policies
   on the agenda, first, when the economy is growing and, second, when
   advocates utilise an economic case to frame their arguments. We find
   that gender equality policy agendas in the UK appear to follow periods
   of positive economic performance and that economic framing of gender
   equality policy is essential.},

Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},

Volume = {91},

Pages = {174-194},
Abstract = {This study explores how English local governments managed high levels of
   worker migration from Eastern Europe in the wake of the enlargement of
   the European Union in 2004. Theories of local government capacity
   suggest that strong central administration and vibrant community
   organizational life can increase the likelihood that public service
   performance will be maintained despite sudden shifts in the external
   environment. We explore the interactive effects of immigration and
   administrative and community capacity on English local government
   performance, using multivariate statistical techniques. The results
   suggest that local government capacity moderated the negative impact on
   performance of migration from Eastern Europe.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},

Abstract = {The medical product sector is characterised by a regulatory patchwork of
   European and national laws and guidelines operating concurrently with
   each other. Each of these sectors are characterised by different levels
   of regulatory uncertainty that may undermine the effectiveness of the
   regulatory framework. How have European regulation shaped individual
   product sectors? How has that impacted regulatory uncertainty in that
   sector? What has been the impact of regulatory compliance? Drawing on
   documentary research and fieldwork interviews this pilot study conducted
   in Netherlands, finds that ATMPs and medical device sectors exhibit high
   level of regulatory uncertainty. Although the sources of uncertainty are
   varied across each of the sectors. In some instances when regulatory
   uncertainty have reached unmanageable levels, measures have been taken
   by regulators to address it. Regulatees themselves have developed a
   complex compliance strategy that allows them to tolerate and in certain
   circumstances even circumvent regulatory uncertainty.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This chapter evaluates the shift in black voter support from
   Mayor Adrian Fenty to Mayor Vincent Gray in the 2010 DC mayoral
   election. The complexities of new black leadership are used as a
   theoretical framework for understanding the salience of gentrification,
   crossover racial appeal, campaign tactics, and policy implementation in
   the mayoral transition from one black candidate to another.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study used polling data from The
   Washington Post one month prior to the 2010 DC Democratic primary (The
   Washington Post, 2010). Using a sample of 630 respondents, multinomial
   logistic regression was used to measure the extent to which substantive
   policy positions, racial crossover appeal, and/or personal traits factor
   into voter preferences.
   Findings - The results reveal that a combination of personal, racial,
   and substantive factors contributed to Adrian Fenty's defeat in 2010.
   The implications suggest a reexamination of the significance of symbolic
   representation in voter candidate preferences and the shifting
   complexity of black leadership in the procurement of black substantive
   representation.
   Originality/value - This chapter captures the transitional nature of
   black leadership in order to distinguish viable strategies for blacks to
   secure both elected office and black empowerment, while offering a more
   nuanced approach to analyzing the changing nature of the black voting
   calculus in the United States.},

Abstract = {The recent recession has seen something of a resurgence in the debate
   over military Keynesianism. Recent commentators, who should know better,
   have claimed that it would make sense to stimulate the U.S. economy
   through increases in military spending, as though this has not been a
   commonly contested view over the last 40 years. A large, literature has
   debated the economic effects of military spending, and while it has
   reached no consensus, there is also little support for any belief that
   military spending is a good way of stimulating the economy. This paper
   makes a contribution to the debate by assessing the theoretical
   perspectives and the empirical approaches used. It then undertakes an
   analysis of the United States using a number of approaches, and the
   results suggest that the simple military Keynesian arguments still lack
   empirical support.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {34},

Pages = {392-396},
Abstract = {Balancing and bandwagoning are concepts that realists return to again
   and again-yet neither concept is well suited for explaining the complex
   issue of Europe's growing role as a security and defence actor. Europe
   will confound realism as long as realism is based on assumptions of
   anarchy as conflictual and as long as non-systemic factors remain
   under-developed. Moreover, I suggest that Europe confounds all
   mainstream IR theories, because neither realism, liberalism, or
   constructivism have taken serious account of the purposive role played
   by agents and although they all see crises as sources of changes, they
   do not account theoretically for the role of the continuous occurrence
   of events as sources of change. I suggest that to understand Europe's
   development as a security and defence actor, it is necessary to consider
   how the construction of agent-level identities and narratives takes
   place in agent-level self-constitutive processes within a fundamentally
   changed structural environment. Doing so is the key for understanding
   the background motives and preferences that have resulted in ups and
   downs in the integration process and in the different positions adopted
   by European member states despite them being subjected to the same
   structural conditions and the same events.},

Abstract = {In the context of the widespread `resurgence' of traditional authorities
   in Africa, increasing attention has been devoted to the manner in which
   the institutions of the state combine with those of non-state
   authorities. While much of the debate has been focused on the
   implications for democracy, this paper addresses the relationship
   between traditional resurgence and violent conflict. An analytical
   framework that distinguishes between `institutional hybridity' and
   different forms of `institutional multiplicity' is presented. This is
   then explored through a case study of the Buganda Kingdom in Uganda,
   where institutional disputes over land and decentralisation can be
   linked to the violence between state forces and Kingdom supporters that
   erupted in 2009. The analysis underscores the importance of careful
   institutional analysis in cases of traditional resurgence in order to
   mitigate violent conflict outcomes.},

   Party in North India},
Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-29},
Abstract = {The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has succeeded in expanding its
   constituency beyond its core low caste base and attracting voters from
   upper and middle castes since the late 1990s. Building on a case study
   of the BSP in the North Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, this paper argues
   that the BSP's multiethnic transformation, whereby the party went from
   being a low caste party to one mobilizing constituencies across caste
   divides, throws new light on the mechanisms facilitating such
   transformatory attempts. The literature predicts that the success of
   multiethnic transformations will be determined by either the character
   of sociological divides, or of intra-party organization; but neither of
   these factors has counted for much in the BSP's case. Here, it is the
   core base's willingness to swap patronage and co-ethnic representation
   for programmatic gains, and the BSP's recourse to asymmetric
   representation whereby it has delivered different bundles of benefits to
   its old and new voters, that have allowed the party to attract new
   constituencies while retaining the old.},

Abstract = {India became a NWS (Nuclear Weapons State) most reluctantly in May 1998
   despite her demonstration of nuclear weapons capability 24 years earlier
   in May 1974. Having assumed the new status as the sixth overt nuclear
   weapons state, India also declared her principled policy governing use
   of nuclear weapons in the event of a national security threat. The
   Indian Nuclear Doctrine was called ``minimum deterrence{''} by the
   BJP-led NDA government, but the Congress-led UPA government in 2004
   renamed it as ``credible deterrence.{''}
   But the heart of the vibrant Indian nuclear doctrine is its commitment
   to No First Use (NFU) of nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons were invented
   by the United States (U.S.). First-ever use of atom bomb is also made by
   the Americans and a philosophic foundation for the discussion on NFU was
   also laid in the U.S. However, having put the NFU in the philosophic
   parlance, the U.S. in the Cold War International environment professed
   the doctrine for First Use (FU) of nuclear weapons. It is China that
   made a first public commitment to the NFU after it became the fifth
   nuclear weapons state.
   This chapter proposes to discuss Indian commitment to NFU as a first
   step on the long path toward global nuclear disarmament-or No Use (NU)
   of nuclear weapons. India saw Partial Test Ban treaty of 1963 as a step
   toward NU and also saw the discussions on NPT as another step toward
   nuclear disarmament as much as it wanted the big powers to see the CTBT
   too as a device aimed at putting world into NU bind. West, led by the
   U.S., was however only interested in using the CTBT to deny nuclear
   weapons status to threshold states, particularly India.
   As a self-declared nuclear weapons state, India has, in nuclear
   doctrine, committed itself to nuclear disarmament. Can there be an
   international treaty between the declared nuclear weapons states? Can
   India and Russia come together on the issue? Can they convince China to
   join? With three Asian nuclear weapons states committing themselves to
   NFU, U.S. can see economic sense in an international treaty on NFU. Is
   it possible to create a global public opinion in favor of NU of nuclear
   weapons? The questions will be answered based on research conduct on the
   subject.},

   helmet practice. Peace operations' progression is traced through five
   analytical ``generations,{''} each adding a crucial factor
   distinguishing it from its predecessors. Each generation is placed in
   relation to changes in the nature of conflict and in the interpretation
   of the foundational principles of peace operations, and links to broader
   theoretical issues in International Relations are made explicit at each
   stage.},

Abstract = {This chapter develops a growth model of a country under a Hobbesian
   environment with international conflicts in which national defense is
   the only way to prevent external predation. The long run growth path is
   determined by the equilibrium of a dynamic game with three players: the
   external predator, the government, and the family. The equilibrium
   growth path has three phases: submissive equilibrium, tolerant
   equilibrium, and full-protected equilibrium. Different defense
   strategies result in different growth prospects, and sustainable growth
   will endogenously induce adjustment of defense strategies.},

   Financial Crisis and the Turn in Transatlantic Relations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {391-408},
Abstract = {This article explores the impact of the European regulatory response to
   the global financial crisis in the governance of transatlantic financial
   markets. The main argument is that European regulatory initiatives have
   sought to expand European regulatory clout over market actors domiciled
   in third countries but operating in European markets, thus departing
   from the authority-sharing arrangements that had informed the
   construction of an integrated transatlantic market for financial
   services in the period preceding the crisis. The article will explain
   this shift in the European approach towards the regulation of
   transatlantic markets by exploring the reconfiguration of EU financial
   regulatory politics triggered by the financial crisis. This argument
   will be developed by analysing the regulatory frameworks introduced in
   the EU to regulate OTC derivatives, rating agencies, and hedge funds.},

Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {397-419},
Abstract = {The paper looks at the case of a large and widely publicised
   environmental controversy in Poland, and asks why the authorities chose
   the ``pro-environmental{''} option in the end. Taking into account the
   wider political and social context of the controversy, we also try to
   show what the role of the European Union (EU) was in that conflict. We
   adopt a rhetorical approach to show the discursive struggle around the
   environmental protection norms, as well as the idea of participation. We
   engage in a theoretical discussion with constructivist research on
   normative change, arguing for the need to take domestic agency, as well
   as local ideational structures, into account while also questioning the
   usefulness of the concept of ``socialisation{''} and the notion of
   ``norm diffusion{''} in the debate on Europeanisation. Instead,
   normative change could be perceived as the empowerment and
   legitimisation of certain norms and values at the cost of a relative
   de-legitimisation of others. The EU, apart from its legal impact, can be
   seen as an important reference point, both as a source of powerful
   discourses and of legitimacy, while the agency is mostly on the domestic
   side. We contend, however, that such normative shifts are very context
   dependent and unstable.},

Abstract = {Prior to 1970 nobody identified themselves explicitly as an
   International Political Economy (IPE) scholar. Topics which are now
   routinely discussed in IPE had a place within the academy, but there was
   nothing of that specific name to act as a context for bringing all of
   the discussions together. Accordingly, the most important point to
   stress in any appraisal of the theories and methods of IPE is perhaps
   the relative youth of the subject field, which means that its boundaries
   are still very much open to contestation. Two dimensions of this contest
   are reviewed in the pages that follow: one over method and whether IPE
   scholars should seek to align around a single method in the interests of
   a more homogeneous identity as a subject field; the other over
   disciplinarity and whether IPE scholars should continue to feel rooted
   in international relations. Both of these disputes are relevant for the
   way in which the current volume's core themes of globalisation, the
   European Union and multilateralism might be studied from an IPE
   perspective.},

Abstract = {Following a poststructuralist theorising of identity in international
   relations, which argues that identity is relationally and discursively
   constructed through foreign policy, this article attempts to analyse the
   way in which the European Commission discursively constructs European
   identit(ies) in its relations with Turkey around the theme of security'.
   The study utilises the methodological tools of critical discourse
   analysis in analysing the speeches and field interviews conducted with
   European Commission officials, in examining the way in which they
   construct Europe' in relation to the security implications of Turkish
   accession. The article's findings challenge the argument that Europe is
   moving beyond the modern state to resemble a postmodern order, and
   problematises the designation of the Commission as a cosmopolitan' actor
   in EU enlargement policy.},

Abstract = {This paper adopts a network perspective to explore the ways
   digitally-mediated relationships prompt social and/ or political
   participation in China. In the ``chicken game scenario{''}, my analysis
   suggests that collective actions are facilitated by both weak and strong
   ties, which generate a fairly unified collective identity that is
   conductive to high-risk mobilization. In the ``public crisis
   scenario{''}, it is generally weak ties that facilitate relatively
   lower-risk mobilization. In the ``compromise scenario{''}, if collective
   actions do occur, they are generally low-risk and non-political. This
   appears to be largely due to the dominance of weak ties in the
   compromise scenario. The ``banal scenario{''} is a black box that has
   yet to be sufficiently investigated in the future.},

Abstract = {Contemporary empirical explorations of the welfare state have paid much
   attention to its multidimensional nature, noting that nations blend
   differing approaches to the various dimensions of the welfare state.
   Sometimes such behaviours can even be contradictory with behaviour in
   one policy arena perhaps being typically liberal in contrast to the
   corporatist roots of other behaviours. In much the same way those who
   argue that the welfare state has changed so substantially as to warrant
   redefining offer nuanced and multidimensional accounts of what has
   replaced the welfare state. In this paper we see how nations engage with
   the competition state as the successor to the welfare state and are
   presented with data that suggests countries, while engaging with the
   competition state model, are doing so in their own ways. (C) 2013 Policy

Abstract = {The idea of resilience is increasingly prominent across a wide range of
   policy areas. This contribution looks at the emergence of resilience in
   UK security discourse and compares this with the situation in France. It
   argues that although the term is being debated in France, it is
   considered to be an Anglo-Saxon import. This article suggests that use
   of the idea of resilience has more to do with particular forms of
   governance than with security. It develops this argument through the
   idea of neoliberal governmentality.},

Abstract = {Scholars have argued that oil resources lead to poor quality
   institutions and governance, which causes slower economic growth, an
   increased propensity for civil war, and other maladies. Such
   conclusions, however, rest on strong modernization assumptions that oil
   resources are unrelated or detrimental to the level of economic
   development. Utilizing a unique multilevel version of extreme bounds
   analysis (EBA), we find that oil's deleterious effects on governance are
   not well established. Instead, when we relax strong assumptions about
   the exogeneity of economic development and utilize more objective
   indicators of institutional quality, oil has a net positive impact on
   governance. Moreover, when accounting for endogeneity, there is little
   to suggest either an intervening or independent effect of poor
   governance on civil conflict in petro-states.},

Abstract = {Increasingly, governments and police agencies require evidence of
   effectiveness and efficiency with respect to law enforcement policies.
   The existing ``what works{''} literature, specifically on drug law
   enforcement, focuses mainly on the effectiveness question when making
   complex choices between drug policy alternatives, but fails when it
   comes to incorporating empirical evidence and the experience of key
   experts in the decision-making process. In addition, little attempt has
   been made to employ sophisticated techniques to assist in complex policy
   decision making with respect to funding competing policing policy
   alternatives. We use the methamphetamine problem in Australia to
   illustrate a way of evaluating, using multi-criteria analysis,
   alternative policy options for developing better drug policy.},

Title = {Potential early phase success and ultimate failure of economic
   sanctions: A VAR approach with an application to Iran},

Abstract = {In order to explain why successes of economic sanctions predominantly
   occur in the first two years of a sanction episode, we analyse the
   dynamic economic and political impact of an economic sanction. Our
   theoretical analysis of the dynamics of adjustment gives us two
   important results: firstly, the strongest impact in terms of utility
   forgone occurs in the initial phase of the sanction episode and,
   secondly, the long-term gain of compliance decreases during a sanction
   episode and is lower in the long run than acknowledged by the usual
   comparative static analysis. On both accounts we expect that sanctions
   have a higher probability of success in the early phase and a lower
   probability of success in the long run. Next we build a comprehensive
   set of vector autoregressive (VAR) models that we apply to the case of a
   boycott of Iranian oil. An important innovation is that we include both
   economic and political factors in a VAR model of economic sanctions. Our
   VAR models find significant impacts of economic sanctions both on key
   economic variables (government consumption, imports, investment, income)
   and on two indicators of the political system (the Polity variable that
   describes shifts in the autocracy-democracy dimension and the Vanhanen
   Index of Democratization that describes political competition and
   participation). The impact of an oil boycott on the Iranian economy is
   considerable: oil and gas rents are important drivers of the Iranian key
   macroeconomic variables and ultimately of its political system. A
   reduction of oil and gas rents creates economic costs that act as
   incentives to move towards a more democratic setting. However, this
   effect is only significant in the first two years and turns negative
   after six to seven years, as adjustment of economic structures mitigates
   the economic and political impact of the sanctions.},

Abstract = {Institutional systems exert important influences on firms development of
   innovative capabilities. This article examines studies of firms
   innovative competencies within the comparative capitalisms (CC)
   literature. This research provides theoretically sophisticated
   assessments of firms innovative capabilities in different countries. It
   takes into consideration a range of institutional areas, such as
   corporate governance and labour market regimes. However, CC studies
   differ significantly along three key analytical dimensions. First, some
   studies focus more extensively on firms and firms objectives than
   others. Second, research examines institutions at the macro, meso and
   micro levels to varying degrees. Finally, studies adopt different
   assumptions on the variability and dynamism of a firms institutional
   setting; such variability can include the importance of foreign
   institutional resources to firms innovative capabilities. Future CC
   research should pay greater attention to theorizing firms
   innovation-related requirements and detailing their specific
   institutional settings, including their access to domestic and foreign
   institutional resources. Concepts and insights from the wider innovation
   and international business literatures can help achieve these
   objectives. By drawing on these related fields, CC studies of innovative
   capabilities will be able to assess in theoretically robust ways the
   challenges that internationalization and what this article calls
   institutional outsourcing pose for analysts and firms.},

Abstract = {While party primaries for candidate selection gain gradual popularity in
   established European democracies, they remain rare in Eastern Europe.
   This article focuses on the Romanian Social Democrats and investigates
   the reasons why primaries were abandoned after one use. The central
   argument is that this short lifespan was determined by the absence of
   relevant short-term benefits. A few pathologies of the primaries led to
   their failure: contest administration, primary regulations and high
   costs. The key findings are that party primaries did not produce the
   intended consequences when implementation was accompanied by centralised
   decision-making.},

Abstract = {Radical activist organizations face the complex task of managing their
   identity so as to draw political attention but also to appear legitimate
   and thus gain public support. In this article we develop a picture of
   the identities of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society (SSCS) members, a
   group mostly known for their direct action against whaling, via a
   thematic analysis of material from the SSCS website and interviews with
   SSCS members. In online commentary, founder Captain Paul Watson
   establishes several deliberately paradoxical notions of who the Sea
   Shepherds are. We relate these identity statements to interviews with
   core activists to examine how they manage the identity conflicts
   resulting from the group identity, such as being seen as pirates and
   hard lined vegans. We found that SSCS positions themselves as a diverse
   and unstructured organization, yet distinctively passionate and willing
   to take action where others will not. The implications of this research
   are discussed in relation to the importance of understanding the
   constraints and conflicts around political activist identities.},

Abstract = {This article argues that there is a difference in what constitutes the
   sources of recognition prior to countries' membership in the
   Euro-Atlantic community represented by NATO and after countries become
   its members. While prior to membership, countries are recognized for
   their compliance with NATO standards and policies, upon membership
   countries get the opportunity to promote specific interests legitimately
   and may seek recognition via non-compliance with NATO mainstream.
   The paper explores this dynamic of recognition on the issue of Kosovo
   independence where Slovakia went from supporting NATO in its effort to
   protect civilians in Kosovo in the late 1990s to non-recognition of
   Kosovo in defiance of the majority of NATO member states less than a
   decade later. The crucial point proposed here is that there was a shift
   in how recognition by NATO worked prior to Slovakia's membership and
   upon membership in these frameworks. While prior to membership
   recognition was achieved by compliance and identification with NATO
   standpoints, policies and actions, upon membership, recognition is
   achieved by differentiation from these patterns. More generally, the
   study shows that NATO membership is a powerful source of conditionality
   in relation to future members and a powerful source of legitimacy in
   relation to current members' actions. While this has been discussed in
   the literature, the point here is that recognition in its various forms
   is an important driving force in these conditionality processes. (C)

   networks in the increasing commodification of humanitarianism in Africa.
   It explores the relationship between celebrities as neoliberal

   interventions. Using various case studies (Product RED, 50 Cent's SK
   drink, Save Darfur Campaign {[}United to End Genocide], Kony2012, Raise
   Hope for the Congo and the Eastern Congo Initiative), the article
   considers how celebrities frame humanitarian crises for public

   impact on African agency and on international solidarity against

Abstract = {This paper reports on a multistakeholder engagement process conducted in
   an Australian policy setting that led to a new community engagement
   framework: Science and Technology Engagement Pathways (STEP). I describe
   the process in the context of a lack of awareness, experience, and
   culture of deliberative public engagement in Australia, particularly in
   relation to decision making concerning science, technology, and
   innovation. Increasing cautiousness in government and industry
   approaches to nanotechnology development, in Australia and elsewhere,
   creates an imperative and an opening for improved stakeholder and
   community engagement to improve the legitimacy and sustainability of
   decisions. In this context, STEP may stimulate movement toward
   deliberative engagement by raising awareness and commitment from diverse
   stakeholders and providing a structure for developments in engagement
   and public dialog. STEP potentially provides rules of engagement and
   intervention pathways for ongoing public engagement with science and
   technology developments and for critical science in society perspectives
   to inform policy.},

Abstract = {Could the Western foreign policy makers have done anything to prevent
   the violence accompanying the breakup of Yugoslavia? The answer to that
   question largely depends on their level of awareness of what was
   happening in the South Slavic federation in the run-up to war. This
   article analyzes a string of newly declassified documents of the British
   Foreign Office related to the February 1991 visit of a high-level
   British political delegation to Yugoslavia, together with interviews
   with some of the meetings' protagonists. These declassified documents
   and interviews offer a unique snapshot in the development of the
   Yugoslav crisis and Britain's policy in the region. They give us a clear
   picture of the goals and strategies of the principal Yugoslav players
   and show us what the West knew about the true nature of the Yugoslav
   crisis and when. The article's conclusions are clear. Yugoslavia's
   breakup and impending violence did not require great foresight. Their
   cause was known well in advance because it was preannouncedit was the
   plan of the Serbian regime of Slobodan Miloevi to impose a centralized
   Yugoslavia upon the other republics or, if that failed, to use force to
   create a Greater Serbia on Yugoslavia's ruins. Crucially, British policy
   at the time did nothing to dissuade Miloevi from his plan and likely
   contributed to his confidence in using violence to pursue the creation
   of a new and enlarged Serbian state.},

Abstract = {Little is known about the effects of the inter-institutional linkages
   created through the establishment of the codecision procedure on
   decision-making in the Council of the European Union. After a review of
   the existing literature and theories on this topic, we examine to what
   extent the codecision procedure leads to more involvement of ministers
   in Council decision-making and to a more powerful position of the
   Presidency in the internal negotiation process of the Council. The
   results show that the initially positive effect of codecision on the
   politicization of Council decision-making has been offset in recent
   years by a growing lack of transparency in inter-institutional
   proceedings caused by the use of informal trialogue negotiations to
   conclude the procedure early. However, our study also suggests that the
   country holding the Presidency does not occupy a more privileged
   position in the Council's internal co-operation network as a result of
   these developments. Thus, with respect to the Council, informal
   inter-institutional negotiation practices seem to decrease the
   transparency of the decision-making process and the accountability of
   the actors involved, but they may not have as adverse an effect on who
   gets what in terms of policy as previously thought.},

Abstract = {This article examines the discourses of prosecution and defense in the
   case of Radovan Karadzic before the International Criminal Tribunal for
   the former Yugoslavia. It focuses on what happens in the courtroom-a
   site mostly neglected in the literature on transitional justice-and the
   consequences courtroom discourses may have for societies in transition.
   Our theoretical point of departure is the concept of ``expressivism,{''}
   which is an attempt to theorize courts' potential to send messages as a
   key feature in thinking about the relationship between normative
   legitimacy, support, and utility of international trials. We conclude
   that the defense by Karadzic disrupts and thwarts the pedagogical
   messaging intended by expressivism to a considerable extent, and reflect
   on the generalizability of our findings by considering the elements of
   the actors, audiences, and the stage in the posited ``courtroom
   drama.{''}},

Abstract = {Felipe Calderon's government pursued continuity in Mexico's foreign
   policy on human rights in line with the two previous administrations.
   This continuity may be explained by the pressure exerted ``from
   outside{''} on the Mexican government by international human rights
   groups, and by the effect of applying an external ``lock-in{''} on new
   foreign policy on the issue. This policy has had little impact on
   respect for human rights in Mexico. The foreign policy of openness and
   multilateral activism has been a significant aspect of a process (one
   that is incomplete and contentious) of redefining the identity of Mexico
   in the international sphere.},

Title = {Why strong moral cosmopolitanism requires a world-state},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL THEORY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {177-212},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The article deals with a pivotal conceptual distinction used in
   philosophical discussions about global justice. Cosmopolitans claim that
   arguing from the perspective of moral cosmopolitanism does not
   necessarily entail defending a global coercive political authority, or a
   `world-state', and suggest that ambitious political and economic
   (social) goals implied in moral cosmopolitanism may be achieved via some
   kind of non-hierarchical, dispersed and/or decentralized institutional
   arrangements. I argue that insofar as moral cosmopolitans retain
   `strong' moral claims, this is an untenable position, and that the goals
   of cosmopolitan justice, as explicated by its major proponents, require
   nothing less than a global state-like entity with coercive powers. My
   background ambition is to supplement some existing works questioning the
   notion of `governance without government' with an argument that goes
   right to the conceptual heart of cosmopolitan thought. To embed my
   central theoretical argument in real-world developments, I draw on some
   recent scholarship regarding the nature of international organizations,
   European Union, or transnational democratization. Finally, I suggest
   that only after curbing moral aspirations in the first place can a more
   self-consciously moderate position be constructed, one that will carry
   practical and feasible implications for institutional design.},

Abstract = {Localism has become a central feature of British political debate in
   recent years. This article traces the emergence and development of
   localism within all the three major UK parties - Conservatives, Labour
   and the Liberal Democrats - and seeks to explain why this transformation
   has taken place. Localism involves a radical ideological critique of the
   central state and seeks to replace it with more local forms of political
   organisation. In particular, this article distinguishes between liberal'
   and communitarian' forms of localism. Finally, this article evaluates
   the strength of localist claims to both empower individuals and allow
   for the expression of communal identity, concluding that there are

Abstract = {We proved the main hypothesis of the paper that the methodology of
   banks' capital measurement and banks' capital structure is problematic.
   In the times of crisis causes many serious problems including financing
   of the future local, regional and global economic developments. We
   didn't go here into quantitative correlation; however, qualitative
   outcome is very obvious. We proved this via the subordination problem.
   Basel II underestimated many risks that banks were disposed to in the
   bad times. Tier 2 (hybrids and subordinated debt) played too important
   role in the total banks' capital. The private owners of Tier 2 and even
   some Tier 1 debt instruments were hit the most by the (banking) crisis;
   the official debt got more seniority. Current Euro-zone crisis has
   potential to cause additional markets' volatilities and subordination
   crisis. Basel III will force banks to have more capital of the best
   quality. Existing and proposed capital accord system for banks with all
   details, pros and cons and detailed analysis with pointed out problems
   and implications on crisis and (future) regional and local economic
   development is the core of this paper. More Tier 1 will cause more
   stable conditions for banks financing local, regional and global
   (economic) developments.},

   Economic sentiment indicators system for monitoring economic
   developments in the EU regions and for identifying the emergence of the
   waves of optimism and pessimism in the current economic and fmancial
   crisis. Analysing Service Confidence Indicator we provide evidence of
   the positive impact of economic integration on EU regions' business
   cycles convergence with analysing two regions i.e. CEE-5 and EU-5.
   Econometric evidence suggests that the existence of convergence of
   regions is explaining a substantial proportion of regional business
   cycles. Results confirm that convergence occurred at the rate of 0,6\%
   during the whole period 2003-2011, 2,2\% and 0,9\% during the sub
   periods 2003-2007 and 2009-2011, respectively.},

Abstract = {While the realist research program has devoted considerable efforts to
   analyze strategies adopted by great powers, it has shown relatively
   little interest in defining what strategies other actors are likely to
   implement. Drawing on realist axioms, this work puts in light that there
   is a particularly efficient strategy that might be considered by
   ``non-power{''} states. This strategy aims at preserving a balance of
   power inside the system, which implies that non-power states are likely
   to prefer ``multidirectional engagement{''} to other types of strategy.
   Focusing on two major regions of the contemporary global system, this
   work shows that non-power states in the Gulf and in Southeast Asia have
   implemented such strategies in the post-Cold War.},

Abstract = {Public Procurement is one of the State activities with the most
   development in recent years. It has evolved, from being considered a
   purely bureaucratic activity to becoming a strategic function that must
   be professionally managed.
   While in this context, the professionalization of the public procurement
   function is being prioritized by the Governments of Latin America and
   the Caribbean, it faces important challenges, mainly with, those related
   to the preparation of the officials for the performance of their duties
   (qualification), verification by government entities for compliance with
   conditions of capacity for the exercise of procurement related with
   government positions (accreditation) and the independent determination
   that the practitioner possesses the necessary skills to perform the
   management activities of public procurement, with a professional level
   (certification).
   In this paper, the concepts of professionalism are distinguished,
   exploring the existing conditions and the experiences in Latin America
   and the Caribbean, describing them and introducing the concept of an
   ecosystem of qualification, accreditation and certification of
   professional competencies in Public Procurement, as well as its basic
   components and its necessary relationship with the respective
   procurement systems.
   The establishment of an ecosystem of qualification, accreditation and
   certification of professional competencies in Public Procurement will
   result in benefits with relation to human resources, operation of
   respective public procurement systems, and the improvement of the
   efficiency and effectiveness of public spending, to better development
   results.},

Abstract = {How, if at all, do nondemocratic elections affect credible signaling in
   international crises? While the literature on credible signaling
   emphasizes the importance of electoral competition, it does not specify
   the minimal conditions that elections must satisfy in order to enhance
   the credibility of threats. We address this oversight by focusing on two
   fundamental properties of electoral institutions: (1) the degree of
   proincumbent bias and (2) the vulnerability of the incumbent to a de
   facto loss of power following an opposition victory. Our theory argues
   that both decreases in electoral bias and increases in incumbent
   vulnerability introduce greater accountability into the electoral
   process and thus enhance the credibility of public threats, even when
   elections fail to meet basic democratic standards. We apply these
   insights to the case of electoral authoritarianism, that is, regimes in
   which some form of electoral competition exists but basic principles of
   democratic governance are commonly violated. Using data on reciprocation
   rates in militarized crises, We show that, so long as electoral biases
   are sufficiently low and incumbent vulnerability is sufficiently high,
   even electoral authoritarian regimes are able to credibly signal
   resolve.},

Volume = {61},

Abstract = {The article seeks to add to the growing contribution of discursive
   approaches to the study of political institutions by analysing the
   possibilities for cross-fertilisation between discursive
   institutionalism and post-structuralist discourse theory. Analysing
   Vivien Schmidt's version of discursive institutionalism, it argues that
   Schmidt's concept of discourse results in a model of explanation of
   institutional change that overlooks questions about the relations
   between power, politics and discourse. It further argues that while
   post-structural discourse theory has made important contributions to the
   understanding of the discursive nature of social practices, it has so
   far failed fully to take on board the institutional dimension of
   politics. It concludes that an integration of Schmidt's insights on
   discursive institutionalism with post-structuralist discourse theory
   allows a more rounded analysis of the political dimension of
   institutions and of the institutional dimension of politics, as well as
   a better understanding of institutional change. To illustrate our
   arguments we draw on our own research to analyse the relations between
   discourse and institutions in the 2002 presidential electoral campaign
   in Brazil and in Argentina's poverty reduction policies in the 1990s.},

Abstract = {This article advances the interpretivist perspective on British foreign
   policy by studying Tony Blair's difficult encounter with the Eurosceptic
   tradition in Britain, popularized by Margaret Thatcher from the late
   1980s. Using discourse data taken from key foreign policy speeches by
   the two leaders across their periods in office, the article investigates
   the problems Blair and his New Labour team faced when trying to justify
   and legitimize Britain's more constructive approach to the European
   Union from 1997. The article argues that Blair failed to modernize
   public attitudes and build support behind a Europeanist consensus in
   Britain because, contrary to the reputations they have built up over the
   years, the two leaders' webs of belief about the British in Europe were
   remarkably similar. Blair reworked rather than undermined core themes
   within the British Eurosceptic tradition.},

Abstract = {A case study of the shift in Venezuela's attitude toward the negotiation
   of the Free Trade Area of the Americas sheds light on Jorge Castaneda's
   distinction between a ``wrong left{''} and a ``right left{''} in Latin
   America. Castaneda's reliance on the ``origins{''} of Latin American
   leaders as the primary explanation for their governance styles is both
   deterministic and incomplete. By employing Nicos Poulantzas's
   ``relational{''} approach to the state, which conceptualizes the state
   as a strategic field of social relations, it becomes possible to
   conceive that the policies and governance styles of leftist governments
   in Latin America are as much the result of pressures emanating from the
   institutions of the state as of the origins of their leaders.},

Abstract = {Asylum policy in the European nation-states has been a subject of
   increasing influence form the European Union over the last 12 years
   since the call for the establishment of a Common European Asylum System.
   This article presents an assessment of the EU impact on the asylum
   policy outcomes in the 27 member states, Norway and Switzerland. The
   article focuses on three central hypotheses about the effects of
   Europeanization a race to the bottom, convergence and burden sharing.
   Using aggregate and origin-specific asylum data for the period 19992010
   provided by the UNHCR, we show that the increasing Europeanization of
   asylum policy has not resulted in a race to the bottom in which asylum
   recognition rates and the numbers of admitted refugees have eroded.
   Contrary to existing literature, we find some evidence for convergence
   of the overall asylum recognition rates but important national
   differences in the recognition of applicants from the same country of
   origin persist. Europeanization has not led to more equal distribution
   of the applications and recognitions of asylum status in Europe.
   Overall, the EU has had only a limited impact on the changes in asylum
   policy outcomes.},

Title = {The role of `social exclusion' and other metaphors in contemporary
   British social policy: a cognitive critical approach},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper addresses the pivotal role played by the selective deployment
   of key metaphors in the construction of political positions within the
   arena of British social policy-making. Drawing on a corpus-based
   analysis of speeches and reports covering a 10-year period of the New
   Labour government, evidence is presented to show how metaphors are used
   to create an ideologically vested narrative of societal ills and policy
   solutions that stretches across different genres and over time. The
   effect is to place problematic groups discursively outside society (the
   `socially excluded'), pathologise their behaviour, specify their route
   back into the mainstream, and delineate society's obligation to those on
   the outside. A methodology known as critical metaphor analysis is
   adopted that combines corpus-based modes of analysis with the
   theoretical insights of conceptual metaphor theory in order to shed
   light on the workings of ideology in particular discursive contexts.
   Linguistic metaphors are identified and grouped into four superordinate
   metaphor domains: CONTAINMENT, MOVEMENT, DISEASE and CONTRACT. The
   analysis reveals the close conceptual interaction between these domains
   and explains the effects produced by their discursive instantiation as
   motivated by a process of ideological change within the Labour Party. In
   seeking to foreground the workings of ideology in discourse, the paper
   also aims to highlight the profoundly important role of key metaphors in
   facilitating the Labour Party's ideological transformation and therefore
   to argue for the importance of attention to language cognition in
   critical forms of political discourse analysis. Journal of International

Abstract = {This paper considers the relationship between assessments of
   institutional quality in developing countries and the innovative
   activities of multinational corporations. Firm entry mode literature has
   established links between domestic institutions and ownership equity
   patterns among multinationals, but institutionalist analyses have not
   adequately addressed the types of activities pursued by multinational
   firms. I argue that in addition to various socioeconomic indicators, the
   quality of domestic political institutions in developing countries is an
   important determinant of local innovative activity. I argue that
   institutional quality in host countries reinforces consistent patterns
   of interaction between states and firms, leading to reduced risk of
   technological expropriation and other undesirable outcomes for firms. I
   test this argument by examining the impact of institutional assessments,
   carried out by firms themselves and by outside observers, on R\&D effort
   among multinationals, using firm-level surveys conducted in developing
   countries between 2002 and 2005. The multilevel empirical analysis
   suggests that multinational firms are likely to both locate R\&D
   activities and pursue them intensively in developing countries with
   well-regarded institutions, and that the impact of institutional
   variables is more significant than other likely predictors, such as
   education levels in host countries.},

Abstract = {The research on representative bureaucracy investigates whether higher
   levels of representation within public agencies affect policy outcomes.
   We expand this line of inquiry by examining the effect of symbolic
   representation on the clients' perceptions of the vocational
   rehabilitation program administered by the Department of Veterans
   Affairs. We test the link between passive representation and symbolic
   representation for Veteran identity. This is one of the first studies to
   investigate an identity not associated with immutable characteristics.
   We question how an identity related to a profession that an individual
   selects into, like Veteran status, can influence a client's relationship
   with a government program. We find that Veteran clients of the
   vocational rehabilitation system perceive substantial differences in the
   behaviors of their counselor and report significantly higher levels of
   overall satisfaction with the program when they know or believe their
   counselor is also a Veteran.},

Abstract = {This article describes the experience of a sociologist who made contact
   with a group of diehard terrorists responsible for multiple murders in
   order to conduct an ethnographic study. After outlining the sociological
   profile of the diehard terrorists, the authormaking reference to the
   ethnographic studies of Jack Douglas, Martin Sanchez Jankowski, and Laud
   Humphreysdescribes how he followed their traces. The aim of the article
   is to analyze the psychological costs that the sociologist must pay when
   he interacts with men and women who, in addition to proudly claiming
   credit for the homicides they have committed, affirm the importance of
   continuing to kill in order to salvage humanity's future.},

Abstract = {Despite connections and common traits between geopolitics and
   International Business based on geography and location, literature on
   this matter is scarce. This study aims to contribute to this literature
   gap, by assessing the importance of Poland's geopolitical factors in FDI
   location decisions. By applying a hybrid methodology which combines
   qualitative and quantitative analyses we conclude that there is a
   connection between Poland's geopolitical factors (stable, variable and
   interactional) and the volume, origin and distribution of the FDI
   received. (C) 2012 The Regents of the University of California.

Title = {Representation as delegation: a basis for EU democracy?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {224-242},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {This contribution tackles the issue of EU democracy from the point of
   view of representation. Building on the discussion of political and
   democratic representation offered, respectively, by Pitkin () and
   Urbinati (), it argues that at the heart of some of the most prominent
   analyses of EU democracy those offered by Moravcsik, Majone and Scharpf
   lies instead a particularly restrictive notion of representation as
   delegation. Starting from a principalagent model of democracy, all three
   authors end up endorsing a notion of representation as delegation that
   both Pitkin and Urbinati would find insufficient and ultimately
   undemocratic. Moravcsik, Majone and Scharpf assume that governmental
   representatives in the EU act either as delegates or as trustees of
   their national constituencies and thus break that ongoing, dynamic
   relationship which is at the basis of a fuller notion of political or
   democratic representation. The contribution concludes by arguing that
   representation as delegation is insufficient to legitimate the EU and
   that the rescue of the full notion of political and democratic
   representation is necessary, particularly in the changed circumstances
   of the financially and economically bereaved European Union.},

Title = {Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: How Do We Combine the Insights of
   Multiple Theories in Public Policy Studies?},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-21},
Abstract = {The combination of multiple theories in policy studies has a great
   potential valuenew combinations of theories or concepts may produce new
   perspectives and new research agendas. However, it also raises important
   ontological, epistemological, methodological, and practical issues that
   need to be addressed to ensure disciplinary advance. This article
   identifies three main approaches: synthesis, in which we produce one
   theory based on the insights of multiple theories; complementary, in
   which we use different theories to produce a range of insights or
   explanations; and contradictory, in which we compare the insights of
   theories before choosing one over the other. It examines the issues that
   arise when we adopt each approach. First, it considers our ability to
   synthesize theories when they arise from different intellectual
   traditions and attach different meanings to key terms. Second, it
   considers the practical limits to using multiple theories and pursuing
   different research agendas when academic resources are limited. Third,
   it considers the idea of a shoot-out in which one theory is chosen over
   another because it appears to produce the best results or most
   scientific approach. It examines the problems we face when producing
   scientific criteria and highlights the extent to which our choice of
   theory is influenced by our empirical narrative. The article argues that
   the insistence on a rigid universal scientific standard may harm rather
   than help scientific collaboration and progress.},

Abstract = {Soon after the establishment of the Southern Cone dictatorships many
   artists and intellectuals, mostly political activists, had to go into
   exile. The documentary filmmakers among them continued to work in their
   countries of exile producing testimonies, denunciations, and reflections
   with their countries of origin as a central focus. An analysis of the
   most important works of the period called ``film from exile,{''} from
   1973 (Augusto Pinochet's coup against Salvador Allende in Chile) to the
   democratic transitions taking place in the subcontinent in the mid- and
   late 1980s, reveals a progression in themes from militancy through
   reflection on the condition of exile to the defense of human rights. The
   documentary films from exile recorded the diversity of resources used by
   the filmmakers to bear witness to the absent, a rich palette that
   combined staging, archival material, interviews, and reflection to
   produce the only traces of free cinema during this period.},

Abstract = {The Stoltenberg government has aimed to implement UN Resolution 1325 on
   women, peace and security in the planning and execution of military
   operations in Afghanistan. The article shows that a positive process
   with relevant measures has been initiated. As yet, however, much has
   been left to each individual PRT commander and has resulted in varying
   practices and varying degrees of implementation. A strategy is therefore
   required if the measures are to have the desired effect. The article
   compares the application of a gender perspective in military operations
   carried out by the Norwegian and Swedish units, with some reference to
   the American experience. This is supplemented by an analysis of internal
   processes in the military organization. Key players from the Norwegian
   armed forces constitute the core interviewees in the article. The data
   include interviews with Swedish and U.S. military as well as
   non-military sources.},

Title = {The Mood Was Grave: Affective Dispositions and States' Anger-Related
   Behaviour},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3},
Pages = {552-580},
Abstract = {Recent developments in international relations and international
   security scholarship emphasize the need to consider emotions in
   explaining interstate behaviour. Less work has been done exploring the
   difference between emotions - or emotional reactions - and the
   longerterm affective dispositions they can trigger, affecting foreign
   and security policy. Affective dispositions towards objects, it is
   argued here, provoke different emotional reactions towards events
   affecting this object, even though the observed emotions might be
   labelled the same. Hence, an interstate dispute will elicit different
   anger expressions and related behaviours if the countries concerned are
   friends (with positive affective dispositions) or enemies (with negative
   affective dispositions towards each other). This article shows that
   state behaviours that otherwise would seem inconsistent or contradictory
   are explained by their affective dispositions. Countries tend to be more
   restrained in their anger-related behaviours towards friends than
   towards enemies. The argument is illustrated by America's emotional
   reaction to the behaviour of Britain during the 1956 Suez crisis,
   compared to its reaction to the Soviet Union following the 1979-1980
   invasion of Afghanistan. The emotional reactions in these cases are not
   specific to Washington. Other countries, such as the Czech Republic,
   France, Hungary, and Poland, displayed similar tendencies during the
   Iraq crisis of 2003, as did Britain, France, and Germany over
   intervention in Libya in 2011, in which anger and angerrelated
   behaviours were influenced by the affective dispositions.},

Title = {Insurgency and Civilian Policing: Organizational Culture and German
   Police Assistance in Afghanistan},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Pages = {324-349},
Abstract = {Effective and legitimate policing is a necessary condition for the
   sustainable stabilization of war-torn countries. A crucial dilemma faced
   by international donors is whether to promote militarized or civilian
   policing. Particularly with insurgency and terrorism, police need robust
   capabilities to defend themselves and citizens against violence. At the
   same time, militarized police forces with weak oversight may fail to use
   proportionate force and serve the public. Little is known about
   management of this dilemma. This article argues that three established
   explanations - local security threats, international norms, and the
   political systems of donor states - do not determine the shape of police
   assistance programmes. Rather, the organizational cultures of donor
   police forces most crucially influence whether donors prioritize
   civilian or militarized police assistance. German support for the Afghan
   National Police (ANP) is a case in point. Despite deteriorating security
   and American pressure to support counterinsurgency, German police
   advisors stuck with a civilian policing model, due to their own
   organizational culture. Planners of foreign missions should better
   anticipate the organizational biases of specific donor agencies, this
   article concludes, to avoid frustration during the implementation phase.},

Abstract = {Through analyzing the various factors in R2P's genesis and expansion as
   an international norm, this article contends that the office of the UN
   Secretary-General has provided steady backing of R2P, allowing for its
   ongoing consideration within the UN bureaucracy and among member states.
   In this respect, R2P has been able to assert itself in a meaningful way,
   with member states compelled to revisit the central tenets of the norm
   within the General Assembly and special dialogues. The office of the
   Secretary-General has clearly interpreted R2P as a strong and effective
   reinforcement of Article 1 of the UN Charter and the overall UN mandate,
   using the norm to more strongly anchor existing UN principles and
   values.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},

Pages = {216-231},
Abstract = {Violence against women occurs in peacetime, intensifies during wartime,
   and continues in the aftermath of armed conflict. Women sometimes make
   gains during conflict and their efforts to break the pattern of violence
   have led to a greater awareness of gender-based violence. However, a
   lack of acknowledgement of transformations in gender identity at the
   macro-level during peace processes may create conflict in intimate
   partnerships. This study brings to light the complexity of changes
   occurring during peace processes in a multi-level analysis of women's
   perceptions and positioning towards the state, their community, and
   their intimate partnership. This comparative analysis of fifty-seven
   female activists' narratives from Chiapas and Northern Ireland
   demonstrates how a one-dimensional peace process (Northern Ireland) can
   limit the space for addressing women's concerns, while peace processes
   that transcend the ethno-national dimension of conflict (Chiapas) can
   open a dialogue on issues of contention in male-female relationships.},

   peacebuilding governance},
Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Pages = {73-90},
Abstract = {Revisionist responses to the fallacies of liberal peacebuilding
   presuppose a commitment to the objective of building self-sustainable
   peace in war-torn countries. If this cosmopolitan commitment is nothing
   but an alternating motive of states for self-serving agendas, then the
   revisionists are in love with a lie, tragically confined to the
   graveyard of idealistic peace proposals. In this essay, the strategic
   and structural underpinnings of global peacebuilding governance are
   therefore explored, interpreting the empirical literature on recent
   operations through the social theoretical perspective of Anthony
   Giddens. It is argued that while the revisionist debate fails to
   recognise the subjective and self-serving preconditions for
   international peacebuilding, a certain strand of the revisionist
   literature is well attuned to these. Indicating what it would mean to
   turn the lie of liberal peacebuilding into more realistic and legitimate
   peacebuilding strategies, this strand also serves as a source of
   inspiration for revisiting broader debates on the law and ethics of
   global governance.},

   SIZED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS' WASTE MANAGEMENT SERVICES},

Abstract = {The current economic crisis is increasingly affecting the public sector,
   requiring stricter control of deficits, and local administrations are
   not exempt from these requirements. Therefore, it is essential to
   consider management forms that may produce cost savings in the provision
   of public services. In this article we propose an evaluation of
   municipal waste collection and disposal services to determine whether
   single/joint or public/private municipal service provision, together
   with other factors including quality, political aspects, and the
   socio-economic environment, most contribute to reducing costs. The
   results obtained for the period 200208 show that joint management
   (inter-municipal cooperation) and public management (in relation to
   single and private management systems, respectively) have a greater
   effect on reducing the costs of this service. Thus, small and
   medium-sized local authorities can identify formulas for reducing costs
   and thus be in a better position to overcome the economic crisis.},

Abstract = {By the end of World War II, the world witnessed both military and
   peaceful uses of nuclear science. A number of countries and different
   sections of the international community strongly urged to avoid
   repetition of the devastation witnessed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A
   world without nuclear weapons was a subject matter of not only pacifists
   but also of a large section of the world. The 2010 RevCon was held from
   3 to 28 May 2010. The final document noted: `... the reaffirmation by
   the nuclearweapon states of their unequivocal undertaking to accomplish,
   in accordance with the principle of irreversibility, the total
   elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament, to
   which all States parties are committed under article VI of the Treaty'.
   The 2010 RevCon also welcomed the new proposals and initiatives from
   Governments and civil society related to achieving a world free of
   nuclear weapons'. Indeed, barna, during his election campaign, spoke on
   the need for nuclear disarmament. So, should we conclude that global
   nuclear disarmament would materialize soon? What is the reality? If we
   take into account signals emitting from the postures and pronouncements
   of the nuclear weapons countries of the NPT and the influential section
   of the global civil society, we may find that global nuclear disarmament
   is somewhere between myth and super myth. A reality check would indicate
   that global nuclear disarmament would continue to elude us.},

Abstract = {Recent studies contend that public health agencies in the United States
   are in a state of turmoil because their organizational form causes them
   to take on conflicting mandates. One key reason is thought to be a
   trade-off in design: between creating stand-alone agencies for health
   and environment and creating agencies that combine the two. We use data
   on the organizational form of state health and environmental agencies to
   assess the choice of organizational form as a problem of institutional
   design from the perspective of path-dependency theory. Our results
   suggest that initial social conditions help explain the choice of
   combined or independent agencies. We believe that this case provides
   useful information about the roots of organizational design for
   resolving competing demands and provides insight into concerns about the
   delivery of health and environmental protection in the states.},

Abstract = {The Argentine director Albertina Carri's documentary/docudrama Los
   rubios confounds the binary between postmodern and neoconservative
   trends in recent Latin American cultural studies and popular media. It
   breaks the mold for ways in which the sons and daughters of the victims
   of political genocide can talk about their memories, inviting a
   pointedly feminist/postmodernist reading that plays with Baudrillard's
   notion of seduction in its challenge to established order. Carri's
   apparently postmodern rejection of the truth, facts, and master
   narratives expected from the politically involved descendants of
   disappeared activists opens up critical spaces for reflection about the
   discourse of meaning.},

Abstract = {This article reports results from the first twin study of adults in the
   United States that focuses exclusively and comprehensively on political
   traits. These data allow us to test whether a common set of genetic and
   environmental influences act upon a broad variety of values, personality
   traits, and political attitudes. In short, it allows us to empirically
   investigate whether there are a core set of predispositions that form
   the basis of our political orientations and, if so, whether these
   predispositions are shaped by the same environmental and innate forces.
   The key finding from our analysis is that there are core political
   predispositions that are rooted in common genetic and environmental
   influences and that these predispositions are empirically distinct from
   broader personality traits.},

Title = {The Legitimacy of Human Rights Courts: A Grounded Interpretivist
   Analysis of the European Court of Human Rights},
Journal = {HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {This article offers an empirically grounded interpretivist analysis of
   the social legitimacy of the European Court of Human Rights based on
   domestic judicial and political elite accounts of the legitimacy of the
   Court in Turkey, Bulgaria, United Kingdom, Ireland, and Germany. The
   central argument of the article is that the social legitimacy of the
   European Court of Human Rights is based on a constant comparison between
   the values and goals of domestic institutions and the values and goals
   of the European Court of Human Rights. More specifically, the social
   legitimacy of the European Court of Human Rights is grounded in the
   logic of a fair compromise: What actors think they lose by according
   legitimacy to the European Court of Human Rights must be balanced by
   what they perceive to gain in return. Three factors organize how actors
   in different domestic settings strike a fair compromise in their
   domestic contexts: a) perception of domestic human rights conditions, b)
   commitment to cosmopolitan ideals of human rights and international law,
   and c) commitment to domestic institutions.},

Abstract = {There is a growing need to develop and implement new forms of governance
   that respond to the increasing complexity of decision making and balance
   the roles of government and local citizens. Localism is (re)emerging as
   an alternative to traditional top-down' governance strategies which are
   criticised for their failure to adequately respond to the diversity of
   community needs. This article uses two case studies to explore how
   localism works in practice, the Tasmanian Drought Support Network and
   the Tasmanian Forest Agreement. Four dimensions of adaptive governance
   are used to critically identify the benefits and limitations of localism
   as a governance approach, exploring the approaches capacity for social
   and economic entrepreneurship, governance quality and the utilisation
   and enhancement of individual capacities. These empirical findings will
   help policy makers and community members better understand localism and
   guide the development of theory around localism and its future practice.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {30},
Number = {6},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the European renewable energy industry's capacity
   for pressure-based and information-based lobbying and its strategies in
   two lobbying efforts: for a legally binding target of 20 percent
   renewable energy by 2020 (a proposal adopted by the European Council in
   March 2007) and for binding interim targets as a means to secure
   effective implementation of the 2020 target (a proposal that was not
   adopted). It finds that the industry has the capacity for
   information-based lobbying but very limited capacity for pressure-based
   lobbying. The article also discusses the effectiveness of the two
   lobbying types. It argues that information-based lobbying is
   particularly effective early in the decision-making process, and
   hypothesizes that early information-based lobbying may compensate for
   limited capacity for pressure-based lobbying and for information-based
   lobbying that takes place later in the decision-making process, but
   concludes that this strategy would have been unlikely to be effective in
   the second case.},

Abstract = {The most outstanding trend in contemporary conflicts has been the fusion
   of the threats from terrorism and insurgency. Insurgent threats in many
   places on the globe today are mistaken as terrorist threats, and
   counterterrorism (CT) is deployed as the local insurgents come
   increasingly to resemble their transnational terrorist partners. Such an
   emphasis on the role of terrorism in insurgencies and the undue focus on
   CT risks strengthening, rather than severing, the connection between
   local insurgents and transnational terrorists. Russia's counterterrorist
   strategy inadvertently transformed the conflict from a contained,
   nationalist rebellion to a sprawling jihadi insurgency and perversely
   encouraged the group to resort even more to terrorist tactics. The
   Russian counterinsurgency has been unsuccessful, as the insurgents are
   neither demolished as a force nor are they isolated by society. Losing
   the hearts and minds among the Chechen people is a key reason behind why
   the Russian operation in Chechnya suffered failures. Too little
   attention was paid to winning over the hearts and minds of the people.},

Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {685-708},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Ohrid Framework Agreement (OFA) was supposed to herald a new era of
   multicultural coexistence in Macedonia following a short-lived civil
   war. However, antipathies between the Albanian minority and Macedonian
   majority run as deep as ever, frequently erupting into rioting which
   threatens the fragile peace on which coexistence is forged. This state
   of affairs appears to affirm at least one commonly voiced criticism
   against the OFA, namely, that the pluralisation of public life it set in
   place would further fragment, rather than unite, Macedonia's diverse
   citizenry. This article sheds light on the persistence of volatile
   ethnic relations in Macedonia despite more than a decade of multiethnic
   democracy. It argues explanations blaming the OFA are misplaced, and
   that the source of Macedonia's fraying ethnic relations lies with each
   community's ongoing struggle for recognition. Under this account,
   conflicts are the outcome not simply of each community's incompatible
   wants around access to sovereign power, prized employment, and other
   distributable resources but unredeemed idealisations of how they would
   like to be respected and esteemed by others. The article contends that
   such struggles for recognition are bringing Macedonians and Albanians to
   interact in a manner that stimulates a sense of profound wrong-doing at
   the hands of the other, which, in turn, serves to fuel interethnic
   antagonisms and widen the social distance between each group.},

Journal = {WORLD POLITICS},

Volume = {65},
Number = {4},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The article addresses the question of what role formal constitutions
   play in mitigating intense conflicts over the religious character of the
   state. In contrast to common views in constitutional and political
   scholarship, it demonstrates that the ideal of liberal constitutionalism
   is not compatible with the political reality and types of conflicts that
   characterize religiously divided societies. Analyzing four processes of
   constitution drafting in which issues of religious law and religious
   identity were at the heart of the debate India, Indonesia, Israel, and
   Turkey it argues that under deep disagreement over the state's religious
   character, the drafters adopt either a permissive or a restrictive
   constitutional approach. While the former implies strategies of
   constitutional ambiguity, ambivalence, and avoidance in order to allow
   the political system greater flexibility in future decision making on
   religion-state relations, the latter approach uses repressive
   constitutional constraints designed to limit the range of possibilities
   available to future decision makers. The article further explores the
   long-term consequences of the two approaches and argues that (1)
   permissive constitutional arrangements, more than restrictive
   arrangements, are likely to promote the democratic functioning of future
   governments; and that (2) permissive constitutional arrangements may
   facilitate greater freedom of religion, but they are also likely to lead
   to greater restrictions on freedom from religion, compared with
   restrictive constitutions.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) presents a Janus-faced profile concerning
   multilateralism. While in some areas it embraces multilateral
   institutions to a greater degree than other major players, in others it
   displays a less than unconditional support. Both patterns have been
   accounted for, but no account has explained why the EU shifts from one
   to the other. This article advances a reason for this bifurcated
   international identity. The EU is embedded in a world society that is
   culturally and normatively dense with regard to the standard of what
   qualifies as an actor. In the areas in which its actorness is further
   away from such a standard, the EU is impelled to take remedial action
   and embrace other components of the model of international actorness,
   like multilateral institutions and multilaterally developed norms. In
   order to test this hypothesis, the article examines the role of the EU
   vis-a-vis negotiations on anti-personnel landmines and hormone-treated
   beef.},

Title = {Resetting EU-China relations from a values-based to an interests-based
   engagement},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {50},
Number = {5},
Pages = {639-663},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The relationship between the European Union (EU) as an international
   actor and The People's Republic of China is currently in crisis whose
   root causes are more than just Eurozone instability but extends into
   important policy domains including global governance, trade reciprocity
   and bilateral investment. This article argues that underlying these
   tensions has been too great an emphasis by the EU on a primarily
   values-based engagement model that has collided with historically
   resonant hostility and different social norms to create obstacles that
   now need to be overcome. In so doing, it moves beyond the theory of
   defensive normativity, instead proposing that only when European
   interests can be intersected with China's predominantly realist world
   view will successful negotiating outcomes begin to be forged. An
   exploration of China's core national interests is overlapped with the
   EU's engagement patterns to help explain past failures and illustrate
   possible future strategies for resolving challenges.},

Abstract = {The accession of the CEE states to NATO and the European Union has put
   an end to the geopolitical ambiguity and implicit insecurity in the
   region between Russia and the so-called `Old Europe'. Instead of being
   an area of great powers' rivalry, elements of `buffer belts' lacking
   meaningful strategic options, objects of raw Nazi-Soviet deals, or zones
   under Russian occupation and domination, the three Baltic States and the
   Visegrad group countries became full-fledged members of the European
   Union and were given NATO's security guarantees. By the middle of the
   2000s, one would conclude that traditional geopolitics had ended in this
   region.
   However, the changes in the strategic situation in CEE have not changed
   the deep rooted moving forces and long-term strategic goals of the
   Russian policy toward the region. Moscow seeks to have the position, as
   its official rhetoric says, of an `influential centre of a multipolar
   world' that would be nearly equal to the USA, China, or the EU. With
   this in view Moscow seeks for the establishment of its domination over
   the new independent states of the former USSR and for the formation of a
   sphere of influence for itself in Central Eastern Europe. If it achieves
   these goals, then Europe may return once again to traditional
   geopolitics fraught with great power rivalries and permanent
   instabilities radiating far beyond CEE borders. Yet a few questions
   remain. Has Russia come to the conclusion that attempting to restore its
   privileged position of influence in Central-Eastern Europe is wrong? Has
   Russia enough power to threaten the CEE countries? How credible are
   NATO's security guarantees? How may Russian behavior in CEE affect a
   wider European geopolitical context? These questions are appropriate in
   the light of Russia's `resurgence' as a revanchist power and because
   Russia is, and most probably will remain in the next five to ten years,
   a weighty economic and strategic factor in areas along the Western
   borders of the former USSR. (C) 2013 The Regents of the University of

Abstract = {This piece aims to examine militarization in the American context. The
   first section traces the theoretical contours of us militarization and
   its conditions of possibility. The second section concentrates on the
   hold and imprint of militarization on society and puts forth that we
   must pay close attention to the spaces, objects, and sites of security
   that together make up the parameters of everyday life. Studying popular
   culture as main axis to show how national life is transformed and
   inhabited by militarization allows us to notice the pernicious
   banalization of the anchoring of the military fact in the social fabric
   of American everyday life, if not of the militarization as ``American
   way of life{''} with war being propagated and consumed as entertainment.},

Abstract = {The small-business sector faces a persistent dilemma: small firms often
   lack the human skills and financial resources to modernize and compete.
   How, then, can small firms overcome collective action problems to forge
   sector-wide modernization? This paper examines the political dynamics
   and the process of institutional change that underpin successful
   industrial upgrading through a comparative, longitudinal analysis of two
   policy experiments aiming at the modernization of small firm sectors in
   Portugal. Relying on comparative-historical analysis and process
   tracing, this study shows that successful industrial upgrading relies on
   intense and sustained political action, led by strong and stable
   interest leadership, in the pursuit of well-defined developmental
   benchmarks, and relying on the implementation of political,
   organizational and financial strategy according to a specific logic and
   sequence.},

Abstract = {Convictions for genocide in relation to the war in Bosnia (1992-1995)
   provide the strongest sense of justice-having-been-done to victims and
   their families. But at the ICTY, the reputation of which has been marred
   by a series of controversies, the few perpetrators found guilty of
   genocide were involved in the Srebrenica massacres of July 1995. Other
   courts have convicted individuals from a range of different locations
   (and periods) in the war, giving arguably a more complete sense of
   justice to victims, and a more accurate contribution to the historical
   record. It is widely perceived that the Genocide Convention has been
   narrowly interpreted. As most genocides do not result in total
   destruction, what counts as part of a group, especially when combined
   with other acts, is a key issue explored here. Two cases (outside
   Srebrenica) in which genocide indictees were not held responsible for
   genocide are examined, with the Jelisic case, involving a foot-soldier
   of genocide, the main focus for critical analysis. Reflection on the
   implications for Bosnian society are given in conclusion.},

Abstract = {This paper explains the concept the Authorised Economic Operator (AEO)
   and discusses why it is important for the local authorities to be
   familiar with the concept. Based on the quantitative survey carried out
   in this research we found that the ownership of the AEO certificate
   accelerates the road-based flow of goods and that it also positively
   affects the operation of economic operators within the scope of
   international trade. We also established that the infrastructure at
   border crossings does not enable the complete utilisation of all
   benefits offered by the ownership of the AEO certificate. This research
   of the AEO customs control program finds that the positive effects of
   AEO are reflected in the local environment as well and that the
   maximisation of the effects of the AEO requires the participation of the
   local government (municipalities, other local communities). This is
   especially the case in the activities associated with the planning of
   cross border traffic infrastructure and in the provision of information
   on the significance of time and security of supply chain functions.},

Abstract = {Generally the settlement and intermediate level municipalities play an
   important role in providing health care. Therefore the local communities
   are responsible for organizing of the majority of the public health
   services in decentralized model, where the settlement level
   self-governments organize the basic (primary) health services and the
   intermediate level local governments the outpatient and inpatient cares.
   Decentralized model is typical but not general in Europe: the central
   governments are widely responsible for the provision of the health
   services in several countries. In the centralized model the local
   governments are not - or just in small scale (health planning and basic
   services) - responsible for the health services.},

Abstract = {The international political situation in the second half of the first
   decade of the 21st century offered greater opportunities than in the
   past for middle powers to have an impact on multilateral policy. With
   this in mind, the paper reviews three multilateral experiences Mexico
   was involved in over the 2006-2013 period: the initiative to create the
   Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (celac), its role on
   the un Security Council, and hosting the 16th Conference of the Parties
   (COP16). Analysis of these cases casts light on the potential and
   limitations of Mexico's foreign policy. Moreover, it enables evaluation
   of the significance of its multilateral action on the consolidation of
   its role as a middle power.},

Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {457-475},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Chinese arms sales to Africa have increased in recent years. In a region
   beset by conflict and unstable regimes, and where arms sales are a
   significant and positive predictor of an increased probability of
   political violence, this is inherently problematic. The sale of weaponry
   to a regime in Khartoum caught up in an alleged genocide in Darfur, the
   awkward appearance in 2008 of a Chinese ship loaded with weapons bound
   for Mugabe's Zimbabwe off the coast of eastern Africa, and the recent
   exposure in 2011 that Chinese arms companies offered to sell around
   \$200 million worth of arms to Muammar Gaddafi's regime are emblematic
   of an issue in Africa's political violence that needs analysis. This
   article seeks to discuss the rationale behind China's arms sales to
   Africa and the effect that they have had on political violence in
   recipient countries. It also provides an analysis of the
   supply-and-demand circumstances of Chinese arms transfers to Africa,
   Beijing's attempts to control such transfers, and evidence that Chinese
   policies on proliferation are (slowly) evolving.},

Abstract = {The Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (Revolutionary Armed
   Forces of ColombiaFARC) was originally founded to protect Colombian
   peasants from harsh landowner policies in exchange for food and
   supplies. Over time, it has evolved into an internationally connected,
   narco-trafficking organization that displays little concern for the
   peasants it once vowed to protect. In recent years, Colombian
   authorities have become more adept at countering the FARC, forcing it to
   operate increasingly outside of Colombia. The FARC's transformation from
   a local insurgency into an internationally connected one is the focus of
   this article. Using social network analysis it identifies key leaders
   who are tied to this transformation and discusses implications
   concerning the FARC's future.},

Abstract = {The failed state thesis has been a matter for discussion in the
   international relations academy for more than two decades. However, the
   soundness of this analytic framework has been questioned. This article
   critically engages this debate by examining the ability of the thesis to
   provide insight into the practice of statecraft in the case of Yemen. It
   argues that as a result of its rigid and Eurocentric approach, the
   failed state thesis is unable to recognise the strategies employed by
   states like Yemen to ensure their survival, which include the purposeful
   production of chaos.},

Abstract = {Recent studies cast doubt on the value added of international trade
   agreements and institutions. Using a new data set that consists of about
   35,000 observations on the trade of fifty-four nations between 1919 and
   1938, we examine whether this skepticism also applies to the infamous
   interwar trade blocs. Traditional historical accounts attribute to them
   a large drop in international trade and a rise in the political tensions
   that would later erupt in World War II. In this study, we show that no
   bloc raised trade among its members as a whole or decreased trade
   between members and nonmembers. However, our findings are not wholly
   consistent with the skepticism recent studies express. We argue that
   conflicts of interest among the great powers encouraged the emergence of
   the bloc system and also gave rise to intrabloc trade shifts consistent
   with the political interests of their great-power hubs. The
   political-military alliances these conflicts created also reduced trade
   between their signatories, and we argue more generally that the causal
   chain runs from politics to trade. As a result, measuring only the
   effect of agreements and institutions on aggregate trade between their
   members can generate inaccurate estimates of their value added.},

Abstract = {A prominent theme in scholarly analyses of contemporary international
   affairs concerns the extent to which the unrivalled power and activities
   of the United States can be said to constitute a form of imperialism.
   Typically, the contours of this debate center on the ostensible
   differences between old and new varieties of imperialist practice. Yet
   the concept of new imperialism remains one on which little consensus
   exists. Wide differences of opinion on its origins, dynamics, and
   characteristics are evident, as is an analytical bifurcation between
   distinct economic and geopolitical explanations. This absence of
   conceptual unity leads to accounts of new imperialist strategy that are
   partial, limited, and incomplete. If the theoretical value of new
   imperialism is to be realized, a more holistic approach is needed. To
   this end, some of the key differences between the contexts of new and
   old imperialism are explored.},

Abstract = {This article documents strategies and tactics of social control used by
   the U.S. government to detect and deter financing of radical Islamic,
   terrorist-labeled organizations. Through grounded theory, social control
   strategies were identified based on data from congressional committee
   hearings from 1999 to 2011. Findings revealed the presence of nine such
   strategies: (1) discover sources of funding, (2) deny or restrict access
   to money, (3) establish information networks and communication norms,
   (4) create derogatory labels, (5) influence the media, (6) impose legal
   sanctions, (7) offer financial incentives, (8) construct a shared
   collective identity, and (9) force terrorist-labeled organizations on
   the defensive.},

Abstract = {One challenge in contemporary political philosophy is to reconcile
   groups' claims for rights and collective self-determination with a
   liberal commitment to the priority of individuals' rights and
   well-being. A solution to this puzzle may rest on a justification of
   group rights based on shared individual interests. This presupposes the
   collective conception of group rights, which does not entail that a
   group has to be conceived of as a distinct entity, with an independent
   moral standing. Such a strategy would thus not lead to conflicts between
   the rights of a group and those of its individual members. This article
   argues that this strategy does not succeed in justifying genuine group
   rights. Shared interests cannot ground rights held by a group qua group,
   especially the kind of rights that national or cultural groups demand.
   The conclusion of this argument is that the interest theorist has to
   embrace a view of groups as distinct entities in order to ascribe them
   rights qua group. So the upshot of this article is that communitarian or
   full-blown nationalist justifications of collective rights may be more
   coherent than some liberal attempts although probably less plausible and
   more problematic from a normative point of view.},

Abstract = {This article examines the origins of European competition policy.
   Whereas a new and influential view holds that German ordoliberal ideas
   were the driving force behind the emergence of that policy, I argue that
   such ideational explanations are theoretically unconvincing,
   methodologically biased and substantively wrong. Based on a careful
   observation of the most relevant actors' preferences, the terms of their
   interaction during the Paris negotiations of 195051, and the
   institutional context of their operations, I conclude that French
   planners' preferences, German reactions and US policy must all be
   examined together to produce a more convincing account of the emergence
   of the most supranational of all European policies. The finding that
   European competition policy emerged out of an acrimonious bargaining
   episode between pro-competition French bureaucrats and anti-competition
   German politicians points to the redistributive nature of European
   competition rules, and thereby severely challenges ideational theories,
   liberal-intergovernmentalism and delegation-for-credibility theories
   alike.},

Abstract = {An interpretive approach to foreign policy explains the beliefs of
   actors and the meanings of their actions by locating them in their
   respective historical traditions and in response to particular dilemmas.
   This article explains how the British Press constructs secularism' as a
   requirement for Turkey's potential future membership in the European
   Union (EU) as a response to the rise of the Islamically-identified
   Justice and Development Party (AKP). By emphasizing Turkey's secularism
   as a precondition for entry into the EU, the press effects a significant
   departure from the dominant British foreign policy traditions with
   respect to Turkey and the EU, which have highlighted considerations of
   material benefits. These arguments are pursued through a close analysis
   of how the British Press covered the attempted election of the country's
   next president in 2007 and the resulting conflict.},

Abstract = {The term `evolution' is used loosely in the policy literature and its
   meaning is frequently unclear. This article injects clarity into debates
   of evolution and establishes its ability to describe and explain policy
   change. It has four main aims. First, it identifies the explicit and
   implicit uses of evolutionary theory in policy studies. Second, it
   considers how such accounts relate to each other and the wider
   literature on public policy. Third, it identifies the causal mechanisms
   involved in evolutionary accounts. Finally, it considers how to
   translate abstract theory into a more concrete set of methods and plans
   for empirical research.},

Abstract = {Officials within parliaments have received marginal scholarly attention.
   This also holds for the European Parliament (EP) which contains a
   considerable administration. This study, based on an online survey
   (N=118), shows that political group staff are primarily committed to the
   concerns of their respective political groups, but also to the arguments
   of those external actors which have similar party affiliation. Since
   most group officials are, in addition, affiliated to a particular
   committee, they also emphasize sectoral interests, including the
   concerns of affected interest groups. EP secretariat officials, on the
   other hand, give priority to sectoral and expert concerns. Both groups
   of staff rank European concerns above national ones, and pay more
   attention to the arguments of the European Commission than to the
   arguments of any other institution. This study thus suggests that
   officials in the EP contribute to the spanning of ideological and
   sectoral cleavages across European Union institutions. These
   observations may be seen as deviating from a basically intergovernmental
   portrayal of the Union.},

Abstract = {KING MAKERS LOCAL LEADERS AND ETHNIC POLITICS IN AFRICA By DO MINIKA
   KOTER Much of the literature on electoral politics in Africa has focused
   on one mechanism of electoral mobilization: reliance on shared ethnic
   identity between politicians and voters. On the contrary, the author
   argues that politicians pursue two distinct modes of nonprogrammatic
   electoral mobilization: (1) by directly relying on the support of voters
   from one's own ethnic background, and (2) by indirectly working through
   electoral intermediaries-local leaders who command moral authority,
   control resources, and can influence the electoral behavior of their
   dependents. Yet the power of local leaders varies greatly; hence the
   option to use electoral intermediaries is not available in all settings.
   The choice of electoral mobilization affects national electoral
   outcomes: by severing the direct link between politicians and voters,
   intermediaries reduce a campaign's reliance on shared identity and
   create cross-ethnic electorates. The evidence for this argument is based
   on original interviews with political leaders collected during fieldwork
   in Senegal and Benin during the 2006-7 electoral season, media coverage
   of elections, and a historical analysis of first mass elections in the
   1950s.},

Abstract = {Little is known about the evolution of electoral sentiment over British
   election cycles. How does party support converge on the eventual
   election outcome? Do preferences evolve in a patterned and
   understandable way? What role does the official election campaign period
   play? In this article, we begin to address these issues. We outline an
   empirical analysis relating poll results over the course of the election
   cycle and the final vote for the three main political parties. Then we
   examine the relationship relying on vote intention polls for the
   seventeen British general elections between 1950 and 2010. Predictably,
   polls become increasingly informative about the vote over the election
   cycle. More surprisingly, early polls contain substantial information
   about the final outcome, much more than we see in presidential and
   congressional elections in the US. The final outcome in Britain comes
   into focus over the long campaign and is to a large extent in place well
   before the official election campaign begins. The findings are
   understandable, we think, but raise other questions, which we begin to
   consider in a concluding section.},

Abstract = {This study analyses to what extent a change of government in times of
   unchanged international structure affects the ideology of foreign
   policy. The main contribution is to investigate the role of political
   culture, as reflected through institutional design, as an intervening
   variable. Effects of changes of government in the United Kingdom in 1997
   and 2010 and in Sweden in 1994 and 2006 is studied by analysing speeches
   in the General Debates of the UN General Assembly. The analysis is based
   on four ideal types. The results indicate that institutional design is
   an influencing intervening variable of foreign policy ideology. In the
   UK, a country dominated by majoritarian institutional design, foreign
   policy ideology changes more extensively in times of government change
   than in Sweden, a country dominated by consensual institutional design.},

Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {What makes a diplomatic or military signal credible? In strategic
   settings where deception is possible, rational actors' interpretations
   rely on their beliefs, intuition, and imagination-they rely on emotion.
   Two properties of emotion-as an assimilation mechanism and its use as
   evidence-are key to addressing four strategic problems. First, emotion
   explains why actors worry needlessly about their reputations. Second,
   emotion is important to understanding costly signals. Third, emotion
   explains radical changes in preferences. Fourth, emotion sharpens
   understanding of strategic problems without being self-invalidating:
   common knowledge of emotion's effects do not always change those
   effects. Understanding how rational actors think requires turning to
   emotion. Evidence from the Korean War captures strengths and weaknesses
   of competing perspectives.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that Russian-Western mistrust persists due to
   historical and cultural developments with roots in the Cold War. The
   post-Cold War imbalance of power served to exacerbate the problem. The
   United States emerged as the world's superpower acting on perceived
   fears of Russia, whereas Russia's undermined capabilities dictated a
   defensive, rather than a hegemonic response. The paper analyzes the
   decision to expand NATO by excluding Russia from the process. It also
   asks why the process suddenly stopped in 2008. What changed the West's
   mind about the expansion was not a revised perception of Russia, but
   rather concern with its growing power and assertiveness as revealed by
   the Kremlin's use of force during the Caucasus' war. (C) 2013 Published

Abstract = {This article distills insights for the scholarship of deterrence by
   examining the 1983 nuclear crisisthe moment of maximum danger of the
   late Cold War. Important contributions notwithstanding, our
   understanding of this episode still has caveats, and a significant pool
   of theoretical lessons for strategic studies remain to be learned.
   Utilizing newly available sources, this article suggests an alternative
   interpretation of Soviet and US conduct. It argues that the then US
   deterrence strategy almost produced Soviet nuclear overreaction by
   nearly turning a NATO exercise into a prelude to a preventive Soviet
   attack. Building on historical findings, this article offers insights
   about a mechanism for deterrence effectiveness evaluation, recommends
   establishing a structure responsible for this endeavor, and introduces a
   new theoretical term to the strategic studies lexicona culminating point
   of deterrence'.},

Abstract = {Scholars have established that the national news media focus their
   attention on important actors in Congress such as party leaders,
   committee chairs and influential senators. However, researchers have yet
   to consider whether the median voter and filibuster pivot salient actors
   in the legislative process receive differential coverage by the news
   media. Examining the 106th Senate, I demonstrate that having a positive
   probability of being the median voter in the chamber affects the
   attention garnered from the national press. However, there is no
   significant difference observed for filibuster pivots.},

Abstract = {This article examines the contemporary phenomenon of suicide attacks by
   fusing network analysis and time-series econometrics. We find that a
   global network of militant organizations drives the reproduction of the
   suicide-attack phenomenon, and brokers within the network mark the
   primary perpetrators and diffusers of the tactic. The introduction of a
   fourth level of analysis of political violence demonstrates that network
   connections between organizations form a system that perpetuates suicide
   attacks. An organization-level analysis reveals that ideological
   congruence facilitates the establishment of network connections. As
   exemplified by the wide range of employers and targets, and moreover by
   the generation of an autogamous function, contemporary suicide attacks
   represent a unique sociopolitical phenomenon. Accordingly, organizations
   that use the tactic warrant a distinct classification.},

Abstract = {Engaging two recent articles published in Contemporary Security Policy,
   this intervention affirms that the emergence of Common Security and
   Defence Policy (CSDP) cannot be meaningfully described as European
   balancing vis-a-vis the United States. It is equally sceptical about
   attempts to explain it as a bandwagoning move. Instead, it suggests that
   European investment in CSDP can be most plausibly explained with a
   constructivist framework that takes into account strategic culture and
   identity-related concerns. From this perspective, CSDP is best
   understood as a vehicle for emancipating Europeans from American
   tutelage.},

Abstract = {Before tracing the tortuous path of the diffusion of the invention, it
   is necessary to define a general introduction on regulatory reform. The
   origin of the debate on the quality of the regulation has its roots in
   the growing of regulatory activity of the State. The widespread tools
   for improving the quality of regulation are: the Regulatory Impact
   Analysis (to analyse the social/economic/environmental impact on
   enterprises of the regulation ex ante) and the Standard Cost Model. The
   work analyses the SCM as a widely applied methodology developed to
   provide a simplified method for estimating the administrative costs
   imposed on firms by regulation.},

Pages = {210-233},
Abstract = {Global governance frameworks are innovative initiatives that respond to
   international norms and incorporate state and non-state actors in
   efforts to address particular governance challenges. The Kimberley
   Process is an important global governance framework that has evolved in
   concert with the anti-conflict diamond norm and seeks to prevent the
   trade of conflict diamonds. The article examines the evolution of this
   global governance framework and anti-conflict diamond norm and
   emphasises the role of two middle powers - South Africa and Canada - in
   the Kimberley Process. It also analyses the cases of Sierra Leone, Cote
   d'Ivoire, and Zimbabwe in order to illustrate the type of governance
   challenges faced by the Kimberley Process. The article concludes with a
   policy-relevant discussion of the promise and limitations of global
   governance frameworks as well as cooperative and collaborative behaviour
   among middle powers.},

Title = {Beyond the Briefing: Theoretical and Practical Problems in the Works and
   Legacy of John Boyd},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3},
Pages = {583-599},
Abstract = {More celebrated than analysed, John Boyd's contribution to strategic
   theory remains largely unevaluated. While his influence in air warfare
   and aircraft design is widely accepted, his role as a strategist -
   especially the widely applied OODA (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) Loop - is
   more controversial. His ideas were originally presented in briefings
   more than in his own writings, and rely on exposition by others. One
   result of this complicated legacy is that his work is advocated more
   than tested. Among existing studies, the most rigorous explain his
   approach to strategy and its application, but the task of testing Boyd's
   novelty and validity as a strategic theorist through rigorous social
   science has only just begun. Comparative analysis suggests that Boyd's
   strategic theory - including the OODA Loop - is highly ambiguous, as are
   claims about his uniqueness. Tested against the broader literatures on
   nuclear pre-emption or counterinsurgency, his novelty and usefulness
   seem limited. Boyd's strategic thought needs investigating in three
   principle areas: epistemological validity, theoretical applicability,
   and the quality and limits of his evidence. Until these areas are better
   explored, Boyd's strategic thought should be taught in any strategic
   studies programme, business school, or war college, though perhaps not
   in the doctrinaire way his strongest adherents might want. Boyd is an
   important figure in the development of the military thought. Students
   who so far only know his name and the OODA concept would benefit greatly
   from engaging with, applying, and criticizing his ideas.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},

Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {292-308},
Abstract = {This article addresses the way the Catholic Church deliberates and/or
   contributes to public deliberation over the Basque ethno-territorial
   conflict. The article proceeds in three sections. Section 2 positions
   the piece within theoretical debate about Rissian and institutionalist
   approaches to the deliberative ideas and practices conveyed by the
   Church. Section 3 sums up the main results of the empirical research
   undertaken, making a distinction between the contribution of the Church
   to public debate over conflict-resolution and the way it has deliberated
   over the ethno-territorial issue within its own institutional apparatus.
   We observe the primacy of logics of appropriateness on the part of the
   Church, thus reducing deliberative practices to an active but
   marginalized status. The concluding section discusses the empirical and
   theoretical implications of the case study.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to build theory and present a
   model of the development of conflicts in teams.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper develops a conceptual model
   based on past theory and research.
   Findings - The model brings a multi-level perspective to the process of
   intragroup conflict by showing the mechanisms by which an interpersonal,
   dyadic conflict can spread to other team members over time through a
   process of conflict contagion.
   Originality/value - This study provides a new model for conflict
   escalation and it sheds light on factors which can either ameliorate or
   exacerbate the speed and extent of conflict contagion. The repercussions
   of different degrees of conflict involvement within a team are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The concept extraterritoriality is an excellent point of departure for
   study of the contingent character of territorial sovereignty.
   Extraterritorial practices are widespread. Theories of the sovereign
   state pretend they are not because that would seemingly undermine the
   state, while in many respects they are what makes `sovereignty'
   possible. This article gives a short review of extraterritorial
   practices historically, focusing on one contemporary case; namely, the
   2009 the Norwegian ban on the purchase of sexual services. This law
   cannot be considered a smoother of relations, but instead a Wider claim
   for justice in the face of global crime. It could easily be argued that
   the law itself is an expression of moralism rather than an effective
   legal tool. The issues addressed in this paper are thus several: What is
   the relationship between sovereignty/order and extraterritoriality? Is
   the development which the Norwegian law exemplifies a return to a
   medieval organization of authority where religious or moral claims are
   dominant? Or how should such a law in fact be explained?},

Abstract = {This chapter introduces a thorough empirical background of the conflict
   between Hamas and Fatah and the rise of Hamas as a non-state actor
   resembling a government; at the same time the chapter provides a
   detailed analysis of the operational setting of the Hamas authority in
   Gaza. The chapter argues that the case of the Hamas authority as a
   non-state actor impacting Gaza's public sphere is unique, noting the
   parameters under which the Hamas authority has been operating since
   2007, including: the continued Israeli occupation of Gaza; the
   diplomatic boycott and tightened closure imposed by the international
   community and Israel (both on the authority itself as an organization
   and on the population of the Gaza Strip generally), and the political
   conflict between the Hamas authority in Gaza and the Palestinian
   Authority (PA) in Ramallah.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to study the interactions of regional and
   international pressure on the Pan-Amazon, a region considered strategic
   for Brazil. Its importance lies in multiple fields, with emphasis on the
   environment and the economy. Two perspectives, although not
   incompatible, reveal themselves difficult to harmonize, especially when
   it converges to the exploitation of natural resources in the Pan-Amazon
   and the exercise of national sovereignty over their territories. But the
   thematic scope of the article is even wider, since one of the main
   objectives of the study is to try to articulate the environmental and
   economic issues related to the Pan-Amazon with policy issues related to
   regional security and national levels around the Brazilian Amazon,
   assuming that the issue is even more complex when contemplated in its
   regional dimension. Finally, we carried out an exercise on scenarios
   involving the Pan-Amazon at both the regional and the international
   levels.},

Title = {Representation in the European State of Emergency: Parliaments against
   Governments?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {35},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {565-582},
Abstract = {`If governments allow themselves to be entirely bound to the decisions
   of their parliament, without protecting their own freedom to act, a
   break up of Europe would be a more probable outcome than deeper
   integration.' The statement of the Italian Prime Minister and head of
   the so-called `governo tecnico words have to be seperated' is one
   remarkable instance for colliding visions of representation in EU member
   states affected by the financial crisis. It exposes an old problem of
   representation: that is, representation of the whole versus
   representation of the parts. National parliaments are called to endorse
   the European decisions of their governments and simultaneously to sell
   the sacrifices to their constituencies. This development is conducive to
   clashes between parliaments and governments. The collision occurs
   between governments representing the Euro and Europe and national
   parliaments representing national voters' interests.
   Nevertheless in the period of analysis (2010-2012) the governments
   generally succeeded in commanding the majority needed to pass relevant
   legislation, whereby most intriguingly majorities were repeatedly formed
   by government and opposition parties. We are interested in the analysis
   of how this came about, how MPs argued over and negotiated the outcome.
   The hypothesis is twofold: First, we expect that despite reservations
   the majority consents because entrapped in a European discourse,
   building on arguments of how the rescue mechanisms are in the best
   European as well as national interests. Second, budget competence being
   the `crown jewel' of parliaments these are anxious to keep control of
   decisions taken at the European level and have to be satisfied through
   side-payments or constitutional concessions strengthening their control
   function. To test our hypothesis we analysed parliamentary debates and
   negotiations of national parliaments in three member states: Germany,
   Italy and Austria.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Pages = {409-412},
Abstract = {As framed here, the key question regarding the larger debate about the
   European approach(es) to the United States after the end of the Cold War
   is: are the Europeans bandwagoning or balancing? And in that context,
   how should the development of the Common Security and Defence Policy
   (CSDP) be interpreted? Both articles provide valuable insights into the
   dynamics of transatlantic relations, yet they both miss important
   (although different) parts of the larger picture. First, this response
   to the two articles argues that the CSDP can be understood neither as
   balancing behaviour nor as an attempt to bandwagon with the United
   States for the simple reason that the CSDP is little but a paper tiger.
   For all practical purposes there is no common European security and
   defence policy. Second, it is argued that the structural realist
   tendency to see the Europeans' behaviour as either balancing or
   bandwagoning is futile. Some European nations clearly bandwagon; others
   are pursuing a more independent and autonomous approach to the United
   States.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},

Pages = {819-837},
Abstract = {In bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations with members of the
   Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the European Union (EU)
   must demonstrate that its policy on services trade is coherent with its
   development policy. This will be a major challenge for the EU, since its
   coherence review of services trade policy merely confirmed the status
   quo. Policy coherence may be improved by granting concessions on
   temporary migration of ASEAN workers to the EU and by providing Aid for
   Trade to ASEAN countries to increase their capacity to export services.
   But at the World Trade Organization (WTO), the EU has already refused to
   grant concessions on temporary migration, and it is unlikely to be in a
   position to provide the right amount and type of Aid for Trade to ASEAN
   countries.},

Abstract = {When ethnic minority parties are excluded from government coalitions,
   are group attributes such as religion related to the groups use of
   political violence? We argue that extremist factions within minority
   groups make use of divergence in religion to mobilize support for
   violent action when the group is excluded from government. Thus, we
   posit that while religion per se is not a source of violence, extremist
   elements of ethnic minorities, whose religion differs from the majority,
   may use religious divergence to mobilize group members to perpetrate
   terrorism. Specifically we test the hypotheses that extremist factions
   of an excluded group will be more likely to carry out terrorist attacks
   when the group's members belong to a different religion as well as when
   they belong to a different denomination or sect of a religion than the
   majority. To test these propositions, we use data on ethnic minority
   party inclusion in government coalitions, ethnic minority group
   religion, and the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) by matching
   perpetrators with ethnic groups for all democracies, 19702004.},

Title = {Beyond Clear-Hold-Build: Rethinking Local-Level Counterinsurgency after
   Afghanistan},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3},
Pages = {526-551},
Abstract = {Despite a highly uneven track record, clear- hold- build has remained a
   dominant, even universal, approach to counterinsurgency. Its prevalence
   is rooted in its incontestable sequencing of operations and the
   attendant promise of a linear path towards peace. Yet the appeal of this
   approach also makes it deceptive and possibly dangerous.
   Clear-hold-build is not a strategy and must not be mistaken for one, as
   it has been in Afghanistan, where it inspired false hope for swift
   progress. Instead, it is necessary to reach a more problematized view of
   this approach and of what it aims to achieve. This article provides such
   an evaluation, proposing five principles that should guide its future
   application. These principles point to the need for a far deeper
   understanding of how security, development, and governance interact at
   the local level. Counterinsurgents must understand the relationships
   between aid and security, between government and governance, and between
   state and periphery. Where the central government is predatory or lacks
   support, clear- hold- build also raises difficult questions of
   authority, legitimacy, and control - questions that counterinsurgents
   must be capable of answering. Thus problematized, clear-hold-build
   emerges as a framework with heuristic utility; a schema that can be
   helpful in planning but which must at the time of application be
   populated by knowledge, substance, and skill. The implications of these
   requirements are troubling, particularly for those governments still in
   the business of armed intervention.},

Volume = {91},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {135-158},
Abstract = {This study examines multiple organizational climates and their
   relationship with politics and performance in public organizations. We
   argue that four types of climates (participative, innovative, leadership
   and service) impact employees' performance and public service outcomes,
   and that perceptions of organizational politics mediate these
   relationships. A theoretical model is suggested and examined empirically
   in a field study of 2102 teachers from 108 public schools and three
   major districts in Israel. Standard regressions and hierarchical linear
   model statistics are used to examine several hypotheses about the
   relationship between climate, micro-level performance and macro-level
   performance. The findings, both micro- and macro-level based, indicate
   that multiple climates in the school environment are positively related
   to teachers' satisfaction and organizational citizenship behaviour.
   Furthermore, perceptions of politics and such micro-level performance
   indicators are also related to school level achievements.},

Abstract = {The Western Balkan countries have made important steps in the
   advancement of democracy. However, public administration remains a field
   where reforms progress very slowly, due to a combination of reasons,
   ranging from economic and political to cultural ones. Macedonia is not
   an exception. This paper analyzes the main reasons for the slow pace of
   reforms in Macedonia's public administration sector. The focus on public
   administration and the state contributes to understanding the priority
   of establishing a professional, efficient and transparent public
   administration system in a country in the process of European accession.
   The main research question is why reforms in Macedonia's public
   administration sector have been so difficult to implement. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {This article sheds light on the involvement of members of the public in
   the United Kingdom's resilience agenda through an examination of the
   Project Argus initiative. The article argues that it is principally
   through knowledge sharing between state and citizen that Argus seeks to
   foster increased resilience. It then moves on to elaborate the idea of
   the resilient citizen, emphasising the way in which it represents a
   potentially more permeating form of institutionalisation of the
   resilience agenda. The development of the resilient citizen, the article
   concludes, captures a bargain struck between state and citizen: extra
   knowledge for extra responsibility.},

Title = {Re-articulating Dissent: Representing the Working Class from Third Way
   to New Right in Britain and Chile},

Abstract = {This article takes the 2010 electoral defeats of the Chilean
   Concertacion and British New Labour governments as a point of departure
   to analyse the crisis of representation in Third Way politics and how
   this crisis has allowed the right to articulate a successful project of
   subaltern dissent. The article develops a critical reading of Gramsci
   through an engagement with Spivak to analyse the complex and contested
   relations of representation through which subaltern subjectivities are
   constituted politically. In applying this critical deconstruction to
   Britain and Chile we discuss the ways in which the Third Way
   discursively, materially and institutionally acted to re-present a
   demobilised working-class subject as part of a model of a consensual
   (elite-led) and de-antagonised politics. We argue that this
   depoliticisation and demobilisation of popular activity has served to
   disembed Third Way parties from their core constituencies in civil
   society, allowing room for the political right to re-articulate
   subaltern dissent. We thus analyse how the right has sought to
   articulate subaltern good sense in terms of (1) nostalgia, (2)
   anti-politics and (3) disciplinality. We conclude by suggesting some of
   the potential tensions and contradictions involved in this
   re-articulation of dissent, particularly in the re-emergence of popular
   mobilisation in both the UK and Chile.},

Abstract = {Many studies have been conducted to determine the conditions that
   contribute to the satisfactory outcome of decision-making processes in
   governance networks. In this article, we explore how the interaction of
   three such conditions - network complexity, network management, and
   stakeholder involvement - results in stakeholder satisfaction. We use
   fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis - a relatively new approach
   in public administration research - to systematically compare the
   decision-making processes and outcomes of 14 Dutch spatial planning
   projects. Our analysis points to three combinations that result in
   stakeholder satisfaction: network complexity combined with adaptive
   management; stakeholder involvement combined with adaptive management;
   and low complexity combined with both limited stakeholder involvement
   and closed network management.},

Abstract = {The article adapts and applies the governing through crime framework to
   analyse the EU and Office of the High Representative (OHR) as
   international governing actors in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Limited,
   ambiguous and opportunistic use of techniques associated with governing
   through crime are most evident in relation to OHR, but only as one of a
   wider range of governing logics, and are linked to specific challenges
   of legitimation. The outward spread of criminal justice models and
   metaphors proposed by Simon is shown to be problematic in light of the
   breadth of activities that such a stance might admit to the framework.},

Title = {Blue helmets as targets: A quantitative analysis of rebel violence
   against peacekeepers, 1989-2003},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {50},

Abstract = {A majority of UN peacekeeping operations deployed to civil wars face
   violent attacks by rebel groups. To date, the academic study of this
   type of violence has been very limited. This article is a first attempt
   to fill this gap. In particular, I aim to examine why rebel groups fight
   against peacekeepers in some cases, while not in others. I argue that
   since peacekeepers are mostly impartial but not neutral, they become an
   actor in a conflict and tend to protect the weaker side from total
   defeat. This implies that on the one hand, relatively weaker rebels will
   seek protection from the government by peacekeepers. On the other hand,
   relatively stronger rebels will challenge the peacekeepers in order to
   restrict their behavior and/or make them withdraw. If stronger rebels
   are successful in targeting the peacekeepers and the peacekeepers
   withdraw or alter their behavior, a victory for these rebel groups
   should become easier. Using novel data on violence against UN
   peacekeepers, I find that indeed, stronger rebel groups are more likely
   to fight against peacekeepers.},

Title = {Centralism and Decentralized Aspirations in the Organization of the
   Chilean School System: 1980-2011},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},

Abstract = {The text describes the tension between centralization-decentralization
   in Chile, in order to maintain that the process of nation formation,
   having its origin in local identities, will end being concurrent with
   the consolidation of centralism. Given this context, the education
   system has been dependent on this centralizing tendency to the extent
   that it has been affected by the political, social and economic
   concentration, which has had an impact on its ability to respond to the
   development required by the different regions of the country.
   In this sense, the article. addresses the proposed problem from three
   perspectives. First, it reviews the presence of decentralizing trends in
   national political history, emphasizing the gradual establishment of
   centralism. Second, it analyzes the question of centralism within the
   framework of the changes in the Chilean educational system from the
   beginning of the civil-military dictatorship, suggesting the
   relationship between municipalization and privatization. It considers
   the effect of centralization on the education system in terms of its
   operating conditions, the heterogeneity of its territory and parts of
   its background relating to the characteristics of the educational
   offerings for the community. Finally, this paper concludes with a debate
   on the proposed hypothesis.
   The document seeks to demonstrate the priority of centralism in the
   organization of the country; the article relates this to the
   characteristics of the national education system and argues that the
   policy of educational decentralization of Chile is deconcentration and
   privatization.},

Abstract = {The concept of everyday making has become a powerful influence on
   activists and academics looking for ways to transcend neoliberalism. For
   everyday makers, democratic and egalitarian spaces are created in the
   cracks and fissures of power by deciding, in the first place, to act
   differently. Drawing on Marx's theory of capital and crisis, this paper
   rejects the choice between everyday and systemic perspectives.The
   challenges today are threefold: how to rollback the market,
   understanding how community and workplace struggles reinforce one
   another, and grasping the dynamics of scale: the systemic implications
   of everyday struggles and vice-versa.},

Abstract = {This article examines civil war resolution as a process comprised of
   multiple interdependent stages. It engages directly the idea that peace
   emerges only as a process comprised of battle, negotiation, agreement,
   and implementation of an agreement. I hypothesize that events at earlier
   stages of the peace process have implications for later stages, but not
   always in the same ways. Drawing on bargaining models of war, I consider
   how two factors that might prevent successful bargainingstalemates and
   the number of actorscan encourage cooperation early in a peace process
   but impede lasting cooperation at later stages. Using a nested
   dichotomies statistical approach to capture interdependence, I find
   support for the argument that stalemates and the number of actors have
   different effects depending on the stage of the peace process. The
   results substantiate the need in theoretical and policy work to consider
   peace as an interdependent, sequential process.},

Abstract = {In the last decade, a growing number of organizations worldwide have
   started reporting on issues concerning their economic, social and
   environmental behaviour. However, public administrations show a delay in
   this regard although there is growing interest from citizens regarding
   sustainability transparency. This paper contributes to intra-country
   analyses of non-fmancial reporting in the public sector by studying
   transparency concerning sustainability in municipalities; it analyses
   the coherence between societal values, identified using Hofstede's
   cultural dimensions, and local governments' corporate social
   responsibility disclosures. We undertook a content analysis of 101
   Colombian, Portuguese and Spanish local government websites and employed
   different graphical and statistical techniques to analyse the extent of
   disclosure and the relationship with societal expectations of
   transparency. The results showed several thematic differences between
   countries in disclosure preferences relating to societal cultural values
   of collectivism, femininity, tolerance and equity. Countries with
   equilibrium in all cultural values are more transparent; those with a
   prevalence of masculine and uncertainty avoidance cultural dimensions
   are particularly oriented to social perspectives and show a higher
   preference for strategic and economic information.},

Abstract = {The Trade Related Intellectual Property Agreement (TRIPS) has had a
   profound effect on industrialization and innovation, as well as access
   to medicines in cases of public health crisis such as HIV/AIDS. However,
   compliance with TRIPS has varied in developing countries, despite
   heightened international pressure. For instance, Brazil has pursued a
   coherent approach to its HIV/AIDS health crisis, while India has failed
   to take care of its HIV patients despite late compliance with the TRIPS
   agreement and the presence of business firms that produce the generic
   medicines for HIV/AIDS. This article suggests that divergence in TRIPS
   compliance is the result of a linkage politics, in which global
   variables ( global rules, global supply chains and global networks)
   reach into the domestic political economy to alter the interests and
   capabilities of domestic actors. Indian pharmaceutical firms have
   developed external and export interests that lower incentives for the
   Indian state to design a nationally relevant public health policy, while
   the Brazilian health movement with its societal and external linkages
   puts pressure on the Brazilian state to defend the interests of its HIV
   patients even at the cost of patents. We conclude by suggesting that
   linkage politics is better at helping us understand compliance with
   international agreements than existing explanations, with important
   consequences for the effectiveness of international institutions.},

Abstract = {Unlike many other social sciences, international relations (IR) spend
   relatively little time assessing the impact of the nineteenth century on
   its principal subject matter. As a result, the discipline fails to
   understand the ways in which a dramatic reconfiguration of power during
   the ``long nineteenth century{''} served to recast core features of
   international order. This article examines the extent of this lacuna and
   establishes the ways in which processes of industrialization, rational
   state-building, and ideologies of progress served to destabilize
   existing forms of order and promote novel institutional formations. The
   changing character of organized violence is used to illustrate these
   changes. The article concludes by examining how IR could be
   rearticulated around a more pronounced engagement with the global
   transformation.},

Abstract = {According to the political business cycle literature,
   survival-maximizing leaders will manipulate whatever macroeconomic
   policy instruments they have at their disposal in order to retain power.
   However, an obvious implication of the political business cycle
   literature has not previously been adequately tested: does having the
   ability to manipulate macroeconomic policy instruments actually allow
   leaders to stay in office longer? We argue that elected leaders who have
   neither fiscal nor monetary instruments available for electoral purposes
   will find it more difficult to survive in office. We test this claim
   using data from 19 OECD countries in the latter part of the twentieth
   century when the degree of capital mobility in the international economy
   was high. We find that access to macroeconomic instruments does help
   leaders retain office, but that these instruments are only effective for
   leaders who have been in office for at least 7 years.},

Abstract = {Socially acceptable behavior of mothers bereaved by the death of their
   soldier-child is a key political issue, particularly in societies at
   war. When grieving mothers are militarized and accept their fate quietly
   and with dignity, they support the war effort. On the contrary, if they
   challenge the legitimacy of the war and criticize the government for the
   death of their child, they are an important support to anti-war
   movements. This article focuses on grieving mothers in Canada and
   Quebec. It is first based on an analysis of the place of mourning
   mothers during Remembrance Day ceremonies. It then looks at the
   controversy that arises after the publication of an anti-war video
   capsule by the Federation des femmes du Quebec. The conclusion of this
   study is that grieving mothers in Canada are militarized. In spite of
   Quebec's supposed antimilitarist and pacifist tradition, such is the
   case even in Quebec.},

Abstract = {The dynamics by which policy ideas rise and fall can be linked to the
   intimate interactions between discrete physical time dimensions, such as
   policy windows, and distinctive perceptions of time, particularly the
   connections made between past, present and future in the form of
   narratives. Kingdon describes how an idea whose time has come' can be
   carried forward in the key policy change instrument of a policy window,
   but much remains to be understood about the dynamics of windows,
   including why they apparently open for a relatively short time period,
   and the significance of the legacy left by windows in terms of their
   ability to influence later events. The article seeks a greater
   understanding of these dynamics through an examination of the
   potentially vital role played by the construction of narratives. The
   case study is taken from the politically sensitive area of urban road
   pricing, in the form of the London Congestion Charge.},

Abstract = {This study puts forward a leadership-centred explanation of
   parliamentary party unity in new democracies, which departs from more
   common approaches that emphasise the effects of exogenous variables on
   rank-and-file legislator behaviour. By analysing party unity in the
   first two legislative sessions (1977-79, 1979-82) of Spain's nascent
   democracy, the study demonstrates that the Spanish parties manifested
   very high levels of voting unity. It argues that in order to understand
   party unity it is critical to examine party leadership goals and
   incentives; and it places leadership choices at the centre of the
   analysis.},

Abstract = {The theory of fiscal federalism asserts that fiscal decentralization
   increases government effectiveness, reduces government budgets, and
   reduces corruption when used as a means of government reform. However,
   counter-arguments have been made that such an approach has diverging
   effects according to the level of national development. We have
   attempted herein to carry out an empirical analysis to examine these
   theories. Data from 17 developed and 17 developing states were obtained
   in order to conduct a regression analysis of various indicators. The
   results revealed that fiscal decentralization reduced government
   effectiveness in developed countries. Important determinants for
   government effectiveness were the quality of regulation and the rule of
   law. When responsibility for expenditure and revenue were devolved,
   budgets expanded in both developed and developing countries. Fiscal
   decentralization deterred corruption in advanced states, whereas greater
   autonomy in spending increased malfeasance in the developing world.},

Volume = {46},

Abstract = {The article focuses on Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries'
   experiences related to Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, three non-European
   theatres of Western military operations, in predominantly Muslim lands,
   in the decade between 2001 and 2011. CEE countries readily became
   involved in two of these foreign missions (Afghanistan and Iraq) because
   of their deep ties to Western politico-economic structures, without
   direct security interests compelling them to do so, but not without
   normative convictions regarding what were seen by them as virtues of the
   two missions. In Libya, however, they were reluctant to join the Western
   intervention. In light of this, the article is interested in examining
   how political elites within the region relate to the generally
   constrained security policy agency that they have. A key argument
   advanced is that such agency may be located in how external hegemony is
   mediated in elite discourses of threat and legitimacy construction. This
   as well as the three case studies outlined in the article show that the
   seeming changes in CEE countries' behaviour in fact boil down to a
   simple set of rules guiding their behaviour. Having identified this
   ``algorithm{''} as an implicit pattern of CEE foreign policy behaviour,
   originating in the intra-alliance security dilemma within the North
   Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), the article formulates its
   conclusions about the alliance policy of these countries largely within
   a neorealist framework. (C) 2013 The Regents of the University of

Abstract = {This article introduces the Continent of International Law (COIL)
   research project on international agreement design. COIL stems from the
   conviction that the International Organization subfield's focus on the
   couple hundred international organizations with physical headquarters
   had to be broadened to include the tens of thousands extant
   international agreements, that is, international law. Each piece of
   international law can and should be studied as an institution. Together,
   this set of institutions, which truly is a continent, is theoretically
   very interesting and empirically very diversified. COIL's basic
   theoretical premise is that international agreement design and
   comparison across agreements begins by understanding the underlying
   cooperation problem(s) the agreements are trying to solve. COIL
   identifies 12 distinct and recurrent cooperation problems, which may
   occur alone or in combinations. The data collection features a random
   sample of international agreements conditional on the issue areas of
   economics, environment, human rights, and security. The first large-n,
   systematic operationalization of the cooperation problems underlying
   real international agreements is highlighted, and descriptive statistics
   are presented - some of which challenge conventional wisdom. For
   instance, enforcement problems (Prisoner's Dilemma-like situations) are
   important, but far from universal, with 30\% of the agreements
   characterized by that underlying problem. The numerous and diverse COIL
   variables allow for a multi-dimensional operationalization of the
   difficult-to-measure concept of the incomplete contract. Hypotheses from
   contract theory are tested, confirming the appropriateness of the new
   measure, the weakness of measures based on number of pages, and most
   significant, the rationality and efficiency of the continent of
   international law.},

Abstract = {Narrative Policy Framework (NPF) is a new and maturing theory of the
   policy process that takes a systematic, scientific approach to
   understanding the social construction of policy realities. As such, NPF
   serves as a bridge between postpositivists, who assert that public
   policymaking is contextualized through narratives and social
   construction, and positivists, who contend that legitimacy is grounded
   in falsifiable claims. The central questions of NPF are: What is the
   empirical role of policy narratives in the policy process and do policy
   narratives influence policy outcomes? First, the contributions of NPF
   scholarship at three levels of analysis-micro, meso, and macro-are
   examined. Next, necessary conditions of a policy narrative are
   specified, accompanied by detailed discussion of the narrative
   components: narrative elements, narrative strategies, and policy
   beliefs. Finally, an empirical illustration of NPF-a case study of Cape
   Wind's proposal to install wind turbines off Nantucket-is presented.
   Although intercoalitional differences have long been studied in the NPF
   scholarship, this is the first study to examine intracoalitional
   cohesion or the extent to which a coalition tells the same story across
   narrative elements, narrative strategies, and policy beliefs. NPF is a
   new approach to the study of the policy process that offers empirical
   pathways to better speculating the role of narrative in the policy
   process.},

Abstract = {Collective guilt from harm one's group has caused an out-group is often
   undermined because people minimize or legitimize the harm done (i.e.,
   they generate exonerating cognitions). When a group action has harmed
   both the in-group and an out-group, focusing people on self-harmways in
   which the in-group has harmed itselfmay elicit more collective guilt
   because self-harm is less likely to be exonerated. In Study 1, American
   participants who focused on how the invasion of Iraq had harmed the
   United States expressed greater collective guilt over harm inflicted on
   the people of Iraq than those who focused on Iraqi suffering. Study 2
   showed that this effect is due to reductions in exonerating cognitions
   among people focused on self-harm. We consider the implications of these
   findings for intergroup reconciliation, particularly in situations where
   two groups have been involved in open conflict.},

Title = {Effective Governance of Global Financial Markets: an Evolutionary Plan
   for Reform},

Abstract = {Two questions remain widely open when it comes to global financial
   markets. First, what is the raison d'etre of open global markets?
   Second, is it possible to foster open markets without an international
   governance structure supervising them? Post-crisis regulatory reform
   presents an acute paradox. While the content of international financial
   regulation is changing rapidly, the reform of governance structures is
   painfully slow. There is no formal governance structure dealing with
   cross-border supervision of global financial institutions. In addition,
   there is no crystallized institutional capacity at the international
   level dealing with cross-border crises and the resolution of global
   institutions. Other areas of concern are the global supervision of
   systemic risk and the absence of a reliable finance research watchdog
   dealing with the production of regulatory standards. This article
   outlines an international governance framework to deal effectively with
   these concerns. The adoption of the proposed plan would lead to breaking
   down the territorial link in the supervision of large financial
   institutions and of systemic risk, without causing intolerable loss of
   sovereignty. In addition, the proposed structure is premised on a set of
   explicit values. These would provide a strong signal to global markets
   that they need to shift their focus from speculation to development
   goals.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an overview of the principal events affecting the
   relationship between Mexico and China, in order to explain the
   deterioration it underwent in 2012. It begins with a look at the
   foundations of Mexico's foreign policy, set out in the National
   Development Plan, before turning to trade relations, characterized by
   increasing trade, Mexico's growing trade deficit, negotiations on
   safeguards and the reaction of the affected sectors in Mexico.
   Subsequently, the text presents the diplomatic interactions and
   disagreements, and finally reviews aspects of the perceptions each
   country holds of the other that may affect the state of their relations.},

Abstract = {Despite the far-reaching liberalization of the French banking system
   over the past quarter century, French banks suffered far less in the
   international financial crisis (20072009) than banks in the United
   Kingdom and Germany. However, the French system also suffered far moreat
   least in the first stages of the crisisthan the banking systems of
   Southern Europe. By several measures, French banks were world leaders in
   financial innovation, and the French banking system was highly exposed
   to international market movements. The limited impact of the crisis,
   however, owed to the specificities of French market-based banking.
   Deliberate state action over the two decades prior to the crisis created
   a specific kind of banking system and encouraged forms of financial
   innovation, the unintentional consequence of which was the limited
   exposure to the securitization that caused the damage wrought during the
   financial crisis.},

Abstract = {A central purpose of performance management reforms such as the Bush
   administration's Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) is to promote the
   use of performance information in federal agencies. But reforms
   initiated by partisan political actors may be pursued differently, and
   may face relatively more obstacles, in agencies whose programs or
   personnel are associated with divergent political ideologies. Using data
   from a survey of federal agency managers, our analysis indicates that
   the impact of PART on managers' use of performance information is
   largely contingent on the political ideology of the agencies in which
   managers work. Managers involved with the PART review process report
   greater performance information use than those not involved if they work
   in politically moderate and, especially, conservative agencies. However,
   there is no such difference in liberal agencies between those involved
   and those not involved with PART reviews. Supplementary analyses provide
   some evidence that these results are attributable to the PART review
   process itself, as opposed to inherent differences in the extent to
   which programs administered by liberal and conservative agencies lend
   themselves to performance management.},

Abstract = {International development cooperation is a foreign policy instrument
   used by nations with processes and impacts that depend on the make up of
   the regulations and institutions charged with its implementation. In the
   final year of Calderon's term in office the International Development
   Cooperation Law was adopted. These regulations oblige the Mexican
   government to put in place a number of entities to bolster the
   institutional nature and impact of this tool. The aim of this paper,
   based on institutional theory, is to evaluate Mexico's international
   development cooperation under President Felipe Calderon, analyzing the
   most representative actions and characteristics and drawing attention to
   the legal and institutional transformations that have taken place since
   the new law entered into force.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes new challenges in the field of ambient air
   protection, such as the use of new energy-generating products, and
   assesses the air quality protection responsibilities of local
   communities in European Union (EU) Member States. Domestic heating
   systems are a major source of air pollution. Thus, chimney-sweeping
   services are very important and must be regulated to provide fire safety
   and guarantee better ambient air quality. This paper analyzes Slovenian
   legislation regulating chimney-sweeping services and compares the
   Slovenian laws with comparable laws of other European countries and the
   national laws of EU Member States to examine the laws' effectiveness in
   regulating and protecting air quality. More specifically, the paper uses
   legal and economic analyses to examine the efficiency of current
   legislation pertaining to chimney-sweeping services. The paper concludes
   that, consistent with theories of asymmetric information and negative
   externalities, licensing would be more effective in meeting the
   challenges of ambient air protection than current exclusive concession
   agreements, which effectively establish geographical monopolies in
   chimney-sweeping services.},

Abstract = {This article explores Tanzania's experience of industrial policy since
   independence through the concept of the political settlement. Higher
   growth in manufacturing since 1996 has been seen as a vindication of
   neoliberal policies of market liberalisation. Yet, the neoliberal
   approach fails to take account of the important legacy of state-led
   industrialisation under socialism and aspects of the political economy
   of the state in Tanzania that explain some of the longer-term
   constraints on industrialisation. Critical aspects of Tanzania's
   political settlement relate to state-capital relations and the
   distribution of power between contenting factions of intermediate
   classes within the state.},

Abstract = {This article offers a controversial argument, namely that a utopian
   approach adds something valuable to the study of politics. I develop
   this position by showing how utopian fiction and experimentation can
   contribute to a recent debate in environmental politics; the call for a
   democracy that includes nature'. I argue that a utopian approach has
   limits for example, it cannot provide all the answers or offer
   blueprints for a perfect world but that it can create spaces in which to
   imagine a different and better political relationship. Simply put, a
   utopian approach can shift the parameters of what is conceivable.},

Abstract = {This article explores those factors that shape a political
   organization's choice of tactics in political mobilization with a
   particular focus on the influence of gender ideology on the choice of
   different type of contentious action. To understand why political
   organizations engaging in contentious politics choose to employ violent
   tactics, nonviolent tactics, or a mixture of both, current scholarship
   has tended to focus on factors such as relationship with the government,
   external support, and religious or leftist ideology. Far less attention
   has been given to the role of an organization's ideology relating to
   gender when predicting its behavior. In addition, much of the analysis
   of contentious activity has analyzed the use of violence or protest
   separately and rarely examines the choice of a mixed strategy. We employ
   a time-series multinomial logistic regression analysis to examine the
   Middle East Minorities at Risk Organizational Behavior dataset (MAROB),
   including data over 24 years on 104 ethno-political organizations that
   have used a range of tactics including protest, violence, and/or a mix
   of the two, to investigate organizational and state-level variables that
   lead organizations to choose different strategies. We find that a number
   of variables can influence a movement's choice to engage in one strategy
   over another. Gender-inclusive ideology makes an organization more
   likely to engage in protest and less likely to choose a violent or mixed
   strategy.},

Abstract = {Many governments have implemented environmental justice mandates
   requiring agencies to consider the implications of cleanup decisions for
   poor and/or minority populations. To the extent that this mandate alters
   decisions, it usually does so by considering the composition of a
   community in the present without adjusting for potential demographic
   changes that may occur over time. However, communities change and these
   changes are likely to affect how well an agency meets its environmental
   justice mandate over the long term. In this research, an agent-based
   model is introduced to simulate how alternative environmental
   remediation scenarios may affect environmental justice outcomes in a
   dynamic residential environment with two demographic classes with
   preferences for living in proximity to neighbors similar to themselves.
   Under these circumstances, there is unlikely to be one best strategy to
   achieve both environmental improvement and environmental equity, and a
   focus on valuable land is the least effective over the long run.},

Title = {Reassessing the concept of policy termination: the case of regional

Abstract = {The concept of policy termination is regaining currency as governments
   reassess policy commitments and budgets amidst the global financial and
   economic crisis. What factors affect the decision to terminate a
   specific policy? Are some policies more susceptible to termination than
   others? This article addresses these questions using a case study of
   regional policy in England where, following a change in UK government in
   2010, the institutional and policy basis for regional economic policy
   has been overhauled. It assesses whether these changes amount to a case
   of policy termination and explores the factors that have influenced
   policy change. Based on one of the few non-US cases, it tests the
   validity of theoretical frameworks that have been employed for
   analysing, categorising and explaining policy termination and draws
   conclusions on the power of these frameworks to account sufficiently for
   the processes of policy change observed.},

Abstract = {On 5 July 2009, the capital city of China's Xinjiang Province exploded
   in violence. The riots that took place on that summer's day in Xinjiang
   should have come as no surprise. Although things usually appear calm on
   the surface in Xinjiang, deep down there is tremendous discontent and
   resentment among Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim group. The Chinese
   government needs to ask itself what caused such a horrific event to take
   place. If not, 5 July 2009 will be a prelude of what is to come. As of
   now, Xinjiang is not a place where terrorists or people with extremist
   views have a stronghold, but if the government continues in the same
   direction, it may produce people who espouse such views. This article
   will examine how the roots of Uighur rage are found in Beijing's
   long-established anti-Uighur policies, which are based on the idea of
   Han superiority.},

Abstract = {This article provides an overview of the practice and study of civil
   resistance. First, historical roots of modern civil resistance are
   discussed, including the emergence in the 19th century of mass-based
   campaigns of non-cooperation to promote nationalist and labor interests,
   as well as the significance of Mohandas Gandhi and the widespread use of
   nonviolent resistance in the 20th century. Second, perspectives of
   scholars of social movements and revolution are compared with those of
   scholars who focus more specifically on nonviolent resistance. Despite
   studying much of the same phenomena, separate literatures have developed
   that are ripe for cross-fertilization and synthesis. In the third
   section, a literature review is organized around three key concepts for
   understanding civil resistance: mobilization, resilience, and leverage.
   Fourth, consequences of nonviolent resistance relative to violent
   resistance are discussed. Finally, areas for future research are
   identified.},

Abstract = {This article looks at the long struggle to reform the Dutch disability
   insurance fund, which covered close to 10\% of the labor force in 2002.
   Ideas played a strategic role in the framing and discourse of the policy
   reforms. A template propagated by the European Commission was used by
   center-left reform advocates to soften a neoliberal campaign to overhaul
   the disability insurance scheme. Center-left politicians used European
   deliberations to convince their colleagues to accept increased spending
   on activation programs rather than rely on rounds of cutbacks. Labor
   market activation also resonated with voters, for very different
   reasons. Voters in the 2000s rallied around activation in order to bar
   ethnic minorities from taking advantage of the disability program. By
   the time that the disability law was repealed in 2006, many voters had
   altered their minds about the disability fund, resenting the fact that
   problematic minorities lived off welfare state benefits.},

Abstract = {The coalition government has implemented welfare-to-work policies
   strengthening the UK's Work First model of activating claimants of
   disability or incapacity benefits (IBs). These reforms abolished the
   Condition Management Programme (CMP) established under the preceding
   government's Pathways to Work (PtW) initiative to assist people on IBs
   to cope with health problems. We argue that IB claimants face complex
   health limitations, and a renewal of CMP provision will be necessary if
   they are to be assisted towards improved health and employability.
   Accordingly, we review the impacts of the PtW CMPs operating between
   2003 and 2011, in order to identify good practice and lessons for future
   policy.},

Abstract = {The added value of self-organized policy networks is widely recognized,
   but how they impact outcomes is less well understood. This article
   extends the existing literature on networks and collaborative
   performance by analyzing the effect of network capital on policy
   outcomes in a developing country, Nepal. A study of the collaborative
   Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program (RWSSP) in Nepal shows that
   village communities' success in getting RWSSP funds for their projects
   depends on their ties to a greater number of organizational partners for
   resources and know-how, and particularly to bridging partners that can
   also draw on experiences from a wider range of other communities.
   Communities are also successful when they secure credible support from a
   more cohesive subgroup of organizational partners that have considerable
   overlap in the projects they do share. Thus, direct ties to a broader
   set of organizational partners and indirect reach to other communities
   lead to better performance but so does the greater cohesion among the
   partners who tend to share the same set of community projects. Since
   partner selection inevitably imposes a trade-off between indirect reach
   and cohesion, a balanced strategy that accounts for both features
   appears important for developing network capital.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade there has been an explosion in literature on
   imperialism and international law. This scholarship has focused on the
   use of force, especially humanitarian intervention and the war on
   terror. These accounts foreground the issue of race, arguing that these
   legal arguments reproduce the dynamic of the civilising mission. This
   article argues that such analyses miss some key elements. Contemporary
   interventions must be counterposed to the First Iraq War, which was
   enabled through the uncontroversial authorization of the Security
   Council. Humanitarian intervention and the war on terror emerged in
   reaction to the fear that other states would veto Security Council
   resolutions. Consequently, the racial' discourse around intervention
   cannot simply be read as othering' the peripheries, but was also a
   response to inter-imperialist rivalry. The article then advances a
   conception of the arguments as an attempt to articulate hegemonic
   coalitions against emerging rivalries, and reads racialization in this
   light.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},

Volume = {50},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {While transitional justice interventions are common in current
   post-conflict transitions, recent surveys in such settings suggest that
   public opinions often vary in their levels of support for such policies.
   Understanding such opinions is crucial for designing post-conflict
   policies that properly reflect public interests. This study uses
   original survey data from Burundi to interpret public opinions toward
   transitional justice policies in a post-civil war context. The data
   reveal a great deal of wariness among Burundians toward punishing human
   rights offenders or seeking the truth about the past. Why would large
   numbers of those entitled to accountability and truth express a
   preference to `forgive and forget'? This question is addressed by
   focusing on two important features of post-conflict settings - namely
   (1) uncertainty about the potential for renewed violence and (2) intense
   competition over how the postwar balance of power should be
   institutionalized. Findings suggest that the latter feature is indeed
   crucial: deep partisan motivations associated primarily with ethnicity,
   and to a lesser extent region, are key determinants of expressed desires
   to forgive and forget. A reasonable interpretation is that a sense of
   political gain may compensate for debts owed due to past abuses and
   induce a preference to avoid the pursuit of truth or punishment lest the
   political gains somehow be threatened. The conclusion draws out
   implications for policy and further research.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes multilateral aid allocation in the European Union
   (EU). We argue that EU members can influence the aid allocation process
   toward their national interests if they form powerful coalitions that
   bias the European Commission's development policies. When EU members'
   preferences over aid allocation are heterogeneous, the Commission can
   implement multilateral aid according to its programmatic goals. Greater
   homogeneity of EU members' goals, however, increases the likelihood that
   members can form powerful interest coalitions and induce the Commission
   to allocate aid according to their own national interests. The empirical
   analysis provides robust support for our theoretical argument, and the
   findings generally indicate that interest coalitions play an important
   role in multilateral aid allocation.},

Abstract = {The EU's political system represents European citizens via three
   different channels: through the European Parliament; indirectly through
   their governments in the Council; and through domestic elections, which
   hold these last democratically accountable to national parliaments or
   citizens. However, these channels involve different and incompatible
   types of representation and forms of democracy, reflecting divergent
   conceptions of political community which, following Philip Pettit, we
   term solidarism, singularism and civicity respectively. The first
   channel seeks to represent the common good of a European people; the
   second the mutual self-interest of the single member states. We argue
   the first lacks social and political legitimacy, while the second proves
   insufficient to tackle collective European problems equitably or
   effectively. We propose reinforcing the third channel so as to modify
   these other two and produce a European demoi-cracy able to sustain the
   form of representative democracy we associate with a civicity. We
   contend such a system fosters an ever closer Union among the peoples of
   Europe by allowing the construction of shared policies that treat the
   different demoi with equal concern and respect.},

Abstract = {Trial by jury is under threat. This is particularly true in the context
   of terrorism. This article will explore the benefits of trial by jury to
   civil society. It will then consider whether those benefits should give
   rise to a presumption in favour of jury trial in the terrorism context.
   Historically, the right to trial by jury has been interfered with on the
   basis that the threat of terrorism justified an exceptional response.
   This article will argue that the state of exception arising from states'
   responses to terrorism in fact demands the retention of trial by jury.},

Abstract = {Since 2008 the response to Somali piracy has been highly decentralised.
   Criticisms have been made of the seemingly low rate of piracy
   prosecutions and centralised solutions, such as an international piracy
   court, proposed. This article explores the role of the Contact Group on
   Piracy off the Coast of Somalia's Working Group 2 (WG2) as a mechanism
   involved in coordinating piracy prosecutions. It reviews the applicable
   international law and available options. It suggests that WG2 has had a
   discernible influence in promoting the decentralised use of national
   courts over the creation of a stand-alone international piracy court. It
   then reflects on WG2 as an example of a new governance' coordination
   mechanism.},

Abstract = {In this article I assess the views of the European Commission on key
   subjects related to Europe's economic governance. My examination is
   framed by a close reading of two documents, one issued in 1962 ('the
   Action Programme for the Second Stage') and the other in 2008 ('EMU@10:
   successes and challenges after ten years of Economic and Monetary
   Union'). The resulting comparison reveals a pattern of intellectual
   flexibility on certain policy issues combined with almost dogmatic
   commitments on others. For example, the views expressed by the
   Commission regarding financial liberalization have changed significantly
   over the past half century; at the same time the Commission has insisted
   tenaciously on the necessity of moving towards (or later consolidating)
   a European monetary union. The nature of this pattern, and especially
   the defense of the same policy prescription under radically different
   circumstances, suggests a deeply-felt commitment rather than a reasoned
   analysis.},

Abstract = {The British government recently proposed to replace the House of Lords
   with an upper house that is largely elected by proportional
   representation. Could such a reform paradoxically pose a threat to
   Westminster-style democracy? Australian experience provides one of the
   best guides to the likely consequences. Australia not only has over 100
   years experience of an elected federal Senate, but it also has over 150
   years experience of upper house reforms in the various state
   parliaments. These state parliaments, though rarely discussed, provide
   good comparative reference points for understanding the likely effects
   of Lords reform. Australian parliamentary history suggests six main
   lessons about the potential dangers of these British proposals. It also
   points to the importance of properly considering the option of
   abolishing the upper house, and it highlights the main democratic
   safeguards that need to be put in place if an elected second chamber is
   introduced.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {50},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {38-56},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Liberal internationalism represents a package of evolving and contending
   commitments, and this article traces the development within it of one
   practice with a longer history, namely the allocation of special
   responsibilities. Responsibilities are those things for which actors are
   held accountable and, internationally, these have negotiated between
   sovereign equality and material inequality, in search of a means of more
   effectively dealing with global problems. The definition of these
   responsibilities generates an intense politics and these are reviewed
   through the remit of the Security Council. The article considers the
   basis for the allocation of traditional special responsibilities for
   security to the Council and then tracks their extension in recent years
   to the issue of humanitarian protection. The vehicle for this has been
   the transformation of a practice about the use of the veto, towards one
   that calls for its non-use in humanitarian cases. This analysis of
   special responsibilities unsettles the separation between order and
   justice, and points to the challenges currently facing liberal
   internationalism. International Politics (2013) 50, 38-56.

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Over the last decade the family and family-centred policies and
   practices have received increasing attention within the public service
   agenda, culminating in the emphatic instruction to `think family'
   individually, collectively and institutionally. This has occurred at a
   time when the sociology of the family has increasingly emphasised the
   difficulties of thinking family in a coherent way. In this article we
   explore this agenda through an examination of the representational tools
   with which public service professionals and managers have been recently
   equipped. We conclude by questioning the adequacy of these tools for
   effectively representing family relations.},

   bilateralism establishes a successful cooperation model, the
   characteristics of which benefited both the Franco-German couple as the
   itinerary of the European Union itself. The foreign policy of Paris and
   Berlin made domestic politics in Europe, inspires the architecture of
   the common foreign and security policy, whose development began only
   with the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009, and whose operational barriers
   remain. The text of treaties echoes the Franco-German partnership and
   records the remaining institutional overlays.},

   environmental policy-making},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {113-131},
Abstract = {The article examines the informal division of labour in the European
   Union's (EU's) external environmental policy-making. It focuses on
   informal arrangements in the EU co-ordination and representation
   processes with regard to the United Nations Commission on Sustainable
   Development (CSD) and international climate negotiations. Whereas the
   rotating Presidency is formally in charge of leading the internal EU
   co-ordination and representing the EU externally, we see that in
   practice an informal system is used, in which member states and
   Commission officials informally `take the lead'. Based upon
   new-institutionalist insights, this article argues that four functional
   reasons explain the informality in the EU's external environmental
   policy-making: burden sharing; expertise pooling; involving member
   states; and guaranteeing continuity. Moreover, once the informal
   arrangement is in place, actors in the EU keep using it because they act
   path-dependently and because it is considered the most appropriate way
   to act in many international environmental negotiations.},

   FIRST CITY: THE LONG STRUGGLE FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN EMPOWERMENT IN
   SAVANNAH},

Abstract = {Purpose - The African American electorate in Savannah, Georgia, has a
   history of being managed and manipulated, but over a period of time it
   reached its full potential. This electorate evolved during the
   leadership of a white Democratic mayor who manipulated the increased
   number of black registered voters as a result of the 1965 Voting Rights
   Act (VRA) to maintain white empowerment in a majority black city. This
   struggle for power proves that national reforms do not always have the
   immediate consequences that national leaders hoped. This chapter
   explores how the African American electorate persevered and took
   advantage of the political mistakes of others to attain its empowerment
   at the mayoral level. This evolution of political mobilization and
   empowerment would culminate with the election of the city's first female
   African American mayor in 2011.
   Research design - We conduct a comparative analysis of election results
   over time.
   Findings - Federal intervention has been the most powerful and helpful
   to the African American electorate. However, while the Savannah African
   American electorate was managed and manipulated, such reforms were
   implemented in a gradual and limited manner. Hence, the rise of black
   mayoral power is the result of a lot of lucky political accidents due to
   a shrewd Democratic mayor who used the 1965 VRA to extend and maintain
   white empowerment in a majority African American urban city. Thus,
   national reforms do not always have the immediate consequences that
   national leaders hoped.},

Abstract = {Best practice in policymaking and institution-building for the
   deployment of grid-connected renewable energy (GCRE) can be found
   scattered throughout reports and policy papers of major international
   actors and in the discourse of policymakers and businesspeople. This
   article collects and systematizes a best practice model and portrays it
   as a sector-specific description of a liberal market economy (LME).
   Also, the article provides a comparison of China's policies and
   institutions for GCRE with best practice, finding that China's approach
   coincides with the latter only imperfectly. Divergences of the Chinese
   approach to GCRE as compared with the model can be explained, at least
   partially, in that best practice pertains to LMEs, and given that China
   is arguably not an LME. Hence, the particularities of China's approach
   to GCRE should be understood not as obstacles to renewables but as
   examples of regulatory and institutional diversity.},

Abstract = {This article is the first part of a study exploring the success and
   limits of external non-military coercion in intrastate conflict. This
   part seeks to understand the conditions and methods that made
   non-military coercion a useful conflict management strategy in the
   Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The study aims to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of non-military coercion as a reasonable alternative to
   military forms of intervention. Empirical data were drawn from a series
   of elite interviews and documentary accounts collected in three
   subsequent field trips. The analysis separates the conflict into three
   distinct phases, emergence, escalation and settlement, to illustrate the
   influence of coercion on the decision-making calculus of conflict
   participants, and outlines the coordinated use of positive inducements
   and pressures to portray the positive influence of non-military coercion
   on the de-escalation of interethnic violence.},

Abstract = {Pre-industrial China and Japan provide contrasting patterns in how
   transactions were conducted in the rural economy. Chinese peasants would
   exchange their products anonymously for cash at the nearest market,
   while transactions in rural Japan tended to be made among people who
   were well-acquainted through credit rather than currency. The case of
   early modern England, where ordinary people tended to make deferred
   payments by means of oral agreements, shows a similarity to the Japanese
   situation. This comparison suggests, in general terms, that currency and
   credit could combine to supply the total amount of means of payment
   needed in a region. However, commercial activities progressed in
   divergent ways: either through anonymous currency transactions or by
   means of chained debts among locals. Unlike currency-dominant systems,
   which tended to create plural units of account, credit-dominant systems
   made it easier to establish a monetary system based on a standard
   formula.},

Abstract = {While many of the contributions to this special issue focus on the
   content of internationalism and the dilemmas of ethical (state) action
   in world politics, this article focuses on the possibilities for
   internationalism to be meaningfully incorporated into state foreign
   policy. Here, my concern is with the extent to which a commitment to
   internationalism might be conceived as legitimate at the domestic level.
   In international relations, constructivists have come closest to
   directly addressing the domestic constraints and possibilities
   associated with foreign policy agenda. Theorists working in this
   tradition, however, have largely worked with binary logics
   (structure/agency, material/ideational, continuity/change) that
   emphasise one set of factors over another. Building on insights from the
   recent `practice turn' in international relations, this article employs
   the work of Pierre Bourdieu in an attempt to transcend these binaries
   and develop a more nuanced and sophisticated sociological. account of
   political possibility. I suggest the utility of his conceptions of
   field, habitus, capital and symbolic power in coming to terms with both
   possibilities for and limits to internationalism as a foreign policy
   orientation. I illustrate the utility of this framework with the example
   of Australia's retreat from internationalism under the Rudd Government
   from 2007 to 2010. International Politics (2013) 50, 97-117.

Series = {Palgrave Pivot},

Pages = {24-35},
Abstract = {The conflict in Northern Ireland is argued to be heavily rooted in
   issues surrounding national identity and group membership. Although
   group differences in Northern Ireland are not physiognomic, individuals
   in this society are capable of categorising one as being Catholic or
   Protestant based on social cues. Such identity categorisation is an
   important part of everyday life in Northern Ireland, where group symbols
   are highly salient. Chapter 3 presents national identity trends over
   recent years based on national surveys. It also focuses on the

Abstract = {Purpose - This chapter examines the shift in political leadership from
   white ethnics and African-Americans to Hispanic/Latino representation in
   city-wide offices. Specifically, we explore the electoral coalition that
   Angel Taveras constructed to become Providence, Rhode Island's first
   Latino mayor. This victory illustrates the continued strength of
   Hispanic/Latino political candidates in American politics.
   Design/method - Using public opinion survey data and a ward-by-ward
   analysis we provide a detailed breakdown of the type of voter Taveras
   appealed to and where these individuals reside.
   Findings - Taveras's win was anchored in the upper-income, white liberal
   wards of the city. In addition, he won in the old Irish and Italian
   wards now inhabited by African-Americans and Hispanic/Latino voters.
   Overall, the significant growth of the Hispanic/Latino community in
   Providence from 30 percent in 2000 to 38 percent in 2010 was pivotal to
   his victory.
   Originality/value - This chapter provides an in-depth examination of how
   a Latino candidate won in a Northeastern city that had been dominated by
   Irish and Italian political leaders. The coalition that Taveras
   constructed highlights how Latinos appeal to liberal white voters.
   Finally, Taveras's victory signals the continued political ascension and
   strength of the Hispanic/Latino community.},

Abstract = {The work of anarchist collectives in the film industry during the
   Spanish Civil War and the video documentaries of Grupo Alavio in
   post-2001 Argentina, as represented in two documentaries that attest to
   historical moments of worker self-management, shows historical and
   aesthetic intersections. Both were devoted to disseminating information
   counter to the official line of the mass media, and in neither was there
   a desire to take over the state; instead, the movements they represented
   denied the very legitimacy of the state. In the tradition of the Soviet
   filmmaker Dziga Vertov, both crafted meanings out of sequences of images
   of all kinds, and both paid homage to the masses awakening to social
   emancipation. Similarly to the Soviet film vanguard of the 1920s, both
   can be understood as organic parts of the transformations that they
   portrayed.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},
Pages = {40-63},
Abstract = {For some realists, cyber warfare is `old wine in new bottles', with
   marginal added value. This misses the larger possibilities for
   political/military chain reactions that cyber warfare may prompt,
   possibly leading to armed conflict. This article utilizes
   Offense-Defense theory to appraise the influence of cyber warfare on
   international security and the prospects for conflict. Offense-Defense
   theory, as applied here, better explains the relationship between
   technological innovation and international politics, and leads to
   different conclusions from other realist approaches. Redefining the
   Offense-Defense balance to accommodate cyberspace leads to an emphasis
   on the offensive advantages of cyber capabilities. The offensive and
   defensive cyber postures of China, Russia, the United States, and NATO
   are examined here to empirically assess the role of cyber warfare in
   security policy. Evidence shows that innovations in Information and
   Communication Technology (ICT) allow states to take greater risks and
   adopt more vigilant or offensive positions toward adversaries. Cyber
   capabilities do not cause armed conflict, but make decisions to escalate
   easier and cheaper. A strategic enabler that provides attackers greater
   freedom of action, cyber warfare is becoming a necessary condition for
   the conduct of war, even if it is not a sufficient one.},

Abstract = {`Interregionalism' emerged in international and regional studies as one
   of the theoretical responses to the profound changes that took place in
   the last decade of the twentieth century. It built on the revival of
   regionalism that spread mainly over the `triad' regions (Europe, North
   America, and East Asia) but went beyond and developed a distinct focus
   in international relations by creating a new theoretical framework which
   does not limit itself to explaining regional integration but rather
   explains a new phenomenon in international relations.
   After describing the emergence of interregionalism and its links to
   regionalism with a special emphasis on two continents, Europe and Latin
   America, this chapter will offer explanatory guidelines for explaining
   interregionalism, particularly several forms it can take as well as the
   unique functions and objectives that this new type of approach to
   international relations fulfils and its differences with both the
   mainstream international relation theories and the theories based on
   regionalism, that is, both `old' and `new'. In the third and final part,
   we will analyse the shortcomings of interregionalism in light of the
   difficulties it is confronted with at present and will also assess its
   scope in the future. Beyond the problems that interregionalism is
   currently experiencing (just as regionalism itself had experienced the
   same type of problems in the 1970s), it is here to stay since it is an
   essential tool for understanding the many novel forms of relations that
   are emerging in the era of globalisation.},

   EUROPE},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {91},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {448-468},
Abstract = {Policy-making is embedded in politics, but an increasing number of
   issues, like obesity, tobacco control, or road safety, do not map well
   on the major dimensions of political conflict. This article analyzes the
   enactment of restrictions on smoking in bars and restaurants in 29
   European countries-a conflictual issue which does not fit easily
   traditional party ideologies. Indeed, the comparative empirical analyses
   demonstrate that government ideological positions are not associated
   with the strictness and the timing of adoption of the smoking bans. On
   the other hand, economic factors like the scale of tobacco production in
   a country, smoking prevalence in society and public support for tough
   anti-smoking policy are all significantly related to the time it takes
   for a country to adopt smoking bans, and to the comprehensiveness and
   enforcement of these restrictions. In addition, horizontal policy
   diffusion is strongly implicated in the pattern of policy adoptions.},

Abstract = {Jamaat al-Adl wal-Ihsan, or the Justice and Spirituality Movement (JSM),
   is the largest oppositional movement in Morocco, which combines Islam
   and politics to mobilize against the monarchy for greater
   democratization in the country. JSM is neither a political Islamist
   movement nor a Sufi order but it combines spirituality and justice,
   piety and politics. This article examines how JSM combines spirituality
   and politics in practice by analyzing the religious authorization
   process with ethnographic data based on participant observation and
   interviews. It illustrates that JSM is able to combine spirituality and
   justice through its central activity of Majlis al-Nasiha. There are
   various practices involved in this biweekly gathering of members and
   novices such as rituals, informal talks, and also qas ru'ya, or the
   sharing of dreams and visions. This article argues that JSM is able to
   combine spirituality and politics through vision-sharing, which combines
   the mystical form of dreams with political content in the religious
   authorization process of JSM.},

Abstract = {The article focuses on a new political player: the Five Star Movement
   led by the comedian Beppe Grillo. The party lies at the junction between
   different organisational models and conceptions of democracy: it
   combines an online and an offline presence; it has horizontal'
   structural elements, but a top-down decision-making process; it is
   positioned beyond' ideologies, while its electorate comes from various
   political families. The work considers the history, message, leader,
   organisation and electoral base of the movement, as well as the
   political opportunity structure that facilitated its growth in 2012 and
   the challenges it faces in the delicate phase of institutionalisation.},

   of interlocking corporate directorships in the UK. Further, it
   investigates the characteristics of those individuals who obtain
   appointments as non-executive directors to the boards of FTSE-listed
   companies after service in parliament and/or government. The analysis
   uses data on board membership and pay in Britain for more than 700
   companies listed on the London Stock Exchange and over 7,500 directors
   and 1,000 former parliamentarians, government ministers and civil
   servants. The findings suggest that although this group is represented
   in the wider corporate network, these individuals are not more central
   than other directors and do not receive significantly different
   compensations once industry sector, experience and board role are
   controlled for. This article offers a novel insight into the
   interconnectedness of the public sphere and the corporate world.},

Abstract = {A number of recent studies argue that there is decline in armed conflict
   within and between nations. Gohdes and Price run against the grain in
   arguing that there is no evidence for a decrease in battle deaths in
   armed conflicts after World War II and that the trend reported in our
   earlier articles is spurious. However, they do not plausibly justify
   this thesis. We reexamine the argument for a decline, exploring
   nonlinearities in the data and potential biases due to measurement
   error. We find that very strong assumptions must hold in order for
   measurement errors to explain the trend in battle deaths.},

Journal = {BUSINESS AND POLITICS},

Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {493-527},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {What is the nature and extent of corporate leader involvement in
   American national politics? The results of a mail survey of nearly 100
   such individuals show that leaders are quite active, devoting an average
   of nearly 1 hour per day to national political activity. We also show
   that corporate leaders engage in a wide range of advocacy activities.
   Monetary activities loom particularly large in the political lives of
   American corporate leaders, as large numbers are approached by members
   of Congress for contributions, and many who are approached answer the
   call. In addition, we find that corporate leaders, unlike advocacy
   professionals, do a great deal of their advocacy work in private; for
   the most part they eschew public activities such as testifying before
   congressional committees. Speaking to the question of which leaders are
   most politically active, our data evince a strong relationship between
   firm political activity and firm leader political activity. In sum,
   politically active firms have politically active leaders. We thus
   contribute to the ongoing academic discussion of corporate political
   activity by showing that the CEO's office is an additional locus of
   political power within business firms, and that CEO political activity
   is instrumental rather than consumptive in nature.},
