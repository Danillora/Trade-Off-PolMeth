Abstract = {This article explores how differentiating between the concepts of state,
   regime, and government adds analytical purchase to our understanding of
   post-independent politics in the ex-Soviet Kyrgyz Republic. By looking
   at the ways in which the government, regime, and state interact, it aims
   to strengthen existing understandings of why early liberalisation was
   thwarted in this republic, presidential rule proved twice difficult to
   maintain, and why the republic continues to face an unaltered fragile
   balance between how power is divided and how it is infrastructurally and
   coercively exercised.},

Title = {Is compulsory voting a remedy? Evidence from the 2001 Polish
   parliamentary elections},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {29},

Pages = {499-520},
Abstract = {Voter turnout has been decreasing in modern democracies. This decline
   can be perceived as a challenge to democracy. Among the solutions
   proposed is compulsory voting, which according to many scholars is
   effective, but seems controversial at the same time. This paper
   considers the possible effects of the introduction of compulsory voting
   in Poland. Empirical analyses show that the introduction of compulsory
   voting would be an effective tool for boosting voter turnout in Poland.
   If Polish citizens had been forced to vote in the 2001 parliamentary
   elections, then the vast majority of non-voters would have participated
   in the elections. Voter turnout would have increased substantially as a
   consequence. Various social groups would react differently to the
   introduction of compulsory voting: gender, education, place of
   residence, occupational status, and ideological self-placement have a
   statistically significant effect on the dependent variable. However,
   policy preferences and party preferences do not have a statistically
   significant effect on the dependent variable. Thus, the most surprising
   finding of the paper is that the introduction of compulsory voting would
   not have substantive impact on the election results.},

Title = {The politics of pension reform reversal: a comparative analysis of
   Hungary and Argentina},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {83-100},
Abstract = {Argentina and Hungary have recently reversed the pension reforms of the
   1990s that had instituted a mandatory private pillar and transferred
   savings under management by private pension funds back to the public
   sector. It is argued here that these latest reforms were a product of
   political dynamics that allowed the governments of Cristina Kirchner in
   Argentina and Viktor Orban in Hungary to enjoy legislative support and
   no significant popular backlash as the incumbents blamed the
   capitalisation system for failures in coverage, poor performance, and
   high administrative costs. Yet institutional considerations alone do not
   explain the type of pension reform enacted nor its timing. The need felt
   to finance short-term debt obligations and promote deficit reduction in
   a context of significantly restricted access to international credit was
   crucial in both countries. The two cases reveal that despite being the
   quintessential intertemporal political bargain, pension reform can be
   paradoxically determined by short-term fiscal considerations. The
   reversal of reforms originally aimed at relieving long-term budgetary
   pressures fuels concerns about the sustainability of the public pension
   system in indebted economies once again.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the PKK's (Kurdistan Workers' Party) nationalist
   mobilization of the Kurds in Turkey in the past 30 years. By drawing on
   the concepts of `hegemony' and `myth', it examines the constitution of
   Kurdish political subjectivity and the representation of Kurdish
   identity and difference in political discourse. It reflects on the
   ideological and political debates over strategy and the contestation
   over identity that numerous Kurdish political organizations took part in
   during the 1970s. It then examines the PKK's subsequent hegemony over
   Kurdish politics in Turkey from the 1980s onwards by highlighting the
   factors that have enhanced its appeal among the Kurdish communities.
   This is done first through tracing the growth of the PKK's
   organizational network, and second, analysing the representation of its
   struggle in political discourse and artistic form to its target groups.},

Volume = {51},

Pages = {97-121},
Abstract = {Parity in gender representation on the bench is crucial if the judiciary
   is to reflect the population it serves. This article determines whether
   judicial appointments commissions, recently adopted in the UK, can
   increase judicial diversity on Commonwealth courts. Applying the
   synthetic control method to cross-national comparative data, the author
   finds that while the appointment of women judges increased in the first
   year after appointment commissions were established in the UK, any
   increase in the gender equity of appointments vanished soon thereafter.
   Not only does this result has important practical and theoretical
   implications for ongoing efforts to increase judicial diversity in
   Commonwealth countries, but it also highlights the utility of the
   synthetic control method for cross-national comparative political
   analysis.},

Title = {An independent review of British health and safety regulation? From
   common sense to non-sense},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},
Pages = {36-52},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The view that regulatory provisions protecting the employment conditions
   of workers need to be minimised in order to protect the business needs
   of employers has been an ongoing theme in British governmental policy
   discourse over the past three decades. For the present Coalition
   government, the assumption that current levels of regulation are unduly
   burdensome on employers and hence harmful to the economy has continued
   to be enthusiastically voiced, most notably in respect of the regulation
   of workplace health and safety. Against this backcloth, this paper
   develops a critical examination of the conclusions of an independent'
   review of health and safety regulations commissioned by the present UK
   Government to shed light on the way in which a deregulatory policy
   agenda is being furthered. The paper commences by locating the recent
   review of health and safety regulations, the Lofstedt review', in the
   context of other recent government initiatives aimed at alleviating the
   burden of health and safety regulation from the shoulders of employers.
   It then moves on to outline the nature of this review and its main
   conclusions and recommendations, before considering in turn its use of
   evidence, deployment of the notion of low risk' and lack of attention to
   the issue of enforcement. Finally, a concluding section draws together
   the key points to emerge from the preceding analysis and highlights how
   the Lofstedt review can be seen to form an integral part of a misleading
   deregulatory discourse that threatens to engender the wholesale
   undermining of workplace health and safety protections.},

Abstract = {In this article the ways in which the original Ackerman framework may be
   used in the assessment of checks and balances in New Zealand are

   institutional specifics of governance identified by Ackerman are looked
   into. The eight institutional specifics are (1) Parliamentary democracy,
   (2) Federal structure, (3) Strong upper house, (4) Professional public
   service, (5) Independent judiciary, (6) Human rights, (7) Integrity of
   major institutions and (8) Referenda. This framework facilitates a
   better understanding of governance in New Zealand.},

Title = {Locating the normative within economic science: towards the analysis of
   hidden discourses of democracy in international politics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {55-81},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Economic science has been overwhelmingly perceived as a `positive'
   science, both among economists and many scholars in other social
   sciences. As a result, there has been an estrangement between the
   `scientific' study of economics and the study of `fuzzier' matters of
   normative nature. Crucially, it is often assumed that economists -
   whether academics or practitioners - have little to say about democracy,
   a concept that is famously normative and contested in nature. This
   article argues that this perception is mistaken and misleading. When
   several key figures in economic science are examined in detail, we can
   see that their economic theories are, in fact, deeply intertwined with
   certain normative visions of democracy, even if implicitly. Recognising
   the role of hidden normative theories of democracy within economic
   science perspectives is important theoretically, in re-reading the
   nature and scope of economic science discourses. It is also, however,
   important in understanding some key world political trends. It is argued
   here that we are in a better position to understand the curious
   `dabbling' of global financial organisations in matters of `political
   nature' when we remain attuned to the role of hidden democratic
   assumptions. Also, the complex role of these organisations in `democracy
   promotion', and the nature of democracy promotion itself, can thus be
   better appreciated. Journal of International Relations and Development

Pages = {302-326},
Abstract = {What does it mean for a military operation when a gender perspective
   based on UN Security Council Resolution 1325 should be integrated in the
   daily work? The question is interesting if one considers that such
   `gender integration' has to take place on every level of this
   male-dominated institution. This article study of the gender-integration
   process in the 2008 Nordic Battlegroup and connects the analysis of the
   process with ongoing national and international developments. In
   interpreting the content of the resolution in practical assignments and
   capacity building it is found that ambiguous interpretations at the
   highest levels have resulted in difficult decisions and conflict at the
   lower levels. Moreover, gender integration is caught up in discussions
   related to professional identity. To some extent the approach to conned
   resolution 1325 with `operational effectiveness' is resulting in
   decreasing resistance.},

Abstract = {Events such as the Arab Spring in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Syria have
   created an urgent need for the international community to engage with a
   range of armed groups during and after conflict. This engagement extends
   beyond humanitarian, conflict resolution and counter-terrorism ends to
   issues of democratization and political transition of such groups in
   legitimate, stable, and inclusive governments. This article underlines
   the need to reconsider post-counterterrorism engagement styles, which
   frame non-state armed groups (NSAGs) exclusively as spoilers, and
   stresses opportunities for state-building partnership that certain NSAGs
   offer. Towards this end, this article emphasizes the importance of
   distinguishing between different types of NSAGs, based on their sources
   of legitimacy, resources, reliability, and partnering potential. It
   concludes with four entry points that promise a strong basis for
   incorporating `legitimacy, inclusion, and resource' considerations into
   the planning and implementation of future state-building efforts.},

Abstract = {Coalition governments are the norm across Central and Eastern Europe
   (CEE). While a number of empirical studies have attempted to understand
   why certain governments form in the region there has, as yet, been no
   consideration of why certain parties emerge as the key players in the
   government-formation process. This paper uses two models to identify key
   actors in government formation in CEE: the dominant and central players
   model; and the portfolio allocation model. The results show that each of
   these models contributes significantly to our understanding of which
   parties are key actors in CEE. The key actors identified by each model
   are overwhelmingly likely to become members of the cabinet and provide
   the Prime Minister of the government. Key players are also more likely
   to accrue a greater share of portfolio payoffs from the coalition
   bargaining process as well as acquiring the most salient portfolios.},

Pages = {101-113},
Abstract = {Triggered by the recent inquiries into the Fukushima nuclear disaster,
   this article reflects on the challenges of developing and operating risk
   regulation and crisis management regimes in an era of highly complex and
   tightly interconnected socio-technical systems. These challenges are not
   just technical and professional but fundamentally institutional and
   cultural. The article identifies three key paradoxes and challenges of
   contemporary risk and crisis management, signals a range of recurrent
   problems in governments' efforts to cope with these challenges,
   problematizes current patterns of societal learning from crises, and
   sketches an agenda for public administration research in this area.},

Abstract = {Regionalism: a worldwide phenomenon. Regional projects have developed
   with various aims and taken different forms. Defining and comparing
   regions are therefore not simple tasks. This chapter is organised in
   three sections. First, it emphasises three essential and interrelated
   challenges to comparative research in regionalism that relate to the
   conceptualisation, the theorisation and the methodology. The approach
   aims to address these issues with a view to providing stronger bases to
   comparative analyses of regional integration. Secondly, the chapter
   presents the European Union's case of regional integration and the
   theoretical and conceptual bias towards the European enterprise. It
   suggests developing innovative theories to compare regions, based on
   increased interactions among the different conceptions worldwide.
   Thirdly, the chapter concludes by underlying four global trends that are
   likely to affect the future of regionalism: globalisation,
   fragmentation, economic integration, and security challenges.},

Abstract = {Implicit in the rationalist literature on bargaining over the last
   half-century is the political utility of violence. Given our anarchical
   international system populated with egoistic actors, violence is thought
   to promote concessions by lending credibility to their threats. From the
   vantage of bargaining theory, then, empirical research on terrorism
   poses a puzzle. For nonstate actors, terrorism signals a credible threat
   in comparison with less extreme tactical alternatives. In recent years,
   however, a spate of studies across disciplines and methodologies has
   nonetheless found that neither escalating to terrorism nor with
   terrorism encourages government concessions. In fact, perpetrating
   terrorist acts reportedly lowers the likelihood of government
   compliance, particularly as the civilian casualties rise. The apparent
   tendency for this extreme form of violence to impede concessions
   challenges the external validity of bargaining theory, as traditionally
   understood. In this study, I propose and test an important psychological
   refinement to the standard rationalist narrative. Via an experiment on a
   national sample of adults, I find evidence of a newfound cognitive
   heuristic undermining the coercive logic of escalation enshrined in
   bargaining theory. Due to this oversight, mainstream bargaining theory
   overestimates the political utility of violence, particularly as an
   instrument of coercion.},

   pursuit of his program of good governance. The removal from office of
   Chief Justice Renato C. Corona, the arrest and detention of former
   President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, the filing of formal charges against
   her relatives and political associates, the dismissal of Aquino's own
   appointees for alleged corrupt practices, and efforts to make government
   transactions transparent were among the significant indicators of the
   administration's efforts toward good governance. The determined pursuit
   of good governance has established a widely acknowledged positive
   business environment for the country. The year 2012 also saw the passage
   of two landmark act of legislation: the Sin Tax Reform Law and the
   Reproductive Health Law.},

Volume = {48},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Much research on conflict and the environment in Africa emphasises the
   competition for energy resources and valuable minerals as a cause of
   war. Drawing on current environmental research on conflict in
   sub-Saharan Africa, this study demonstrates how the lack of adequate
   wildlife protection generates new sources of instability, notably
   between poachers and park guards and between local populations and
   refugees displaced by war. The article offers both an analysis of the
   important role that wildlife protection can play in the peace-building
   process after war and an agenda for future research. Effective policies
   on wildlife can provide a framework for communication between formerly
   conflicting parties; they can educate the population on the importance
   of sustainable resource management; and they can promote financial
   stability. All of these elements are crucial in preventing a renewed
   cycle of violence.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to give attention to the concept of
   racist hate speech and particularly to the fact of its complexity and
   inseparability from a wider spectrum of hatred. Using the methodology of
   intersectionality, this article encourages the CERD Committee's
   continued but cautious engagement in relation to racist hate speech.
   This article is a lightly modified version of a paper the author was
   invited to present at the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of
   Racial Discrimination's day of thematic discussion on Racist Hate
   Speech, held during CERD's eighty-first session on 28 August 2012 in
   Geneva.},

Abstract = {This article explores the way that Africa has been represented within
   British political modernity through the representations of campaign
   organisations. Using a model of framing, campaigns are reviewed in terms
   of the ways that Africa is rendered diagnostically, prognostically and
   motivationally. In each case, one can identity a layering' within a
   single campaign tradition. This tradition is based in a Christian,
   liberal and humanitarian nationalism that emphasises notions and norms
   of good Britishness at least as much as it does specific realities in
   African spaces. As a result, representations of Africa within campaigns
   are domesticated' for national consumption. The article concludes by
   considering the prospects of this tradition in a period when development
   campaigning has become more globalised.},

Abstract = {Realist political philosophy has enjoyed a remarkable revival in recent
   years, with prominent intellectual figures (for example, Raymond Geuss,
   Bernard Williams) promoting an identifiably `realist' alternative to
   neo-Kantianism. Yet contemporary Realists either ignore or caricature
   mid-century (or classical) international realists (for example, E. H.
   Carr, Hans Morgenthau, Reinhold Niebuhr), whose theoretical
   contributions have also recently generated a substantial revival of
   interest among international political theorists. However, they have
   done so at a high cost: recent philosophical-minded realists unwittingly
   reproduce conceptual ambiguities plaguing mid-century international
   realist contributions to political ethics. Unlike its mid-century
   predecessor, realist political philosophy also fails to analyze
   political `realities' in any but the most abstract fashion. Realist
   political philosophy still primarily constitutes an anti-Kantian
   gesture, but by no means a cogent theoretical alternative.},

Abstract = {Given its religious demography, sub-Saharan Africa seems particularly
   prone to the outbreak of violent clashes between Christians and Muslims.
   This article compares three sub-Saharan countriesNigeria, Cote d'Ivoire,
   and Tanzaniathat display different levels of inter-religious violence
   despite each having in common similar population ratios of Christians
   and Muslims, as well as all sharing a number of the classical risk
   factors for conflict onset. The analysis of these three case studies
   shows that higher levels of inter-religious violence result from
   horizontal inequalities and overlapping religious and ethnic group
   boundaries that, in the context of tense political transformation,
   consequently breed inter-religious grievances and violence. When
   theological ideas become politicized, inter-religious violence reaches
   its most intense level of expression.},

Abstract = {This article draws on primary focus group data from the UK to offer
   three contributions to recent debate on the impact of anti-terrorism
   measures on citizenship. First, it presents a qualitatively rich account
   of citizens' own perspectives on this relationship. Second, it explores
   the significance of ethnic identity in relation to public attitudes.
   Finally, it traces the implications of anti-terrorism initiatives upon
   multiple dimensions of citizenship including participation, identity and
   duties as much as rights. The article argues that citizens from a range
   of ethnic minority backgrounds, and thus not only Muslims, believe that
   anti-terrorism measures have directly curtailed and diminished their
   citizenship. This is in contrast to white participants who, while not
   untroubled about the impact of these measures, generally viewed this as
   a concern distanced from their everyday lives. This difference suggests
   that anti-terrorism measures may be contributing to a condition of
   disconnected citizenship in the UK.},

Abstract = {Management consultants provide strategic advice to public sector
   agencies and departments throughout the US, contributing to what some
   scholars call the ``hollowing out of the state.{''} What ideational
   frameworks underlie these public - private relationships? Findings from
   a survey of management consultant show that they believe that they are
   contracted because they provide knowledge that is unavailable inside the
   public sector and that their ideas are more innovative. This study helps
   to explain management consultants' perceptions of their services
   contracted by US public sector. By gauging the perspectives of
   management consultants, this research will potentially help academics
   and practitioners to better understand public agencies' contracting of
   management consultants. This article provides preliminary steps towards
   better understanding and analyzing the use of management consultants by
   different levels of the US public sector.},

Abstract = {Coordination has been a continuing challenge to governments. This paper
   examines the nature of those challenges, and proceeds to consider the
   possibilities for a theory of coordination. In particular the paper
   considers means of overcoming the collective action problems involved in
   coordination through means other than hierarchy. Several alternative
   mechanisms for producing greater coordination in policy are examined,
   and then situated in their broader political and organisational
   contexts.},

Abstract = {Despite growing pessimism in Turkey regarding EU membership
   negotiations, domestic reforms in a number of policy areas such as
   asylum and competition policy have continued and have brought Turkish
   legislation closer to the European Union (EU) acquis. What explains the
   continuation of costly reforms in the absence of credible membership
   prospects in EU candidate countries? We argue for a model of
   Europeanisation that in addition to policymakers' cost-benefit
   calculations takes into account whether there is a policy misfit or a
   vacuum, the role of domestic social actors, and the influence of
   international institutions and transnational networks beyond the EU.},

Abstract = {Over the last few decades, a vast literature has emerged examining the
   relationship between democratic political institutions and trade policy
   outcomes. While this literature has added significantly to our
   knowledge, it has effectively ignored policymaking in dozens of
   important statesthose that remain autocratic. This paper fills that hole
   by exploring the effects of authoritarian variation on national trade
   policies. Our contention is that more institutionalized authoritarian
   regimes will tend to adopt more open trade policies. This relationship
   should hold, we argue, for two distinct reasons. First, we argue that
   autocratic regimes with larger ``selectorates{''} should have greater
   incentives to provide public rather than private goods. As a result, we
   expect that multiparty, and to a lesser extent single-party, autocracies
   will tend to prefer more open trade policies than non-party (often
   personalistic) dictatorships, monarchies, and military juntas. Second,
   we contend that more stable autocratic regimes will have longer time
   horizons and therefore greater incentives to adopt policies, such as
   trade openness, that may strengthen long-run economic performance. We
   find strong support for these arguments using several cross-national
   time-series models of all autocracies ranging from 1962 to 2007
   (contingent on data availability).},

Abstract = {Theories of civil war highlight how relative power affects conflict
   onset, dynamics, strategy, outcome, and duration. Yet most studies of
   civil war have not been able to capture rebel power adequately and often
   rely on national-level characteristics to infer relative power
   distributions. This study addresses this shortcoming by using a troop
   strength measure to test arguments about how relative power affects the
   likelihood of civil conflict settlement. Drawing on the international
   crisis bargaining literature, while noting the inherent differences
   between interstate and intrastate conflicts, this study argues that the
   condition of power parity increases the likelihood of negotiated
   settlement and ceasefire. Weak rebels are unable to achieve concessions
   through negotiation since governments view them as minor threats. Yet
   governments have difficulty defeating weak rebels due to an emphasis on
   guerrilla warfare. On the other end of the spectrum, rebels that are
   superior to the government in strength are unlikely to settle given
   their power advantage. Strong rebels that can rival the strength of the
   government (i.e. they are near parity) can exact more concessions
   because fighting at parity exposes information about how long each side
   can hold out while escalating the costs of war, giving each side a
   greater incentive to negotiate and eventually seek a ceasefire or peace
   agreement. This argument is supported using data on 112 dyads in the
   post-Cold War period.},

   the ongoing conflict - has yet to be examined. The authors argue that
   states are more likely to join conflicts that occur close to their
   territories than conflicts that are located at a greater distance, and
   that accounts that do not pay attention to this distance are incomplete.
   Proximity to the location of an ongoing conflict affects the opportunity
   for a state to join (by decreasing costs), while also affecting the
   state's willingness to join (by increasing the potential threat to the
   state's security). A series of statistical models provide evidence for
   the authors' claims: a state's opportunity to join and its willingness
   to aid or exploit a neighbor in conflict, or to fulfill its alliance
   commitments, are each conditioned by its proximity to the location of
   the conflict. This conditioning effect of dispute location is important
   because it helps account for cases that appear to contradict the
   expectations of existing arguments regarding capabilities, contiguity,
   and alliances - such as when weak, non-contiguous, and non-allied states
   join ongoing conflicts and strong, contiguous, and allied states do not
   join.},

Abstract = {This article assesses how and to what extent the European Union (EU)
   uses a security perspective to define and shape its relationship with
   the developing world. In order to evaluate the EU's development policy
   and its relations with developing countries we link the concept of
   security-development nexus' with the concept of securitization'. The
   article examines whether securitization can be observed with regard to
   four dimensions: discourse, policy instruments, policy actions and
   institutional framework. The analysis demonstrates a securitization of
   the EU's development policy and its relations with developing countries,
   particularly in Africa. However, paradoxically, the securitization's
   extent and nature suggest that the EU can also use it as a way to avoid
   a more direct involvement in conflict areas.},

Abstract = {Arms races are costly and inefficient; therefore, standard causal
   explanations, based on threat perception, are inadequate, as states
   should prefer to resolve disagreements prior to the onset of these
   inefficient competitions. Building on recent research, arms races are
   alternatively conceptualized as a product of uncertainty, used to reveal
   information. Expectations are derived regarding when arms races should
   be most likely, allowing for one of the first systematic, quantitative
   tests of the causes of arms races. Empirical tests support theoretical
   expectations that arms races are most likely in contexts where there are
   salient competitive stakes and high levels of uncertainty, such as
   territorial rivalries or the early tenure of new leaders. The
   theoretical logic and empirical tests not only produce insights into why
   states participate in costly and inefficient arms races but also hint at
   a better understanding of the long puzzling relationship between arms
   races and war.},

Abstract = {This contribution develops a framework for evaluating the legitimacy of
   codecision. It uses democratic theory to clarify the role of legislative
   procedures in securing the legitimacy of political systems. It shows how
   that role requires public control with political equality and public
   justification. It uses that standard to show how legislative
   agenda-setting, Council voting weights, European Parliament elections
   and seat apportionments, national parliamentary scrutiny, justificatory
   practices, and control of judicial and administrative rule-making all
   affect the legitimacy of codecision. Overall the contribution concludes
   that the legitimacy of codecision is part of a predicament that can only
   be managed, not solved.},

Abstract = {Divisions on European integration were prominent in the Conservative
   Party in the 1990s, but abated in opposition. In this period, the party
   became more cohesive in terms of attitudes on Europe as it embraced soft
   Euroscepticism. However, differences over the desired scale and pace of
   changes to Britain's relationship with the European Union saw dissent
   increase as the party entered coalition government with the Liberal
   Democrats. This article examines the effectiveness of various approaches
   to management of dissent on Europe utilised by the party leadership:
   intervention in candidate selection; patronage and discipline;
   permitting limited dissent; policy compromise and deferred decisions;
   pledging referendums; and agenda setting and issue salience. It shows
   that intra-party divisions on European integration are particularly
   difficult to manage and suggests that dissent on the issue may often be
   higher in governing parties than those in opposition.},

Abstract = {This article examines the transformation of the Chechen conflict from a
   predominately nationalist to jihadist struggle, and compares the similar
   changes that took place in the Kashmiri insurgency. Using global
   jihadist strategy and ideology, and the accompanying influence of Al
   Qaida, both conflicts are shown to have taken on a new ideology and to
   have expanded beyond previous areas of operation. In both instances, the
   political leadership wrapped themselves in the mantle of political Islam
   (Islamism) as ensuing violence led to rapid socioeconomic transformation
   and social breakdown, thus allowing foreign jihadists to exert power and
   take up/divert the cause. In the past few years, two main groups
   originating in Chechnya and Kashmir have taken on Western targets and
   become more indoctrinated in Al Qaida's global jihadist ideology: the
   Caucasus Emirate (CE) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). The opportunist
   franchising strategy of Al Qaida could come to play a role in the future
   of both groups, especially if the CE is able to coalesce into a more
   unified front. More importantly, the global jihadist attributes of the
   CE must begin to garner the same attention in the Western world as that
   of LeT.},

Abstract = {This article presents an empirical analysis of a unique dataset of 1240
   former members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA). We
   highlight the shifting sociological and operational profile of PIRA's
   cadre, and highlight these dynamics in conjunction with primary PIRA
   documents and secondary interview sources. The effect of these changes
   in terms of the scale and intensity of PIRA violence is also considered.
   Although this is primarily a study of a disbanded violent organization,
   it contains broad policy implications beyond the contemporary violence
   of dissident movements in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of
   Ireland. We conclude with a consideration of how a shifting sociological
   profile impacts upon group effectiveness, resilience, homogeneity, and
   the turn toward peaceful means of contention.},

Abstract = {We present what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first published
   set of annual out-of-sample forecasts of genocide and politicide based
   on a global dataset. Our goal is to produce a prototype for a real-time
   model capable of forecasting one year into the future. Building on the
   current literature, we take several important steps forward. We
   implement an unconditional two-stage model encompassing both instability
   and genocide, allowing our sample to be the available global data,
   rather than using conditional case selection or a case-control approach.
   We explore factors exhibiting considerable variance over time to improve
   yearly forecasting performance. And we produce annual lists of at-risk
   states in a format that should be of use to policymakers seeking to
   prevent such mass atrocities. Our out-of-sample forecasts for 1988-2003
   predict 90.9\% of genocide onsets correctly while also predicting 79.2\%
   of non-onset years correctly, an improvement over a previous study using
   a case-control in-sample approach. We produce 16 annual forecasts based
   only on previous years' data, which identify six of 11 cases of
   genocide/politicide onset within the top 5\% of at-risk countries per
   year. We believe this represents substantial progress towards useful
   real-time forecasting of such rare events. We conclude by suggesting
   ways to further enhance predictive performance.},

Abstract = {Transnational non-state governance arrangements (NGAs) are increasingly
   common in areas such as labor standards and environmental
   sustainability, often presenting themselves as innovative means through
   which the lives of marginalized communities in developing countries can
   be improved. Yet in some cases, the policy interventions adopted by the
   managers of these NGAs appear not to be welcomed by their supposed
   beneficiaries. This article accounts for this predicament by examining
   the effects of different configurations of accountability within NGAs
   promoting labor rights. Most labor-rights NGAs incorporate proxy
   accountability arrangements, in which consumers and activists hold
   decision makers accountable on behalf of the putative beneficiaries of
   the NGAs: workers and affected communities in poorer countries. The
   article shows how and why different combinations of proxy versus
   beneficiary accountability influence the choice of policy instruments
   used by NGAs, and applies the argument to three prominent non-state
   initiatives in the domain of labor standards.},

Title = {Fighting gender-based violence: The women's movement and the enforcement
   of rape law in Liberia},
Journal = {AFRICAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2013},

Abstract = {Many African states have adopted laws that criminalize rape and other
   forms of gender-based violence (GBV), but the enforcement of such laws
   is often weak. Many rape cases are never brought to court and victims
   are frequently encouraged to accept reconciliation instead of
   prosecution of offenders. Drawing on research from post-conflict
   Liberia, this article investigates the ability of women's movements to
   influence the state's implementation of rape law, and seeks to theorize
   the relationship between women's activism and the enforcement of rape
   law. It documents the range of strategies adopted by the Liberian
   women's movement, and argues that these tactics have contributed to an
   increased referral of rape cases to court. This was made possible by two
   conditions: a relatively open political environment and political and
   material support from international organizations, which in turn enabled
   women's NGOs to gain access to and make an impression on the
   implementation process. This demonstrates the capacity of civil society
   organizations in Africa's more open and internationally connected states
   to influence policy at the implementation stage-even in particularly
   challenging areas such as women's rights.},

Abstract = {The recovery of companies by their workers was one of the movements for
   autonomy that characterized the cycle of rebellion in Argentina between
   1993 and 2002. Confronted by the liquidation of a company, the workers
   would occupy the premises and resume production. The cycle of governance
   that followed this period was characterized by new mechanisms of control
   that weakened the principles of direct democracy and solidarity forged
   in the workers' struggle. Field research on two recovered companies
   suggests that, despite the institutionalization and disarticulation of
   the movement, the experience of more horizontal forms of organization,
   the reappropriation of the means of production, and the experience of
   autonomy are lessons for the working class that will be the referents
   for future organization for confronting capitalist exploitation.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article presents the case for a state-owned British Investment Bank
   and discusses its institutional design and capitalisation on the basis
   of the experiences of the Nordic Investment Bank (BIB). Current
   supply-side policies aimed at increasing investment in the
   infrastructure and small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sectors are
   likely to fail because they neglect constraints and market failures on
   the demand side. In contrast, a commercially operated but mandate-driven
   public investment bank can mitigate market failures on both sides by not
   only supplying capital on favourable terms to financially viable
   projects but also stimulating demand through policy-signalling effects.
   A focus on offering additionality would be key to the BIB's success. In
   addition to the economic case' for the BIB, this article discusses the
   political case': how to make it interesting to a government bent on
   fiscal retrenchment.},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to analyze the overall users'
   satisfaction with preschool institutions, and the correlation between
   different socio-economic characteristics of the respondents and their
   satisfaction with the obtained services. A survey was conducted in seven
   towns and municipalities in the Province of Vojvodina in Serbia,
   including 7798 parents of children using preschool services. The
   research instrument was a questionnaire composed based on similar
   surveys of user satisfaction. Multiple regression analysis served as the
   tool in analyzing the relationship between the users' socio-economic
   background and overall satisfaction with services. Overall parent
   satisfaction with preschool education services appears lower among
   respondents with higher education, those who participate in the costs of
   preschool services and those living in urban areas.},

Abstract = {Theory of parliamentary regimes presumes that parliament can express
   vote of no confidence in government. On the other hand executive power
   (government or head of state) is endowed with right to dissolve the
   parliament. However, these ``doomsday devices{''} are not in balance in
   many parliamentary regimes, including the Czech Republic. On the basis
   of a comparative analysis of dissolution provisions in the constitutions
   of European states the article argues that the government in the Czech
   Republic should be given the right to dissolve the lower chamber at
   least in case that the latter expresses vote of no confidence in the
   former. (C) 2013 The Regents of the University of California. Published

Abstract = {During the past three decades national human rights institutions (NHRIs)
   have spread to more than one hundred United Nations (UN) member states
   and become key to human rights enforcement and democratic
   accountability. Given that NHRIs can take on a life of their own even
   under adverse conditions, why do governments in the developing world
   create permanent, independent national bodies with statutory powers to
   promote and protect human rights? Human rights international
   nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) are crucial for global diffusion.
   They empower local actors and influence governments in favor of NHRI
   adoption by mediating the human rights and NHRI discourses and
   mobilizing shame internationally. An event history analysis offers
   robust evidence that controlling for the UN, regional organizations, and
   other rival factors, human rights INGOs have systematic positive effects
   on diffusion. The case studies of South Korea and Malaysia provide
   process-tracing evidence that the hypothesized causal mechanisms are
   operative.},

Abstract = {How does international law affect state behavior? Existing models
   addressing this issue rest on individual preferences and voter behavior,
   yet these assumptions are rarely questioned. Do citizens truly react to
   their governments being taken to court over purported violations? I
   propose a novel approach to test the premise behind models of
   international treaty-making, using web-search data. Such data are widely
   used in epidemiology; in this article I claim that they are also well
   suited to applications in political economy. Web searches provide a
   unique proxy for a fundamental political activity that we otherwise have
   little sense of: information seeking. Information seeking by
   constituents can be usefully examined as an instance of political
   mobilization. Applying web-search data to international trade disputes,
   I provide evidence for the belief that US citizens are concerned about
   their country being branded a violator of international law, even when
   they have no direct material stake in the case at hand. This article
   constitutes a first attempt at utilizing web-search data to test the
   building blocks of political economy theory.},

Abstract = {I study the content and dynamics of Price Public Hearing Meeting (PPHM)
   in China by analyzing 711 talking points delivered by 140 participants
   in six deliberative meetings on price adjustments. By examining the
   ``modes of action{''} and the content of these speeches, this study
   demonstrates that the participants at these six PPHM's collectively
   employed a set of discursive strategies to show deference to the state's
   authority and, simultaneously, to expand the discursive space at the
   PPHM's beyond the parameters set by the state's hegemonic discourses.
   Discussion of government responsibilities and criticism of the state-
   sanctioned price hikes took place in this new space. The Confucian
   political value of ``people's livelihood{''} (minsheng) was widely drawn
   upon by grassroots representatives to stress the government's role as
   the guardian of people's welfare.},

Abstract = {The promulgation of the Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule
   stands as the first step to developing a comprehensive national approach
   to climate change. However, what role, if any, did interest groups play
   in the development of this rule? This paper applies Kingdon's multiple
   streams model as a descriptive framework to analyze interview data for
   this rule to better understand interest group involvement across all the
   stages of the rule-making process (rule development, notice and comment
   phase, and rule finalization). Our research suggests that interest
   groups were indeed influential throughout the process, but those
   involved during rule development were clearly at an advantage.},

Abstract = {This article is a study of Canada's foreign policy towards Africa from
   the earliest beginnings after the Second World War until 2012. The
   argument is that Canada has tried to ensure it is well regarded by
   Africa as a player, partner and friend. This would permit Canada to (1)
   build constituencies of support with Africans when interests converge on
   issues of common concern; and (2) ensure Canada is not alienated from
   Africa, and African states are not alienated from the West. Since 2006,
   however, Prime Minister Stephen Harper has over-emphasized the trade
   (player) aspect of the Africa policy, with potentially serious
   consequences for Canada's reputation and position in Africa against
   competitors like China.},

Abstract = {What are the ethics of foreign policy? How do foreign policymakers
   decide between competing ethics? Could policymakers make more ethical
   decisions? These questions achieved prominence in the UK context when
   Robin Cookthen Foreign Secretaryannounced in 1997 that British foreign
   policy should have an ethical dimension'. Subsequent commentary on New
   Labour's foreign policy would often use the phrase ethical foreign
   policy' to disparage the moralistic rhetoric of Tony Blair and Robin
   Cook. This article utilises interviews with former Foreign Secretaries
   and Ministers of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to explore
   why ethics should be so controversial in British foreign policy
   discourse. Using Mark Bevir's concepts of the traditions' and dilemmas'
   of governance, it conducts an interpretivist analysis of this data;
   aiming to understand how policymakers posit themselves as ethical
   agents, define what it means to be ethical, and rationalise their own
   ethical judgments in policymaking.},

Abstract = {Can local organizations give civilians the capacity to protect
   themselves from civil war violence? Civilians have traditionally been
   considered powerless when facing armed groups but new research suggests
   organized communities may promote security through nonviolent strategies
   such as resolving disputes between neighbors and managing relations with
   macro-armed actors. This article analyzes whether and how these
   `mechanisms' designed to retain community autonomy functioned in the
   community-case of the Peasant Worker Association of the Carare River
   (ATCC) in Colombia. The Carare civilians developed a local institutional
   process to investigate threats against suspected armed group
   collaborators to clarify the `fog of war' and reform civilian
   preferences to participate in the conflict. This process is evaluated in
   reference to existing hypotheses about violence in civil wars such as
   the balance of territorial control using qualitative evidence from
   original field research. A unique within-case database created through
   focus group sessions with community `conciliators' is used to analyze
   not only acts of violence, but also threats that were defused. Despite
   the prevalence of conditions that would predict persistent violence
   against civilians, the local institution itself proved to be a critical
   factor for both explaining and limiting levels of violence. The results
   suggest civilian choices and their consequences did not merely result
   from the capabilities or choices of armed actors.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to shed more light on Ukraine's language problem by
   specifying popular views of policies the state should pursue in the
   language domain. Aiming at the delineation of possible ways to reconcile
   the preferences of main ethnolinguistic and regional groups, it analyzes
   their views of the valid and desirable legislative and institutional
   arrangements. The data come from a nationwide representative mass survey
   and twenty focus groups in different parts of Ukraine. The analysis
   shows that Ukrainian-speakers would like to see their language dominant
   in all domains but are ready to put up with the widespread use of
   Russian, provided that their own right to use Ukrainian is not
   questioned and the titular language retains the priority status and
   exclusive role in some symbolically important practices. In contrast,
   Russian-speakers prefer an upgrade of the status of Russian, which they
   present as a way to ensure the equality of speakers of the two languages
   but most of them actually want official bilingualism to let them remain
   unilingual in their capacities both as citizens and as employees. The
   best solution would be to adopt compromise legislation providing for a
   limited upgrade of the status of Russian and then facilitate its
   observance by both bureaucrats and citizens. However, the new language
   law adopted under President Yanukovych was widely perceived as
   endangering the use of Ukrainian and thus contributed to confrontation
   rather than compromise.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},

Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {150-159},

Abstract = {It is important to draw critical attention to the broad policy
   perspectives that travel across the globe and operate at multiple
   scales. Social Investment is clearly one such set of ideas that has
   assumed increasing prominence over the last two decades. Like most such
   rapidly diffusing ideas, however, it admits of quite different
   interpretations. In this article I examine the most recent iterations of
   the Directorate for Employment, Labour and Social Affairs' (DELSA)
   interpretation of Social Investment against the backdrop of its earlier
   work. I argue that its initial formulations could be seen as an example
   of inclusive liberalism. Since then, however, DELSA has begun to embrace
   important elements of a social democratic version, including a concern
   with gender equality. Policy Implications center dot While the idea of
   Social Investment may have opened anew a positive role for social
   policy, it is insufficient for such policies to focus narrowly on
   improving the human capital of the poor. Rather it is important to
   develop the human capital of all. center dot While Social Investment
   policies can include measures to facilitate work and family life it is
   also important to actively promote equality of the sexes in paid and
   unpaid work. center dot Social Investment policies, with their emphasis
   on the supply side, need to be complemented by policies to promote good
   jobs for all. center dot To be effective, Social Investment policies
   need to be accompanied by appropriate macroeconomic policies.},

Abstract = {The global recession, Eurozone crisis and austerity programmes have had
   a huge impact upon the European economy and present even greater future
   threats. They have sharpened debates about policies for recovery and the
   role that different territories can play in this. In this context in
   particular they have encouraged a debate about the economic contribution
   of capital and non-capital cities and whether countries perform better
   if they concentrate their investment in their capitals or spread
   investment across a wider set of cities. Drawing on the findings of a
   recently completed study of European second-tier cities and a review of
   the academic and policy literature on local and regional economic
   development, the paper argues the case for a place-based' approach to
   support second-tier cities across Europe. The key policy messages of
   this approach for policy-makers at national and European levels are
   highlighted.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Pages = {65-88},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Spain's newspapers are characterised by strong partisan identities. We
   demonstrate that the two leading newspapers nonetheless show powerful
   similarities in the topics of their coverage over time. The media system
   is strongly related to the policy process and it shows similar levels of
   skew (attention focuses on just a few topics) and friction (attention
   lurches rapidly from topic to topic) as others have shown for policy
   processes more generally. Further, media attention is significantly
   related to parliamentary activities. Oral questions in parliament track
   closely with media attention over time. Our assessment is based on a
   comprehensive database of all front-page stories (over 95,000 stories)
   in El Pais and El Mundo, Spain's largest daily newspapers, and all 7,446
   oral questions from 1996 to 2009. The paper shows that explanations of
   friction and skew in governmental activities should incorporate media
   dynamics as well. Political leaders are clearly sensitive to media
   salience.},

Abstract = {We examine the significance of leadership, economic problems and
   immigration for defection from voting Labour over the period 200510.
   Vote switching at different points throughout the electoral cycle is
   estimated using discrete-time event history analysis models. Contrary to
   established expectations about the impact of the financial crisis and
   weaknesses in Gordon Brown's premiership, political leadership and
   economic evaluations had similar effects on defection during the early
   part of the electoral cycle, when Tony Blair was still in place, and the
   economy was still growing. In contrast, during the later period the
   economic crisis failed to impact on vote switching, which derived more
   noticeably from concerns over immigration or dislike of Brown. The
   emergence of immigration as a source of electoral punishment for Labour
   appears to derive from a particular dissatisfaction with the
   government's performance on an issue of rising salience; by comparison
   the economic crisis may well have been sufficiently global to have
   weakened attributions of responsibility to the government.},

Abstract = {This article considers whether there should be a separate international
   Covenant to elaborate on the human right to own property. Citing two
   contemporary casesnamely, the semi-starvation faced by many citizens of
   Zimbabwe and the shortage of food in VenezuelaI argue that a human right
   to own property protects the economic human rights to adequate food and
   freedom from hunger. The right to own property is also crucial to the
   economic development necessary to ensure that human beings can supply
   themselves with food and otherwise support themselves. As such, it is a
   strategic human right, a right that protects other rights. I also argue
   that the right to own property is an intrinsic human right, valuable in
   itself as a component of human dignity. The article ends with a brief
   proposal for an elaborated Covenant on the human right to own property.},

Number = {2},

Abstract = {Government preference for military veterans in hiring, a means to honor
   them for their service and sacrifices, potentially conflicts with other
   values of the public service, including its diversity and quality.
   Census data for 1990, 2000, and 2006-2009 show that veterans are at
   least three times as likely to hold federal jobs as, but only 10\% more
   likely to hold state and local government jobs than, comparable
   individuals without military service. Veterans' preference has
   substantially increased the percentage of federal employees who are men
   and has probably decreased the percentages who are Asians, gay men, and
   immigrants, but its effects on the composition of state and local
   governments are small. Federal personnel data for the past decade show
   that veteran new hires are older and less educated than nonveteran new
   hires, and that they do not advance as far in the first 15 years of
   their careers as nonveterans hired into the same grades at the same
   time, suggesting that veterans' preference may be lowering the
   performance of the federal civil service.},

Abstract = {Panel data analysis has become a popular tool for researchers in public
   policy and public administration. Combining information from both
   spatial and temporal dimensions, panel data allow researchers to use
   repeated observations of the same units (e.g., government agencies,
   public organizations, public managers, etc.), and could increase both
   quantity and quality of the empirical information. Nonetheless,
   practices of choosing different panel model specifications are not
   always guided by substantive considerations. Using a state-level panel
   data set related to public health administration as an example, I
   compare four categories of panel model specifications: (1) the fixed
   effects model, (2) the random effects model, (3) the random coefficients
   (heterogeneous parameter) model, and (4) linear dynamic models. I
   provide an overview of the substantive consideration relevant to
   different statistical specifications. Furthermore, I compare estimation
   results and discuss how these different model choices may lead to
   different substantive interpretations. Based on model comparisons, I
   demonstrate several potential problems of different panel models. I
   conclude with a discussion on how to choose among different models based
   on substantive and theoretical considerations.},

Abstract = {The article examines how the structure of party systems, that is,
   effective number of political actors, electoral volatility, and shares
   of dominant party votes and seats, affect the initiation and direction
   of electoral reform in post-communist democracies. Based on a dataset of
   electoral rule changes in post-communist democracies from 1992 to 2008,
   we analyze the frequency and direction of reforms over time. The
   findings reveal that the frequency of reforms declines with successive
   electoral cycles but not to the degree suggested by theories of
   institutional inertia. Countries with high levels of voter volatility
   are more likely to engage in reforms; however, the findings in this
   article demonstrate that politicians react to volatility by
   inconsistently choosing between permissive and restrictive responses.

Abstract = {The article argues that British non-proliferation policies towards the
   Middle East have had limited success because they are circumscribed by
   dependence on alliances and constrained by other factors such as
   Britain's historical legacy, its status as a nuclear weapons state and,
   especially through the European Union's engagement with the region, the
   communication of self-interest rather than credible pursuit of the
   declared objective of regional security-building. Despite promoting and
   implementing its own disarmament policies, Britain has been unable to
   overcome mistrust and perceptions of hypocrisy in the region in order to
   strengthen the non-proliferation regime. This is particularly evident in
   the dispute with Iran, which is examined in detail with the assistance
   of Adler's double-damned dilemma' model. The analysis argues that the
   Western coercive approach has facilitated the stalemate with Iran,
   because it has encouraged Iran's provocations and allowed it to respond
   with a strategy of denial. The analysis suggests that Britain and its
   allies adopt a defusing strategy which does not reduce the dispute to a
   proliferation problem, but treats Iran's behaviour as a quest for
   recognition. Britain has little influence on Iran, but might build on
   its relationship with Turkey to develop this approach in conjunction
   with its allies.},

   International Studies Quarterly, doi: 10.1111/isqu.12001 (c) 2012
   International Studies Association Why do countries open their economies
   to global capital markets? A number of recent articles have found that
   two types of factors encourage politicians to liberalize their capital
   accounts: strong macroeconomic fundamentals and political pressure from
   proponents of open capital markets. However, these conclusions need to
   be re-evaluated because the most commonly used measure of capital
   account openness, Chinn and Ito's (2002) Kaopen index, suffers from
   systematic measurement error. We modify the ChinnIto variable and
   replicate two studies (Brooks and Kurtz 2007; Chwieroth 2007) to

Abstract = {Pelc, Krzysztof J. (2013) The Cost of Wiggle-Room: Looking at the
   Welfare Effects of Flexibility in Tariff Rates at the WTO. International
   Studies Quarterly, doi: 10.1111/isqu.12037 (c) 2013 International
   Studies Association There is considerable variation in the depth of
   countries' commitments at the World Trade Organization (WTO). While WTO
   members apply tariffs on imports at roughly comparable levels, the
   maximum levels allowed on these tariffs vary dramatically, leaving some
   members with far more flexibility to raise trade barriers overnight.
   Some countries have argued that such binding overhang is harmless unless
   it is exploited, while other countries disagree. This paper is the first
   attempt to empirically assess the effect of binding overhang on trade
   flows. I argue that the mere existence of binding overhang has a
   strongly negative effect on trade, through the way in which it muddles
   expectations. Using data at the 4-digit harmonized system product level,
   covering the WTO membership from 1995 to 2008, I demonstrate that the
   cost in terms of lost trade resulting from the ability to legally raise
   a tariff by one point is tantamount to nearly half the cost of having
   done so. In sum, WTO membership is, by itself, no panacea. Negotiating
   greater tariff flexibility can water down a country's legal commitments
   and significantly reduce the benefits flowing from the institution.},

Abstract = {Though race is most commonly associated with domestic politics, the
   concept itself was born in the transnational realm. This article
   conceptualizes race as a system of global power relations that has
   changed over time, manifests differently across space and exists on
   multiple analytical levels. Drawing from the insights of international
   relations, comparative politics and critical race theory, it argues that
   race is a transnational norm or idea that can independently affect both
   domestic policy outcomes and international relations among
   nation-states. The article explores several promising avenues of
   research in the examination of the varied manifestations of race in
   international and domestic realms and ends with a brief discussion of
   continuing challenges and future research agendas in the comparative and
   international study of race.},

Abstract = {Interpretations of new wars' are contradictory. While some stress the
   asymmetry of intentions, strategies, and capabilities of antagonists,
   others emphasize the identity of warring parties in sharing the same
   space of political violence. Introducing elements of a political
   anthropology of victimhood, this paper suggests that the polarity in new
   wars is driven by self-representations of collective victimhood. Modes
   of total warfare in the twentieth century shifted the moral centre of
   gravity towards representations of humanity as a transcendent victim.
   The universalist sacred of protecting humanity as a victim, however,
   masks the polarity between antagonists who legitimize aggression by
   defensive propositions in the name of suffered victimhood. On the one
   hand, moral justifications of revenge for victimhood support claims for
   the asymmetry of polarity. On the other hand, this asymmetry of
   proliferating victims conceals an ongoing symmetry of rivalry.
   Ultimately, the focus on political agency and on moral justifications
   maintains the illusion that the other is the aggressor. A new moral
   economy requires acknowledging the deep interdependence of rivals. The
   aggressor has always been aggressed. If the moral core of warfare is in
   the de-humanization of the enemy, possible paths of reconciliation
   require the moral recognition of the enemy's same humanity.},

Abstract = {The initiative to establish a truth commission in the successor states
   of the former Yugoslavia (RECOM) presents a rich case study of the
   performance of the ``toolkit{''} that transitional justice professionals
   propose on a global scale: an inclusive package that offers truth,
   justice, reconciliation and stability. Whether these goals could be
   achieved is the subject of a critical debate that questions overly
   ambitious projects of truth commissions, especially their sensitivity to
   local understandings and practices of transitional justice. We aim to
   contribute to this debate by examining the reception of RECOM in Kosovo,
   where most local actors remain either noncommittal or outright opposed
   to RECOM. What these actors share is the conviction that their own
   narratives be taken seriously, even when this means refusing the
   suppression of ``truths{''} that can be divisive. We found that giving
   priority to ``the local{''} implies more than adapting the received
   professional ``toolkit{''}: it might require abandoning it.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the gap in the literature on U.S. domestic
   terrorism and counterterrorism in the 1970s by examining a
   once-notorious but now largely forgotten terrorist group, the Black
   Liberation Army (BLA). An outgrowth of the Black Panther Party, the BLA
   was directly responsible for at least 20 fatalities, making it amongst
   the most lethal homegrown U.S. groups of the period. This article seeks
   to shed new light on the BLA by exploring its relatively short but
   violent trajectory. By focusing on the group's origins, operations,
   ideology, and structure, the BLA can be understood as part of a wider
   landscape of homegrown political violence. The BLA emerged during the
   waning phase of a protest cycle that included the civil rights, Black
   Power, and anti-war movements. Like other terrorist groups before and
   after, the BLA claimed to be acting in self-defense and on behalf of the
   people, presenting itself as an army resisting police occupation of
   minority communities. With the collapse of the extreme Left in the
   mid-1970s, the BLA's prospects for creating a broader revolutionary base
   became remote. The article also examines law-enforcement responses to
   the BLA and the competing ways in which the Federal Bureau of
   Investigation and local police (and in particular, the New York Police
   Department) framed and countered the BLA threat.},

Title = {BUFFALO, NEW YORK: A DISCUSSION OF MAYOR BROWN'S LEADERSHIP},
Booktitle = {21ST CENTURY URBAN RACE POLITICS: REPRESENTING MINORITIES AS UNIVERSAL
   INTERESTS},
Series = {Research in Race and Ethnic Relations},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Pages = {251-270},
Abstract = {Purpose - The focus of this chapter is to establish a blueprint for
   effective Black leadership without compromising the interests of other
   racial and ethnic groups. A uniform approach has not been utilized to
   accomplish the ``dual agenda{''} of representing majority and minority
   interests simultaneously, although most of our urban cities now consist
   of a plurality of Black, Latino, Asian, and Caucasian voters.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using the city of Buffalo and Mayor Brown
   as a case study, a content analysis was conducted on Mayor Brown's
   upcoming career in politics as well as close coverage of his election
   and reelection bids. A descriptive analysis was also conducted on the
   election of first-time Black mayors in order to identify the style of
   leadership that is appropriate for a particular era.
   Findings - Some of the findings of this research confirmed that a city's
   size, its predominant racial and ethnic makeup, the city's regional
   location, the era that they were elected in, their professional
   experience, and prior elected positions continue to be influential
   factors in electing Black mayors. In each era however, there was a
   particular style of leadership that became a necessary element in
   electing and reelecting a Black mayor.
   Research limitations/implications - While this research relied mostly on
   a content analysis of Mayor Brown's leadership and first-time Black
   mayors, it would have been better served if an in-depth interview was
   conducted with Mayor Brown himself. It is imperative for research that
   seeks to establish a blueprint to speak to the primary agents of that
   office as well as community leaders for an objective perspective.
   Practical implications - Aspiring politicians who wish to lead their
   cities will need to have a consistent plan that speaks to coalition
   building in order to solidify a diverse base of supporters. Also
   important is to be able to elect more Black mayors in a particular city
   that has been exposed to Black mayoral leadership shortly thereafter to
   build upon previous accomplishments.
   Originality/value - This chapter fulfills the need to accomplish the
   ``dual agenda{''} of representing majority and minority interests
   simultaneously.},

Pages = {255-269},
Abstract = {The global financial and sovereign debt crises led to the creation of
   numerous new agreements and institutions to contain the current crisis
   and prevent future ones. These measures reinforce the historical trend
   towards the predominance of intergovernmental decision-making in
   economic and monetary union (EMU), going so far as to
   re-intergovernmentalize cooperation that had previously been decided
   upon by the Community method. Using principal-agent analysis, this
   contribution looks at fiscal policy cooperation since the outbreak of
   the sovereign debt crisis and considers how the impact of
   re-intergovernmentalization is manifested largely in the policy process
   rather than the policy outcome. However, this is still cause for concern
   given the precarious nature of EMU's legitimacy and the loss of
   efficiency that delegation typically provides.},

Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},

Volume = {12},

Pages = {225-246},
Abstract = {There is increasing debate within the former Yugoslavia regarding the
   possible creation of a truth and reconciliation commission (TRC). The
   RECOM coalition, formed in 2008, is committed to the idea of a regional
   TRC. This article, however, argues that a regional approach to
   truth-seeking is premature at this stage and thus focuses on the
   national level-and specifically on Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH). The
   article's twofold objective is to explore whether BiH needs a TRC and,
   if so, what this TRC should look like. This is an empirical article that
   draws upon the author's fieldwork at the International Criminal Tribunal
   for the former Yugoslavia, in BiH and in South Africa.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1, SI},

Abstract = {This article examines the infrastructure policy sector's capacity to
   respond to climate change adaptation through an analysis of the Canadian
   case. It includes a three-level examination of capacity: at the macro
   level through a virtual policy network analysis; at the meso level
   through examination of the lead department's evolving mandate and
   resources; and at the micro level through analysis of survey data
   related to departmental workers policy tasks and attitudes. Four
   hypotheses across these three levels are set out and tested at the
   national and subnational levels. Together, the findings suggest that the
   policy capacity in the Canadian infrastructure sector will be unable to
   meet the demands placed upon the sector to respond to the increasing
   challenges of climate change adaptation.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Pages = {387-391},
Abstract = {Cladi and Locatelli's conceptualization of CSDP as an instance of
   bandwagoning on US power has significant analytical leverage; however,
   their analysis fails to outline an alternative systemic explanation to
   the balance of power. This contribution argues that European defence
   cooperation is best understood by using a neoclassical realist analysis
   that integrates the insights of Stephen Walt's `balance of threat'
   theory. Furthermore, it is argued that the analysis presented by Pohl
   neglects the role of the Atlantic Alliance in European security. In
   doing so, Pohl misses the nature of CSDP as the central element of the
   `reform' of western Europe's Cold War bandwagoning on US power. One
   should not, therefore, expect CSDP operations to necessarily be about
   frustrating or helping US strategic objectives. CSDP is instead an
   institution that is designed primarily to meet security challenges
   within Europe's geopolitical neighbourhood that the US is unwilling or
   unable to tackle.},

Abstract = {Criticism has tended to see the pioneer documentaries of the New Latin
   American Cinema in the late 1950s and early 1960s as reproducing what
   they denounced. Close analysis of the formal strategies of three classic
   Argentine films of the period-Fernando Birri's Tire Die, Humberto Rios's
   Faena, and Raymundo Gleyzer's Ceramiqueros de Traslasierra-suggests,
   instead, that the questions and contradictions in these political
   documentaries are illuminated by the desire to imagine and address a new
   audience as an agent of social change.},

Abstract = {The momentous 2005 Liberian elections followed a devastating civil war.
   Remarkably, the winner of the presidential race was a woman, Ellen
   Johnson Sirleaf, and the second-placed was a footballer, George Weah. In
   addition, in stark contrast to many African elections in particular
   those in neighbouring Sierra Leone, voting patterns were fragmented:
   voters often chose President, Senators and Representatives from
   different parties or independents. Much can be explained by a remarkably
   level playing-field delivered by an interim coalition government
   providing no incumbent. In 2011, the Johnson-Sirleaf incumbency stood to
   significantly change the dynamics. This article seeks to discern whether
   Liberian elections maintain their unusual patterns, whether Liberia has
   joined the ranks of African patron-clientelist, dominant-party or
   two-party systems, in particular compared to that of Sierra Leone, or
   whether there are new twists in its democratic development.},

Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {338-354},
Abstract = {What made it possible for the National Socialist GermanWorkers' Party
   (NSDAP) to evolve from a fragmented political sect to a movement with an
   unprecedented potential for political mobilisation by the early 1930s?
   Based on the Nazi movement in Berlin, this article seeks to explore a
   new approach to the growth of the NSDAP which synthesises organisational
   refinement and a new look on Nazi propaganda prior to 1933. Through the
   creation of cells in residential areas and the workplace, by educating
   and training party cadres and through the insistence on Kleinarbeit as
   an alternative to mass propaganda, these developments interacted with
   each other, and were an attempt to project Nazism as an ideology and a
   political movement into spaces that had previously been closed to it.
   Both developments should be considered as bottom-up mobilisations of the
   party's grass-roots and were the results of a conscious, long-term
   strategy that aimed to bring about a radical transformation of German
   society. Together they helped transform the Nazimovement into a
   flexiblemassmovement with the ability to mould an inchoate and diverse
   group of sympathisers into an integrated body of committed and skilled
   activists.},

Abstract = {Western studies have found that men tend to view their aggression as
   instrumental whereas women tend to view it in expressive terms. A
   preliminary qualitative study on an Indian sample found low internal
   consistency for these measures, and that men viewed their aggression in
   both instrumental and expressive terms. The present study used scenarios
   to examine feelings about aggression in 300 males and females in India,
   aged 16 and 26 years. Males were more likely to view aggression in terms
   of loss of control, shame for family, and acceptability, while
   16-year-olds were more likely to feel shame and embarrassment following
   aggression. These robust findings indicate that for this sample feelings
   about aggression are more complex than the two constructs, instrumental
   and expressive, can capture.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},

Pages = {203-215},
Abstract = {The present study explored the sexual, physical, psychological, and
   overall dating violence experiences, and related these experiences to
   Investment Model variables among Turkish college women. Three hundred
   and ninety dating women from four universities in Ankara, Turkey
   completed the Satisfaction, Investment, Alternatives, and Commitment
   subscales from the Investment Model Scale and the Sexual Coercion,
   Physical Assault, and Psychological Aggression subscales from the
   Revised Conflict Tactics Scale. 79.5 percent reported at least one
   incident of violence in a dating relationship within the previous year.
   Regression analyses indicated that satisfaction fully mediated the
   relations between physical, psychological, and overall dating violence
   victimization and commitment, but not for sexual victimization. The
   results suggest that future research should explore the possibility that
   the dissatisfaction women experience may be related to an increased
   likelihood of relation termination.},

Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Pages = {39-60},
Abstract = {In many conflict-affected countries local peace committees (LPCs) have
   an impact on local communities by keeping the violence down, solving
   community problems and empowering local actors to become peacebuilders.
   Of course, committees like these are confronted withmany challenges; the
   biggest challenge is that they are very dependent on the broader,
   political or conflict environment. If that environment becomes very
   polarised or violent, they will be gravely affected. LPCs are committees
   or structures formed at the level of a town or village with the aim to
   encourage and facilitate joint, inclusive peacemaking and peacebuilding
   processes within their own context. The article describes 10 examples of
   LPCs in countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Colombia and
   Afghanistan. It is remarkable to see that in those countries hundreds of
   LPCs exist, with in most cases limited impact. The article describes as
   well a broader framework of infrastructures for peace, as it is
   implemented in several countries, such as Ghana and Kenya. This is a
   promising approach. The article concludes with some conclusions and
   proposals to enhance LPCs and infrastructures for peace nationally and
   internationally.},

Abstract = {We examined women's participation in village self-governance in an
   Eastern Chinese county. While they have more or less been universally
   participating in voting in village elections, their representation in
   the village self-governance bodies remains low, and their political
   aspiration and sense of empowerment remain limited. A wide range of
   factors contribute to this situation. In general, women enjoy a much
   lower level of education and are economically dependent upon male
   members of their families. Social gender, or the stereotypes of women as
   less competent and are expected to stay away from public affairs, plays
   a very significant role too. Institutional problems, such as frauds and
   irregularities in election, lack of government's attention in promoting
   women's political roles, and the inability of state-sponsored women
   organizations to influence local governance, all contribute to
   underrepresentation and inadequate participation of women. Policy
   responses must look beyond women's electoral participation and address
   these many deep-rooted issues.},

Abstract = {This article aims to rehabilitate women campaigners against nuclear
   weapons as a focus of study and interlocutor for feminist International
   Relations scholars. Highlighting the recent tendency in gender and
   security studies to ignore or stereotype these campaigners, I first show
   how their critical re-investigation has been facilitated by recent
   systematizations of poststructuralist-influenced feminist methodology.
   In this light, I then revisit the discourses circulating in women's
   antinuclear activism in the 1980s before deconstructing in more detail
   the post-Cold War writings of Helen Caldicott and Angie Zelter. I argue
   that multiple, differently gendered constructions of the antinuclear
   campaigner were in play during the Cold War and have since been
   reconfigured in ways that reflect and reproduce the shift to a post-Cold
   War context and differences between the United States and UK. In such
   ways, then, women antinuclear campaigners continue to develop diverse
   oppositional subject positions in their efforts to challenge nuclear
   hegemony, in a discursive struggle worthy of attention from gender and
   security scholars as part of a broader, critical re-engagement with the
   gendered dimensions of nuclear politics.},

Abstract = {This article examines Estonia's economic institutions, performance and
   vulnerability to the global economic crisis in the context of the
   varieties of capitalism framework. It shows that Estonia shares many
   characteristics of a liberal market economy, but that there are also
   some features which do not fit the classical model, notably its
   corporate governance institutions. It also suggests that the varieties
   of capitalism framework can account for key features of Estonia's
   economic performance, including its growth trajectory and adjustment to
   the global financial crisis. The article also reflects on the broader
   significance of these findings for understanding post-communist
   capitalism. (C) 2013 The Regents of the University of California.

Abstract = {The decades since 1946 have seen repeated rhetoric supportive of Herbert
   Simon's critique, published that year, of Luther Gulick's Notes on the
   Theory of Organization' (published in 1937). The literature offers few
   contrary opinions against this support. The present article presents a
   minute analysis of Simon's arguments against Gulick. The reason for this
   focus is that the rhetoric supportive of Simon's critique addresses the
   manner in which he argued against Gulick. It is shown how Simon's
   critique suffers from flawed and misleading argumentation, semantic
   incoherence, naive simplicity, disproportionate emphasis, implied
   imputation, misdirected logic, historical misinterpretation, contextual
   overshooting, methodological incommensurability, false reproaches,
   misguiding charges, and an etiological approach unequipped to deal with
   complex webs of interrelationships.},

Abstract = {In this study we aim to compare the public perceptions towards informal
   patient payments in six Central and Eastern European countries
   (Bulgaria, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Ukraine). Overall,
   around 35-60\% of the general public in each country has ever made
   informal payments, though informal cash payments are perceived
   negatively, mostly as corruption. In-kind gifts are often seen as a
   token of gratitude. However, significant differences among countries are
   observed. Despite the public support for the eradication of informal
   payments, there are population groups who favor their existence and this
   should be taken into account in policy-making. (C) 2013 The Regents of

Abstract = {The trend towards flexible career arrangements has not left EU
   institutions untouched, as is manifest in the growing reliance on
   temporary and part-time officials. How does the increasing career
   hybridity within and across EU institutions affect European
   socialization, i.e. the extent to which officials embody the spirit of
   working for Europe' and adopt supranational norms? We conceptualize
   European socialization as a mutually reinforcing process shaped by the
   interaction of officials with the institutions of which they are
   members. We argue that a focus on career arrangements provides a good
   starting point as these arrangements shape individuals' interaction with
   the organization. Consequently, they generate diverging socialization
   processes which lead to different socialization products. Our empirical
   insights are based on a study of different types of career arrangements
   within the European Commission bureaucracy and specialized and
   independent EU agencies through structured and semi-structured
   interviews and surveys with officials.},

Abstract = {Civilian protection mandates in United Nations (UN) peacekeeping
   operations have become increasingly common since 1999. This article
   suggests that these mandates should be recalibrated to help build
   resilient local communities and empower civilian populations to have a
   greater say in their national governance structures. However, while
   peacekeepers could reasonably give greater emphasis to building local
   resilience, the empowerment agenda is largely beyond their means. This
   leaves some UN peacekeeping operations in the perilous position of
   working to protect civilians at the operational level without addressing
   some of the key structural conditions that give rise to violence against

Abstract = {In 2011 the heads of state of the Southern African Development Community
   (SADC) disbanded the SADC Tribunal after the regional court held that
   the Zimbabwean government's land seizures violated the rule of law. The
   disbandment reflects SADC's hierarchy of values, in terms of which the
   organization's formal commitment to human rights and a regional legal
   order is subordinate to the political imperatives of regime solidarity
   and respect for sovereignty. The Tribunal saga demonstrates that the
   jurisdiction of regional courts derives not simply from their official
   mandates but from an interplay between domestic and regional law and
   politics.},

Abstract = {The Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA), one of the best known and
   most researched terrorist organizations in history, has been
   comparatively assessed alongside various terrorist outfits from around
   the world. However, it has never been systematically compared with its
   most immediate rival, neighbour, and competitor, the lesser known
   Official Irish Republican Army (OIRA). This article addresses this
   scholarly gap and presents a thematic assessment of the similarities and
   differences between the two organisations in their respective
   post-ceasefire periods of 1972 and 1994. It proposes a new comparative
   approach to studying terrorist organisations in which knowledge about a
   better known entity (here, the PIRA) and its future trajectory is
   generated through a detailed assessment of the activities and
   developments of a not only more obscure case (here, the OIRA) but also,
   in many aspects, the most comparable case or cases. Such an approach
   could yield interesting results for the field of terrorism studies,
   which could still profit from in-depth, internal, case study analyses of
   specific terrorist organizations.},

Abstract = {This article draws upon recent findings from the field of neuroscience
   to explore how loss aversion affects foreign policy resolve. We theorize
   that U.S. policy makers are more resolute in pursuing preventive
   policies that seek to avoid losses than they are in pursuing promotive
   policies that seek to acquire new gains. To test our theory, we conduct
   the first large-n analysis of foreign policy hypotheses derived from the
   neuroscience of loss aversion using data from 100 cases of
   U.S.-initiated Section 301 trade disputes. The results provide strong
   support for the loss-aversion-based theory, revealing that American
   policy makers are willing to fight harder and hold out longer in trade
   disputes with preventive objectives than they are in cases with
   promotive ones. Our study demonstrates that hypotheses derived from
   neuroscientific findings can be tested using large-n techniques in study
   of foreign policy, revealing a new avenue of inquiry within the field.},

Abstract = {This article argues that bureaucratic capacity - the competence and
   reliability of the national bureaucracy - matters to the allocation of
   public spending among welfare state programmes since it is difficult for
   governments to justify high levels of spending on programmes that
   require bureaucrats to make case-by-case decisions, on a discretionary
   basis, if the bureaucracy is incompetent, corrupt or both. We expect
   bureaucratic capacity to have a positive effect on programmes that
   involve bureaucratic discretion, but weak or no effects on programmes
   that are more straightforward to implement. In order to test these
   hypotheses, we analyse public spending on active labour market
   programmes (which involve a lot of discretion) and parental leave
   benefits (which involve less discretion). Relying on data for twenty
   advanced democracies from the mid-1980s to the mid-2000s, we find that
   high bureaucratic capacity does have a positive effect on active labour
   market policy spending, but not on parental leave benefits.},

Abstract = {The wide-ranging varieties of capitalism literature rests on a
   particular conception of banks and banking that, the authors argue, no
   longer reflects the reality of modern financial systems. They take
   advantage of the greater information regarding bank activities revealed
   by the financial crisis to consider the reality, across eight of the
   world's largest developed economies, of the financial power of banks to
   act as bulwarks against market forces. This article offers a
   market-based banking framework that transcends the bank-based/capital
   market based dichotomy that dominates comparative political economy's
   consideration of financial systems and argues that future CPE research
   should focus on the activities of banks. By demonstrating how
   market-based banking increases market influences on the supply of
   credit, the authors highlight an underappreciated source of financial
   market pressure on nonfinancial companies (NFcs) that can have a
   potential impact across the range of issues that the varieties of
   capitalism (VoC) literature has seen as differentiating national
   systems. This approach has implications in areas such as labor, welfare,
   innovation, and flexibility.},

Abstract = {In recent years, Saudi Arabia has strengthened its regulatory and
   financial institutions and adopted many reforms concerning its business
   environment. Yet, Saudi Arabia seems an unlikely country to succeed at
   implementing business environment reforms given the presence of an
   authoritarian state and rent-seeking behavior from elites that is the
   outcome of oil wealth. What explains the ability of Saudi Arabia to
   initiate reforms that many states have struggled to implement or
   uniformly reject? This paper argues that the country's monarchical
   system helps the government solve the credible commitment problem with
   private sector elites, thereby facilitating business environment
   reforms. The monarchical system does this by legitimizing and
   reinforcing the institution of economic familism. The salience of this
   institution provides a reliable guarantee to private sector elites that
   their rents and business interests will be protected during the reform
   process. The case of Saudi Arabia stands as an important example of how
   absolute monarchies can pursue certain economic reforms, and also how an
   informal institution can solve the credible commitment problem in an
   authoritarian context where formal institutions are either absent or
   weak.},

Abstract = {Threat relates to right-wing ideological attitudes at the individual
   level. The present study aims to extend this relationship to the
   national level. More specifically, in a sample of 91 nations, we
   collected country-level indicators of threat (including inflation,
   unemployment, gross national product, homicide rate, and life
   expectancy). Moreover, we analyzed data from the European and World
   Value Survey (total N=134,516) to obtain aggregated country-level
   indicators for social-cultural and economic-hierarchical right-wing
   attitudes for each of these countries. In accordance with previous
   findings based on the individual level, a positive relationship between
   threat indicators and right-wing attitudes emerged. This relationship
   was stronger than what was usually reported at the individual level. In
   the discussion, we focus on the mutually reinforcing influence at the
   individual and national levels in terms of right-wing attitudes.},

Abstract = {According to the law of dispersion', the level of inequality in
   political participation is higher when voter turnout is low. We
   empirically test this hypothesis by evaluating levels of voter turnout
   in the 2010 Swedish election to the Vastra Gotaland county council and
   in the 2011 re-election for the same county council. The re-election
   voter turnout was reduced by almost half, from 80.6 per cent to 44.1 per
   cent. Our results support the law of dispersion: the level of inequality
   in participation substantially increased between young and old, rich and
   poor, low and high educated and politically interested and uninterested.},

Abstract = {The article deals with Jewish revolutionaries in the Russian Empire from
   the 1880s until the October Revolution of 1917, approaching them through
   the prism of their identity crisis during a period of transition. The
   author's aim is to uncover the cultural and psychological mechanisms of
   Jewish radical motivation and to elucidate the factors which led to the
   formation of a radical consciousness and to growth in radical activity.
   Some of these mechanisms are universal, while others specifically
   characterize Jewish society in Russia. Equally essential are the modes
   of transformation of traditional Jewish concepts into the specific
   elements of revolutionary ideologies.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The sovereign debt crisis and the euro crisis have prompted heads of
   state and government in Europe to intensify supranational cooperation.
   However, some political leaders and policy makers aim for more. They
   propose the introduction of a common European economic government that
   would prevent Europe from experiencing further financial threats and
   stabilise national budgets and financial markets, as well as the euro.
   The results of a survey among well-informed people imply a rather
   ambivalent attitude towards this venture. While a slim majority favours
   the general idea of centralised economic governance in Europe, or in the
   eurozone, the concrete ideas for the design of such a government are not
   popular among the respondents. A centralised macroeconomic policy, a
   common budget that is set centrally and using eurobonds as a common
   means of debt financing in the eurozone all receive limited approval.
   So, if they are aiming for more supranational cooperation, public and
   corporate policy makers need to take clear-cut steps that offer tangible
   benefits that influence public opinions favourably.},

Abstract = {The presented article tries to make sense of Vaclav Havel, a man of many
   qualities and professions yet not a professional in the conventional
   sense of the word. The aim is to offer deeper insight into diverse
   cognitive elements which formed Havel's political reasoning and
   attitudes. The idea is to provide an alternative interpretation and get
   beyond the customary explanations expressed through traditional IR
   language seeing Havel as a dissident idealist who was pushed by some
   realist impulses to clearly define real political and later also
   geopolitical stands. In doing so, the article is divided into three
   parts. The first part discusses conceptual frameworks (rather than a
   single framework) within which Have saw and understood the political
   world. The middle part examines Havel's political agenda, namely the
   issues of the return to Europe, the German question, and relationships
   with Russia, the United States and toward multilateral institutions. The
   final part that utilizes primary data obtained through personal
   interviews with many Havel's close collaborators presents two faces of
   Vaclav Havel: the dramatist and the ideologue. (C) 2013 The Regents of

Abstract = {Face-to-face diplomacy has long been the lynchpin of international
   politics, yet it has largely been dismissed as irrelevant in theories of
   cooperation and conflict-as ``cheap talk{''} because leaders have
   incentives to dissemble. However, diplomats and leaders have argued for
   years that there is often no substitute for personally meeting a
   counterpart to hash out an agreement. This article argues that
   face-to-face diplomacy provides a signaling mechanism that increases the
   likelihood of cooperation. Face-to-face meetings allow individuals to
   transmit information and empathize with each other, thereby reducing
   uncertainty, even when they have strong incentives to distrust the
   other. The human brain has discrete architecture and processes devoted
   to parsing others' intentions via cues in face-to-face interaction.
   These processes enable actors to directly access the intentions of
   others with a higher degree of certainty than economic and
   game-theoretic models of bargaining predict.},

Abstract = {This paper examines to what extent advisory activities previously
   performed inside the government have been relocated to places outside of
   government. Although this process, labelled as externalization of policy
   advice, is widely taken as a universal trend, here it is shown that
   empirical findings suggest a more complicated picture. The level of
   externalization differs across policy domains, countries and overtime.
   There are also different meanings of externalization and it has both
   quantitative and qualitative dimensions. In this article it is argued
   that the provision of policy advice can be conceptualized in terms of
   two competing processes: externalization and filling-in. The strength of
   these processes depends upon a wide range of factors. An overview of the
   empirical findings on externalization is provided and the factors
   assumed to be conducive to externalization are outlined. The article
   concludes with implications for further research, arguing that empirical
   research should be more theory-driven and enhanced by the inclusion of
   other research designs and methods. (C) 2013 Policy and Society

Abstract = {Mali has been faced with a series of uprisings by its Tuareg over a
   number of years. Although each of these rebellions was ended by a
   cease-fire, the Malian government never succeeded in instituting longer
   term peace agreements. The 2012 Tuareg rebellion has presented even more
   significant security threats. The environment in northern Mali now is
   marked by multiple armed groups, with multiple competing agendas. This
   complex situation, with Tuareg rebels, Islamists with varying goals, and
   local militias, with a pattern of varying levels of cooperation and
   conflict, will at best be very difficult to resolve in the long term.
   Combined with an almost complete security vacuum in northern Mali on the
   part of the government, this situation could be intractable even with
   external intervention. At the same time, the focus on counterterrorism
   in northern Mali may not be conducive to a long-term resolution of what
   in reality is a much more complicated security environment.},

   compare one state to another. The indicators make compliance more
   visible and amenable, both to encouragement by nongovernmental

   legalization of these norms is currently progressing. Tracing the

Abstract = {The United Nations adopted an explicitly rights-based approach to
   disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) in 2006 as part of
   its larger agendas of ``liberal peace building,{''} integrated peace
   operations, and human rights mainstreaming. Rights-based DDR represents
   yet another example of how human rights discourse, law, and practice
   manage to penetrate adjacent domains-first the development, then
   humanitarian, and now security sectors. This article examines the
   development of rights-based DDR and looks at two key limitations. It
   concludes by recommending that DDR be rights-sensitive rather than
   rights-based.},

Abstract = {Karl Marx observed long ago that all economic struggles invite moral
   struggles, or masquerade as such. The reverse may be true, too: deep
   moralpolitical conflicts may be waged through the manipulation of
   economic resources and the design of policy devices. Using the recent
   financial and Eurozone crises as empirical backgrounds, the short papers
   presented here by Philippe Steiner, Cornelia Woll, Wolfgang Streeck and
   Marion Fourcade propose four different perspectives on the play of moral
   judgments in the economy and call for a broader and more systematic
   scholarly engagement with this issue. Focusing on executive
   compensation, bank bailouts and the sovereign debt crisis, the
   discussion forum builds on a roundtable discussion held at the opening
   of the Max Planck Sciences Po Center on Coping with Instability in
   Market Societies (MaxPo) in Paris on November 29, 2012.},

Abstract = {The twenty-first century has ushered in a new era for the numerous
   social and political movements of Mapuche indigenous groups in Chile.
   Apart from distancing themselves from state institutionality and
   demanding autonomy, they have tended to reject alliances with the
   traditional left, considering it alien to indigenous subjectivities.
   Study of these various new wave movements paying particular attention to
   the relationship between indigenous and modern subjectivities suggests
   that, while the historical memory of Mapuche social and political
   organization may contribute to the creation of a powerful progressive
   social movement, the highly modernized Mapuche indigenous cultures are
   also quite compatible with an indigenous brand of neoliberalism.},

Abstract = {The paper analyses how corruption affects the Rule of Law in Slovenian
   local self-governments through qualitative analysis of corruption cases
   and interviews. We discovered that corruption, its influence on local
   society is increasing, where everyone (especially mayors) attempts to
   avoid obligations and find loopholes into the law in order to benefit.
   There is a common belief that illegal behaviour and negative
   consequences to the Rule of Law is due to human greed and the role of
   informal networks. The main consequences are increasing levels of
   negative economic effects, mistrust in public institutions, inequality
   and environmental destruction.},

Abstract = {Confidence is an understudied topic in modern economics as well as in
   modern sociology, but vital to an understanding of financial markets and
   financial crises. In this article, I suggest what a theory of confidence
   may look like that is centered around signs. With the help of this
   theoretical approach, to which I add some ideas by Walter Bagehot, I
   explore the financial crisis of 20082009 in the USA, how confidence was
   lost during the fall of 2008 in connection with the bankruptcy of Lehman
   Brothers, and especially how it was then restored in the spring of 2009.
   I conclude that the processes of loosing and restoring confidence
   differ.},

Abstract = {How do competing claims about energy-security and climate-change
   policies play out in the Brazilian domestic system? Has the Brazilian
   government's recent attempt to unite climate and energy-security
   narratives around the notion of sustainability' had a substantive impact
   on Brazil's energy and environmental policies? Domestic and
   international environmental actors have played increasingly important
   roles while lobbying the government to include an
   environmental/climate-change dimension to its energy-security
   approaches. However, climate-change concerns, as conventionally
   articulated by environmental actors, are not at the core of the
   government's energy policy agenda. Environmental results, which emerged
   in Brazil as fringe benefits of past energy-security policies, have been
   skilfully captured by the political leadership as a way to promote
   Brazil's climate-change credentials. To inform analysis of the alleged
   environmental sustainability of hydroelectricity and home-grown biofuels
   as a showpiece of Brazil's contribution to tackling climate change, the
   varied interpretations of energy security and their implications for
   climate-change interventions are explored. Empirical examination of the
   interaction between energy and climate policies in Brazil is followed by
   analysis of the Brazilian negotiating position in multilateral climate
   meetings.},

   that of Jewish orphans in the Netherlands after World War II. Kidnapping
   these children was not initially involved in their movement from
   parents' to strangers' homes; however, after the war, the State often
   refused to return some of these children to surviving Jewish kin or to
   the Jewish community. In other words, against the wishes of the
   decimated Jewish community after the Nazi genocide of the Jews, the
   postwar Netherlands government withheld Jewish children from their kin
   and from their ethnic community, keeping them in Gentile homes. I argue
   that this child withholding constitutes a form of child transfer because
   of the manner in which it was done and the reasoning behind it.},

Title = {Macroeconomic Stabilisation in the Eurozone: Lessons from Failure},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {66-73},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Three forms of macroeconomic stabilisation in the eurozone are
   considered: national macroeconomic stabilisation, debt discipline and
   eurozone-wide macroeconomic stabilisation. The eurozone started with an
   architecture that ignored the first, which it hoped - despite advice to
   the contrary - would look after itself. This article explores what
   subsequently happened before the financial crisis, during the Great
   Recession and after 2010. It argues that the failure to address the
   issue of national macroeconomic stabilisation was a crucial factor
   behind what became an existential crisis for the eurozone. However, the
   crisis has a silver lining. The rationale behind union-wide controls to
   limit fiscal deficits (the SGP and now the Fiscal Compact) no longer
   exists. Since 2010 it has become clear that eurozone members face
   greater market discipline on fiscal deficits than do countries with
   their own currency. As a result, fiscal controls and institutions to
   support them can and should reside at the national level, and can
   therefore focus on national stabilisation as well as the more long-term
   control of government debt. It is argued that this alternative to the
   current architecture is both more feasible and more desirable than a
   move towards fiscal union.},

Abstract = {The euro crisis increasingly threatens not just the European Union
   (EU's) internal economic unity but also the cogency of its international
   projection. Relatively little attention has been paid to how the euro
   crisis might affect EU foreign policy. In the future world order,
   influence will not equate with structural weight. It is something to
   celebrate if solutions to global problems come from non-Western sources,
   as long as the EU has worked to ensure that other powers approach
   problem-solving in a positive-sum fashion. Geo-strategically this is far
   more important than short-term commercial bargaining gains. Rising
   powers reject homilies on liberal internationalism, but will need to
   deal with the same challenges of cooperative security-building as their
   political responsibilities and interests accumulate. The EU needs to
   reflect not only on its immediate management of the euro crisis but also
   on how this will feed into the changing relationship between Europe and
   the wider world. This enjoins European governments to redirect their
   longer-term international policies.},

Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2013},
Number = {56},
Pages = {123+},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Unbridled litigation against the State, the constraints of State
   agencies to defend themselves in court, and repeated failures in
   judicial processes has forced the Government of Colombia not only to
   allocate substantial resources for the payment of judgments and
   settlements, at the expense of resources for social investment, but that
   has also distracted public agencies from fulfilling their core mandates
   at the service of the citizenry. As the volume of claims and their
   fiscal cost increased, public entities became aware of the high risks
   associated with any action that does not conform strictly to the
   parameters of the Constitutional clause of State liability.
   Emerging empirical evidence also shows that the problem is compounded by
   weaknesses in handling cases of State liability by State lawyers, either
   because of the lack of an active role in the evidentiary debate, the
   widespread absence of closing arguments, and even appeals against
   decisions contrary to State interest, or the lack of adequate support
   for such appeals. In many cases, lawyers appealed only as a formality to
   avoid disciplinary investigations, but did not leverage the remedy with
   the right litigation tools to ensure a successful outcome.
   Based on international experiences and local efforts over 10 years,
   Colombia launched an original legal defense policy with the
   establishment of the National Legal Defense State Agency (ANDJE), based
   on a hybrid model vis-vis concentrated/deconcentrated alternatives which
   is in line with the structure of a unitary State, decentralized by
   services and territories. However, the pending agenda remains daunting
   as the ANDJE must still develop a coherent system of legal defense,
   which would allow individual State agencies to become proactive
   litigants, and prevent and mitigate the damage caused by unlawful State
   actions.},

   doi: 10.1111/isqu.12005 (c) 2012 International Studies Association What
   types of countries have ratified the Rome Statute establishing the
   International Criminal Court? Because the court relies on state
   cooperation, it is a good example of a regime facing a participation
   problem. In order to be effective, the regime requires active members,
   but states that fear regime effectiveness will therefore find it
   potentially costly to join. We analyze the extent to which this problem
   plagues the ICC. We find that countries for whom compliance is likely to
   be easiestdemocracies with little internal violenceare the most likely
   countries to join the ICC. On the other hand, countries with the most to
   fear from ICC prosecution, nondemocracies with weak legal systems and a
   history of domestic political violence, tend to avoid ratification. We
   contrast our findings with those of a recent article by Simmons and
   Danner (2010), arguing that ratification patterns show evidence of
   credible commitments. Our analysis across a breadth of evidence, both
   descriptive and multivariate, suggests caution toward arguments about
   the impact of the ICC on global practices and provides support for the
   notion that states strategically select themselves into supranational
   judicial agreements.},

Volume = {61},

Abstract = {This article uses Sartori's classification of party systems to map
   changes in the post-war UK party system. Using measures of the effective
   number of parties and of parties' policy positions, the article shows
   that classic' two-partism from 1950 to 1970 broke down amid ideological
   polarisation. This development created a vacated centre', which the
   Liberals filled, leading to fragmentation of the electoral-party system.
   This period gave way in 1997 to one in which ideological convergence
   returned, alongside further electoral fragmentation. The uneven decline
   in the vote shares of the parties finishing first and second led to
   supermajorities and two long periods of single-party rule from 1979 to
   2010. The article argues that the UK had an alternating-predominant
   party system in this period. This system was a hybrid of single-party
   predominance and classic two-partism, in which competition between the
   two main parties was usually very weak but where there was some scope
   for governmental alternation.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the verbal content of the 2010 prime
   ministerial debates using computer-aided text analysis (CATA) and
   functional analysis. It seeks to provide reliable measures of what the
   leaders said, develop our theoretical understanding of televised debates
   in British elections, open up the 2010 debates for potential comparison
   with others, and provide additional evidence by which the democratic
   value of the debates might be assessed. The article demonstrates that
   the leaders focused more on policy than on personality, that most
   content was devoted to positive reasons for supporting parties rather
   than negative attacks on opponents, and that there was variation in the
   attention paid to general themes and specific issues and in the nature
   of the leaders' appeals to voters. The findings offer qualified support
   for issue ownership and functional theories, but knowledge of the
   specific political context remains necessary for understanding the
   content.},

Title = {Constituting China: the role of metaphor in the discourses of early
   Sino-American relations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {177-205},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper demonstrates the value of political metaphor analysis as a
   tool for answering constitutive questions in International Relations
   (IR) theory, questions that attend to how the subjects of international
   politics are constituted by encounters with other subjects through
   representational and interactional processes. To this end, I examine the
   key metaphors within American political discourse that guided and
   structured early Sino-American interactions, focusing on US Secretary of
   State John Hay's Open Door notes and the contemporaneous Chinese
   Exclusion Acts. Viewed from a social constructivist metaphor
   perspective, this metaphorical protection of free trade and great power
   privilege hid the assumption that China was unable to act as its own
   doorkeeper, obscuring debates in the domestic and international spheres
   as to the meaning of `Chinese' and the appropriate strategy for managing
   the encounter. A second approach, the cognitive perspective, builds on
   the seminal IR applications of cognitive linguistics and cognitive
   metaphor theory to reveal the deeper conceptual basis, specifically the
   CONTAINER schema, upon which this encounter was predicated. Used in
   tandem, these two approaches to the constitutive role of political
   metaphor illuminate the processes by which metaphors win out over
   competing discourses to become durable features of international social
   relations. Journal of International Relations and Development (2013) 16,

Abstract = {How do regional changes affect the process of global governance? This
   article addresses this question by examining how the International
   Monetary Fund (IMF) responded to the challenges presented by Economic
   and Monetary Union (EMU) between the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in
   1992 and the launch of the euro in 1999. Based on primary research from
   the IMF archives, the article illustrates how the IMF's efforts to
   reconfigure its relationship with European institutions evolved
   gradually through a logic of incremental change, despite initial
   opposition from member states. The article concludes that bureaucratic
   actors within international organizations will take advantage of
   informal avenues for promoting a new agenda when this fits with shared
   conceptions of an organization's mandate. The exercise of informal
   influence by advocates for change within an international organization
   can limit the options available to states in formal decision-making
   processes, even when these options cut across state preferences.},

Abstract = {The Comparative Manifestos Project (CMP) data are the most popular
   source for parties' positions on the leftright and other ideological and
   policy dimensions. Over the past few years, several researchers have
   identified various methodological problems in the CMP data, but
   third-party users rarely acknowledge them. This article classifies the
   problems associated with the CMP into four areas: (1) theoretical
   underpinnings of the coding scheme; (2) document selection; (3) coding
   reliability; and (4) scaling. The article reviews each area
   systematically and concludes with a set of recommendations regarding the
   use of the CMP data.},

Abstract = {This article addresses four assumptions behind many of the current
   theoretical and policy approaches to individual processes of Islamist
   radicalization in Europe: the association with terrorism and extremism;
   determinism; the extraordinary nature of radicals; and the reification
   of the grievance and collective identity discourse. It argues for an
   intentional and developmental, rather than structural and socio-economic
   feature-focused, approach to the explanation of the radicalization
   process, with the consideration of framing and socio-psychological
   mechanisms having an impact on individual decision-making processes, and
   for an overall, broader conceptual understanding of radicalism.},

Abstract = {It is commonly accepted that social dominance orientation (SDO) and
   right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) are potent unique predictors of a
   variety of prejudice and prejudice-related constructs. However, contrary
   to some predictions, there has been little evidence that these
   constructs interact to produce this outcomethey appear to be additive
   but not interactive in their prediction of prejudice. We extend the
   interaction hypothesis to consideration of another broadly relevant
   constructpolitical ideology. Drawing from 14 independent New
   Zealandbased samples, we show, through meta-analysis and multilevel
   random coefficient modelling, that SDO and RWA additively and
   interactively predict levels of political conservatism operationalised
   in a variety of ways. Specifically, both constructs are associated with
   increasing political conservatism, and the lowest levels of conservatism
   (or highest levels of political liberalism) are found in those lowest in
   both SDO and RWA.},

Abstract = {This article identifies how the use of the European Union (EU) mobility
   rules, as formulated by the EU's Posting Directive, has been linked to
   the temporary provision of services in practice. It demonstrates how
   this linkage, legitimised by European Court rulings, undermines the
   Directive's original intent to provide rights-based regulation of labour
   mobility in the Union. In the assessment of posting practices, striking
   findings of two studies co-conducted by the author in 2003 and 2010 are
   discussed. In the first section, the origins of the Directive are
   described, followed by sections that contextualise the posting rules in
   the framework of the fundamental economic freedoms of EU Treaties, and
   discuss the problems related to implementation and enforcement. Based on
   the Directive's definition of posting, three issues of governance and
   practice are raised: (a) regulation of the employment relationship, (b)
   application of labour conditions and (c) respect for collective
   agreements. A final section offers policy recommendations in order to
   deal with the ways in which posting governance and practices currently
   impede any vision of rights-based mobility in the EU. It is argued that
   current minimalist interpretation of the posting rules can neither
   guarantee equal treatment nor protect the rights of temporary migrant
   workers.},

Abstract = {Much recent literature in cultural, political and social geography has
   considered the relationship between identity, memory, and the urban
   landscape. This paper interrogates such literature through exploring the
   complex materialisation of memorialisation in post-Soviet Russia. Using
   the example of the statue of General Alexei Ermolov in Stavropol', an
   analysis of the cityscape reveals interethnic tensions over differing
   interpretations of the life and history of the person upon whom the
   statue is based. The existence of a rich literature on Ermolov and the
   Russian colonial experience in the North Caucasus helps to explain this.
   The symbolic cityscape of Stavropol' plays an important role in
   interethnic relations in the multi-ethnic city; it is both an arena
   through which Russian identity is communicated with people and produced
   and reproduced, and an arena through which Russian citizens compete with
   each other for authority on historical narratives that operate at and
   between a number of scales. People's readings of the cityscape can
   reveal much about power and space in contemporary Russia. (C) 2012 The

   Economy. International Studies Quarterly, doi: 10.1111/isqu.12003 (c)
   2012 International Studies Association Recent studies show that the
   democratic peace correlation is not significant once the potentially
   confounding variable that can cause both democracy and peace,
   contract-intensive economy, is considered; this pattern holds in
   analyses of wars, fatal militarized interstate conflicts (Mousseau
   2009), and interstate crises (Mousseau etal. 2013). These studies
   rescind the primary evidence for democracy being a cause of the
   democratic peace and indicate that contract-intensive economy is the
   more likely explanation for it. This article addresses all recent
   defenses of the democratic peace correlation, reports results using a
   new measure of contract flows, and extends the investigation to all
   militarized interstate conflicts. Analyses of most nations from 1961 to
   2001 show that there is no correlation of democracy with peace, and
   contract-intensive economy is one of the most powerful nontrivial
   variables in international conflict. The era of the democratic peace
   appears to be at an end, subsumed by an economic peace.},

Abstract = {Heightened levels of internal labour mobility since the European Union
   (EU)'s Eastern enlargements in 2004 and 2007 have shifted the context
   for member state policies geared towards the admission of non-EU
   workers. This article contends that the strategic use of the internal
   mobility regime by member states, as a justification for selective
   recruitment of labour from outside the EU, deserves more analytical
   attention. This contribution examines how labour migration policies
   (LMP) in the United Kingdom, France and Germany make use of the EU
   free-movement framework in current legislation, and how associated
   policy rationales are justified. In an interpretive policy analysis of
   legislative documents and decision-makers' meaning-making, as related in
   semi-structured interviews, the article identifies the logics, tools and
   rationales which link LMP to EU free movement. These links are shown to
   be highly selective and they serve common as well as nationally distinct
   governance goals. Across all three cases LMPs ascribe various degrees of
   relevance to EU internal labour supply, depending on the different skill
   levels of migrants targeted in respective policies. This shared pattern
   of economic coordination of LMP by skill level in which the EU common
   labour market plays the role of delimiting additional migration in the
   skilled and especially low-skilled segments is conflated with national
   migration control agendas. Member states draw on EU free movement to
   justify migration restrictions targeted at specific sending countries.
   As a result, the governance of the foreign workforce produces skills-
   and origin-based privileges rather than granting rights to mobile
   migrant workers in Europe.},

Title = {Democracy and Legitimacy in the European Union Revisited: Input, Output

Abstract = {Scholars of the European Union have analyzed the EU's legitimacy mainly
   in terms of two normative criteria: output effectiveness for the people
   and input participation by the people. This article argues that missing
   from this theorization is what goes on in the black box' of governance
   between input and output, or throughput'. Throughput consists of
   governance processes with the people, analyzed in terms of their
   efficacy, accountability, transparency, inclusiveness and openness to
   interest consultation. This article defines and discusses this third
   normative criterion as well as the interaction effects of all three
   normative criteria. It does so by considering EU scholars' institutional
   and constructivist analyses of EU legitimacy as well as empirical cases
   of and proposed solutions to the EU's democracy problems. The article
   also suggests that unlike input and output, which affect public
   perceptions of legitimacy both when they are increased or decreased,
   throughput tends to be most salient when negative, because oppressive,
   incompetent, corrupt or biased practices throw not just throughput but
   also input and output into question.},

Abstract = {In extremely weak states, why are some civil society organisations
   better at providing health care than others? The case of health-care
   provision in the Kivu provinces of the eastern DRC provides a useful
   context in which to examine this question. Faced with the negative
   effects of more than 15 years of conflict, civil society organisations
   are the only institutions capable of providing social services. This
   article uses a series of case studies of local, faith-based health-care
   providers to argue that a number of historical, demographic and
   institutional factors cause some groups to develop stronger social
   capital networks than others. This in turn affects the degree of
   effectiveness that an organisation will have in providing social
   services in the state's absence. In doing so, they effectively
   substitute for the state in its role as a provider and regulator of
   public goods.},

Abstract = {Overcoming the limits of the New Labour project requires both a
   re-examination of its strengths and weaknesses relative to those of Old
   Labour, and a serious reflection on the content of the
   MilibandPoulantzas debate that established the international reputation
   of the present leader's father. From both sources, it is clear that this
   generation of Labour leaders need to turn party policy deliberately
   leftwards again, and to engage in a progressive hegemonic campaign in
   support of that shift prior to the next election. For only if Labour
   returns to office with an electoral base mobilised to support a
   fundamental resetting of power can the party ever hope to escape the
   dull logic of Labourism so criticised by Ralph Miliband and his academic
   followers. The thesis of this article is that now is the time for one
   generation of a famous Labour family to disprove the pessimistic thesis
   of its earlier generation.},

Abstract = {This contribution presents a detailed methodological discussion on the
   empirical study of political representation. It confronts Saward's
   conceptualization of the representative claim with the method of claims
   analysis, developed by Koopmans and Statham. Drawing on Saward, the
   contribution emphasizes the theoretical need to study the act of
   representation in the form of claims through which connections between
   representatives and represented are made. Drawing on Koopmans and
   Statham, the contribution stresses an empirical focus on public spheres
   in which claims are located. While theory of representation so far
   remains overly complex in light of the reality of representation in the
   public sphere, the empirical analysis of claims ignores theoretically
   important aspects of representation. The theoretically informed and
   empirically viable methodological approach of representative claims
   analysis (RCA) is therefore proposed to facilitate future inquiry.},

Abstract = {As with standard models of rationality, theorists generally treat
   prospect theory's demonstration of risk aversion in gains but risk
   tolerance in losses as domain-general. Yet evolutionary psychology
   suggests that natural selection has designed a domain specific cognitive
   architecturewith systems specialized for some substantive domains but
   not others. Here we address risky choices through that lens asking
   whether humans' risk responses dispose them to enter social
   relationships even when doing so is counter to normative rationality and
   regardless of whether the enter versus not enter choice is framed as
   between gains and losses. Laboratory findings in five sites across three
   countries provide a positive answer to both possibilities. Participants
   could enter or not enter inherently risky social relationships. They
   were more willing to enter such relationships than rational choice
   models would predict and were equally so willing regardless of whether
   equivalent alternatives were framed as gains and as losses. With the
   social context extracted in otherwise identical games, participants'
   risk responses were consistent with prospect theory. The present
   findings suggest the possibility of adaptations designed to facilitate
   socialitydespite its risks and how those risks are framed.},

Title = {POLICY AND GENDER IN ADULT SOCIAL CARE WORK},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {91},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {159-173},
Abstract = {There are inherent tensions between government policy on adult social
   care work in England and the practice of that care work. This paper
   locates these tensions within the masculine model of professionalization
   contained in English adult social care policy and its interpretation by
   a largely female workforce. We situate our analysis within critical
   realism, exploring street level bureaucracy in manager and care worker
   policy interpretations. We argue that their exercise of agency draws
   substantially upon gender structures. Managers espouse policy while
   reproducing gender to construct care work as low in skill and status.
   Care workers, whose views are often neglected, transform gender to
   resist this positioning of their work. Our contribution is to question
   policy's effectiveness given its disregard of gender and its consequent
   disconnect from those practising adult social care. In so doing, we also
   advance understanding of street level bureaucracy.},

Abstract = {During the first two decades after the collapse of communism, 37
   political parties won representation in the Czech, Slovak, or Hungarian
   Parliaments. By 2012, 22 of these parties had failed in the sense that
   they have fallen below the 5\% electoral threshold at least once. This
   set of failed parties includes a wide range of parties, from the far
   right and nationalist flanks to unreconstructed communists, including
   centre, green, agrarian, Christian, and social democrat parties. Some
   were represented in parliament for one term only; others were in
   parliament for two decades. In this article, we explore how and why
   these parties fell out of parliament. Beyond the obvious answer - that
   they failed to win enough votes - five factors involve particularly high
   political risk for political parties. Two system-level factors are
   somewhat beyond the control of the smaller parties: changes in the
   salience of cleavages and the electoral system. However, the other three
   are directly linked to the parties' strategies for competition: whether
   they participate in coalition government as a junior partner, how they
   manage internal dissent, and the party's organisational strength.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},

Pages = {459-475},
Abstract = {Solidarity is an important idea behind European integration. The Lisbon
   Treaty advanced the understanding of the concept by establishing three
   dimensions: solidarity between member states, member states and
   individuals, and between generations. However, the knowledge about
   solidarity is incomplete and its conceptualization in the EU legal order
   needs to be further developed. This article aims at deepening the
   knowledge about solidarity in the EU by eliciting its rationales and
   scope of application. It will be concluded that solidarity is developed
   to different extent in different fields of law. It is most advanced in
   socio-economic law, but underdeveloped in areas of law that are new to
   the EU legal order: solidarity in the event of environmental disasters
   and solidarity with future generations. Reasons for the different depths
   of solidarity will be elicited, as well as possible means to overcome
   inhibitors to transnational solidarity.},

   INTERESTS},
Series = {Research in Race and Ethnic Relations},

Abstract = {Purpose - Cory Booker will likely step down as mayor of Newark in 2014
   or 2018. When he does, the possibility of a strong Latino candidate
   emerging is quite likely. There are a number of black politicians who
   would like to succeed Booker as well. This chapter identifies eight
   potential successors to Booker and assesses their ability to create a
   multiracial electoral coalition using prior vote performance in citywide
   elections.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study regresses district (or
   precinct) level vote preferences for the aforementioned potential
   successors in previous elections on the racial and ethnic composition of
   the district, using voter district demographic data from 2000 and 2010 1
   compiled by the US Census Bureau and the Minnesota Population Center.
   Findings - There is a decade's worth of evidence suggesting racially
   polarized voting among blacks and Latinos in Newark. The racialized
   black and Latino candidates examined in this chapter had much stronger
   support in districts with large coethnic populations. In contrast, the
   more deracialized candidates often had softer support in districts with
   high concentrations of coethnic voters, but often performed better in
   districts with higher concentrations of non-coethnics.
   Originality/value - While the author cautions against reading too much
   into the findings, the results do portend a future of racially polarized
   voting in Newark, especially as the city's population diversifies and as
   different factions vie for power.},

Abstract = {Starting from an indication of the problematic nature of the
   relationship between religion and the state, this paper examines
   political debates on the headscarf and face veil in three liberal states
   - Germany, France, and Belgium - between 2003 and 2011. It shows the
   significant commonalities - despite both the different arrangements
   between religion and the state and also despite the radically different
   political, social, and linguistic situations in these countries. The
   political debates are hostile and assert that fundamental values closely
   related to national identity, societal values, and human rights are
   threatened by what the headscarf or face veil represents. The similarity
   of argumentation shows that, whether the country has a doctrine of
   laicite or is more overt about the links between religion and the state,
   the liberalism of each has reached the limits of the `alien religiosity'
   which politicians say their country can bear.},

Abstract = {To what extent do China's non-profit and voluntary organizations have
   the capacities to represent effectively the interests of their
   constituents? In this paper, we examine the prevalence of various
   representational dimensions in these organizations. Our survey findings
   provide evidence that, other things being equal, an organization's
   levels of descriptive and participatory representation have a positive
   and significant impact on its levels of substantive and symbolic
   representation. Our findings also show that organizational type matters:
   social organizations are more substantively and symbolically
   representative than private non-enterprise organizations, whereas
   advocacy-oriented organizations are more symbolically representative
   than those that are not advocacy-oriented. Our case studies further
   illustrate how the typical advocacy-oriented organization differs from
   the service-oriented organization in the development of its
   `representational mix', how an organization's `representational mix'
   evolves over time, and how the relationship between the organization and
   its supervisory agency affects its various representational dimensions.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3},
Pages = {600-602},
Abstract = {Much of what exists in print about Boyd are not his own ideas but those
   of interpreters from numerous perspectives, both civilian and military.
   Since most commentators never sat through his briefings, separating Boyd
   from his interpreters complicates things greatly. Boyd was a synthesizer
   who roamed through military history, philosophy and science to question
   and inspire. He wanted people to be creative, think differently and
   better, and find new ways to solve problems. Though we may bemoan his
   shortcomings, his accomplishments cannot be separated from his
   eclecticism. Osinga and Hasik show the way toward a more conventional

Abstract = {China has showed its eagerness in using its economic strength in the
   very recent years. Is China going to be a major sanctioning state like
   the United States or the European Union? This chapter argues that
   although there have been an increasing number of economic sanctions
   imposed by China with its expanding national interests and growing
   diplomatic problems, China will still keep a low profile in using
   economic sanctions because of the restraining factors such as the WTO
   rules, inherent problems in its economy, the pursuit of a good
   reputation and its strategy of peaceful development. Thus the frequency
   and tactics of using economic sanctions may vary according to its rising
   economy and changing international situation, but that will go in a very
   limited way.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},

Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {73-89},
Abstract = {After the defeat of the Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe
   (TCE) in the French and Dutch referendums, governments across Europe had
   little appetite for popular votes on the Lisbon Treaty. Indeed, nine of
   the ten countries which were committed to (or had held) referendums on
   the TCE got around such votes on Lisbon. The article investigates how it
   was possible for governments in these nine countries to avoid putting
   the treaty to the people despite the precedent set by the TCE. It will
   be argued that three factors were crucial in this regard: first, the
   European-level collusion between governments; second, domestic political
   changes during the `period of reflection': and third, governing
   strategies of depoliticising the decisions against referendums. Thus,
   the politics of avoiding referendums could only succeed due to the
   interplay between the determined agency of governments at the European
   and domestic levels and auspicious domestic contexts of ratification.},

   of locally engaged staff, as well as the dangers of overdependence; the
   use of interns; and methods of grievance redress. We also consider how
   the major powers try to influence receiving states to change or pursue
   policies that favor the major power's interests through advocacy as well
   as public diplomacy, in contrast to developing countries, which usually
   work within the system, and how such actions stretch the provisions of
   the 1961 Vienna Convention. We consider the complex management
   challenges for embassies and efforts to improve performance, applying
   methods borrowed from the corporate world.},

   through Solidarity to Immunity},
Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {253-264},
Abstract = {This study explores the process of cumulative `symbolic sublimation' of
   power within secular formations as it unfolded through the formative
   phases that saw in Western Europe the rise and consolidation of patterns
   first of state sovereignty (within early modernity) and then of social
   solidarity (within late, colonial and postcolonial modernity). It spells
   out the process of symbolic sublimation through which secular power
   justifies itself in cultural terms, by effecting the simultaneous
   mutation and occultation of traditional symbols in order to underwrite
   sovereignty and solidarity. Finally, it shows that symbolic sublimation,
   particularly in the current phase that witnesses the erosion of both
   sovereignty and solidarity, can no longer disguise wider patterns of
   connectedness within social relations that are irreducible to either
   modernist formation. This contemporary stage of the `secular' in the
   post-colonial era is analysed by reference to political and judicial
   decisions on issues related to the Islamic headscarf and responses
   thereto. It reveals the extent to which `immunity', the obverse more
   than the antithesis of community, is both the long-term vector and the
   ultimate outcome of both sovereignty and solidarity as the two historic
   arrows of the `secular'.},

Abstract = {The threat posed by nuclear weapons to world peace need not be
   exaggerated. Advancement in science and technology has enabled us to go
   for a complete annihilation of not only the Homo sapiens but all the
   species on earth. Should we permit our idiocy entangled with the nuclear
   weapons to destroy us or should we, the thinking animals, permit our
   wisdom to outlive the demonic nuclear weapons, is a question that is
   being asked by sensible people all over the world today. Just public
   denouncement of weapons of mass destruction is un-utilitarian. Mankind
   has been hearing such hollow, absurd words ever since the first atomic
   test. We have been feeding ourselves on a diet of hypocrisy. If it is
   not that what else is CTBT? Should the world permit demons to chant
   mantra? Isn't it time to recognize that the world is governed not by
   saints but by Satans? (This is because rise and fall of civilizations
   has taught us that might is still right.) Isn't it time to understand
   that only a metamorphosis of the Satans into saints can save the world?
   If we know that well, we should start thinking how the nuclear Satans
   could be transformed into nuclear saints and it is only logical that the
   nuke Satans should take initiative in transforming themselves, which
   alone would salvage the world. The present study is premised on these
   assumptions.},

Abstract = {Public administration has undergone a fundamental change in China since
   Deng Xiaoping initiated a process of openness and reform in the late
   1970s. While reform is widespread in Greater China (China, Taiwan, Hong
   Kong, and Macau), only limited scholarship has been conducted to
   theorize these changes and empirically document them. This is somewhat
   surprising given the growing international prominence of China as a
   major powerhouse in the world economy and a political leader. This
   symposium seeks to contribute towards building knowledge and evidence on
   the changing nature of public administration in Greater China. In this
   article, key themes unique to Greater China are drawn out, the emergent
   status of public administration scholarship in China is discussed, and
   the key ingredients of a research agenda are presented.},

Volume = {91},

Abstract = {Public Administration (PA) as a field of study in China has made
   tremendous strides over the last three decades. This paper provides an
   overview of PA research in China from a sample of 2,877 articles
   published in six top PA journals in mainland China and Taiwan between
   1998 and 2008. Our analysis based on these journal publications reveals
   several critical shortcomings of PA research in China in research
   reporting, approaches, and methodologies, pointing to a long journey
   ahead before the full potential of such research can be unleashed. Our
   comparison of journal publications between mainland China and Taiwan
   suggests that scholars in Taiwan have made great strides in improving
   quality of research in a short period of time, and that such experience
   could provide their colleagues across the Taiwan Strait with valuable
   insights into the future direction of the field.},

   Analyzing policy configurations with fuzzy-set/QCA},
Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {32},

Abstract = {The paper investigates policy conditions for high rates of non-standard
   employment in Korea and Japan exploiting fs/QCA (fuzzy-set Qualitative
   Comparative Analysis). We first review the previous literature on labor
   market risks and discuss the advantages of taking a configurational
   approach in investigating policies related to increase of non-standard
   workers. Secondly, non-standard employment in Korea and Japan are
   examined more closely in comparison with other OECD countries. In case
   of Korea, a low level of statutory minimum wage in combination with
   strict employment protection legislation for permanent workers is
   suggested as the sufficient condition for high rate of non-standard
   employment rate. In case of Japan, a low level of statutory minimum wage
   in combination with weak employment protection legislations for
   temporary workers is suggested to lead to a high level of non-standard
   employment rate. We empirically test which policy configurations cause
   high rate of non-standard employment and discuss (i) the importance of
   examining multiple policies together and (ii) that there can be
   different pathways to the same outcome. (C) 2013 Policy and Society

Number = {10},
Pages = {1425-1442},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {This article seeks to refine the joint decision trap model by
   introducing additional time-based exit mechanisms. The procrastination
   of decisions, temporary derogation, and transitory compensation enable
   European Union (EU) member states to escape gridlock by distributing the
   costs and benefits of a decision over the time axis. In addition,
   time-based mechanisms not only help to overcome stalemate in
   policy-making, they also lock member states into a policy regime that
   may gradually be strengthened once delayed measures take effect. We
   demonstrate the workings of time-based strategies for the case of the
   EU's Emission Trading System (EU ETS). Given the diversity of EU member
   states' interests, the evolution of a mandatory and increasingly
   ambitious EU ETS presents a puzzle for EU scholars. While established
   exit mechanisms do not provide conclusive explanations for the case of
   the EU ETS, we argue that time-based strategies were key to move the
   EU's policy on emission trading forward.},

Title = {Fit and Feasible: Why Democratizing States Form, not Join, International
   Organizations},

Abstract = {Does democratization make states join existing international
   organizations (IOs)? Previous research suggests that democratization
   increases a state's propensity to join IOs capable of assisting in the
   distribution of public goods and establishing credibility for domestic
   reforms. We argue that this is not the case. Instead, recent
   democratization has a strong effect on a state's propensity to form new
   IOs. Since democratizing states face different governance problems than
   established democracies, existing IOs may not be a good fit.
   Additionally, established democracies might hesitate to allow
   democratizing states membership in the most lucrative existing IOs,
   thereby making immediate accession to such IOs not feasible.
   Quantitative analysis shows that democratization has a strong and
   consistently positive effect on the probability of forming a new IO, but
   not on the probability of joining an existing IO. The findings suggest
   that international cooperation theorists should begin to analyze forming
   new and joining existing IOs as alternative strategies that states can
   use to achieve their policy goals.},

Abstract = {This article argues that there is little evidence supporting the
   existence of the often praised, and allegedly subtle and successful
   Dutch approach' to stabilisation and counter-insurgency operations in
   Iraq or Afghanistan. It denounces the uncritical use of the term and
   refutes suggestions of historical and cultural roots to such an
   approach, for instance in Dutch colonial warfare in the Indonesian
   archipelago. It concludes by explaining the true conditions that gave
   rise to this notion, which seems to feed into a gratifying national
   self-image of the Dutch as non-martial, conflict averse and tolerant,
   rather than offering an original and successful formula for countering
   insurgencies.},

Abstract = {In recent years the concept of the border has been reconceptualised:
   borders are no longer viewed primarily as static lines at the outer edge
   of the state, but increasingly as mobile, bio-political and virtual
   apparatuses of control. While such a reconceptualisation resonates with
   western border security practices, however, it is vulnerable to the
   critique that such a totalising vision of sovereign space does not take
   into account the varied responses, resistances and contestations among
   populations targeted by those bordering practices. This article responds
   to such a critique by developing an interlocking account of the gendered
   and racialised logics that condition the possibility for contemporary
   border security practices. We illustrate our approach via an analysis of
   two visions of contemporary British society and border politics: one
   offered by Prime Minister David Cameron in his Muscular liberalism'
   speech delivered in February 2011; the other contained in Chris Morris'
   jihadist comedy Four Lions'.},

Abstract = {This paper considers the political geography of localism and reviews the
   insights of geographers regarding localism and locality. It identifies
   three main approaches to locality in Human Geography. Regional
   geographers, humanistic geographers and spatial scientists view
   localities as relatively natural phenomena. Marxist and
   political-economic geographers view localities as social phenomena
   produced by uneven capitalist development. Post-structuralist
   geographers view localities as characteristically open, plural and
   dynamic. The paper also distinguishes three sets of political localism
   to be found in human-geographical literatures. First, localism describes
   seemingly natural ways of life - organised to maximise authentic
   experiences of place in the case of Humanistic Geography and to minimise
   the friction of distance in the case of spatial science. Second,
   localism describes cultural-political expressions of spatial divisions
   of labour, including local political cultures, local proactivity in the
   context of large-scale economic restructuring, and actually existing,
   variegated, local neoliberalisations. Third, localism describes
   struggles to produce locally scaled action, including projects of local
   autonomy and self-sufficiency directed against the central state,
   movements to defend collective consumption from developers, coalitions
   to defend fixed capital against devaluation, and state downscaling to
   regulate capitalism. To illustrate their usefulness, some of these
   insights are applied to the localism agendas of recent British
   governments.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the inability of the Commonwealth and State
   Governments in Australia to affect significant progress on water reform
   is largely a product of their inability to win the hearts and minds of
   rural communities; a failure to understand the importance of localism.
   Hitherto, the failure to bring the politics back in and integrate
   community voices into the process of policy development has proved the
   major obstacle to the achievement of a balanced social and environmental
   perspective in the Murray Darling Basin (MDB) and has served to
   reinforce traditional prejudices. This article makes four main
   contributions to the study of communities experiencing stress. Firstly,
   we present the case for deep local democratization in times of stress.
   Secondly, we build on a diagnostic tool - the Can do Like to Enabled to
   Asked to Responded to (CLEAR) model - to evaluate the effectiveness of
   the consultation process underpinning the Guide to the Murray Darling
   Basin Plan (MDBP) and apply it to the Forbes consultation. Thirdly and
   fourthly, we use the findings from this evaluation to identify
   principles of community engagement which provide the best possible
   conditions for effective social mobilization and the capabilities that
   are necessary to deliver effective citizen-centric policy outcomes in
   communities experiencing high levels of stress},

Abstract = {This article examines various forms of new terrorism, specifically the
   structure of leaderless resistance, in connection with Robert Michels'
   idea of the iron law of oligarchy. It is usually argued that leaderless
   resistance movements lack some of the typical obstacles of terrorist
   (and other) organizations, given their non-hierarchical and
   comparatively fluid natures. However, a new form of oligarchy develops
   in this type of movement, located in the propagation of key ideological
   concepts/arguments/symbols, the assigning of target preferences, and the
   elevation or demotion of others within the movement broadly. Rather than
   oligarchy forming via the material assets of organizations, an
   ideational oligarchy is created that shapes the goals of leaderless
   resistance movements: those leaders who are already established, and who
   control the means of communicating the movement's ideas to the widest
   audience, will impede the growth of groups and individuals within the
   movement that attempt to supplant their role. This article will use the
   examples of certain eco-terror groups (the Animal Liberation Front and
   the Earth Liberation Front) to explicate this development.},

Abstract = {The contextualisation of Hans Morgenthau's thought has been
   significantly advanced in recent years. Uncovering the intellectual
   relationships Morgenthau had with Max Weber, Friedrich Nietzsche,
   members of the Frankfurt School, or even Carl Schmitt has not only
   revealed the development of political discourses in the Weimar Republic,
   but it has helped to rectify interpretational shortcomings of realism
   and encouraged scholarship to apply realist principles to twenty-first
   century world politics. Despite this comprehensive contextualisation,
   the `thinking partnership' between Morgenthau and Hannah Arendt has
   attracted so far only rhapsodic elaborations. This neglect is surprising
   because, at a time when the financial crisis in Western democracies is
   gradually turning into a crisis of democracy itself, a close reading of
   them offers a kind of social criticism whose implications are worthy of
   consideration.},

Title = {Two-Way Democracy: the Non-Place of the Enterprise in Civil Society},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2013},
Number = {57},
Pages = {67+},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {With his proposal for two-way democracy, Jurgen Habermas introduces into
   the core of democratic theory the potential of social change and
   transformation inherent in civil society, a value that the current
   globalization process makes explicit in its full potential. The
   subsequent development of deliberative democracies has gradually
   specified the viability of this proposal both in the strength of the
   associative system and in the influence of public opinion and its
   numerous spheres. Yet this definition of civil society appears to
   exclude precisely those spaces where power is most forcefully produced
   and reproduced. This is the case of the economic sphere and of the
   enterprise as its basic institution.
   The aim of the present article is to offer a critical analysis of the
   place that enterprises -particularly transnational companies- do, can
   and should occupy in a global civil society. The challenge lies in
   putting forward a broad concept of civil society that allows us to
   identify the power these global actors hold and their responsibility as
   agents of justice, without renouncing a critical perspective; in other
   words, identifying their place in the distribution of responsibilities
   for what is public that every democratic system is assumed to have.
   The response is given from an ethical perspective whose reconstructive
   methodology enables us to approach the institutional structure of civil
   society; specifically from a renewed discourse ethics that, building on
   the proposal of Habermas, can both justify its critical perspective and
   propose ideas for it implementation, ideas that are always linked to the
   development of new spaces for participation and the deliberate search
   for agreements. These brief lines aim to make a modest contribution from
   moral and political philosophy to the necessary interdisciplinary debate
   on the public dimension in civil society, and on the possibilities for
   its democratization in our complex, plural and global societies.},

Title = {``A Very Transcendental Power': Denaturalisation and the Liberalisation
   of Citizenship in the United Kingdom},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3},
Pages = {637-655},

Abstract = {The right to strip citizenship from (denaturalise) those deemed disloyal
   or dangerous is a significant but largely unexamined power held by some
   liberal states. Since 2002, the British government has, in response to
   concerns about terrorism and value of citizenship, expanded its power to
   denaturalise certain categories of citizens, including those born in the
   UK. This development seems odd in the light of academic literature that
   has described a recent trend in Europe towards the increasing
   liberalisation' of citizenship. Writing on the subject of citizenship
   acquisition, scholars have pointed to a range of changes that curtail
   the state's ability to withhold citizenship from resident non-citizens.
   In this article, I draw upon parliamentary debates, archived documents,
   government reports and secondary literature, to chart the historical
   development of denaturalisation power in the UK and consider the extent
   to which it has been shaped by liberal principles. This history
   indicates that denaturalisation had indeed undergone a process of
   liberalisation before the Labour government partly reversed its
   direction after 2002. Yet it also shows that liberal principles, far
   from simply curtailing the state's powers to strip citizenship, have
   been deeply implicated in recent and historical attempts to expand
   denaturalisation power by British governments.},

Abstract = {The toolbox of governments increasingly resembles a set of informational
   cues and prompts. Governments and other public sector organisations
   realise that the traditional tools of government, such as law and
   finance, need a supportive informational context to be effective. Recent
   developments in British government show that the distinction between
   nudge-like interventions and the traditional policy instruments cannot
   be sustained. These informational resources have increased the capacity
   of government and they can help alleviate the problems of top-down forms
   of intervention. In short, an informational focus to the tools of
   government can enhance more traditional forms of intervention.},

Abstract = {Governments are concerned about the dangers posed by ballistic missiles.
   However, there is almost no theoretical or empirical scholarship on
   ballistic missiles. This article presents and tests the conventional
   wisdom that the spread of ballistic missiles makes conflict more likely.
   Original data on ballistic missiles and on crisis initiation is
   collected, and analysis using a variety of statistical models is
   conducted. It is found that among all directed dyads from 1946 to 2007,
   potential challengers possessing ballistic missiles are significantly
   more likely to initiate international crises. Further, potential targets
   armed with ballistic missiles are significantly less likely to be
   challenged. Crises are less likely to escalate when targets are armed
   with missiles. The results are obtained after accounting for several
   control variables. Analysis reveals that the findings are not affected
   by possible endogeneity bias. The analysis also reveals complex
   interactive effects between ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons on
   the onset of international crises.},

Abstract = {Can general mechanisms governing social life (necessity) and the
   possibility of multiple outcomes in socio-historical processes
   (contingency) be incorporated into a single theoretical framework? In
   recent years, the critical realist philosophy of science has emerged as
   an intellectual strand within international relations (IR) that makes
   theoretical claims about necessary social processes while recognizing
   the irreducible role of contingency. However, critical realist scholars
   treat contingency as an externality', thereby declining to theorize
   social processes that result in contingent outcomes. Here, it is argued
   that contingency emerges out of the combination of events and processes
   as theorized by the law of uneven and combined development. This
   provides a general conceptualization that treats differentiated
   historical outcomes, and their contingencies, as inherent to human
   development. Out of these assumptions a workable approach to historical
   sociology in IR can be developedone predicated upon uncovering the form
   of historical combination', the contingent fusion of elements, in
   international systems.},

Abstract = {Discourse analysis is employed to explore the discursive terrain of an
   environmental dispute concerning proposals for an opencast coalmine in
   West Yorkshire, England. Three dominant discourses are entangled in a
   framing contest over the nature of nature' as the consequential
   construction will have profound implications for the planning process
   and the people involved. The case study is particularly attentive to the
   notion of local identity, and how local actors employ strategic
   representations of nature to defend and transcend their sense of place.
   This is demonstrated by local opposition whereby the essentialism of
   nature and scale has been effectively challenged throughout the dispute.
   The study also elucidates the complex relationship between local and
   trans-local mobilisation, and how a form of grassroots realpolitik has
   enabled two protest groups to unite and advance an amalgamated discourse
   of opposition in order to achieve the common objective of keeping the
   coal underground.},

Title = {The Domestic Politics of Protecting Human Rights in Counter-Terrorism:
   Poland's, Lithuania's, and Romania's Secret Detention Centers and Other
   East European Collaboration in Extraordinary Rendition},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},
Year = {2013},

Abstract = {Three countries in Eastern Europe, Poland, Lithuania, and Romania,
   hosted secret detention sites for the benefit of the Central
   Intelligence Agency's (CIA's) interrogation program from about 2002 to
   2006. All three countries initially denied with indignation these
   allegations. In the past five years, Poland moved toward prosecution as
   a result of a Supreme Court decision ordering declassification of
   documents, which resulted since 2008 in an ongoing prosecutorial
   investigation likely to indict the former Interior Minister and possibly
   others. While Lithuania's parliament identified plans for a site, it
   claimed to not know whether it was used, and prosecution was aborted.
   Romania's secret prison became the host not only to second-tier,
   high-value detainees of the CIA, but after Poland shut down its site, to
   the most dangerous detainees, who were tortured in the basement of the
   National Security Archives Building in Bucharest. Romania's three
   governmental branches continue to deny that it ever collaborated with
   the CIA or that such a site even existed. This essay analyzes this
   variation in the domestic responses of these three countries, as well as
   other CIA collaborations with Bosnia, Kosovo, and Macedonia. It argues
   that international pressure was a necessary condition for domestic
   political processes, especially in the legislative and judicial branches
   supervising executive actions. However, the strength of the latter two
   branches, along with the type of political class and civil society, will
   explain the strongest reform process in Poland, the medium-range
   response in Lithuania, and the nonresponse of denial by Romania.},

Abstract = {An increase in the European Parliament's (EP) powers is generally
   equated with more democratic and legitimate law-making. However,
   analysis of the Data Retention Directive - negotiated by means of both
   consultation and codecision - suggests that although the EP has been
   empowered under codecision its capacity to translate citizens' demands
   into democratic and transparent outputs has been reduced. Against
   expectations, the EP did not use its new veto powers in the data
   retention case to maximize its policy preferences because the content of
   these preferences did not fit with the wider need to be seen as a
   responsible' legislator. An institutionalist approach drawing upon
   rational choice and constructivism helps to explain this seemingly
   anomalous outcome in the highly politicized Area of Freedom, Security
   and Justice (AFSJ).},

Abstract = {This commentary points to the poor state of empirical measures of the
   quality of states, that is, executive branches and their bureaucracies.
   Much of the problem is conceptual, as there is very little agreement on
   what constitutes high-quality government. The commentary suggests four
   approaches: (1) procedural measures, such as the Weberian criteria of
   bureaucratic modernity; (2) capacity measures, which include both
   resources and degree of professionalization; (3) output measures; and
   (4) measures of bureaucratic autonomy. It rejects output measures and
   suggests a two-dimensional framework of using capacity and autonomy as a
   measure of executive branch quality. This framework explains the
   conundrum of why low-income countries are advised to reduce bureaucratic
   autonomy while high-income ones seek to increase it.},

Abstract = {Analysis of newspaper reporting on the topic of energy security in eight
   countries - four from the global North (France, Germany, the UK, and the
   United States) and four from the global South (China, India, Brazil, and
   South Africa) - produces no support for the thesis that news is
   disseminated from core countries to the periphery and semi-periphery.
   There is an important difference between China and the other three
   fast-developing countries and a highly asymmetric flow of news not
   aligned to old core-periphery boundaries. In general, energy security is
   mainly covered in trade and business outlets and less in newspapers with
   mass circulation, indicating that the topic is still an elite concern.
   In some instances, attention has surged at the same time in different
   countries. But very few of these instances show a homogenous coverage
   across countries. Despite increasingly globalised media, news is created
   and consumed at a national level.},

Abstract = {In southern Mexico today there is a clash between two spatial projects
   that are increasingly inimical to one another. On the one hand, capital
   is seeking to expand and transform the region into a new pole of
   accumulation. On the other hand, indigenous communities are vigorously
   struggling against the dispossession that this would entail and
   defending their claims to territory, often through the conscious
   creation of counter-spaces. In doing so, they are raising fundamental
   questions about the meaning of democracy, development, and
   multiculturalism and the role of class struggle in informing these
   issues.},

Abstract = {Participatory budgeting, which originated in southern Brazil, entails an
   important reworking of the public sphere. The deliberative democracy of
   the `Brazilian model' is, however, less readily replicated, even within
   Brazil itself, than many enthusiasts recognise. A crucial feature of
   Brazilian urban politics is the relative weakness of political society
   in terms of both redistribution (of resources and dignity) and
   co-optation (of dissident civic activists). In some other parts of the
   global South, including India and South Africa, the strengths of
   political society inhibit the emergence of a public sphere along the
   lines of the `Brazilian model'.},

Abstract = {As far back as Thucydides, scholars have hypothesized that power affects
   the onset of conflict. Despite its importance, power remains a difficult
   concept to measure, and scholars have primarily relied on material
   measures that quantify the internal resources available to a state. This
   concentration on internal sources of power, however, excludes an
   important power resource available to a state: its external relations.
   It is reasonable to expect that when a state estimates the power of a
   potential opponent it looks not only at the internal resources but also
   at the power of states that would likely join the conflict. In this
   article, we develop a new measure of external power that explicitly
   accounts for the external sources of state power. Unlike previous
   studies that aggregate a state's expected alliance contributions, our
   measure is based on the expected contribution of all states, allies and
   non-allies alike. We conduct a preliminary test of this new measure on
   dispute onset, and our results provide support for power preponderance
   over balance of power theories. External power parity contributes to
   dispute onset rather than deterrence. In addition, we show that
   examining the combined, rather than individual, effects of external and
   internal power produces some intriguing results, suggesting that one
   state's internal power preponderance can be offset by another state's
   preponderance of external power. These results altogether suggest that
   further studies examining the role of external power can produce
   fruitful results.},

Abstract = {In 2012, the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) recorded 32 armed
   conflicts with a minimum of 25 battle-related deaths. This is a
   significant decrease from the 37 recorded in 2011. Overall, the 2000s
   has been the least conflict-ridden decade since the 1970s. A worrying
   finding, however, is that the number of internationalized intrastate
   conflicts continued to be at a high level for the fourth consecutive
   year. At six, the number of wars - conflicts leading to 1,000 or more
   battle-related deaths - remained the same as in 2011. In total, UCDP
   estimates that the conflicts that were active in 2012 caused between
   37,175 (low estimate) and 60,260 (high estimate) battle-related deaths,
   with a best estimate of 37,941. The conflict that caused the highest
   number of fatalities in 2012 is the Syrian conflict, which led to
   between 14,830 (low) and 30,805 (high) battle-related deaths, with the
   best estimate being 15,055. Eleven armed conflicts listed in 2011 were
   not active in 2012; however, three new conflicts erupted during the year
   - India (Garoland), Mali and South Sudan vs. Sudan (common border) - and
   three previously registered conflicts were resumed by new actors.
   Lastly, 2012 saw an increase in the number of signed peace agreements
   which had been at a very low level over the past three years; four
   accords were concluded during the year, compared with one in 2011.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the administrative transformation of the Department
   of Cultural Affairs, freedom of expression, the year of Mexico in
   France, the image of Mexico in the world and the closure of Mexico's
   diplomatic mission to unesco. During this administration, cultural
   diplomacy waned and lost its institutional standing. Efforts to
   counteract the deteriorating image of Mexico abroad through cultural
   diplomacy lacked the financial resources necessary to expand their
   activities and, combined with a series of poor decisions and
   circumstantial events, the cultural activities run by the Ministry of
   Foreign Affairs entered a clear phase of decline.},

Title = {Informal Accountability, Socially Embedded Officials, and Public Goods
   Provision in Rural China: The Role of Lineage Groups},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},

Abstract = {In recent studies, analysts have found that so-called ``informal
   accountability{''} exerts significant influence on public goods
   provision in rural China. According to these studies, such informal
   accountability may be formed through the embedment of local officials in
   social groups. However, there seems to be no agreement on the
   identification of such embedment and the conditions under which this
   embedment can influence public goods provision. To advance the
   literature of this debate, this study examines village officials who are
   embedded in such social groups as lineage groups and explores their role
   in shaping public goods provision in rural China based on a unique set
   of nationwide-survey data. Using a direct measure of social embeddedness
   of village officials, we have found that the embedment of village
   officials in a social group can be identified through a direct measure
   designed in this study and that the embedment has a positive effect on
   public goods provision in rural China. Finally, we draw some important
   policy implications from our findings.},

Abstract = {Governmental preferences are crucial to our understanding of European
   and international treaty reforms. Nevertheless, current research fails
   to explain why and under what circumstances governments prefer certain
   proposals for institutional reform. The present article analyzes the
   conditional nature of governmental reform preferences over different
   dimensions of institutional design. In doing so, it integrates
   endogenous and exogenous explanations for governmental reform
   preferences into a single theoretical framework. The longitudinal
   research design enables an explicit empirical analysis of the observed
   short-term changes in the governments' positions on European treaty
   reforms. In terms of political integration, these changes not only
   represent short-term trends in public opinion but also reflect the
   partisan composition of governments and parliaments. Both causal effects
   are mediated by the institutional design of the domestic preference
   aggregation process. With respect to institutional reforms, the
   governments' changing positions can be explained as a reaction to
   previous treaty reforms. Given a particular level of political
   integration, governments optimize the trade-off between decision-making
   power and efficiency. Hence, I find that preferences on political
   integration and institutional reform are conditional upon each other,
   with the direction and strength of this conditionality varying
   systematically across member states and changing over time.},

Abstract = {Recent research has shown that the General Agreement on Tariffs and
   Trade (GATT)/World Trade Organization (WTO), contrary to common
   perceptions, does not increase trade. We argue that the effect of the
   GATT/WTO on dyadic trade flows is conditioned by the strength of
   market-protecting institutions (MPIs), which are the fundamental
   determinant of transaction costs. Dyads with weak MPIs do not see an
   increase in trade from GATT/WTO membership while dyads that have strong
   MPIs do see an increase in trade from GATT/WTO membership. In the former
   case, the benefits of GATT/WTO membership are outweighed by the high
   risk of doing business under weak market protection, but when property
   rights are well protected, GATT/WTO membership contributes positively to
   international trade. Empirical analysis of bilateral trade flows from
   1948 to 1999 supports this hypothesis.},

Abstract = {The ideational impact captured by Manners's notion of normative power
   Europe (NPE) appears most distinct and potentially most consequential in
   the realm of regionalism. However, empirical research on the topic has
   been hampered by the focus on EU actorness and methodological
   difficulties. Drawing on diffusion theory, this article develops
   conceptual, theoretical and methodological foundations for conceiving
   NPE as ideational diffusion. It argues that Europe's ideational
   influence on regionalism can be fruitfully understood as the largely
   indirect process by which the EU experience travels to other regions
   through socialization and emulation. Yet, as structural conditions vary
   across regions, EU ideational diffusion rarely leads to similar or even
   comparable institutional practices and outcomes. A choice-orientated
   approach is proposed for examining these claims empirically, which
   focuses on specifying the underlying counterfactual: political decisions
   in regionalism would have been different in the absence of the EU. The
   article concludes by outlining the analytical and normative promise of
   the proposed recasting of Manners's original concept.},

Abstract = {In recent years Western policy towards Afghanistan has been marked by
   inconsistencies and errors. This article explores United States (US)
   soldiers' perceptions of the enemy in Afghanistan based on oral history
   interviews with dissenting combat soldiers who served in the Afghan
   theatre. By foregrounding soldiers' attitudes towards the enemy, this
   study includes marginalized voices, often overlooked, that challenge
   prevailing misconceptions. General David Petraeus, the former commander
   of US forces in Afghanistan, has argued that significant battlefield
   decisions are not reserved for generals alone. Petraeus'
   counterinsurgency programme promotes strategic corporals' whose
   decisions hold important consequences. If strategic corporals are
   involved in military decision-making, it follows that their
   interpretation of the conflict may also hold strategic implications for
   the researcher. Soldiers' views of war are not the final, authoritative
   verdict. However, this article suggests that these strategic corporals
   should be included in a complex matrix of interpretation to broaden US
   understanding of the enemy.},

Abstract = {Do international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) lessen the need
   for states to provide their own services? In the case of health, many
   assume that INGOs limit health spending by governments. Against the
   conventional wisdom, we argue that these organizations create increased
   demand for governmental health spending through three mechanisms: (1)
   indirectly affecting the policy-making climate ({''}climatic
   conditioning{''}), (2) aiding domestic NGO and health activists in their
   efforts, and (3) directly pressuring governments for increased health
   spending themselves. Given these mechanisms, health INGOs, although
   typically supplying health services of their own within a country,
   should augment pressure for public service provision by the state and,
   it follows, lead to increased state health spending. We test our
   argument using a new data set on health INGOs, together with a
   well-established model of health spending, and find ample support for
   our arguments. Increases in health INGOs' activities do lead to
   increased governmental health spending, mainly by indirectly affecting
   the policy-making climate and, most especially, advancing the effective
   efforts of domestic activists.},

Abstract = {China's social welfare system in the past three decades has undergone a
   fundamental transformation. This process is part of a general movement
   occurring in the developing world in the new context of globalization.
   Globalization has produced a structural change of preferences among
   major social actors with regards to social protection, which in turn
   induces the governments to adopt a balanced and inclusive approach of
   social protection that is compatible to market competition and
   continuous development. What distinguishes China in achieving this
   objective is the combination of the government's commitment to openness
   and its strategic policy adjustment that, working together, induce the
   vested interests from the public sector to accept the new institutions
   in a timely manner so that the welfare programs assist the economy in
   exploring the opportunities offered by the international market.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the determinants of FDI inflows in six Central
   and Eastern European countries (CEEC) by incorporating the traditional
   factors and institutional variables over the 1996-2009 period. The study
   identifies whether and how these determinant factors differ across four
   investor countries (EU-15, the US, China, and Japan). The results verify
   the positive and economically significant role of GDP size, trade
   openness, EU membership, and institutions (measured by economic
   freedoms, state fragility, political rights, and civil liberties
   indices) on FDI inflows. The results also reveal the existence of
   notable differences in the determinant factors across four investor
   countries. (C) 2013 The Regents of the University of California.

Abstract = {On the background of continuous global economic instability and debt
   problems in the Eurozone, the significance of post-communist external
   debt goes without saying. The article will explore the scope and
   dynamics of external indebtedness in the post-communist world in a
   comparative and historical framework. Particular attention will be paid
   to a likelihood of a debt crisis in the region similar to the one in the
   developing world in the early 1980s. The debt crisis will be an ultimate
   price for reform mistakes and may have serious political economy
   implications by hampering or even reversing the process of the
   post-communist transformation. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Abstract = {The dynamics of conflict (de)escalation by social movements or political
   opposition groups have attracted cross-disciplinary interest among
   social scientists, but there remain several knowledge gaps to be filled.
   On the one hand, there is already extensive research on the shifts from
   unarmed expressions of collective grievances to the adoption of violent
   strategies by oppressed constituencies or `minorities at risk', as well
   as on the transition from armed insurgency to negotiations,
   demobilization, reintegration and conventional politics. However, there
   is scarce scholarship on the phenomenon of armed groups shifting their
   conflict-waging strategies from violent to nonviolent means, especially
   in contexts which cannot be resolved by force but are also `unripe' for
   conventional de-escalation methods through negotiation and political
   integration. This article offers a first attempt to fill this conceptual
   and empirical gap, by investigating the nature and the drivers of
   transitions from armed strategies to nonviolent methods of contentious
   collective action on the part of non-state conflict actors. It focuses
   in particular on the internal and relational/environmental factors which
   underpin their decisionmaking process, from a change of leadership and a
   pragmatic re-evaluation of the goals and means of insurgency, to the
   search for new local or international allies and the cross-border
   emulation or diffusion of new repertoires of action. This multilevel
   analysis draws from past research on various self-determination or
   revolutionary movements which fit the scope of analysis (i.e. Nepal,
   Egypt, Palestine, West Papua, East Timor, Mexico and Western Sahara).
   The article also points to the need for more systematic enquiry on these
   cases through in-depth comparative empirical analysis.},

Abstract = {In 2004, the British National Health Service (NHS), an organisation with
   one of the largest workforces in the world, adopted a new approach to
   identifying and developing managers, which was refreshed in 2009 with
   guidance for NHS talent and leadership plans'. This paper explores the
   introduction of talent management (TM) in the British NHS, focusing on
   process evaluation. It discusses the introduction of TM in the NHS
   before examining the stated principles, objectives and measures of TM in
   the NHS. It draws on a mix of research methods, including a literature
   review, focus groups, qualitative interviews with policy-makers,
   qualitative interviews with managers, a questionnaire survey, and
   qualitative interviews in high performing organisations. It is found
   that there are a number of issues that may undermine the TM strategy,
   including unclear definitions, conflicting principles, problematic
   measures; exclusive focus, sustainability; and lack of necessary
   infrastructure, culture and data.},

Abstract = {The articles in this special issue all seek to highlight the ways in
   which concepts from linguistics can enlighten analyses of policies and
   the political. In this commentary, I seek to situate some of the central
   concepts that have been employed in terms of their treatment in
   cognitive linguistics. The first part of this commentary focuses on
   metaphor a construct that receives explicit analysis in these works as
   it is a fundamental tool we use for thinking about and expressing
   abstract concepts. The discussion then turns to a topic underpinning all
   of these studies, even while remaining implicit in them, namely
   metonymy: the mention of a part to stand for a whole, a whole for a
   part, and other relations of association. This section considers the
   important role of metonymy in providing a compact means for politicians,
   policy-makers, and/or average citizens to make reference to, and reason
   about, complex topics. At the same time, metonymy also carries the risk
   of reflecting, or inducing, unwarranted logical inferences. The third
   topic taken up here is categories; key issues considered are the variety
   of structures that categories can manifest and how these structures are
   pertinent in different ways in differing contexts, including classical
   categories that metaphorically function like containers, vs prototype
   categories with fuzzy boundaries. Employing these approaches in the
   analysis of policies and the political therefore involves not only a
   linguistic turn, but also a cognitive one. Journal of International

Abstract = {This paper considers the institutional and regulatory framework of local
   infrastructure services in Florida and examines how decision-makers
   perceive the governance structures of publicly-owned utilities in this
   state. It should be of interest to a broad audience, particularly to
   European practitioners that are unfamiliar with the rules and practices
   that frame municipal utilities in the U.S. Many countries pursued
   reforms that were mainly rooted in the New Public Management ideas where
   setting targets, measuring performance and applying rewards or sanctions
   are standard procedures. However, as our paper suggests, it seems that
   there are other ways of protecting the public interest and promoting
   efficiency and accountability. After reviewing the theory, the study
   describes the current system in terms of rate setting, investments,
   consumer protection and quality of service. A state-wide survey was
   developed to identify potential sources of tension between managers and
   politicians. The responses were supplemented by interviews with
   managers, enabling the authors to identify good practices of local
   governance, including the de-politicization of the decision-making and
   the managerial attention to sustainable approaches to funding
   infrastructure.},

Title = {Election Closeness, Habit Formation and Voter Turnout: Evidence from
   Sixteen Swedish Elections},

Abstract = {The developmental model of voter turnout posits that the propensity to
   vote (or abstain) is a habit acquired during the period of a young
   adult's socialisation to the electoral process. Once acquired, the habit
   tends to persist and the individual becomes fairly immune' to the
   potential influences hypothesised to affect turnout. In particular,
   Franklin proposes that electoral context will have a strong impact on
   those who have no or little experience of voting (or abstaining) in
   democratic elections but virtually no impact on those whose electoral
   experience' is more substantial. Tests of the above crucial hypothesis
   have focused mostly on the heterogeneous effects of electoral
   competitiveness (election closeness) on turnout. I follow the same route
   but also point to potential drawbacks of the tests performed so far. At
   the same time, I propose what I claim is a superior test of
   experience-conditioned impact of closeness on turnout. My test utilising
   data on sixteen Swedish elections conducted between 1956 and 2006 yields
   suggestive results supporting Franklin's hypothesis.},

Abstract = {For nearly forty years, debates on a definition of international
   terrorism as part of a comprehensive convention have been preoccupying
   the United Nations. This article challenges conventional approaches
   referring to divergences in national interests and preferences, or to
   institutional constraints and national legal traditions, to explain why
   no definition has been agreed upon. It analyzes the inconclusive debates
   from a critical perspective and argues that the continuous search for a
   definition can be understood through the prism of collective identity
   struggles: the desire to define terrorism is not only the desire to give
   a precise content to terrorism and, thereby, create the identity of an
   Other. It is also the desire to create a collective identity, a Self,
   representing and uniting those who oppose terrorism. By applying a
   discursive understanding of collective identity construction to analyze
   the UN debates, the article elucidates how strongly the definition of
   terrorism hinders a common understanding among those who are opposing
   terrorism. Thereby, the analysis highlights that the demonization of
   terrorism foremost impedes a homogeneous understanding of a collective
   Self, ready to confront and define terrorism in the first place.},

   predicting political economy risk for project managers operating in a
   variety of developing country settings, including non-democracies,
   ethnically diverse environments and societies undergoing political
   transition. In doing so, the paper also develops a number of novel cases
   illustrating the effectiveness of this framework in helping us
   understand both surprising success and failure in the realms of
   sustainable, private sector and human development. These cases include
   Tata Nano's difficulties in locating its automobile plant in West
   Bengal, how a small NGO, the Mehta Foundation, helped secure passage of
   green fuel mandates in Delhi over strong political opposition, and the
   sustained success of Mexico's pioneering conditional cash transfer

Abstract = {Political theory of European union, through an engagement between
   political concepts and theoretical understandings, provides a means of
   identifying the EU as a political object. It is argued that
   understanding the projects, processes and products of European union,
   based on sharing' or communion', provides a better means of perceiving
   the EU as a political object rather than terms such as integration' or
   co-operation'. The concept of European communion' is defined as the
   subjective sharing of relationships', understood as the extent to which
   individuals or groups believe themselves to be sharing relations (or
   not), and the consequences of these beliefs for European political
   projects, processes and products. By exploring European communion
   through an engagement with contemporary political theory, using very
   brief illustrations from the Treaty of Lisbon, the article also suggests
   that European communion embraces three different readings of the EU as a
   political object the EU as a constellation of communities; as a
   cosmopolitan space; and as an example of cosmopolitical co-existence. In
   other words, the political object of European union may be identified as
   sharing European communion'.},

Abstract = {This article evaluates the psychological processes, discursive
   practices, and sociopolitical mechanisms underlying the identity
   reconstruction of Muslim immigrant women in the United States and the
   Netherlands. Specifically, it focuses on the ways in which Muslim
   immigrant women who are embedded in both Islamic and Western cultures
   negotiate their traditional and modern identities and
   self-representations and construct a coherent self-narrative about their
   bicultural existence as Western-Muslim. The qualitative evidence
   presented here expands existing theoretical and empirical discussions on
   biculturalism and acculturation by demonstrating the ways in which
   contextual factors define the negotiation repertoire that is available
   to bicultural individuals. The findings of this article also call into
   question some of the earlier findings on cultural conflict hypothesis,
   because it shows that successful negotiation of bicultural identities
   depends not so much on whether the individual perceives these identities
   and cultures to be compatible with each other, but rather on the
   availability of a coherent self-narrative of belonging to both cultural
   worlds.},

Volume = {11},

Abstract = {This paper examines how the simultaneous enhancement of local governance
   and capacity building as a development strategy advances the idea not
   only of the self-help and self-responsibility of communities but, above
   all, how this strategy of neoliberal development is a form of production
   of subjectivity through which individuals are constituted as homo
   oeconomicus, or, more precisely, as entrepreneurial subjects. Employing
   Foucault's insights from two series of lectures, given at the College de
   France, titled Security, Territory, Population and The Birth of
   Biopolitics, the article examines neoliberal development incentives and
   policies as an effect closely related to the government of individuals
   as a part of a specific community or locality. These insights are
   reflected through the specific case study of the Tanzanian Social Action
   Fund. The case of TASAF shows, when analysed on two diverse but
   complementary levels, of delineation (descriptive) and implementation
   (through concrete practices), how governmental (neoliberal) strategy, by
   employing moral dimensions, shapes individuals into entrepreneurial
   subjects who act with economically rational and are at the same time
   convinced that improvement of their own lives depends predominantly on
   themselves.},

Abstract = {Discourse analysis reveals that Mikhail Gorbachev as General Secretary
   and his successors as Russian presidents have practiced a shared
   strategy of metaphorical - not spatial - centrism that has gradually
   slid the state from dictatorship toward democracy. Preservation of a
   political center for himself and his successors to occupy made it
   necessary for Boris Yeltsin to dismantle the USSR if elections in Russia
   were to continue. At the same time, for each successive exponent of this
   centrist strategy, an attempt to practice democracy without the
   repellent flaws of electoral fraud and political repression would forgo
   the strategic advantage of occupying the political center. (C) 2012 The

Abstract = {The environmental discourse has long been split in two camps: one
   technophilic, the other technosceptic. The former suggests that
   technical solutions are the primary fix to environmental problems, while
   the latter favours changes in behaviour over technological remedies. We
   explore the structure of this discourse by examining the arguments of
   each camp and their sub-groups along with their respective shortcomings.
   We also highlight approaches that go beyond this bipolarity and promise
   practical advances towards more effective interventions. The
   investigation extends to an analysis of the reasons why such novel and
   more sophisticated approaches suffer from a frustratingly low level of
   uptake in the public and private sectors. Among the obstacles identified
   are ontological differences, institutional structures, economic
   incentives and issues around complexity and governance.},

Abstract = {This article, concerning various state strategies in different periods
   since 1978, classifies the evolution of the government's policy on
   administering social organisation into three phases. In particular, the
   state's policy has gone through a series of shifts from laissez-faire to
   control, from a non-formal style of administration to using legal
   instruments as the main means, and with administrative focus from the
   central to the local level. The supervision mechanism thus formulated
   implies a totalitarian logic of exercising a ``tutelary{''} style of
   monitoring-a logic that has to a certain extent revealed
   ``opportunism{''} on the part of the state. Through an analysis of the
   state's governance strategies on social organisations, this article
   argues that this ``tutelary-style{''} monitoring system explains the
   interaction between the state and civil society in contemporary China.},

Title = {Seduced and surrounded by security: A post-structuralist take on
   Norwegian High North securitizing discourses},
Journal = {COOPERATION AND CONFLICT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},
Pages = {80-99},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Combining elements of the Copenhagen school's securitization theory with
   a Foucauldian discourse analysis, this article examines certain
   discursive processes that emerged in the wake of Norway's 2005 High
   North Initiative. The Norwegian government's explicit politicization of
   energy issues appears to have acted as door opener, letting `security'
   in to colonize the High North discourses once more. Russia is again
   firmly positioned as the `radical other', leaving the discursive field
   open to various forms of securitizing discourses. The post-2005
   discursive field of the Northern areas is, in many ways, more
   open-ended, complex and confusing than ever. The opening up and
   expansion of the concept of High North security means that `everything'
   is seen as having a security potential. What does seem clear is the
   increasing presence of security in primary texts and the media debate:
   entry to and credibility in the discourse depends on `security speak'
   across an ever-widening array of thematic contexts. The article also
   argues that a combination of securitization theory and discourse
   analysis seems a fruitful way forward in shifting more focus towards the
   active and important role of the audience in securitizing processes.},

Title = {Lockean Toleration: Dialogical not Theological?},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Pages = {215-230},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {It is often claimed that the idea of toleration emerged from and depends
   upon a Protestant context that limits its usefulness today. These claims
   implicate the political thought of John Locke, clearly a key figure for
   the history of toleration, and also an emphatically Protestant one. The
   fullest support for the claim in question is offered by Jeremy Waldron's
   God, Locke and Equality, which argues that the idea of equality on which
   Locke based his case cannot be separated from its religious foundations.
   Taking issue with Waldron's view, this article argues that in the course
   of defending toleration Locke came to advance an idea of equality that
   may be termed dialogical', in that it rested on the equality that is
   necessarily presupposed by argumentative exchange. While that idea of
   equality is fully consistent with Locke's Protestantism, it does not,
   the article argues, depend upon it. Rather, it depends on the minimum
   requirements of shared citizenship. Civil equality is modelled, in
   Locke's defence of toleration, on what is presupposed by shared
   membership in political society, and no religious view is indispensable
   to it. Moreover, while the Protestant' reading of Locke may seem unique
   in introducing an element of compulsion, the dialogical' reading may
   introduce as much compulsion as is needed for the purposes of
   contractualist political theory.},

Abstract = {The Plan Puebla Panama (PPP) is a development program for the
   modernization of southern Mexico and Central America through the
   construction of transnational urban networks. The implementation of the
   PPP in Chiapas provides a significant example of the relationship
   between depoliticization and planned urbanization in the context of
   contemporary neoliberal governance. The production of space embodied in
   the PPP advances the consolidation of capitalist social relations and
   the extension of state power while representing this process as a
   pragmatic response to economic necessity in the interest of the common
   good. This project, however, is undermined by the constitutive
   antagonisms of neoliberal urbanization, as demonstrated by multiple
   place-based resistances and the ongoing development of the Zapatista
   autonomous territories.},

Title = {The Effects of Need for Cognition and Need for Affect on Partisan
   Evaluations},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},

Volume = {34},

Pages = {23-42},

Abstract = {The voting behavior literature has advanced two prominent theoretical
   models of partisanship: the social psychological and rational models.
   Implicit to both stylized models is the assumption that all partisans
   process information similarly. Yet, growing research in psychology
   suggests that individuals possess different motivations when evaluating
   information. We propose that the applicability of the stylized models of
   partisanship is conditioned on individuals' need for cognition (NFC) and
   need for affect (NFA), with the social psychological model being most
   applicable to individuals who have a high NFA and the rational model
   most applicable to those with a high NFC. To test this proposition, we
   fielded a survey in which respondents who identified with the two major
   political parties in the United States (Democrat or Republican) were
   randomly assigned factual information that depicted either their party
   or their opposing party in a negative light. Respondents were then asked
   to assess the actions of that party and subsequently evaluate both
   political parties. We find evidence that is generally consistent with
   the proposition that the stylized models of partisanship are
   conditionally dependent on the extent to which individuals possess a
   need to engage in effortful thinking or a need to seek out emotions.},

Abstract = {This article uses two unique panel data sets to study the causal effect
   that armed conflict has over firm exit in Colombia. Using a fixed-effect
   estimation methodology at the plant level and controlling for the
   possible endogeneity of armed conflict through the use of instrumental
   variables, we find that a one-standard deviation (SD) increase in the
   number of guerrilla and paramilitary attacks in a municipality increases
   the probability of plant exit in 5.5 percentage points or .28 SD. This
   effect is stronger for younger manufacturing plants, with a smaller
   number of workers and low levels of capital.},

Abstract = {If the environment becomes the subject of party competition so that
   mainstream parties compete to be the greenest' party and move closer to
   Green party positions that may produce more environmental policy
   measures and better environmental outcomes. A comparative analysis of
   the impact of the environmental dimension on contemporary party politics
   employs the 2010 Chapel Hill Expert Survey and the Manifesto Project
   empirical data to analyse party positions and issue salience. Green
   parties still form a homogenous party family characterised by strong
   environmental, libertarian and left-wing policy positions. Mainstream
   parties have mostly employed dismissive and accommodative strategies
   towards the environment, with left-wing parties adopting more
   pro-environment policy positions than right-wing parties, but with only
   marginal differences in issue salience that fluctuate over time.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {It has taken quite a while for a consolidated crisis discourse to emerge
   in Britain in response to the seismic events of 200709. But one is now
   clearly evident, widely accepted and deeply implicated in government
   economic policy. It is a crisis of debt discourse to which the response
   is austerity and deficit reduction; it is paradigm-reinforcing rather
   than paradigm-threatening. In this article I consider the
   appropriateness of such a crisis discourse, arguing that an alternative
   crisis of growth discourse is rather more compelling and would point in
   very different policy directions while generating very different
   expectations about the effects of deficit reduction. Such a discourse
   can just about be detected in the growing criticism of the government's
   austerity programme, but it is yet to lead to the positing of a new
   growth model. I explore the implications of both crisis discourses for
   responses to the crisis, concluding with an assessment of the prospects
   for the return to growth under a new growth model in the years ahead.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {The article considers the reasons why New Labour's political economy
   failed to insulate Britain from the economic crisis that emerged in
   2007, and the characteristics of a political economy platform that would
   provide Labour with a solid base for a progressive social democratic
   programme moving forward. The article argues that Third Way political
   economy failed to appreciate or address the inherent crisis dynamics of
   market economies, especially the extent to which profit-seeking
   behaviour tends to contradict social interests more broadly conceived.
   The article argues that mutual organisation offers an opportunity to
   mute the crisis dynamics in capital by re-establishing links between
   production and community, and that the Labour party should seize on this
   opportunity at a moment of crisis to form the basis of a progressive
   programme of social democratic reform.},

Abstract = {This chapter presents a critique of the so-called peace process through
   military action within the Sri Lankan ethnic conflict. There is a need
   to study this problem from the psychological, developmental, and
   humanitarian point of view. This chapter analyses the deep-rooted seeds
   of the problem, its historical background, its various domestic and
   international angles and perceptions, and the international angles as
   well as regional implications of the Sri Lankan Tamil insurgency. The
   nature of the problem, the effect of ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka on
   regional security, and the militarily remedization of the problem by Sri
   Lankan government and its result are focused on here.
   Finally, the study identifies the contemporary role of diaspora
   communities as a severe hindrance to a lasting peace in the country.
   Thus, the analysis concludes that lasting peace in the island is
   possible only through the promotion of a genuine liberal democracy, from
   both within and without. Suggestions for future peace, stability, and
   development have been put forward.},

Abstract = {This article examines the challenge Norway and France face in
   coordinating specialized government activities after 10 years of
   comprehensive reforms. The focus is on the tension between territorial
   and sectoral specialization and between vertical and horizontal
   specialization. We describe both sector-specific administrative reforms
   and more overarching general reforms, looking at similarities and
   differences in the reorganization choices made by the two countries and
   also at what drives change. We argue that a combination of factors is
   required to explain outcomes. These factors include not only home-grown
   reforms but also sectoral challenges, diffusion and learning from
   abroad, adaptation to the financial crisis and budget deficit, and
   choices made by powerful political executives. Sometimes these factors
   work together and reinforce each other, producing radical reforms; at
   other times they have a mutually constraining influence, resulting in
   only minor changes.},

Abstract = {The paper proposes an explanation for the boom in advocacy organisations
   in the Czech Republic after the collapse of the Communist regime in
   1989. There has been a major increase in the number of professional
   advocacy organisations, accompanied by an influx of
   ``post-materialist{''} issues. In the first half of 1990s, American and
   European state and non-state actors promoted these issues. Since the end
   of 1990s, European Union funds have taken over as the most important
   source of funding. Foreign funding has thus created conditions conducive
   to the emergence and development of advocacy-based activism in the Czech
   Republic. Moreover, advocacy organisations are presented in the paper as
   the locus of a new type of politically oriented activism, which is no
   longer based on mobilisation, but rather on transactions.},

Abstract = {By acquiring a deeper understanding of how the Standard Cost Model has
   worked in practice and whether it has produced significant results or
   not, the research inquired two empirical case studies (The Netherlands
   and Denmark). In order to outline the implementation process of the
   model and explain how it was adopted, interviews with the main actors
   were carried out along with the analysis of newspapers and data
   collection.
   The Dutch process was analysed by observing the policy cycle phases
   (definition of policy problem, policy design, implementation and
   evaluation) specifying the actors involved, their roles, their
   relationships and the resources deployed.},

Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {29},

Pages = {420-442},
Abstract = {The establishment of a Cooperation and Verification Mechanism for
   monitoring Bulgaria's and Romania's progress in judicial reform and the
   fight against corruption not only confirms the evolutionary nature of
   European Union (EU) conditionality, but introduces a new feature, that
   of post-accession conditionality. More than six years after accession,
   neither Bulgaria nor Romania has managed to tackle the remaining issues
   and the scrupulous monitoring mechanism is still maintained. What are
   the main features and limitations of post-accession conditionality? Why
   does the effectiveness of EU conditionality deteriorate after accession?
   The article outlines a conceptual framework for comparative study of
   pre-accession and post-accession conditionality. On the basis of a
   stage-structured conditionality model, it discusses the transformations
   of the main elements of conditionality before and after accession and
   argues that the absence of accession advancement rewards combined with
   toothless explicit threats for sanctioning non-compliance produce very
   weak negative incentive structure which undermines the effectiveness of
   post-accession conditionality. The study, which draws on extensive
   interviews with senior EU officials and examination of key EU documents,
   highlights the growing application of differentiated and targeted
   conditionality and concludes with a reflection on the future of the
   mechanism and its implications for the ongoing enlargement of the Union
   with countries of the Western Balkans and Turkey.},

Abstract = {Is arms control becoming irrelevant? This analysis offers a new way of
   testing the decline of arms control. Rather than focusing on foreign
   policy outputs and international outcomes, this analysis examines
   perceptions of security policy decision makers and opinion leaders
   through their references to arms control. Salience and framing analysis
   are used to evaluate the marginalization of arms control in political
   communication. Empirically, the article examines selected American media
   coverage, research institute publications, and the Congressional Record.
   This research confirms a dwindling number of references to the concept
   of arms control over the last two decades. This trend is not explained
   by the emergence of new technological issues, nor does it follow the
   chronological pattern of actual arms control successes and failures.
   Rather it hints at a more fundamental transformation of political
   thought.},

Volume = {34},

Pages = {397-408},
Abstract = {Neither the realist analysis of Lorenzo Cladi and Andrea Locatelli nor
   the liberal approach of Benjamin Pohl offers sufficient theoretical
   leverage or conceptual sophistication to adequately explain a complex
   empirical puzzle such as European security and defence cooperation. Both
   articles provide some valuable insights into aspects of contemporary
   transatlantic relations and the CSDP, but a complex international
   outcome like European security cooperation cannot be attributed either
   to balancing or bandwagoning, or to the simple aggregation of domestic
   political preferences in individual member states. In order to move
   beyond the impasse in the debate between realism and liberalism, this
   article proposes an alternative theoretical approach - one that avoids
   reductionism and integrates both system-level and domestic factors into
   the analysis; provides a clearer understanding of the ontological status
   of agents and structures in transatlantic security relations; and gives
   due weight to both material and ideational factors in shaping security
   policy. The primary sources of this innovative theoretical approach to
   the study of transatlantic security relations are threefold: Colin
   Wight's concept of structural relationality combining depth ontology
   with emergence theory; the strategic-relational approach of Bob Jessop;
   and a discursive-materialist analysis of power, institutions, and ideas
   based on neo-Gramscian understandings of hegemony.},

   and the nationalistic driven debate on the referendum which led to the

   coproduction of public services, that is, citizens' input to the
   production of public services. This question has received considerable
   attention among scholars and governments, but the causal effect of
   government initiatives on citizen coproduction has been extremely
   difficult to measure due to endogeneity problems. Moreover, the
   literature has devoted limited attention to the important question of
   which citizens are likely to increase coproduction efforts as a
   consequence of initiatives (e. g., are the citizens with the greatest
   need for the service also affected?). I address these shortcomings using
   a randomized field experiment on publicly provided language support for
   immigrant children, including more than 600 families. I focus on
   initiatives that provide citizens with resources relevant for their
   coproduction. The results show that government initiatives can increase
   citizens' coproduction, also among the citizens with the greatest need
   for the service.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is to analyze the connections
   between centrality within conflict networks, individual performance, and
   job satisfaction from the perspective of social networks. The
   intervening effects of task interdependency on these connections are
   also examined.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using the social network survey approach,
   the empirical data from 310 engineers of a large R\&D Institute
   affiliated with the Ministry of National Defense in Taiwan were
   collected.
   Findings - The results show that centrality within relationship conflict
   networks was negatively related to individual performance and job
   satisfaction. However, centrality within task conflict networks was
   positively related to individual performance and job satisfaction Task
   interdependency mitigates the negative influence of relationship
   conflicts on individual performance and job satisfaction, and the
   positive influence of task conflict on job satisfaction.
   Research limitations/implications - As the evidence in this study came
   from the employees of one organization, future studies should
   corroborate findings by surveying more organizations.
   Practical implications The findings have important implications for
   individual social networks. Within the conflict network, people who
   occupy the central position of relationship conflict have a negative
   impact on performance and job satisfaction.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to the literature on social
   networks and conflicts theory by demonstrating the concept of centrality
   within conflict networks. In addition, it also demonstrates that the
   centrality of conflict network is an important factor in influencing
   individual performance and job satisfaction.},

Abstract = {The founders of the Soviet security police celebrated the central role
   of popular participation in their work and elevated this mystical
   connection with the people to the status of a cult - a cult that
   persisted throughout the Soviet era and has survived the collapse of
   Communism. This raises questions about continuity in Russian history,
   particularly because aspects of the cult seem to have been rooted, in
   spite of Soviet claims to the contrary, in tsarist mythology of
   benevolent despotism. This piece asks three questions: Where did the
   cult of the Cheka come from? Why has it proved so durable? And what
   immediate impact did it have during its formative years on the
   activities of the Soviet security police in the 1920s and 1930s?},

Series = {Globalisation Europe Multilateralism},
Year = {2013},
Pages = {125-143},
Abstract = {Normative theories of global justice(2) can be divided according to two
   criteria: i) relational or non-relational and ii) statist or
   cosmopolitan. Relational authors can either be statist or cosmopolitan.
   Non-relational authors are usually cosmopolitan albeit in a different
   way than relational cosmopolitans. The limits of statists (such as
   Blake, Nagel, Julius, Sangiovanni(3)) are shown further, starting with
   cosmopolitan objections to the statists. The cosmopolitans can be
   relational or non-relational: the difference is that relational
   cosmopolitans (Beitz, Pogge, Cohen and Sabel(4)) expand the basic
   structure from the domestic to the global level whereas non-relational
   cosmopolitans (Caney, Buchanan(5)) use moral arguments in order to
   bypass the institutional arguments. Statist arguments are adopted to
   criticise cosmopolitanism. Cosmopolitanism is criticised for two kinds
   of reasons: i) institutional reasons and ii) moral reasons. The former
   mainly concern relational cosmopolitans, while the latter relate to
   non-relational cosmopolitans. In doing so, one can play a cosmopolitan
   in combination with statist features and vice versa. This is not because
   either cosmopolitans or statists are right. The intention is rather to
   avoid the pitfalls of both statism and cosmopolitanism by
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   presenting a fresh start under the label of liberal internationalism. In
   the next step, relational institutional support for liberal
   internationalism is provided: normative regionalism. Finally, a moral
   support for liberal internationalism is established: a non-relational
   humanitarian duty of justice. This duty of justice is not egalitarian
   but sufficientarian, that is, more focused on absolute rather than on
   relative deprivations.},

Abstract = {Faced with the return of the politics of power to the international
   stage and the reevaluation of studies based on the territorial
   characteristics of a country, it becomes relevant to ask: What is the
   geopolitical situation of Mexico and what are the consequences of this
   for national security? To answer this question, the basic concepts of
   geopolitics are summarized before applying them to the case of Mexico.
   This is followed by an analysis of the regional changes that took place
   at different historical stages of the country and the effects of these
   on the origin and scope of threats to national security.},

   for peacebuilding},
Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Pages = {141-157},
Abstract = {In historical perspective statebuilding has often been violent because
   it threatens the interests of groups which are on the outside of the
   process and it encounters outlying resistance which must be subjugated.
   The consolidation of national political projects is a related process
   that has often been accompanied by significant armed conflict as groups
   with vying political visions compete for control of the agenda. Yet, in
   the twenty-first century some scholars and most policy analysts
   interested in peacebuilding portray peacebuilding and statebuilding as
   complementary or even mutually dependent. International peacebuilding
   activities in post-conflict and conflict-prone societies - undertaken by
   international organisations and individual donor states focus upon the
   creation or recreation of state institutions as a conciliatory process
   and as the key to peace and stability. This article explores this
   apparent paradox and considers if there has been a historical
   transformation in the relationship between statebuilding and peace, and
   what implications historical statebuilding experience holds for
   international peacebuilding activities.},

Abstract = {Purpose - To examine how Black mayors in majority- White cities
   successfully incorporate the interests of African-Americans into their
   overall agenda for the city and the said effectiveness of this strategy
   electorally.
   Design/methodology/approach - Utilizing data from elite interviews and
   local newspaper articles, we apply the theory of targeted universalism
   to the governing approach of Jack Ford.
   Findings - Mayors of color often come into office with the dual
   responsibility of being an advocate for their respective racial group
   and a leader for the city as a whole. Jack Ford, the first
   African-American to be elected as mayor in Toledo, Ohio, took this
   challenge on gladly, but with mixed success. We find that Jack Ford used
   his powers as mayor to improve social conditions for Blacks in Toledo,
   yet also faced challenges in trying to better their economic
   opportunities. Moreover, he failed to parlay these particularistic
   efforts into a second electoral victory. In this case, a targeted
   universalistic policy approach to advancing Black interests had limited
   effectiveness. The single mayoral term of Jack Ford suggests that Black
   executives must walk a fine line between their (assumed or expected)
   racial empowerment role and their duty to advance the various interests
   that exist among residents of their city. Hence, we find that in order
   to have lasting electoral success Black mayors must be acutely aware of
   what is expected of them by the various constituencies they serve and
   govern accordingly.
   Research limitations/implications - Because of the chosen research
   approach, the research results may lack generalizability. Therefore,
   researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further.
   Practical implications - The chapter includes implications for the
   development of an effecting Black mayoral governing strategy wherein the
   mayor can successfully advocate for the advancement of black interests
   in majority-White cities with specific policy proposals and programmatic
   developments.
   Originality/value - This chapter fulfills an identified need to study
   the governance of Black mayors in medium-sized cities and their
   representation of Black interests in the majority White municipal
   context.},

Abstract = {Corruption was a serious problem in Singapore during the British
   colonial period and especially after the Japanese Occupation (February
   1942 - August 1945) mainly because of the lack of political will to curb
   it by the incumbent governments. In contrast, the People's Action Party
   (PAP) government, which assumed office in June 1959 after winning the
   May 1959 general election, demonstrated its political will with the
   enactment of the Prevention of Corruption Act (POCA) in June 1960, which
   strengthened the capacity of the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau
   (CPIB) to combat corruption effectively. Indeed, Singapore's success in
   curbing corruption is reflected in its consistently high scores on
   Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) from
   1995 to 2012 as the least corrupt country in Asia. Singapore was ranked
   first with Denmark and New Zealand in the 2010 CPI with a score of 9.30.
   Similarly, Singapore has been ranked first in the Political and Economic
   Risk Consultancy (PERC) annual surveys on corruption from 1995 to 2013.
   Why has Singapore succeeded in minimizing the problem of corruption when
   many other Asian countries have failed to do so? What lessons can these
   countries learn from Singapore's experience in combating corruption?
   This chapter addresses these two questions by first describing
   Singapore's favorable policy context, followed by an identification of
   the major causes of corruption during the British colonial period and
   Japanese Occupation, and an evaluation of the PAP government's
   anti-corruption strategy.},

Abstract = {The relationship between the military and the media has always been
   characterized by conflict and interdependency. However, during the past
   decade the interaction between these two institutions has changed
   markedly as a result of new types of media and a growing military
   engagement in irregular conflicts. Building on existing research, this
   article traces how these changes in the media military relationship's
   primary contexts have affected the degree of interdependency and
   conflict between, on the one hand, soldiers and military organizations
   and, on the other, war correspondents and editors. It is among the
   article's main arguments that the introduction of new types of media has
   generally worked to weaken the interdependency between the media and the
   military. Concurrently, the developments of the past decade have raised
   new research questions that is what the last section of the article is
   about.},

Title = {Terrorist attack and target diversity: Changepoints and their drivers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {50},
Number = {1},
Pages = {75-90},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Terrorists choose from a wide variety of targets and attack methods.
   Unlike past literature, this article investigates how diversity in
   target choice and attack modes among domestic and transnational
   terrorists has evolved and changed over the past 40 years. Changes in
   the practice of homeland security, which affects the marginal costs of
   target-attack combinations, and changes in the dominant terrorist
   influence at the global level, which affects the marginal benefits of
   target-attack combinations, drive the changepoints. Our empirical
   analysis relies on count data drawn from the Global Terrorism Database
   (GTD) for 1970-2010 that distinguishes between domestic and
   transnational terrorist incidents. Given the data-intensity requirements
   of our methods, the study is necessarily from a global perspective. A
   Bayesian Reversible Jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) changepoint
   analysis is applied to identify arrival rate changes in both domestic
   and transnational terrorism. The changepoints in these aggregate series
   are then matched with those of the subset time series for attack modes
   (e.g. assassinations and bombings) and target types (e.g. officials and
   private parties). The underlying drivers of these changepoints are then
   identified. The article also calculates a Herfindahl index of attack
   diversity for the aggregate and component domestic and transnational
   terrorism time series for the entire period and during four subperiods.
   The variation in both domestic and transnational terrorist attacks has
   generally fallen over the last four decades; nevertheless, this
   diversity still remains high. Bombings of private parties have become
   the preferred target-attack combination for both transnational and
   domestic terrorists. This combination is the hardest-to-defend
   target-attack combination and requires the most homeland security
   resources. Policymakers can use these and other results to focus their
   counter-terrorism measures.},

Abstract = {The `global' crisis at the end of the first decade of the twenty-first
   century has served to advance change in the international political
   economy symbolised by `emerging' economies, powers, companies, and
   middle classes. In turn, this has generated novel forms of increasingly
   hybrid types of governance from the G20 to Extractive Industries
   Transparency Initiative (EITI) (www.eiti.org) and Global Alliance for
   Vaccination and Immunisation (GAVI Alliance) (www.gavialliance.org). The
   number of `developmental States' in the emerging `second world' (Khanna
   2008) is growing, transforming the context for innovation in regional
   development in the Global South as the EU is preoccupied with
   intraregional difficulties (Fanta, Shaw and Tang 2013). The post-2015
   development agenda constitutes a timely opportunity for the articulation
   of agency rather than continued dependency by `the rest' as the
   `post-American world' dawns (Zacharia 2011).},

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is to address the relation between
   task and relationship conflicts at work and employee well-being. It
   seeks to examine psychological detachment from work during off-job time
   as a moderator in the relation between conflicts and well-being.
   Design/methodology/approach - In a field study, 291 white-collar
   employees completed survey measures of task conflicts, relationship
   conflicts, psychological detachment from work during off-job time, and
   well-being. Control variables included workload and job control.
   Findings - Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that employees
   experiencing high levels of task conflicts and high levels of
   relationship conflicts report poorer well-being. As predicted,
   psychological detachment from work mitigated the negative relation
   between relationship conflicts and well-being. Contrary to expectations,
   psychological detachment failed to moderate the relation between task
   conflicts and well-being.
   Practical implications - The study suggests that employees should be
   encouraged to disengage mentally from work during leisure time.
   Originality/value - This study links research on workplace conflicts
   with research on recovery processes. It tests the moderator effect of
   psychological detachment from work on the association between workplace
   conflicts and well-being.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The main aim of this study is to explore the motivational
   process behind two types of forgiveness i.e. true and hollow
   forgiveness. It is predicted that victims who engage in true forgiving
   behavior will have stronger relationship-oriented motives than either
   those who engage in hollow forgiving behavior or those who do not engage
   in forgiving behavior. Furthermore, the authors seek to explore the
   relationship between true and hollow forgiveness and conflict resolution
   strategy.
   Design/methodology/approach - In Study 1, participants were asked to
   recall personal experiences of being harmed, and they rated the events
   in terms of forgiveness, motives of forgiveness, resolutions strategies,
   and satisfaction with outcome. In Study 2, participants were presented
   with scenarios depicting individuals who were victimized, and were asked
   to read the scenarios, imagining themselves as the victim. Following
   this forgiveness, motives of forgiveness, resolution strategies, and
   satisfaction with outcome were measured.
   Findings - Consistent with the predictions, participants classified as
   being true forgivers were motivated by relationship-oriented motives.
   These individuals preferred a collaborative conflict resolution
   strategy, and tended to be satisfied with the outcome of the conflict.
   In contrast, participants classified as being hollow forgivers were
   motivated by self-oriented reasons, and they preferred avoidance as a
   conflict resolution strategy. In addition, these individuals were less
   satisfied with the outcome of the conflict than were the true forgivers.
   Originality/value - These findings suggest that perceptions of the
   conflict resolution process depend on the type of forgiveness.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how census politics in the Western Balkans
   take the form of a political device to entrench or transform ethnic
   demographics, which can have implications for cooperation and
   reciprocity between neighbouring states. We argue that the contingency
   of census politics spring from a trinomial interaction between actors
   claiming to represent the dominant nationalising state, national
   minority, and external homeland. Building on this triangulation, this
   article explores the interaction between the dominance of the
   nationalising states, the influence of the national minority, and the
   interest/interference of the external homeland in the 2011 censuses in
   Albania, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia. The article
   illustrates how census-taking is a highly politicised process in a
   region with hostile political dynamics, which revealed the unstable and
   contested nature of citizenship, ethnic belonging, weak civic identity,
   and fragile regional relations.},

Abstract = {Following the elections of 2007, there was a significant increase in
   public expressions of secessionist feeling on the Kenya coast. During
   2010 and 2011, one manifestation of this was the emergence of the
   Mombasa Republic Council (MRC), which demands independence for the
   coastal region. The language of secessionism is historical, and revisits
   the vivid political debates of the late 1950s and early 1960s, when
   politics in coastal Kenya revolved successively around two
   constitutional issues. The first was the possibility that the Ten-Mile
   Strip, nominally the sovereign territory of the Sultan of Zanzibar,
   might not become a part of independent Kenya; the second was the
   `regionalist' constitution of 1963-4. This article explores the way that
   people now retell the history of earlier debates, and argues that these
   retellings suggest both the power and the plasticity of claims to
   historical knowledge, and that they reveal a profound fault line within
   `secessionist' opinion, which separates those who claim political
   primacy on the basis of autochthony from those who locate their claim to
   independence in the language of colonial-era treaties. Such divisions
   are important, because they shape the way that secessionist arguments
   are framed, and the potential for secessionist politics to undermine the
   unity of the Kenyan state.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to draw out the ideological nature of discourses of
   resilience, and traces their rise in international statebuilding
   approaches. It suggests that this shift to resilience follows
   disillusionment with liberal internationalist understandings that
   Western or international actors could resolve problems of development,
   democracy and peace through the export of liberal institutions.
   Interventionist discourses have increasingly stressed the importance of
   local capacities, vulnerabilities and agencies and, in doing so, have
   facilitated the evasion of Western responsibility for the outcomes of
   statebuilding interventions through problematising local practices and
   understandings as productive of risks and threats and as barriers to
   liberal progress.},

Volume = {34},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {Traditionally Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) has been seen as a
   unidimensional construct. Recently, however, researchers have begun to
   measure three distinct RWA dimensions (Feldman, 2003; Funke, 2005; Van
   Hiel, Cornelis, Roets, \& De Clercq, 2006). One of these new
   multidimensional RWA approaches has conceptualized these three
   dimensions as Authoritarianism, Conservatism, and Traditionalism (ACT),
   which are viewed as expressions of basic social values or motivational
   goals that represent different, though related, strategies for attaining
   collective security at the expense of individual autonomy. Findings are
   reported from two studies to assess the validity and predictive utility
   of the multidimensional ACT approach. First, a direct cross-national
   comparison showed that the three ACT dimensions were reliable and
   factorially distinct and demonstrated the measurement invariance of the
   three latent constructs across Serbian and NZ (New Zealand) samples. The
   three ACT dimensions predicted self-reported behavior differentially in
   both samples, and a comparison of latent means showed the Serbian sample
   higher than the NZ sample on the ACT dimensions of Authoritarianism and
   Traditionalism but markedly lower on Conservatism. Second, a reanalysis
   of previously collected NZ data showed that the three ACT scales
   differentially predicted three dimensions of generalized prejudice in a
   theoretically meaningful manner. These findings underline the importance
   of studying ideological attitudes, such as RWA, multidimensionally.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the establishment and disowning of the
   Macro-Economic Research Group (MERG) by the African National Congress in
   the lead-up to the formation of the democratic dispensation of 1994 and
   the first elections, overwhelmingly won by the African National Congress
   (ANC), which still forms the national government of South Africa.
   Considerable emphasis is placed on the politics of the ANC and to a
   lesser extent the general situation of the South African economy rather
   than by dissecting economic debates alone. MERG was a relatively lone
   substantial voice calling for real structural and institutional changes
   in the economy, ultimately rejected by the ANC at the behest of
   business. Two decades after the end of apartheid, it has become a
   hallmark of liberal criticism of the government to denounce it as
   following the worked-out agenda of a radical agenda underlying the

Abstract = {Set in the wider historical context of a country in severe political
   crisis at the beginning of the 1970s, the Career Executive Service
   (CES)the managerial class in the Philippine civil servicebegan as an
   authoritarian construction within the political and institutional
   structure of the martial law regime. Because Philippine post-war
   state-building was accompanied by a weak central civil service, the CES
   became indispensable in promoting an entrepreneurial administrative
   culture which emphasized quality of innovativeness or risk-taking and
   senior-level teamwork within a bureaucracy that was professionally
   subservient to a technocratic elite, apart from providing the regime
   with a progressive civilian image. Insulated from power politics, the
   CES nevertheless became a closed merit-based system co-existing with a
   clientelist structure inhabited by rent-seeking coalitions outside it.
   Under the restored nominal democratic system in 1986, the CES underwent
   deconstruction, but still preserved the boundary between expertise and
   management. Today, however, the new administration is reconstructing the
   career service program with a new mix of qualities and skills that may
   actually blur the borders between expertise, political engagement and
   administration, in the hope of opening doors to authentic democratic
   practice and accountability.},

Abstract = {This article evaluates the rapid escalation of American household debt
   in relation to the changing dynamics of liberal welfare capitalism.
   Starting with the outcome of rising household debt levels during the
   credit and asset bubble of 2001-7 it argues that the failure of
   asset-based welfare and the inability of households to move beyond their
   historical dependence on earned income made indebtedness essential to
   household social participation and protection. It examines the unique
   relationship of young adults (households headed by persons under age 35)
   and senior citizens (households headed by persons over age 65) to the
   liberal welfare regime, in particular the ways in which these
   relationships were shaped by the 2001-7 credit and asset bubble. By
   using a framework in which debt is analyzed as a claim against income,
   alongside other costs of social participation and daily living, we see
   the impact of the credit and asset boom on both young adults and senior
   citizens: growing indebtedness and financial insecurity.},

Abstract = {Since Robert Cox's early interventions in the 1980s, the work of Gramsci
   has been openly applied to the arena of international politics, often
   superimposed on to the wider concepts of world order' and transnational
   class' formation. While this has produced a great deal of commendable
   scholarly work, it has equally produced a growing number of critics who
   have voiced concerns over the viability and feasibility of applying
   Gramsci's key concepts to the realm of the international. Rather than
   revisiting these charges, we argue that one of the main problems
   associated with the neo-Gramscian' interpretations of international
   relations (IR) is that they have tended to develop an ontology of their
   own and have not pursued a re-reading of Gramsci's actual work to
   explore a fresh opening towards applying Gramsci to the international.
   We argue that by re-exploring Gramsci's understanding of conceptions of
   the world' and by re-examining Gramsci's concept of hegemony, a greater
   scope can be achieved for understanding power relations within global
   politics. We demonstrate the potential for this by tentatively looking
   at the role of increasingly popular global evangelical religious groups
   in the fashioning of hegemonic consent across diverse parts of civil
   society, arguing that it is such bottom-up studies of societal consent
   that are required in order for Gramscian theory and research to move
   beyond their current ontological applications.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Pages = {359-368},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The current and future impact of Islamic feminism within the political
   framework of the Arab world is profound. In order to understand the
   current relevance of Islamic feminism, this article first examines the
   roots of feminism in the Arab world, analyzing the fundamental
   differences and commonalities that Islamic feminism has with western
   feminism. The diverse categories of Islamic feminism are then discussed,
   focusing on universalism within the framework of hermeneutic Islamic
   discourse. Islamic feminism is then reconstructed around its
   methodologies. This article asserts that the hermeneutic strain of
   Islamic feminism is the overarching paradigm to be employed, as it
   presents women's rights within the context of the Qur'an and women's
   right to perform ijtihad (personal interpretation based on logical
   reasoning), rejecting patriarchal influences. Islamic feminism and its
   place within the rise of modern Islam theorizing is then shown as a
   viable explanatory factor in the recent shaping of political and
   cultural discussions on the role of religion in the political sphere,
   especially in the context of the Arab Spring. Policy Implications
   Education is one of the major areas to which policy makers must devote
   their attention. There needs to be renewed emphasis on and encouragement
   of the democratic transition in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
   region. This re-emphasis must include a strengthening of Islamic
   hermeneutic feminism in the politics of the region. This can be achieved
   through an education curriculum that reinforces the concepts of
   dialogue, equality and tolerance, thereby liberating the thinking of
   conservative political parties. Young people and social media played a
   significant role in the events and momentum of the Arab Spring. As such,
   policy makers must encourage and invest in these two critical factors to
   ensure their continued success. By promoting a humanistic hermeneutic
   discourse, the innovative efforts and energies of young people and
   social media can be developed and strengthened further. Higher education
   in particular must also be a policy focus for the promotion and further
   development of Islamic feminism. Western universities as well as
   universities in the MENA region have the capability to advance and
   further develop the theoretical and conceptual role of hermeneutic
   interpretations of Islam. Given the context of the Arab Spring, the role
   that women play as a catalyst for sustainable democratic development
   must be recognized, promoted and developed further. Policy makers have
   the opportunity to redefine and re-emphasize the critical role of women
   in the decision-making processes of the region.},

Abstract = {Both Scotland and New Zealand, small nations with a British political
   heritage, implemented mixed-member proportional (MMP) electoral systems
   in the 1990s. Minority government characterises most of the New Zealand
   experience since the introduction of MMP in 1996, while Scotland's only
   such experience occurred between 2007 and 2011. The Scottish experience
   differed significantly from that of New Zealand because Scotland has a
   different party system (characterised by two major cleavages) and exists
   in a system of multi-level governance, resulting in a more
   conflict-laden relationship between parties. The centre-periphery
   cleavage in the Scottish case results from being part of the United
   Kingdom, while New Zealand is an independent state. Both nations
   introduced MMP as part of an effort to bring about a new politics', but
   the impact of institutional engineering upon the behaviour of
   politicians has been limited.},

Abstract = {Social leadership' refers to the act of orchestrating adaptive change in
   groups, organisations, communities and nations. This article evaluates
   the contribution a social leadership approach can make to dealing with
   complex adaptive issues facing communities experiencing profound social
   change. It broaches the thorny question of what form of leadership best
   fits different localisms. The article does this by examining a sample of
   cases that are indicative of each form of localism and where the
   adoption of a social leadership approach has deepened the effectiveness
   of community problem-solving, compared to more centralised, top-down
   approaches. It distinguishes between localism as a consultative process,
   for solving technical problems, and localism as a learning dynamic',
   which helps communities adapt in an evolutionary sense to new or
   constantly changing environments. This article concludes that linking
   localism to a social leadership framework allows the concept to take on
   more depth as a way of engaging communities around tough realities
   focusing on underlying dynamics and generating the adaptive behaviours
   required to address those challenges.},

Abstract = {In the legislative and executive branches, policy scholars have used
   punctuated equilibrium (PE) theory to describe and explain patterns of
   change. However, there has been little examination of how PE might apply
   to courts and legal policy change. This article addresses that gap by
   providing evidence that legal policy changehere conceptualized as
   changes in what precedents the Supreme Court most often citesis governed
   by PE theory. After making a prima facie case for the applicability of
   PE theory to the Court, I leverage network rankings of Supreme Court
   decisions to create a proxy for legal policy change that improves on
   existing measures. Using both a stochastic process model and an analysis
   of the punctuations the measure uncovers, I find strong evidence of PE
   processes.},

Abstract = {In recent years, a growing body of research has set out to examine the
   role that emotions play in shaping political attitudes and behaviors
   regarding terrorism. However, one major issue that is generally
   overlooked is whether the thematic relevance of emotive triggers leads
   to differential effects on people's reactions to international
   terrorism. Specifically, does angerregardless of its sourcetend to drive
   people towards supporting an aggressive foreign policy option to counter
   terrorism, or do the thematic underpinnings of anger (i.e., the specific
   contents that trigger this particular emotion, such as watching a news
   story about a recent terrorist attack) matter vis-a-vis the policy
   choice? To address this gap, this study experimentally examines the
   impact of angerinduced by thematically relevant versus irrelevant
   emotive triggerson people's cognitive processing and foreign policy
   preferences regarding international terrorism. Overall, we find that the
   induction of anger via thematically relevant emotive triggers leads to a
   higher tendency for selecting a military option, a lower amount of
   information acquisition, and a shorter processing time in response to
   terror-related incidents.},

   national intelligence to provide high quality warnings prior to the
   eruption of popular revolutions. This article uses new sources of
   evidence to trace and explain Israel's success in comparison to US
   failure at correctly estimating the course of the Iranian Revolution in
   1977-79. In explaining this variance, the article shows that it was
   mainly the result of the intimate acquaintance of Israel's
   representatives in Iran with the local language, history and culture, as
   well as the ability to communicate with locals-tools which the Americans
   completely lacked.},

Title = {Institutional Arrangements in the Implementation of Policies to Combat

Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},

Abstract = {The democratization process has propelled important transformations in
   the relationship between the State and society during the past few
   years. Those changes in Brazilian society were responsible for
   alterations in public policies' institutional structures. This was a
   result of the demand and urge to face social problems.
   There is a movement leading to changes in the institutional
   arrangements. The management framework, which had a traditional,
   self-absorbed, hierarchic, sectorial and functional view, evolved into a
   much more modern one. The organizations are now adopting a more
   decentralized, cross-sectorial and participative model, focused on
   results.
   Considering that the relationship between the State and society is
   dictated by public policies, this turns out to be the space for
   innovation and experiments, always looking forward to quantitative and
   qualitative improvements.
   This essay analyses one of the most vital Brazilian public policies,
   named ``Brasil Sem Miseria{''} (Brazil without Misery). The goal of this
   program is to increase the opportunities of those who are extremely
   poor, as well as to develop their skills up, by incrementing their
   income and welfare levels. Taking into account Brazil's continental
   proportions and the heterogeneity of its regions regarding culture,
   economy and weather, this public policy is extremely challenging. The
   program ought to adopt specific strategies to each region in order to
   fulfill their public needs all over the country. So, they created
   complex institutional models, coordinating actions with civil society,
   municipalities and states.
   This analysis verifies the institutional and management arrangements
   used during the implementation of this policy in the state of Sao Paulo.
   It also investigates the decentralization's conditions and the shapes
   that are included on the institutional framework.},

Abstract = {Private security companies (PSCs) currently receive a great deal of
   attention in the news media, in sensationalist reporting, and
   increasingly in scholarly books and articles. While the scholarly books
   and articles make significant contributions to our understanding of this
   global phenomenon, there are several impediments to analysis that must
   be recognized and overcome if analysis is to be improved. Three of these
   impediments are reviewed in this article. The author suggests that US
   government material is currently available to minimize impediments and
   offers a framework to make analytical sense of it. Since contracting out
   is based on contracts, and unless the complexities of awarding and
   managing contracts are understood, recommendations made to reform the
   process of contracting out security are unrealistic.},

Abstract = {Using a large annual database of French firms (19942000), this article
   examines the determinants of workforce reductions in publicly listed and
   non-listed companies and their consequences on firm performance. First,
   workforce reduction appears to be a defensive response to adverse
   economic shocks. However, publicly listed firms anticipate better than
   do unlisted companies the decision to cut jobs. Second, a
   difference-in-differences model indicates that there has been a very
   small but significant improvement in the major performance indicators
   for the non-listed companies. For listed companies, the corresponding
   estimates are not significant.},
