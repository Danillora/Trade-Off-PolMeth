Abstract = {Human rights defenders (HRDs) are increasingly empowered by, and
   dependent upon, digital technologies. These technologies have opened up
   new potentials, enabling HRDs to extend their capacity to document and
   analyse human rights abuses, to amplify them, and to more effectively
   organize locally and internationally. Digital technologies, however,
   have simultaneously created new points of weakness: exposing HRDs'
   whereabouts, activities and networks, and creating evidence against them
   through data leakages, digital traces, and direct surveillance and
   interception. Attacks on HRDs have escalated over the past two years,
   with a significant increase in the number of entrapments and networks
   being compromised through the use of computers, cameras, mobile phones
   and the internet. This rapidly changing landscape poses a number of
   challenges to practitioners working in the field of security and
   protection for HRDs and has led to a growing concern about how best to
   enable HRDs to assess and mitigate the related risks. After
   contextualizing and introducing the dimensions of digital insecurity for
   HRDs, this paper will note some of the responses to HRDs' digital
   security needs which have been developed, and their limitations. It will
   then go on to identify three key principles that should inform the work
   of practitioners in future and to raise a series of critical questions
   for further research and work in this area.},

Title = {Broadening the Cultural History of the Cold War The Emergence of the
   Polish Workers' Defense Committee and the Rise of Human Rights},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COLD WAR STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {104-127},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The historiography of the Cold War has witnessed a revived interest in
   non-material factors such as culture and ideology. Although this
   incipient cultural history of the Cold War has focused mainly on the
   period from 1945 until the early 1960s, the signing of the Helsinki
   Final Act in 1975 turned ideas into potent factors of international
   politics when East European opposition groups began to expose how their
   governments violated the accord's human rights provisions. By putting
   the emergence of one such opposition group, the Polish Workers' Defense
   Committee, in an international context, this article extends Cold War
   cultural history into the 1970s and 1980s, tracing how human rights
   ideas affected international and domestic politics. The Communist
   states' willingness to put up with the human rights provisions in the
   Helsinki Final Act was not sufficient to shame them internationally.
   Instead, what happened is that Western leftists, after encountering East
   European dissidents, increasingly perceived human rights as a
   precondition for the success of their own political project and hence
   revoked what Robert Horvath calls the revolutionary privilege long
   granted to Communist regimes. Because Communism's identity was so
   closely related to its struggle with the West, this criticism was
   particularly damaging. Only within the dynamics of a cultural framework
   from earlier stages of postwar history did transnational human rights
   advocacy become effective.},

Abstract = {In recent years, breastfeeding supporters and some feminists have found
   themselves in deep disagreement about the legitimacy of biomedical
   evidence suggesting the superiority of breastfeeding to formula feeding.
   In this article, I examine the ways in which breastfeeding supporters
   have relied on such scientific evidence not only to convince women to
   breastfeed but also to build their case for structural supports that
   will enable women to do so. Such an approach, I argue, is problematic
   for both normative and strategic reasons. Calling instead for
   breastfeeding advocacy based on the autonomy of women, I suggest a
   number of questions for breastfeeding supporters, feminists, and
   scholars to consider as they begin to build a feminist approach to
   breastfeeding advocacy.},

Abstract = {In post-socialist societies, marketing and consumption play a crucial
   role for what is regarded as value. Assuming consumer capitalism' as an
   important feature of the neoliberal project, I argue that marketing
   theories and practices produce market societies in Eastern and Central
   Europe. To highlight the reflexive adaptation of consumer capitalism' by
   producers, marketers and consumers, this essay discusses fashion brand
   promotion in Bulgaria. The case studies illustrate how the
   transformation of modes of valuation can be understood as a process of
   performative modernisation and marketisation. It appears that the local'
   adjustment of global' concepts of marketing and consumption leads to new
   formations of value in spatial, temporal and subjective terms.},

Abstract = {This article compares the efforts to govern performance enhancement
   technologies in two seemingly different competitive arenasfinancial
   markets and professional cyclingwhere the pressures to outperform are
   enormous. In the two decades prior to the 2007 financial crisis, new
   derivative financial commodities such as collateralized debt obligations
   (CDOs) were created to juice up investment returns for extraordinary
   profits. Over roughly the same period, the development and use of blood
   boosting drugs and technologies brought so-called doping by cyclists to
   new levels of complexity and sophistication with extraordinary race
   results and new levels of commercialization of the sport. The efforts to
   turbocharge their respective competitive spaces took place within
   complicated regimes of self-regulation that had strikingly dissimilar
   narratives about performance enhancement and, consequently, different
   technologies for control. Looking across these seemingly disparate cases
   draws our attention to how regulation fits into the assemblage of
   competition and prospects for reform.},

Abstract = {In this article, I reflect on the lessons learned from a one year
   action-research process with displaced people in London to advocate for
   an actor-oriented approach to human rights education. I suggest that
   when it comes to supporting marginalized people to claim their rights,
   we need not to look for a transferable set of skills and knowledge but
   to nurture a rights consciousness - a sense of entitlement to one's
   rights - through transformative learning methodologies. The article
   discusses both the content and pedagogy of such methodologies, paying
   special attention to critical reflection and affective learning. I
   conclude that for us as human rights educators to engage in
   transformative learning for human rights we need to approach rights as
   rooted in the relationships, contextual realities, and perspectives of
   the people we work for and with, and I suggest that the way we
   understand rights incurs a set of implications for the way we `teach'
   and claim them.},

Abstract = {Human rights education is about more than simply conveying knowledge;
   rather it follows the head-heart-hands (or sometimes feet) model with
   the role of education being to ensure understanding and knowledge
   (head), change of attitude (heart), and the development of the skills to
   do something with the knowledge (hands/feet). In the higher education
   sector, this presents some challenges, and requires alteration to more
   traditional models of teaching and learning. This article compares
   student expectations and results in two broadly comparable courses one
   in the United Kingdom (UK) and the other in China. Both courses were
   heavily skills-based, seeking to ensure that students achieved
   sustainable knowledge and developed the capacity to undertake human
   rights research on any country. As the results indicate, most students
   professed ignorance about the United Nations (UN) system and
   international human rights prior to the start of the course, yet
   achieved a fast learning curve of knowledge and skills. It is to be
   hoped that such a module makes a real contribution towards the goals of
   the World Programme for Human Rights Education.},

Title = {Resilience and the Autotelic Subject: Toward a Critique of the
   Societalization of Security},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {210-226},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In discourses of resilience, there is a clear assumption that
   governments need to assume a more proactive engagement with society.
   This proactive engagement is understood to be preventive, not in the
   sense of preventing future disaster or catastrophe but in preventing the
   disruptive or destabilizing effects of such an event. In this sense, the
   key to security programs of resilience is the coping capacities of
   citizens, the ability of citizens to respond, or adapt, to security
   crises. The subject or agent of security thereby shifts from the state
   to society and to the individuals constitutive of it. In many ways, this
   shift away from a sovereign-based understanding to a social or societal
   understanding of security, under the guidance or goal of resilience,
   could be understood as a deliberalizing discourse, one which divests
   security responsibilities from the level of the state down to the level
   of the citizen. This article seeks to consider some of the genealogical
   aspects of discourses of resilience as a societal or agent-based
   understanding of security (particularly focusing on the work of
   Friedrich von Hayek and Anthony Giddens) in order to work through some
   of the consequences of the state's divestment of security
   responsibilities for traditional liberal framings of state-society
   relations.},

Title = {Critiques of Growth in Classical Political Economy: Mill's Stationary

Abstract = {In recent political-economic theories of nature', Mill and Marx/Engels
   form important reference points. Ecological economists see Mill's
   stationary state' as seminal, while Marxists have brought capitalism
   back in' to debates on growth and climate change, sparking a
   Marxological renaissance that has overturned our understanding of
   Marx/Engels' opus. This article explores aspects of Mill's and
   Marx/Engels' work and contemporary reception. It identifies a
   resemblance between their historical dialectics. Marx's communism is
   driven by logics of agency' and structure' (including the tendency of
   profit rates to fall'). In Mill's dialectic a thesis', material
   progress, calls forth its antithesis', diminishing returns. The
   inevitable Aufhebung' is a stationary state of wealth and population;
   Mill mentions countervailing tendencies but fails to consider their
   capacity to postpone utopia's arrival. Today, Mill's schema lives on in
   ecological economics, shorn of determinism but with its market advocacy
   intact. It appears to contrast with the productive forces expansion'
   espoused by Marx/Engels. They stand accused of Promethean arrogance',
   ignoring natural limits' and gambling on abundance'. But I find these
   criticisms to be ill-judged, and propose an alternative reading, arguing
   that their work contains a critique of the growth paradigm', and that
   their cornucopian' ends do not sanction Promethean' means.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the inter-relationships between neoliberalism,
   tourism and nature. It argues that scholars of international political
   economy (IPE) need to engage more fully with the role of nature in
   driving forward the logics of neoliberalism. Most scholars view nature
   as a source of accumulation or as an object of governance, but this
   paper uses the neoliberalisation of nature debate to extend our
   understandings of neoliberalism. In particular, global tourism has
   targeted and opened up new frontiers in nature, which serves to expand
   and deepen neoliberalism to a wider range of biophysical phenomena. This
   paper uses the case of elephant tourism to demonstrate how tourism is
   not just reflective of neoliberalism, but is in fact a key driver of it,
   acting as an environmental fix for capitalism. Further, this paper takes
   up the challenge of research on actually existing neoliberalisms' via
   engagement with locally specific contexts and emerging forms of
   socio-nature in the Thai tourism industry. It reveals how neoliberalism
   redraws the boundaries of access to nature, thereby shifting the
   distribution of costs and benefits. Hence, nature is one of the primary
   ways in which neoliberalism is constituted, albeit in a highly
   differentiated way. This reminds us not to reify neoliberalism and
   accord it a greater degree of power and coherence than it really has.},

Abstract = {Russia's recovery from the deep economic crisis it experienced in
   20082009 did not deliver clear political dividends for the Russian
   leadership. This is because of the context in which the crisis occurred
   and the way that the leadership, particularly President Medvedev, and
   many of its critics described the crisis. The oil-fuelled boom that
   preceded the crisis had the effect of deepening it. Economic recovery
   based on rising energy prices looks like a failure, rather than a
   success, and highlights the underlying structural problems of the
   Russian economy. Arguments about the need for modernisation from within
   government exacerbated this perception. This seems to have weakened the
   connection between approval for the leadership and economic growth, a
   staple of pre-crisis politics.},

Abstract = {An emergent literature on transnationalism has been burgeoning since the
   1990s to examine new patterns of immigrant settlement. Research to date
   has emphasized the effects of transnationalism on the development in
   sending countries rather than receiving countries, focused on immigrant
   groups from Latin America rather than Asia, and examined individuals
   rather than immigrant organizations as units of analysis. As a
   consequence, we do not have reliable knowledge about the impacts of
   transnationalism on immigrant communities in the host society and the
   extent and sources of intergroup variations. To fill this gap and to
   supplement knowledge gained from Latin American experiences, this
   article offers a conceptual framework for analyzing the relationship
   between transnationalism and community building by examining Chinese
   ethnic organizations in the United States. We show that immigrants often
   engage their ancestral homelands via organizations and that
   organizational transnationalism contributes to strengthening the
   infrastructure and symbolic systems of the ethnic community and
   enhancing the community's capacity to generate resources conducive to
   immigrant incorporation.},

Abstract = {Has a Beijing Consensus emerged to challenge the Washington Consensus?
   If so, what is the essence of this alternative consensus and why does it
   matter? This article argues that efforts at a definitive description of
   a Chinese model of stateeconomy relations, especially as it compares to
   the original policy recommendations of the Washington Consensus, have
   and will continue to prove unsatisfying. This is because any such
   comparative exercise is inherently political and prone to various angles
   of critique. Instead, this article argues that it is precisely because
   of the politics of such comparison that competing and often
   contradictory portrayals of a Beijing Consensus or China Model have
   taken on importance inside and outside of China. This article further
   argues that western accounts of a Beijing Consensus or China Model
   alternative to the Washington Consensus too often ignore or minimize the
   contentious debates within China about how best to describe Chinese
   economic governance. This study, in contrast, seeks to understand
   China's relationship to the Washington Consensus by exploring how
   concepts like the Beijing Consensus or China Model are deployed and
   contested outside and inside of China. The article concludes by offering
   suggestions for further research on the domestic Chinese and
   international policy implications of debates about the Beijing
   Consensus.},

Abstract = {European identification has previously been explained by the selective
   gains brought by the European integration process, by personal
   transnational experiences and by the influence of political programmes
   aiming at increasing levels of identification. All these explanations
   imply that identification with one's continent would be specific in
   extent and distribution across the social structure in Europe compared
   to other continents. These assumptions are tested using International
   Social Survey Programme (ISSP) and a longitudinal analysis using
   Eurobarometer. Results show that, first, the extent of continental
   identification in Europe is not higher than in other continents. Second,
   they reveal that there has been no increase in European identification
   in recent decades. And third, the socio-structural distribution of
   continental identification is similar on all continents. Accordingly,
   explaining European identification with respect to policy output of the
   European Union is questioned by the findings. The results rather hint at
   the possibility that European identification is independent of political
   integration.},

Title = {Transcending the deregulation debate? Regulation, risk, and the
   enforcement of health and safety law in the UK},

Abstract = {This paper considers the context for the development of the concept of
   responsive regulation, namely the transcending of the deregulation
   debate. It argues that claims regarding responsive regulation when
   allied to risk-based rationales for enforcement can, in fact, allow a
   deregulatory momentum to develop. This argument is grounded with
   reference to a case study of the regulation of workplace health and
   safety in the UK, with a particular focus upon the period 20002010. The
   paper casts doubt on the relevance and robustness of the concept of
   responsive regulation. In a context that might have been fertile ground
   for developing genuinely responsive regulatory policy, empirically we
   find the development of policies that are better described as regulatory
   degradation. Thus we argue in this paper that, whatever the intentions
   of its proponents, there is a logical affinity between responsive
   regulation, and effective de-regulation, and that it is this affinity
   that has provided a convenient political rationale for the emergence of
   a neo-liberal regulatory settlement in the UK.},

Abstract = {Purpose - Prior research suggests that high school experiences shape
   young adult political behaviors, particularly among immigrant youth. The
   U.S. social studies classroom, focused on democratic citizenship
   education, proves an interesting socializing institution.
   Methods - Through qualitative inquiry, we interviewed Latino immigrant
   young adults and their former teachers regarding their high school
   social studies experiences and evolving political and civic engagement.
   Findings - Armed with experience bridging the worlds of the school and
   home, immigrant students respond and relate to the content and pedagogy
   of the social studies classroom in such a way that they (1) participate
   in civic discourse and (2) nurture a disposition toward leadership
   through teachers' civic expectations of them and instructional emphasis
   on critical thinking skills.
   Social implications - The ability to engage in civic discourse and a
   disposition toward leadership are both necessary to foster America's
   democratic ideals, and to take on leadership roles during adulthood.
   With focused effort on the unique perspective of immigrant youth, high
   school social studies teachers can nurture in these students the ability
   to become leaders in young adulthood, broadening the potential
   leadership pool.
   Originality - This study highlights how the social studies curriculum
   may be particularly salient to Latino immigrant youth as they transition
   from adolescence to young adulthood and develop their political and
   civic identities.},

Abstract = {This article draws from critical mass studies of gender in other
   political institutions to inform an application to the US Courts of
   Appeals. The results demonstrate the utility of considering court-level
   aspects of diversity. As mixed-sex panels become more common within a
   circuit, both male and female judges increasingly support plaintiffs in
   civil rights claims, though the magnitude of the effect is larger for
   women. The presence of a female chief judge is also positively
   associated with pro-plaintiff decisions by men and women in sex
   discrimination cases.},

Abstract = {This study draws upon the insights of Michel Foucault to examine the
   contemporary immigration industrial complex in the United States. We
   focus on the involvement of private prison corporations in this complex,
   as well as the factors that have been essential to its creation and that
   perpetuate its continuance. We argue that four key aspects of the system
   (the legal apparatus, worldviews/ideas, private corporations, and webs
   of influence) converge to create an immigration industrial complex and
   that this complex functions as an economy of power that works to manage
   the existing system and discourages fundamental reform.},

Abstract = {This study investigates how government ideology matters for the success
   of World Bank economic policy loans, which typically support
   market-liberalizing reforms. A simple model predicts that World Bank
   staff will invest more effort in designing an economic policy loan when
   faced with a left-wing government. Empirically, estimates from a Heckman
   selection model show that the quality at entry of an economic policy
   loan is significantly higher for governments with a left-wing party
   orientation. This result is robust to changes in the sample, alternative
   measures of ideology, different estimation techniques and the inclusion
   of additional control variables. Next, robust findings from estimating a
   recursive triangular system of equations indicate that leftist
   governments comply more fully with loan agreements. Results also suggest
   that World Bank resources are more productive-in terms of reform
   success-in the design of policy operations than in their supervision.
   Anecdotal evidence from several country cases is consistent with the
   finding that left-wing governments receive higher quality loans.},

Abstract = {The Europeanization literature has extensively examined the influence of
   the European employment strategy (EES) on Member States' employment
   policies. However, two least-likely cases - Greece and Portugal - have
   been neglected in the literature. This article focuses on the activation
   of public employment services (PES), which has been one of the key
   elements of the EES. Based on a sample of 44 semi-structured interviews
   and primary and secondary document research on seven reform episodes
   during 1995-2009, it finds that the EES altered Greek and Portuguese
   employment policies by empowering policy entrepreneurs and, when the
   latter were absent, through European Social Fund financial
   conditionality. While the literature considers policy learning as the
   chief EES-Europeanization mechanism, little evidence is found herein to
   support such an explanation. The findings may be relevant for a number
   of EU policies based on voluntarism and EU funds, such as the new
   flagship EU initiative Europe 2020.},

Abstract = {Two decades of aggressive neoliberalisation in Russia has failed to
   produce a uniform system of private property and profit-maximising
   enterprises. Instead, the complex interactions of multiple practices of
   property' that are pre-Soviet, Soviet and post-Soviet in origin, and not
   private property alone, have created a diverse economic landscape.
   Moreover, multiple practices of property have produced both capitalist
   economies (such as Moscow's early capitalist enterprises) and
   non-capitalist, ethically guided economies (such as the indigenous
   enterprises of Arctic reindeer herders). The persistence of alternative
   economic logics in Russia illustrates the limits of the role of private
   property in shaping the post-Soviet economy.},

Abstract = {As opposed to the current literature which argues that informal politics
   pervades formal institutions in Kazakhstan and Central Asia more widely,
   this article argues that Nur Otan, the political party of the President
   of Kazakhstan, acts as a formal institution to counter the instability
   generated by informal networks competing for access to political and
   economic resources. This is achieved by consolidating the political
   parties associated with these networks into Nur Otan and the
   synchronisation of the party and the state apparatus. However, the
   extent to which Nur Otan can provide this stabilising function in the
   long term is dependent upon regime dynamics.},

Abstract = {This article is based on the first collection of testimonies of female
   former political prisoners in Tunisia. Relying on purposive rather than
   random sampling, the interviews were aimed at contributing to an
   authentic Tunisian process of transitional justice that takes cultural,
   religious and gender-based norms into consideration. To date, the voices
   of conservative Islamist women detained under the Tunisian dictatorship
   have been significantly absent from the national discourse on
   transitional justice. Select voices of women are presented here that can
   begin to address this gap. The newly elected provisional government, in
   which the Islamist Ennahda Party enjoys a majority, has established a
   Ministry of Human Rights and Transitional Justice, the first of its kind
   in the world. While this augurs well for Tunisia's future, there is fear
   that the transitional justice process may nonetheless be captured by
   political agendas.},

Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {188-209},

Abstract = {In 2008, debates over the deployment of body scanners in EU airports
   gave rise to imbroglios of technologies, bodies, law, and policies.
   Eventually, these entanglements appeared to be undone and resolved by
   the concealment of bodies from the screens of the machineswhich had,
   meanwhile, been renamed security scanners. Using the concept of setting,
   this article describes the processes of disappearance operating among a
   vivid multiplicity of actants and connections and identifies three main
   paradoxical features characterizing them. Based on this analysis, the
   article advances the notion of the politics of disappearance, where
   heterogeneous elementsboth material and immaterial, visible as well as
   invisibleactively contribute to the making of a security practice and,
   potentially, to the opening of political landscapes.},

Abstract = {Poor urban communities experience high rates of incarceration and
   prisoner reentry. This article examines where former prisoners live
   after prison, focusing on returns to pre-prison social environments,
   residential mobility, and the role of intermediate sanctions-punishments
   for parole violations that are less severe than returning to prison-on
   where former prisoners live. Drawing on a unique dataset that uses
   administrative records to follow a cohort of Michigan parolees released
   in 2003 over time, we examine returns to pre-prison environments, both
   immediately after prison and in the months and years after release. We
   then investigate the role of intermediate sanctions in residential
   mobility among parolees. Our results show low rates of return to former
   neighborhoods and high rates of residential mobility after prison, a
   significant portion of which is driven by intermediate sanctions
   resulting from criminal justice system supervision. These results
   suggest that, through parole supervision, the criminal justice system
   generates significant residential mobility.},

Abstract = {This article examines the implications of extension of competence to the
   Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in the area of immigration
   policy. Through analysis of the implications for Italy, France and the
   Netherlands of CJEU decisions on expulsion and family reunification it
   is shown that an EU rule of law has developed that can constrain the
   executive branch of Member State governments. This means that the EU can
   no longer be conceptualized in the area of immigration policy as merely
   an external venue to which Member States escape' in order to circumvent
   legal constraints at national level. The growing role of the CJEU forces
   instead a reconceptualization of the dynamics of immigration law and
   policy in Europe.},

Abstract = {Japan is one of a few developed countries in which marriage and higher
   earning potential among women are negatively associated. Previous
   studies have suggested that a traditional gender division of labor is at
   the root of this negative relationship, but this study suggests that the
   relationship is changing. In this article, I examine the latest marriage
   behavior among Japanese women from 1993 to 2008, focusing on the
   relationship between women's economic emancipation and marriage in a
   gender-traditional society. Using the longest panel survey available in
   Japan, this study first demonstrates that the effects of women's
   earnings have reversed, and are now in fact positive in the 1970s
   cohort. This suggests that Japanese marriage behaviors now resemble more
   than in the past those of Western countries, where wives' economic
   contributions to the family are considered important. I argue that
   changes in young adults' gender ideology have been the major force in
   facilitating this shift.},

Abstract = {This article explores the lessons of family change in the West for
   emerging patterns of change in East and Southeast Asia, especially for
   the transition to adulthood. This passage has become more protracted and
   less predictable in Western nations. There is also a great deal of
   variation in the patterning of the adult transition in different nations
   in Europe and the Anglo-speaking nations. I identify some of the reasons
   for this variation-economic, cultural, and institutional-that account
   for the varied regimes of early adulthood and speculate how they may
   impact different Asian countries, owing to historical, cultural, and
   institutional patterns.},

Abstract = {What impact do human rights international non-governmental organizations
   (hereafter HROs) have on the initiation of economic sanctions? The
   extant literatures on sanctions and transnational non-state groups have
   largely overlooked the role, if any, the activities of these
   transnational non-state actors have on the use of economic coercion as a
   popular policy tool. In this study, we argue that HROs could affect
   sanction decisions through two distinct mechanisms: information
   production ({''}shaming and blaming{''}) and local empowerment (local
   presence). By bringing poor human rights performers into the
   international spotlight, we argue that this effect should hold even
   after accounting for human rights practices in the targeted countries.
   Using dyadic data on HROs and economic sanctions, we find robust support
   for our basic argument that HRO activities increase the likelihood of
   sanction events against repressive regimes. Additionally, much of the
   empirical support highlights the role of information production, as
   opposed to local empowerment, in leading to sanction onset. Overall, our
   findings indicate that HROs are powerful actors in influencing foreign
   policy decisions between states.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {32-54},
Abstract = {Politicization as a term used in intelligence studies is poorly defined,
   conceptualized and operationalized. Despite the negative connotations
   associated with the word politicization that equate it with a form of
   corruption, it is not entirely clear what it is a corruption of. In
   short, the concept of politicization is for the most part analytically
   useless. This article critiques the existing status quo
   conceptualization for being overly broad and insufficiently nuanced,
   explores the nature of analytic politicization as a subset of
   politicization writ large, and replaces it with a narrower
   conceptualization that explains what makes analytic politicization bad
   and deserving of condemnation. Based on this evaluation, one can
   conclude that much of what is considered to be politicization in a
   corrupted sense is really just a naturally-occurring consequence of
   analysis and interpretation in a policy or political context},

Abstract = {This paper examines the proposition that the economic performance of
   advanced capitalist countries depends on their size and ethnic
   composition. As such it blends insights from two important literatures
   in comparative political economy. One is exemplified by the work of
   Peter Katzenstein, who wrote the classic treatise on the relationship
   between nation-state size and economic performance. Another is
   illustrated by the work of Ernest Gellner, whose work suggested that
   economic performance depends on the ethnic composition of the
   nation-state. The argument is tested on pooled data from 30 advanced
   capitalist countries for the 1985 through 2007 period. Regression
   analysis confirms that ethnically homogenous countries tend to have
   stronger rates of economic growth during this period than ethnically
   heterogeneous countries but that neither the size of countries nor the
   interaction of size and ethnic composition have significant effects.
   This points to the need for further exploration of these issues either
   with data covering a longer time frame or historical case studies.},

Abstract = {This article utilizes qualitative research from South Africa to
   problematize the global movement for the legalization of same-sex
   marriage. Taking seriously the centrality of sexuality to the
   establishment of empire, the article locates marriage as a mechanism not
   only of heteronormativity, but also of racialization. While marriage is
   heralded by international and national LGBT organizations as the
   greatest measure of societal inclusion within a liberal democracy, the
   article argues that heteronormativity, through the institution of
   marriage, is reinforced rather than challenged or shifted with the
   inclusion of same-sex couples. For black lesbian women in South Africa,
   the reinforcement of heteronorms has very real consequences, not least
   of which is the further entrenchment of a discourse that characterizes
   same-sex sexuality as un-African'. The article suggests that the
   inclusion' in citizenship extended by marriage legislation comes at
   great cost and concludes by suggesting a reprioritization of goals for
   global LGBTIQ movements.},

Abstract = {The social safety net responded in significant and favorable ways during
   the Great Recession. Aggregate per capita expenditures in safety net
   programs grew significantly, with particularly strong growth in the
   SNAP, EITC, UI, and Medicaid programs. The increase in transfers was
   widely shared across demographic groups, including families with and
   without children, and single-parent and two-parent families. Transfers
   grew as well among families with more employed members and with fewer
   employed members. In the low-income population, however, the increase in
   transfer amounts was not strongly progressive across income classes,
   with transfers to those just below or above the poverty line increasing
   slightly, compared to those at the bottom of the income distribution.
   This was mainly because of the EITC program, which provides greater
   benefits to those with higher family earnings. The expansions of SNAP
   and UI benefitted those at the bottom of the income distribution to a
   greater extent.},

Abstract = {This Special Issue of the Journal of Human Rights Practice is dedicated
   to critical reflection on the protection of human rights defenders
   (HRDs). In this article we consider existing research and knowledge
   about the protection of HRDs, highlight the contributions of the policy
   and practice notes in this collection, and put forward current issues
   and questions on the protection of HRDs for further exploration.
   Specifically, we highlight eight areas for research: the definition and
   use of the term `human rights defender'; perceptions of risk, security
   and protection; culture, gender and diversity (with particular emphasis
   on protecting women human rights defenders); the use of legal and
   administrative mechanisms for repression; the effectiveness of
   protection mechanisms; strategies and tactics for protection; fostering
   enabling environments for the defence of human rights; and the impact of
   technology and digital security on HRDs. In the last section of this
   article, we highlight the importance of more collaboration between
   academics, practitioners and HRDs for the effective evolution of
   protection mechanisms and practices. We reflect on the merits and
   challenges of collaborative applied research, suggesting how this can be
   done effectively.},

Abstract = {In 2007, the EU decided to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20/30 per
   cent, something which was considered a proof of the EU's willingness to
   take on high targets independently of others. In the period 2009-11, the
   EU was debating but could not reach an agreement on stepping up to a 30
   per cent reduction target. This raises the question: why did the EU go
   from being capable of adopting high targets independently of others to
   being incapable of agreeing whether it should increase its mitigation
   effort? It is argued that whereas actors sceptical of a high target
   could be rhetorically entrapped in 2007, such entrapment was impossible
   in the 2009-11 period. The lack of entrapment can be explained in terms
   of changes in the international and socio-economic contexts, which led
   to changes in the policy processes and the normative environment, which
   again made effective entrapment impossible.},

Abstract = {The structural funds were designed to give the European Commission
   supranational control over where regional aid was spent. In this
   article, we argue that domestic pork-barrel' politics determine which
   regions are awarded regional aid in the new member states of Eastern
   Europe. Support for our argument comes from a dataset that includes
   1,688 European Regional Development Fund grants to Latvia's 118 regions
   and 1,533 pre-accession Phare awards to Bulgaria's 264 municipalities.
   In both Bulgaria and Latvia, we find that regional aid projects went to
   wealthier not poorer localities, and to those that supported coalition
   parties in the previous election.},

Abstract = {A criticism of evaluation practice in regional policy in Central and
   Eastern Europe (CEE) countries is that it stresses its function in terms
   of accountability and formal reporting on progress, rather than its role
   in policy or institutional learning. This article aims to test this
   critique through the use of system thinking' and focuses on the case of
   regional policy in Poland, where evaluation practice has developed
   dynamically since 2000. It contributes to the literature by developing
   an analytical framework that sets out the role of evaluation in regional
   policy learning and identifies key factors and mechanisms that determine
   the development of an effective evaluation system for regional policy.
   The analysis draws on all Polish evaluation studies conducted between
   1999 and 2010, interviews with civil servants and experts involved in
   the implementation of cohesion policy programmes, as well as secondary
   data from earlier studies. The essay identifies key mechanisms and
   factors that determine the main function of evaluation as a learning
   tool that produces and utilises knowledge in the decision-making
   process. These main elements are: growth in funding of the policy;
   stability of institutions; motivators; and system architecture.},

Abstract = {In 1957, Nikita Khrushchev initiated a reorganisation of economic
   administration in the Soviet Union that became known as the Sovnarkhoz
   reform. The reform had a major impact on the perception of the role of
   the republic-level authorities in the system. It also put to the test
   the ability of central managers and planners to consider alternative
   ways of administering industry. The article examines the experience of
   the Ukrainian republic-level authorities in the most crucial aspect of
   the reform, management of resources, paying particular attention to the
   controversies related to control of inter-republic deliveries.},

Title = {Civil Society and the Resurgent Struggle against Impunity in Uruguay
   (1986-2012)},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {306-327},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {With the approval on 27 October 2011 of Law 18.831, the Uruguayan
   parliament voted to overturn the 1986 Expiry Law, a law long criticized
   by human rights advocates because it prevented the criminal prosecution
   of human rights abuses committed during the country's military
   dictatorship (1973-1985). By overturning what many considered the
   lynchpin of institutionalized impunity in Uruguay, the new law restores
   the state's capacity to prosecute human rights violations. Although a
   number of factors contributed to this surprising outcome, including a
   more permissible opportunity structure (the successive election of two
   left-wing governments) and the willingness of some judicial operators to
   challenge the Expiry Law, this article argues that the key explanatory
   variable to understanding these recent developments is the persistent
   demands of civil society groups over time. Civil society groups
   developed innovative strategies and incorporated new groups that gave
   renewed strength to the resurgent struggle against impunity in Uruguay.
   The article concludes with reflections on the significance of Uruguay's
   renewed accountability efforts for transitional justice debates.},

Volume = {648},

Abstract = {Of the estimated 10 million youths living with HIV worldwide, 63 percent
   live in sub-Saharan Africa. This article focuses on migration as a risk
   factor of HIV infection among the youths in sub-Saharan Africa. The
   study is based on multilevel modeling, applied to the youth sample of
   the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), conducted from 2003 to 2008 in
   nineteen countries. The analysis takes into account country-level and
   regional-level variations. The results suggest that across countries in
   sub-Saharan Africa, migrants have on average about 50 percent higher
   odds of HIV infection than nonmigrants. The higher risk among migrants
   is to a large extent explained by differences in demographic and
   socioeconomic factors. In particular, migrants are more likely to be
   older, to have been married, or to live in urban areas, all of which are
   associated with higher risks of HIV infection. The higher risk among
   youths who have been married is particularly pronounced among young
   female migrants.},

Abstract = {In this essay an evaluation of the content and determinants of the EU's

   firstly, did the ICJ's judgment alter EU policy towards Kosovo and
   Serbia and, secondly, was EU policy towards Kosovo and Serbia effective?
   It is argued that the EU's response to the ICJ's judgment in 2010 has
   been consistent and effective, but that the underlying determinants of
   the policy have not changed since 2008. It is argued that the EU's
   response to the ICJ's judgment in 2010 has been consistent and effective
   and that the ICJ judgment has had a catalytic effect on the EU's
   influence over Serbia and the Serbia-Kosovo relationship. Overall, EU
   policy has been effective, despite being periodically ad hoc.},

Abstract = {The growing number of female suicide bombers in the Muslim world has
   recently received a lot of attention by academics and journalists in the
   West. This developing literature has tended to understand these women as
   victims or pawns of Islamic patriarchy. This article offers critical
   review of the causal accounts of female suicide bombing in order to show
   how these discourses of victimization reify a masculinist justification
   for American empire. This narrative of empire produces Islam as a
   religion/culture of patriarchy and, thus, reads Muslim women as needing
   rescue from their religion and their men in order to validate military
   intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan. Working from the post-colonial
   insights of Gayatri Spivak, this article argues that female suicide
   bombers reflect a subaltern status in the war on terror. As such, these
   conceptualizations of the causes of female suicide bombing proffer a
   narrative of masculine rescue against the barbaric force of Islamic
   patriarchy, rendering the war on terror as a homoterritorial war over
   masculine dominance in the region.},

Abstract = {The negotiation of migration issues within the Latin American Southern
   Cone Market (Mercosur) has gained momentum lately and has followed a
   specific (relatively autonomous and fast) dynamic that is unprecedented
   and contrasts with the slow and conflictive negotiations to achieve the
   bloc's economic goals. This study explains why negotiations to harmonize
   migration policies are taking place, why now, and how this is happening
   in a way that contradicts previous assumptions. It highlights a number
   of facts and explanatory factors largely neglected by the existing
   literature, such as: (1) instable political contexts in which social
   inequality, marginalization, and discontent call attention to
   socio-political issues and prompt state attempts to regulate human
   mobility cooperatively; (2) regional leadership that is not simply based
   on relative power and economic interests but on ideologically-loaded
   political projects and key actors who forge and legitimize a
   post-neoliberal consensus linking domestic and foreign policy
   strategies; (3) policy networks of private and public actors whose ideas
   inform top policy-makers discourses and contribute to the processes of
   socialization of policy elites, construction of shared understandings,
   and cultivation of cooperative practices that feed regional integration.
   The findings and conclusions shed light on the interplay between
   domestic politics and foreign policy, as well as the processes of
   coalition- and identity-building that are allowing South American
   governments to expand cooperation in a piecemeal and somewhat
   inconsistent fashion.},

Abstract = {Much contemporary policy seeking to address the problems of urban
   poverty and the failures of public housing focuses on deconcentrating
   poverty through the relocation of public housing residents to less-poor
   neighborhoods or by replacing large public housing complexes with
   mixed-income developments. Lying behind these efforts is a set of
   generally integrationist goals, aiming to remove public housing
   residents from contexts of isolation and concentrated disadvantage and
   settle them in safer, healthier, and more supportive environments that
   better connect them to resources, relationships, and opportunities.
   Although some of the goals of these efforts are being met, the broader
   integrationist goals are proving elusive. Focusing on the mixed-income
   component of Chicago's Plan for Transformation-the most ambitious effort
   to remake public housing in the country-this article argues that a range
   of institutional actors (including developers, property management,
   community-based organizations, and the housing authority) and
   organizational behaviors (around design, service provision,
   intervention, deliberation, and representation) shape dynamics that
   reproduce exclusion and work against the integrationist goals of these
   policies.},

Abstract = {In the context of transition, nine out of the 10 post-communist
   countries that ultimately joined the European Union reluctantly
   privatised the bulk of their banking sectors with foreign capital. The
   financial crisis of 20082009 therefore sparked fears that foreign banks
   would remove their operations from their Central and East European
   markets because of a home bias' in lending. Such fears were predicated
   on the widely held beliefs that banks' loyalties lie with their home
   markets and that it is therefore desirable to protect domestic bank
   ownership to help combat an economic downturn. This essay casts doubt on
   the value of banking sector protectionism by comparing foreign and
   domestic bank behaviour in Central and Eastern Europe during the crisis.
   The essay finds no consistent relationship between domestic control and
   either limited economic vulnerability or countercyclical lending.},

Abstract = {This article compares the decision-making structures of the Association
   of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) with those of the European Union
   (EU). It asks whether the EU is an appropriate template for ASEAN or
   whether, given the apparently unique circumstances of European
   integration and Southeast Asian regionalism, analogies between the two
   are counterproductive. Attempts, for example, to model ASEAN's Committee
   of Permanent Representatives (CPR) on the EU's Committee of Permanent
   Representatives (Coreper) throw into relief the latter's uniquely
   consensual modus operandi. Can this consensus be replicated by ASEAN
   simply by institutional mimesis? First, the EU's evolution is briefly
   outlined; second, ASEAN's institutional architecture is set in the
   context of the ASEAN Charter's innovations that most invite comparison
   with the EU; and third, the two organizations are compared by assessing
   a zone of discretion' between setting ambitious, but realistic, goals
   for ASEAN's greater integration and adopting structures that might be
   inappropriate to ASEAN.},

Abstract = {The financial crisis that erupted in September 2008 seemed to confirm
   all the worst stereotypes about the United States held abroad: that
   Americans are bold, greedy, and selfish to excess; that they are
   hypocrites, staunch defenders of the free market ready to bail out their
   own companies; and that the US has long been the architect and primary
   beneficiary of the global economic system. So the crisis had an enormous
   potential for deteriorating further the global image of the United
   States, already at an all-time high during the George W. Bush era. Yet
   anti-American sentiments did not surge worldwide as a result of the
   crisis, neither at the level of public opinion, nor at the level of
   actions and policy responses by foreign policy-makers. This article
   explains why the dog did not bark and reawaken anti-Americanism in the
   process. The central argument is that this potential anti-Americanism
   has been mitigated by several factors, including the election of Obama,
   the new face of globalization, and the perception of the relative
   decline of US power coupled with the rise of China, which suggests that
   the post-American world may be accompanied by a post anti-American
   world, at least in Europe.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Pages = {420-437},
Abstract = {A major school of thought in Israel asserts that: (1) a cornerstone of
   the Israeli security doctrine is gaining early warning based more on
   changes of the enemy's capabilities and less on learning its intentions;
   and (2) that deviation from the doctrine caused the strategic surprise
   experienced by the state on the outbreak of the 1973 Yom Kippur war.
   This assertion is examined here by looking into another case in which
   Israel was also militarily surprised. In February 1960 the Egyptian Army
   deployed offensively along the joint border, while the IDF remained
   unaware of the situation. Israel's conduct during the affair - known as
   the Rotem Affair - was based on lenient assessments (derived from
   sigint) regarding the Egyptian intentions, ignoring their capabilities.
   It transpires, therefore, that dominance of `early warning of
   intentions' has been the rule rather than the exception.},

Abstract = {During the first two decades following the collapse of the communist
   regime, Romania has reckoned with the human rights infringements
   perpetrated from 1945 to 1989 with the help of a range of official and
   unofficial, judiciary and non-judiciary, backward- and forward-looking
   methods pursued by a variety of state and non-state actors. This article
   summarises the progress registered to date in court trials, lustration,
   access to secret files, property restitution, the truth commission,
   rehabilitation of former political prisoners, compensation to victims
   and their descendants, the opinion tribunal, forensic investigations,
   rewriting history books, unofficial truth projects and memorialisation.},

   succeeded in overcoming internal government prejudice to become His

   Foreign Office had banned the covert intelligence agencies from
   operating within the Soviet sphere, which included the Baltic states,
   the non- covert Foreign Research and Press Service Baltic States Section
   could operate without offending the USSR. The article charts how the
   Foreign Research and Press Service supplied crucial information from the

Abstract = {Over the last 10years, economic issues related to currency policy have
   become the major ongoing dispute between China and the United States.
   Specifically, the US Congress has demanded a tougher policy to avert the
   negative consequences of unfair Chinese policiesin the form of a
   manipulated currencyfor the US economy. Building on an analytical
   framework of discourse theory (DT)and proposing a method for applying DT
   in empirical researchan investigation into congressional debates on the
   Chinese currency shows that the question is not a purely economic one,
   but rather that it reflects a dislocation of US identity as the vanguard
   of liberal-democratic capitalism. This dislocation involves changes to
   how liberal identity in the US Congress is articulated in relation to
   the role attributed to illiberal China, which in turn affects the
   formulation of US China policy in Congress.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {497-517},

Abstract = {This article explores the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) as a site
   of contestation and consolidation for the fields of international
   criminal justice (ICJ) and transitional justice (TJ). Created in
   response to the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri in
   2005, the STL exhibits the particularly confined notions of `justice'
   that are at play across the ICJ field. An examination of domestic
   Lebanese debates surrounding the Tribunal reveals, however, that
   `justice' in the Lebanese case possesses many meanings. Rather than
   accept the false binary of the international over the domestic and the
   trial over broad-based social dialogue, this analysis of the STL reveals
   ways in which meanings of justice remain open to contestation both on
   the ground and in ICJ and TJ. The article illustrates this by examining
   the international-domestic law binary at play in the STL's establishment
   and the way local Lebanese actors have challenged it in the country's
   ongoing struggle for postconflict political stability.},

Abstract = {Starting from the empirical observation of high levels of absorption of
   EU cohesion funds but strikingly low levels of substantive change in
   regional cohesion, this essay offers a contextual analysis of regional
   development policies in Hungary. Based on theoretical frameworks dealing
   with Europeanisation, new regionalism and participative development, it
   explores the reasons for this observation by analysing the role of
   administrative and planning structures and of development discourses.
   The essay shows that the Europeanisation of regional development policy
   triggered several changes in the planning process and led to the partial
   inclusion of new actors. However, the main effect of this was a growing
   centralisation of development policy making. The essay explains this by
   pointing to the domestic political context and the historical
   foundations of regional development discourses of the conservative and
   leftist liberal parties. While there are overlaps between the discourses
   on both sides of the ideological divide, they are perceived as
   incompatible by political actors. Thus, it is argued that considerations
   of political power, rather than ideological nature, shape Hungarian
   regional and development policy and explain the incremental reform
   process.},

Abstract = {Does politics still matter for reducing income inequality in new
   democracies? The standard explanation is that political institutions, in
   particular the left government and proportional representation, are
   negatively associated with income inequality among advanced industrial
   countries, but there have been so few studies attempting to explain the
   variation of distributional outcomes across new democracies. This
   article tests the hypotheses about the effects of political institutions
   on income inequality with unbalanced pooled time-series cross-sectional
   data that cover 26 fledgling democracies for 1975-2006. The evidence
   presented here suggests that, other things being equal, a parliamentary
   system and PR are substantially more likely to be associated with lower
   levels of income inequality, but a left government and more years of
   democracy do not appear to be related to lower income inequality.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the (in)equality of the European budget with
   respect to financial contributions and expenditures across Member
   States. Standard tools from the measurement of income inequality,
   including the Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient, are applied to the
   distribution of European Union contributions and expenditure. In
   addition, the inequality in the allocation of the budget is juxtaposed
   against the distribution of voting power within the Council of
   Ministers. Redistribution from rich to poor members can mainly be
   attributed to unequal per capita contributions in funding the EU budget,
   while voting power rather than the needs of individual members dominates
   with respect to expenditure. The accession to the EU of relatively
   smaller eastern European countries in 2004 and 2007 delivered more
   voting power to poorer countries with relatively small population
   shares. This change reinforced the voting power effect in expenditures.},

Abstract = {Using a case study of the Goromonzi District in Zimbabwe, this article
   explores whether women's participation in informal politics leads to the
   collective empowerment of women at the community level. Furthermore, the
   article seeks to investigate opportunities and constraints that exist
   for improving the position of women. Results show that due to unequal
   access to and control over resources, discriminatory attitudes and
   perceptions against women, and entrenched systems of political
   patronage, participating in informal local-level politics may empower
   individuals, but it does not empower women as a group. To be empowering,
   informal political organizations should pursue a transformatory
   political agenda that seeks to challenge social relations which
   perpetuate inequality between men and women.},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of internal migration, and its timing,
   on young women's transition to adulthood. Using the 2010 Greater Jakarta
   Transition to Adulthood Survey, we identify five key groups of women
   living in Greater Jakarta: those who were born there, those who migrated
   before the age of 10, those who migrated between ages 10 to 17, those
   who migrated after age 17, and circular migrants. Using retrospective
   quantitative data, we examine the timing of five key adulthood markers
   for each of these groups: leaving the parental home, leaving the
   education system, entering the workforce, marrying, and having children.
   We then explore the extent to which variation in education, marriage,
   and fertility patterns explain the women's current employment outcomes.
   Qualitative findings are also discussed to provide insights on migration
   motivation and the life strategies that these women adopt to navigate
   their transition to adulthood.},

Abstract = {The World Economic Forum (WEF) is a global governance actor that has in
   recent years taken an increased interest in issues pertaining to gender
   equality and women's empowerment. The paper critically investigates the
   work of the WEF in this area, suggesting that WEF-produced gender and
   development discourse is profoundly compatible with the politics and
   practices of neoliberalismnot least in the way in which it aligns gender
   equality and women's empowerment with national economic competitiveness.
   This is, furthermore, a distinctly postfeminist reading of gender that
   rests upon the production of neoliberal-compatible female
   subjectivitiessuch as rational economic woman or Davos womanwho emerge
   as those in society best able to deliver fair and sustainable economic
   growth (effectively rescuing global capitalism from the excesses of
   hypermasculine crisis capitalism). The framing of the case for gender
   equality and women's empowerment in these terms is powerful and may well
   be an effective way for gender advocates to present their demands. But
   by analyzing not only how the WEF has framed/represented gender issues
   but also what has been left out of this representation, the paper points
   to the way in which simplistic representations concerning the
   contribution that women make to economic competitiveness disguise the
   double burdens and gendered structures of socioeconomic inequality that
   are central to the widening and deepening of the market into all spheres
   of social life under conditions of roll-back neoliberalism.},

Abstract = {The burgeoning literature on informal governance has shed new light on
   the workings of international organizations and the hidden rules of the
   game. The common thrust of these studies is that informal governance is
   the result of an implicit agreement among states that, in order to
   sustain cooperation, it can be necessary to accommodate important
   interests even if this seemingly goes against the organization's
   purpose. Struck under conditions of uncertainty, however, implicit
   agreements such as this are necessarily vague, and their implementation
   is bound to generate conflicts that threaten to undermine the
   organization's legitimacy. How, then, do states decide whether formal
   rules or informal governance apply? This article uses the case of the EU
   to propose a solution to this dilemma. The central argument is that
   member states have delegated the authority to adjudicate on demands for
   informal governance to the office of the Council Presidency. They mold
   the legislative agenda such that the government in office can be trusted
   in its judgment. The plausibility of this argument is illustrated with a
   description of the Presidency's historical development and a case study
   on the negotiation of the EU's controversial Working Time Directive.
   Apart from pointing to a missing piece in the literature on informal
   governance, the study holds more general lessons for the interaction of
   formal and informal rules as well as the information-providing role of
   international institutions.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a cognitive and empirical approach, based on
   in-depth semi-structured elite interviews, to analyse the extent to
   which the dollar is becoming a negotiated international currency in the
   perception of financial elites in China, Brazil and the countries of the
   Gulf Cooperation Council. It shows that while the greenback is still the
   top currency in the system due to a lack of alternatives, its long term
   dominance is questioned because its economic pre-eminence and its
   political leadership are perceived to be fading. This in turn is
   stimulating financial elites in emerging markets to promote alternative
   regional monetary frameworks and the internationalisation of their own
   currencies. The article explores how financial elites in key dollar
   holding countries react to the US exorbitant privilege' of not facing
   disciplinary constraints in its economic policies. It then examines how
   the US has been able to misuse its central position in the system by
   delaying and deflecting adjustment costs upon others, and illustrates
   the disapproving response that this has provoked in emerging markets and
   Europe. Finally, it concentrates on Chinese proposals to renegotiate the
   status of the dollar in the system and why these have been hitherto
   rejected by the US.},

   that all manufacturing firms were affected by the crisis and that there
   is no single and dominant transmission channel. Crisis reactions were
   significantly related to participation in international markets,
   although participation in trade, in external borrowing or FDI cannot
   explain recession by themselves. The reversal of growth was mainly
   caused by demand shock and, following that, by financial constraints.
   Thus the hypothesis that blames overheating of internal demand in the
   years prior to the crisis seems to receive statistical backing.
   Globalised companies, though hit by external shocks, were better
   prepared to pay the cost and balance the consequences of the crisis.},

Abstract = {The financial and economic crisis in the Central and East European
   countries raised the profile of economic policy themes that relate to
   the role of taxation and state spending. The key policy differences
   related to public budgets and support for a demand stimulus. Responses
   fall broadly into two categories that we link to a social-democratic and
   a neo-liberal response. The distinction indicates that the policy
   responses were linked to the party affiliation of the government on the
   leftright spectrum. There were some remarkable common trends that cannot
   be explained by the logical requirements of the economic situation
   alone. There are differences in timing and in severity, but every
   country has at some point moved towards a policy of balancing the budget
   by making cuts. In all cases there were cuts in benefits for marginal
   groups in society and a switch towards indirect rather than direct
   taxes. These carry clear distributional implications.},

Title = {The differential demand for indirect rule: evidence from the North

Journal = {POST-SOVIET AFFAIRS},

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {Indirect rule is one of the means that central authorities have long
   employed in hopes of defusing communal conflict and civil war in
   multicultural societies. Yet very little is known about the appeal of
   indirect rule among the ruled themselves. Why do people in some places
   demand more indirect rule and local autonomy, whereas others seem
   content to be governed directly by rulers of an alien culture? This is a
   crucial question with important implications for determining the form of
   governance that is most likely to provide social order in culturally
   heterogeneous societies. Although much attention has been given to
   consider the relative costs and benefits of direct versus indirect rule
   for the central authorities, the other side of the coin - namely, the
   variable demand for indirect rule among the members of distinctive
   cultural groups - has hardly been examined with systematic empirical
   data. This paper presents a theory of the differential demand for
   indirect rule and offers an initial test of its principal empirical
   implications using original micro-level data from the North Caucasus
   region of Russia. The theory's core claim is that the middle class
   should express the greatest demand for indirect rule, while both the
   upper and lower classes should prefer more direct rule. The theory
   therefore predicts that there will be an inverse parabolic relationship
   between the demand for indirect rule and economic class. The findings
   are largely consistent with these theoretical expectations.},

Title = {Giving Effect to Children's Right to Health in Colombia? Analysing the

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Despite major developments to provide conceptual clarity to the legal
   enforcement of economic, social and cultural (ESC) rights, research
   analysing the processes of implementing court rulings and their actual
   impact is scarce, and there is a lack of consensus on the impacts of
   this kind of intervention on public policies, the plaintiffs, society,
   or on how to assess these impacts. This article presents an approach for
   evaluating the implementation of - often complex - judicial rulings
   calling for health system reform. The article is based on an analysis of
   the process of implementation of the Colombian Constitutional Court's
   decision T-760/2008, which ordered extensive reforms of Colombia's
   health system. Concurring with the constitutional protection for
   children's fundamental right to health, decision T-760/2008 includes
   separate orders explicitly addressing children's right to health. The
   focus of the article is on the implementation of these orders related to
   children's access to health care. The article firstly describes the
   legal strategies, including some of the key elements related to
   children's right to health, included in T-760/2008. It then analyses the
   process of implementation through the three mechanisms identified in the
   framework (institutional/organizational, actors and power relations, and
   discourses and ideas), before finally evaluating whether the expected
   outcomes (as described in the parameters of the Court decision) were
   achieved.},

Abstract = {When Gorbachev came to power he inherited not simply a system in crisis,
   but a structure of symbols that was embedded within the broader
   political system and which was also in crisis. Given the ideocratic
   nature of the Soviet system, any change to that system would require
   symbolic change as well. This essay charts how Gorbachev sought to come
   to grips with this problem, investing some symbols with new meaning
   while rejecting others. It shows how ultimately he was unable to produce
   a new, coherent narrative.},

Volume = {7},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {114-123},

Abstract = {This comment extends the vision of Responsive Regulation by noting
   subsequent developments in regulatory pluralism, in particular those
   occurring under private auspices. The apparent weakening or withdrawal
   of state regulatory institutions has inspired considerable regulatory
   activity on the part of non-state actors. In addition, the concurrent
   growth and pervasiveness of digital technology have greatly facilitated
   the involvement of individual citizens in non-state regulatory activity.
   However, the full implications of what might be called wiki-regulation
   remain to be seen. The risks that accompany private regulation may
   include the lack of accountability of non-state regulatory actors, and
   the possibility of their failure. There is also a risk that with the
   increasing salience of what Vogel calls civil regulation, state
   regulatory institutions may atrophy, or fail to develop at all.},

Abstract = {Reminding us of the failure of academia to predict the East European
   revolutions, and the challenges presented by the latter to the theories
   of revolution, the essay claims that in order to understand why the exit
   from communism comprised so many varied modes, one should take a
   path-dependence' diachronic and synchronic comparative perspective.
   Based on this dual approach and a set of variables, the essay advances a
   typology of East European revolutions and argues that the issues
   regarding the type of political regime, the development of civil society
   and its way of interacting with the state are of paramount importance
   for comprehending how the negotiated revolutions' in Central Europe came
   about. Finally, the significance of the Central European civil society
   strategy under late communism for the era of globalisation is addressed.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the development and failure of a plan by the
   Special Operations Executive (SOE) to use a small-scale mutiny by German
   troops in Greece in 1944 to engender a widespread uprising within the
   Reichsarbeitsdienst and the ranks of non-German troops serving in the
   Wehrmacht. Through an analysis of this operation, codenamed
   `Kitchenmaid', an assessment will be made of the capabilities and
   motivations of SOE's Greek section (Force 133); the problem of its
   cooperation with Greek communist guerrillas in relation to British
   foreign policy towards Greece; and the strategic and political value of
   `Kitchenmaid'.},

Abstract = {The lack of academic interest in intelligence in France partly explains
   the prevalence of many preconceived ideas about French Intelligence.
   This article deals with the slow building of France's intelligence
   machinery in the nineteenth century, as part of a study of the modern
   French State. At this time, intelligence practices were transformed by
   the appearance of several intelligence bureaucracies. Studying three
   dimensions of the development - informal practices, formal organizations
   and statutory rules - the article demonstrates the closeness of
   intelligence to politics. Doing so it suggests that intelligence needs
   to be considered not only as an instrument of policy-making but as an
   actor at the centre of the modern French state, a part of its very
   essence.},

Series = {Sociological Studies of Children and Youth},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {16},
Pages = {21-43},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper presents a critical exploration of the concept of
   children's `participation' by looking in more detail at children's right
   to play and the possibilities this presents for a different
   understanding of children as political actors.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper applies a range of concepts,
   largely drawn from Deleuzian philosophy and children's geographies, to
   produce an account of playing that unsettles traditional ways of valuing
   this behaviour. In doing so, it also extends current approaches to
   children's participation rights by presenting play as a primary way in
   which children actively participate in their everyday worlds.
   Observations of children's play are utilised to illustrate the multiple
   ways in which moments of playfulness enliven the spaces and routines of
   children's lives.
   Findings - Playing may be viewed as micro-political expressions in which
   children collectively participate to establish temporary control over
   their immediate environment in order to make things different/better.
   These everyday acts are largely unnoticed by adults and represent a
   markedly different form of political engagement from the ways in which
   children are brought into adult-led political realms. Yet playful
   moments are a vital expression of children's power and ability to
   influence the conditions of their lives.
   Originality/value - Thinking differently about playing offers an
   opportunity to revitalise the very notion of participation. Such a move
   marks a line of flight which opens up the possibility for everyday
   collective acts to disturb dominant ways of accounting for adult-child
   relationships and by doing so establish moments of hope that people can
   get on and go on together by co-creating more just and participative
   spaces of childhood.},

Abstract = {This article explores the link between the financial crisis and
   Euroscepticism at the level of public opinion, building on and
   developing further the literature on the impact of economic, identity
   and institutional factors on Euroscepticism. It argues that the economic
   crisis did not substantially bring economic factors back in as an
   important source of Euroscepticism, even though the most pronounced
   increase in Euroscepticism has taken place in the countries most
   affected by the crisis. By contrast, national identity and political
   institutions play an increasingly important role in explaining public
   Euroscepticism.},

Title = {Turning point: International money and finance in Chinese IPE},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2013},

Abstract = {Unlike the depth of international political economy (IPE) research on
   finance and money in North America and Britain/Europe, or the amount of
   work that has been done inside China on the IPE of international trade,
   the IPE of global finance and money is still at a nascent stage inside
   China. The paper examines the evolution of Chinese IPE research on
   global finance and money and suggests that research in these issue areas
   appears to be reaching a turning point. The main empirical finding is
   that this shift in knowledge production has been induced principally by
   China's emergence as a financial force and the national developmental
   concerns this entails, as well as by the onset of the 2008-09 global
   financial crisis and the rise of the emerging economies' grouping. The
   growing Chinese scholarship on the IPE of finance and money is adding
   analytical depth and broadening Chinese IPE, particularly on the impact
   of financial globalization on developing and emerging economies. While
   such research will likely contribute to Chinese policymaking in the
   future, the scholarly test for Chinese IPE is whether and how it will
   contribute to filling the global knowledge gaps on the determinants of
   financial and monetary policy, and whether it will give rise to new
   understandings on global finance and money, especially the causes of
   international financial crises. Heretofore, much of the literature has
   been heavily policy-oriented and normative.},

Abstract = {The large current account imbalances in the eurozone reflect persistent
   diverging trends between core and periphery countries, also fed by low
   interest rates and abundant capital flows brought about by the
   introduction of the euro. With the global financial crisis, the market
   sentiment has changed, and capital has left the periphery countries
   suffering from debt and growth problems due to their failure to bring
   price-wage dynamics into uniformity with those of the more disciplined
   countries. Germany is called upon to provide financial assistance and
   additional external demand; however, though the euro is at stake,
   Germans are recalcitrant. This article investigates the rationale of the
   German stance in light of the (corporatist-etatist, neo-mercantilist)
   German socio-economic model and the widespread concern about losing the
   competitiveness that Germany regained through painful reforms and
   changes in the last two decades.},

Abstract = {The Great Recession had a profound effect on the retirement security of
   older Americans, and the slow recovery from the downturn will have a
   lasting impact on their quality of life. The nature of today's
   retirement system left older households exposed to the collapse in the
   equity and housing markets and induced many to plan for a later
   retirement. More late-career workers experienced job loss than in
   previous recessions, often with long jobless spells, encouraging a
   record number of early Social Security retirement claims and disability
   applications. Going forward, workers who lost a job can expect lower
   earnings and more instability and, potentially, poorer health. Even
   households that avoided job loss will have less money available for
   spending in retirement due to low interest rates and reduced home
   values. These findings emphasize the importance of Social Security as
   income insurance and the need for a more robust retirement income
   system.},

Abstract = {The effects of recessions on social and political attitudes are likely
   smaller than the effects on employment, income, and wealth, but
   relatively modest aggregate effects may be masking differences in
   attitudes between individuals who live in areas most and least affected
   by recessions. To investigate social and political attitudes in
   geographical context, we exploit a new data source that matches
   individuals to their county of residence to analyze whether changing
   economic conditions at the county level are associated with changing
   confidence in major social institutions and with changing levels of
   interpersonal trust. We find that individuals in particularly affected
   counties are more likely to decrease their support for organized labor
   and the federal government. County-level hardship does not appear to be
   associated with changes in interpersonal measures of trust, however,
   suggesting that two very different processes may be at play.},

Abstract = {In 2010, Poland launched a new national strategy for regional
   development which is seen as an assertion of Poland's domestic regional
   development vision, informed by, but distinct from, EU cohesion policy
   which has dominated Polish regional policy since accession. A key
   question is whether a new model of policy implementation is emerging.
   The strategy includes a commitment to a place-based regional policy
   model. This implies spatially sensitive policy implementation capable of
   mobilising the potentials of all territories. However, the concept is
   vague. Moreover, in Poland this agenda is being launched in a context of
   entrenched territorial disparities, traditionally constrained policy
   implementation capacity and institutional change. What are the defining
   characteristics of place-based implementation systems? What are the
   challenges to the institutionalisation of the place-based model? Are
   these evident in delivery frameworks being developed in Poland?},

Abstract = {Wage growth has become increasingly interdependent in the European
   monetary and economic union but a stubborn differential in wage growth
   rates of some European countries persists. Can peculiarities of national
   wage-bargaining systems explain this situation? The article develops the
   idea that wage growth differentials across Europe are due to differences
   in wage-bargaining systems. It is demonstrated that wage growth in the
   exposed industry is restrained by competition. Spillovers from the
   exposed sector of the economy to the public sector thus can induce
   overall wage restraint. However, it is shown that spillovers from the
   exposed to the public sector differ according to the wage-bargaining
   system. Pattern-setting regimes lead to substantial spillovers and thus
   induce higher wage restraint than other wage-bargaining systems.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes Estonian macroeconomic policy since the country
   regained independence in 1991. Estonia was the first post-communist
   country to introduce a currency board in 1992, and consecutive
   governments have systematically prioritized macroeconomic stability and
   fiscal prudence. Estonia implemented an internal devaluation in
   2008-2009, which enabled it to become the first post-Soviet republic to
   adopt the euro in 2011. This article explores the origins of the
   currency board and shows how institutions, interests, and ideas have
   contributed to Estonian exceptionalism in macroeconomic policy and to
   euro adoption. It demonstrates that the Estonian experience can shed
   light on the political prerequisites of internal devaluations, which may
   be of great relevance both to current and future Central and Eastern
   European euro area members.},

Abstract = {What drives European Union (EU) policy change in a sensitive and
   contentious area? To answer this question, this article tells the story
   of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the EU from its beginnings
   until the present. The EU's role in EU CSR has changed from
   social-liberal standard-setter to neo-liberal cheerleader and back. This
   article attempts to explain these shifts. It argues that Europe's
   institutional diversity hampers standard-setting while economic crises
   and declining levels of business legitimacy facilitate it. Contention
   has been fuelled by CSR's inherent ambiguity: is CSR a means to regulate
   the economy, or a domain of voluntary activity that must remain free of
   state regulation? Fearful of regulation, business groups - German
   employers in particular - have forcefully advocated the latter view. In
   addition to converting EU CSR from social-liberal to neo-liberal,
   business has neutralized two of the Commission's standard-setting
   advocates. The financial crisis, the power of arguments and discourse,
   and the impact of global policy developments in the field of CSR have
   re-empowered standard-setters. The article concludes with a critical
   analysis of the EU's renewed CSR strategy and non-financial reporting
   agenda.},

Abstract = {Rural-to-urban migration is increasingly common among youths in
   developing countries and could affect sexual activities with
   consequences for premarital pregnancies. We use life history data
   collected in Kisumu, Kenya, to investigate how the timing and number of
   rural-to-urban moves are associated with premarital pregnancy. Among
   sexually experienced young women aged 18 to 24 (N = 226), 60 percent had
   moved at least once in the past 10 years and 38 percent had experienced
   a premarital pregnancy. Results of the event history analysis show that
   those who experienced one or two moves were at increased risk for
   premarital pregnancy compared to nonmovers. Also at increased risk were
   movers whose most recent move occurred in the past 7 to 12 months.
   Finally, those whose last move occurred at age 13 or younger were also
   at an elevated risk. Migration brings about specific risks and needs for
   youths, including the need for sexual and reproductive health education
   and services, which should be made available and accessible to new urban
   residents.},

Number = {2, SI},

Abstract = {In this short piece, I return to the articles in this special issue to
   examine the relationship between the material reality of the concept of
   BRICs and its symbolic place in the world economy today. Aside from the
   facts that the BRIC countries have been ready to depart from the
   Washington consensus on certain key elements (state intervention), while
   maintaining other aspects (fiscal discipline), there isn't much support
   for the notion that these countries somehow share specific development
   strategies. If anything, the papers in this special issue show that
   these four countries have rather different etiologies of growth. The
   notion of BRICs, I argue, is thus better apprehended through its
   symbolic and political dimensions, as an effort by well-placed actors in
   the financial markets to drum up excitement about investment
   opportunities, as well as reorient the governance structures of the
   world economy away from the traditional stronghold of Europe.},

Title = {Leveraging Change WOMEN'S ORGANIZATIONS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF
   UNSCR 1325 IN THE BALKANS},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},

Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {This article examines how regional and local women's organizations in
   Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo have used UNSCR 1325 as a tool for
   organizing and advocacy in three broad areas: women's inclusion in
   decision-making processes; regional and human security; and transitional
   justice. In response to perceived unwillingness by international as well
   as national actors to implement UNSCR 1325, women's organizations
   developed strategies to use this international norm to achieve their
   goals. They have done this, I argue, through a double boomerang effect'.
   In their seminal 1998 work, Activists Beyond Borders, Keck and Sikkink
   demonstrated how NGOs operate to produce a boomerang effect; they appeal
   to transnational actors to assert international pressure against
   national governments in order to enforce compliance with human rights
   norms. In attempting to implement UNSCR 1325, women's organizations have
   also often added a reverse dimension, mobilizing local support through
   grassroots campaigns and regional networks in order to force the United
   Nations and other international actors to comply with their own
   resolution concerning women, peace and security. In doing so, they have
   achieved some success in promoting inclusion. They have been less
   successful in using UNSCR 1325 as a tool for addressing structural
   sources of inequality including militarism and neo-liberal models of
   economic development.},

Abstract = {Drawing on interviews and ethnographic research conducted between 2008
   and 2010, this article examines how relatively educated Muslim youths
   navigate employment and family life in the context of an emerging
   globalized Muslim youth culture and economic restructuring in the
   industrial town of Cilegon, Indonesia. Specifically, the article
   explores the aspirations of young men and women for work and marriage
   and their ability to achieve locally valued forms of masculinity and
   femininity during their transitions to adulthood. It argues that
   aspirations and decisions about employment are informed by, and in turn
   contribute to, gendered and religious expectations about marriage and
   future family life.},

   during Richard Nixon's first term as U.S. president. Drawing heavily on
   recently declassified documents pertaining to back-channel negotiations

Title = {Radio-Intercepts, Reconnaissance and Raids: French Operational
   Intelligence and Communications in 1940},
Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Pages = {337-376},
Abstract = {Mentioned in memoirs by a few former military intelligence officers,
   operational intelligence has had little attention in academic writing on
   the Second World War before Ultra's decisive contributions began in
   1941-2. Especially neglected has been the fighting provoked by the
   German offensive in 1940 that cleaved through France, Belgium, the
   Netherlands and Luxembourg and drove Britain off the Continent. This
   article tackles this gap, analysing the military intelligence/military
   operations interface on the French side. It assesses the contributions
   and shortcomings of radio-intercept intelligence, along with
   intelligence-gathering by air and ground reconnaissance (demonstrating
   that German air superiority imposed a `battle blindness' on Allied
   commanders wanting intelligence on approach marches and formation
   switches more than a dozen kilometres into the German rear). It reveals
   that frontline infantry raiding - redolent of intelligence-gathering
   techniques familiar to veterans of 1914-18 trench warfare - was again
   widely employed. This proved a highly effective recourse, particularly
   during the positional battles on the Somme, Aisne and Oise in June 1940,
   filling intelligence gaps left by more technologically sophisticated but
   more fragile sources. The factors that kept formations fighting so as to
   inflict significant delays and heavy losses on the German assaults were
   robust communications networks (to convey operational intelligence fast
   enough to permit counter-manoeuvres based on it), and the preservation
   of French chains of command and control. When these key nodes collapsed,
   preventing the hard-won operational intelligence being deployed to
   coordinate French military resistance, the latter declined into a series
   of disjointed, directionless and unavailing acts of courage that could
   not exploit the several instances during the campaign when the Germans,
   too, were afflicted by battle fatigue, re-supply bottlenecks and morale
   wobbles.},

Abstract = {This article contends that, in the period under study, government
   security agencies in both colonial and post-colonial Sudan have failed
   to dominate society. It attributes this failure to the limited resources
   and limited ambitions of the state, and the fact that its security
   organs were thus weakly institutionalized. The fact that these failures
   persisted after independence, in spite of the efforts of post-colonial
   governments to expand their intelligence agencies, demonstrated the
   divisions within the state and the extent to which it could be captured
   by competing political and social groups.},

Abstract = {This article discusses a unique organization in the regulatory world,
   the Brazilian Association of Regulatory Agencies (ABAR), which brings
   together federal, state, and municipal regulatory agencies across
   different policy sectors. The paper argues that as a regulatory policy
   network, ABAR has been crucial to the professional socialization,
   capacity building, and institutionalization of regulators in Brazil.
   Moreover, it has promoted their identity as professionals and
   differentiated them from politicians, regulatees, and societal actors.
   Thus, while ABAR raises the shield of expertise to secure independence
   from political and social interference, it has itself become a relevant
   actor in the country's regulatory political dynamics, contributing as
   such to the strengthening of the Brazilian regulatory state.},

Abstract = {Two research traditions have evolved to assess links between recessions
   and health, with seemingly divergent findings. Aggregate-level studies
   generally find that mortality rates decline during recessionary periods.
   By contrast, individual-level studies generally find that events that
   frequently occur during recessions, like job loss, unemployment, and
   material hardship, carry negative health consequences. We
   comprehensively review evidence from these two bodies of research,
   illustrate key findings, and show how the different mechanisms can
   operate in parallel. We also outline some of the limitations of the
   extant evidence, discuss studies emerging to address these limits and
   directions for future research, and provide brief empirical examples to
   illustrate some of these limits and directions using the Health and
   Retirement Study and the Michigan Recession and Recovery Study. Our
   review emphasizes the importance of considering both the aggregate- and
   individual-level associations when evaluating the likely short- and
   longer-term consequences of the Great Recession for health and health
   disparities.},

Abstract = {Despite high hopes that the proliferation of international justice
   mechanisms represents progress toward the maintenance of international
   peace and security, claims about the ability of prosecutions to prevent
   future atrocities remain largely unexamined. These claims rely on
   undertheorized assumptions about both the operation of deterrence and
   the commission of mass atrocity. This article surveys the theory of
   criminal deterrence in order to assemble a more clearly specified set of
   expectations about how deterrence might be expected to operate in the
   international arena. It invokes social science findings that mass
   atrocity commission is motivated by different logics across cases to
   suggest that these differences are relevant to the potential extent of a
   deterrent effect. It considers the current prosecutorial policy of the
   International Criminal Court and suggests that, given the comparative
   lack of certainty and severity of sanction represented by the Court's
   prosecutions, as well as the selection of perpetrators with powerful
   incentives to offend, current prosecutorial policy is not well-targeted
   at producing a deterrent effect.},

Abstract = {This article provides an argument for approaching the breast-bottle
   controversy within feminism from a rhetorical perspective, which focuses
   attention on how the controversy has been framed in relation to the
   value of medical evidence. Using the concept of rhetorical situation,
   the analysis demonstrates that feminists who devalue medical evidence of
   the health benefits of breastfeeding tend to see a
   breastfeeding-friendly culture, while those who see evidence for the
   health benefits of breastfeeding tend to see a culture friendlier to
   bottle-feeding. The consequences of these divergent views are
   significant, as the two groups differ significantly concerning whether
   culture or biology are changeable elements of the current circumstance
   that disadvantages mothers. The rhetorical perspective encourages
   feminists to find common ground by understanding how the staging of
   evidence and argument contributes to theoretical stalemates that impede
   all women from benefiting from political reframing of the breast-bottle
   debate.},

Abstract = {Two UK-based political scientists present the results of an original
   survey they conducted in Russia soon after the presidential elections of
   2012. The survey examines the interaction between mass attitudes toward
   the causal triggers of protest during the 2011-2012 electoral cycle and
   underlying political attitudes regarding the preferred alternatives to a
   hybrid regime (both more democratic and more authoritarian). They find
   that supporters of the protests were not stronger advocates of a
   democratic transition; on the contrary, they were more likely to support
   authoritarian leadership and ethno-nationalism. This finding leads to a
   discussion of whether one of the major constraints on elite-mass
   mobilization in Russia is the authoritarian direction such mobilization
   might entail.},

Abstract = {This paper asks why an officially unregulated market in pharmaceuticals
   in a least developed country, Djibouti, behaves as if it were strictly
   regulated, with limited access to a small number of high-cost drugs. We
   use Actor-Network Theory (ANT) to show that the explanation is more
   complex than critics of the international pharmaceutical industry have
   supposed. Regulation and property rights generated in developed
   countries have become embedded in the drugs and black boxed to the point
   of invisibility. This has allowed them to travel to Djibouti with the
   drugs, while maintaining their effects in action. This case study
   develops our understanding of the way in which materials that are not
   designated as regulatory agents may still have regulatory impacts
   through their ability to enrol complex networks of actors, rules,
   values, and practices. Finally, it argues against the notion of law as a
   fixed and distinctive space for action, as opposed to the ANT vision of
   a fluid and contingent order, where law is part of a
   socio-technico-legal alliance that happens to achieve certain effects.},

Abstract = {In 2009, following numerous high profile abuse cases, the Indonesian
   government placed a moratorium on its citizens taking up employment in
   Malaysia as domestic workers. From the perspective of feminist
   International Relations, the emergence of migrant domestic work as a
   foreign policy concern between these two states is significant -
   exposing a relationship between foreign policy and the webs of
   transnationalized social relations of reproduction that underpin the
   development prospects of middle to low income states. In this article I
   utilize the example of the Malaysia-Indonesia dispute in order to
   develop some tentative suggestions concerning the possibility of
   integrating an analysis of transnational social relations of
   reproduction into foreign policy analyses. The article initially
   overviews how the dispute is widely understood in relation to
   Indonesia's turn to a more democratic foreign policy. The inadequacy of
   such a reading is explored further. The article suggests that the
   above-mentioned dispute should rather be understood in relation to the
   specific configurations of productive-reproductive relations that
   underpin migratory flows and the role of Indonesia and Malaysia as
   regulatory' states involved in the establishment of return-migration
   systems in which women migrants are viewed as economic commodities and
   policed via a range of state-sanctioned practices (including commitments
   to anti-trafficking).},

Abstract = {Labeling and information disclosure to support consumer choice are often
   proposed as attractive policy alternatives to onerous mandatory business
   regulation. This article argues that choices available to consumers are
   constructed and constrained by actors in the chains of production,
   distribution, and exchange who bring products to retail. It traces how
   free-range eggs come to market in Australia, finding that the industrial
   free-range label dominating the market is not substantially different
   from caged-egg production in the way that it addresses animal welfare,
   public health, and agro-ecological values. I show how the product
   choices available to consumers have been constructed not just by the
   regulation (or nonregulation) of marketing and labeling, but also by the
   regulatory paths taken and not taken all along the food chain.},

Abstract = {In 2007, the Russian government instituted quotas for immigrant work
   permits that were consistently lower than actual labour demand. While
   low quotas are politically popular on the mass level, this article
   argues that low quotas are also a tool of the government to distribute
   patronage resources to regional political and economic elites. For
   several years after quotas were instituted, they remained quite
   controversial, and during this time decisions about them were firmly in
   the hands of Vladimir Putin, first as president and then as prime
   minister, giving him a powerful tool to control the immigration process
   and labour market manually. While this type of manual control is
   effective in the short term to manage contentious policy arenas, it
   suffers a number of possible long-term consequences.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Abstract = {The relationship between globalisation and Europeanisation is
   conventionally studied by focusing on the domestic level. In this
   article we explore this relationship at the international level instead.
   We examine the way in which the two phenomena in the form of the ILO and
   the EU relate to one another. Adopting a discursive institutionalist
   approach and focusing on flexicurity, we investigate whether, how and
   under what conditions the discourse on flexicurity provides a point of
   convergence or divergence between globalisation and Europeanisation. Our
   empirical data reveals attempts by the European Commission to use
   globalisation as a legitimating device for a market-accommodating
   programme for labour market reform. The ILO remains more sceptical, both
   about the overall effects of globalisation and the more concrete uses of
   flexicurity. Meanwhile, the concept of flexicurity is subject to change
   and rearticulation in line with the evolving policy agenda endorsed by
   the Commission and/or the member states. The relationship between Europe
   and globalisation is thus far from neutral. Europe' is active in shaping
   globalisation; translated into the work undertaken here, Europeanisation
   could be conceived as a facet of globalisation rather than as a bulwark
   to it, or merely as a process running parallel to it.},

Abstract = {Migration to Europe has become a major source of financial and social
   resources for an increasing number of Senegalese men who are the main
   providers for their natal households. European migration is seen as a
   transitory phase, since most of them plan to return to Senegal. We use
   qualitative interviews conducted in 2007 in a small town in northwest
   Senegal to explore the dynamics of migration among young Senegalese men,
   identifying their goals and examining how migration affects their lives
   and families. Motivations to migrate for these young men are related
   both to the social prestige associated with being a successful migrant
   and to the obligations they feel toward their elders to enable them to
   live out their old age in the best conditions. Because migrating is
   costly and demands mobilization of social networks, most migrants
   require the support of their elders to leave, thus reinforcing their
   obligations toward them and contributing to transforming the
   relationships between generations.},

Title = {Making Direct Democracy Deliberative through Random Assemblies},

Abstract = {Direct-democratic processes have won popular support but fall far short
   of the standards of deliberative democracy. Initiative and referendum
   processes furnish citizens with insufficient information about policy
   problems, inadequate choices among policy solutions, flawed criteria for
   choosing among such solutions, and few opportunities for reflection on
   those choices prior to decision making. We suggest a way to make direct
   democracy more deliberative by grafting randomly selected citizen
   assemblies onto existing institutions and practices. After reviewing the
   problems that beset modern direct-democratic elections and the long
   history of randomly selected citizen assemblies, we propose five
   different varieties of randomly constituted citizen bodies-Priority
   Conferences, Design Panels, Citizens' Assemblies, Citizens' Initiative
   Reviews, and Policy Juries. After selecting members through stratified
   random sampling of citizens, each of these assemblies would operate at a
   different stage of the legislative process, from initial problem
   identification through approval of a finished ballot measure. Highly
   structured procedures guided by professional moderators and featuring
   expert testimony on policy and legal matters would help to ensure
   deliberative quality, and careful institutional designs would make each
   body politically powerful. In the end, these citizen bodies would be
   likely to address the deliberative deficit of direct democracy and
   better achieve the public's desired policy objectives.},

Abstract = {To what extent was Tsarist Russia's collapse in 1917 caused by the
   wartime breakdown of railway transport? Focused on freight traffic, this
   article addresses one fundamental aspect of this critical question,
   namely the railway network's efficiency, and especially the allegations
   of widespread disorganisation. It seeks to identify the overall amount
   of useful work' achieved during 1913-1916: not simply the weight of
   goods loaded, but also the distances that these freights were carried.
   In these crucial terms, it argues, the railways actually worked far more
   intensively than in peacetime, implying that although the network did
   suffer major problems, railway disorganisation was not a spark of
   revolution.},

Abstract = {Is Brazil's economic policy regime a mere tinkering of the Washington
   Consensus? The evidence suggests that Brazilian governments
   institutionalized a hybrid policy regime that layers economically
   liberal priorities originating in the Washington Consensus and more
   interventionist ones associated with neo-developmentalist thinking. To
   capture this hybridity, the study calls this regime liberal
   neo-developmentalism'. While defending the goal of macroeconomic
   stability and sidelining full employment, Brazilian governments also
   reduced reliance on foreign savings and employed a largely off-the-books
   stimulus package during the crisis. Brazil experienced important
   privatization, liberalization and deregulation reforms, but at the same
   time the state consolidated its role as owner and investor in industry
   and banking while using an open economy industrial policy and a cautious
   approach to the free movement of capital. Finally, while conditional
   cash transfers fit the Washington Consensus, Brazil's steady increases
   in the minimum wage, industrial policies targeted at high employment
   sectors and the use of state-owned firms to expand welfare and
   employment programs better fit a neo-developmentalist policy regime. In
   sum, while the main goals of the Washington Consensus were not replaced
   with neo-developmentalist ones, Brazil's policy regime saw an extensive
   transformation of policy orthodoxy that reflects Brazil's status as an
   emerging power.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to demonstrate women's substantive impact
   on government by examining the earmark requests of the US House
   representatives. Women representatives are hypothesized to make more
   funding requests for women's issues than male representatives. Through
   use of OLS statistical analysis, women's issue earmark requests, as
   reported by the 111th congressional House members for the fiscal year
   2010, serve as the dependent variable. Gender is a significant predictor
   of earmark requests even when controlling for the ideology,
   partisanship, and racial minority status of a House member. This finding
   is evidence of women's substantive representation in the form of earmark
   requests.},

Abstract = {This is an interrogation into what an international(ized) court can
   hold. Expressivism teaches us that by trying those responsible for mass
   losses, criminal courts send moral messages on the value of the rule of
   law that strengthen community attachments. In this performance of
   ritualized grief and condemnation, the court must hold the victim: the
   dead victim who remains in images inside and outside the court; the
   surviving victims whose desire to bear witness stands in tension with
   the constraints of the legal process in victim participation; and the
   communities whose victimization is the court's focus as they are engaged
   through outreach programs. In this article, I question whether
   expressivism is a viable rationale for international criminal law by
   examining victim appearance at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts
   of Cambodia. I argue that expressivism relies on simplified
   representations of victimhood that do not adequately address victims.},

Abstract = {The Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) on Indian
   residential schools allows us to rethink the scope and bounds of
   transitional justice. Once we expand our notions of injustice and
   transition, the Canadian case is not so far apart from paradigmatic
   cases, which too often overlook structural violence. The article argues
   for settler decolonization as a path of reconciliation and in so doing
   directly engages structural violence and instantiates theoretical
   arguments to more securely anchor the field of transitional justice to
   positive peace. The article analyzes the decolonizing potential of the
   TRC in its ability to invoke `social accountability' through its
   approach to truth and in its grassroots potential. Although the TRC has
   some capacity to advance decolonization, its progress is hampered by the
   conservative political environment, its weak public profile and to some
   degree its own emphasis on survivor healing, which provides a ready
   focal for settlers to individualize Indian residential schools violence
   as something of the past. Yet, Indigenous healing is intrinsically
   connected to structural transformation and reconciliation depends upon
   remedying colonial violence in the present.},

Abstract = {For the last 20 years, Euroscepticism has become a stable component of
   European politics and has attracted much attention. European elections
   have provided Eurosceptic parties with an opportunity to get
   parliamentary representation. While there is a burgeoning literature on
   the Eurosceptic stances of these parties, there remains relatively
   little research on their strategies once inside the European Parliament.
   This article analyzes how Eurosceptic MEPs from the untidy right
   conceive and carry out their representative mandate in an institution
   they despise. First, it takes an historical perspective to show that
   despite the persistence of Euroscepticism in the European Union's
   elected chamber, the body of research remains comparatively limited.
   Second, it examines the institutional constraints faced by Eurosceptic
   representatives resulting from the institutional environment and the
   ideological heterogeneity of these actors. The final part proposes a
   typology of parliamentary roles to account for their attitudes and
   behaviours inside the chamber.},

Title = {The Collapse of the Israeli Intelligence's Conception: Apologetics,
   Memory and History of the Israeli Response to Egypt's Alleged Intention
   to Open War in May 1973},
Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {520-546},
Abstract = {This article attempts to contradict the commonly accepted assumption in
   Israel and the West that in April-May 1973 Egypt and Syria were about to
   open war against Israel and were deterred by a series of measures that
   Israel took, including partial mobilization of the Israel Defence Force
   (IDF) reserves. The article ventures to separate the apologetics and
   (flawed) memories from the information provided by the now available
   documentary evidence. After presenting the prevailing Israeli version,
   the article analyses the memoirs on the Egyptian side about the
   preparations for war and determining D-Day, to refute this version.
   Based on the contemporary protocols of government and general staff
   meetings and political-military consultations, it argues that the
   Israeli government, general staff and intelligence community did not
   regard at the time the outbreak of war as an imminent threat. The steps
   they took concerned the medium and long run, and were irrelevant in the
   short run. Similarly, the mobilization of reserves was not connected to
   the alarm of war but to the Day of Independence parade in Jerusalem. The
   article claims on the basis of these protocols that the reason for the
   excitement was the collapse of the Israeli intelligence's conception
   that Egypt would not resume hostilities before it could hit at the
   interior of Israel, and Syria would not go to war without Egypt. The
   arrival of Libyan Mirages and Iraqi Hunters to Egypt in April fulfilled
   this condition and the possibility of war could not be dismissed
   offhand. Israel responded to the new situation by the book. It shared
   the information and analysis with the White House and the CIA; it
   refreshed the IDF planning down to the divisional level and the IDF
   general staff held a series of thorough discussions to estimate the
   situation. The bottom line of this process was a government directive to
   the IDF to prepare for war at the end of the summer of 1973 (as it
   actually happened). In the latter portion of the article I explain why
   this directive was ignored when it was put to test in late September and
   early October of 1973.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This paper explores how the interactive dynamics of peer
   education models within independent youth media outlets facilitate and
   impede youth engagement in media activism and social change work, more
   broadly defined.
   Design/methodological approach - Ethnographic and participatory action
   research methods are used with the youth media hub, Youth Media Action
   (YMA), to examine the possibilities and challenges that peer media
   educators confront in cultivating a noncommercial space for the
   collective production of oppositional media. YMA specifically seeks to
   involve youth from marginalized communities.
   Findings - The results suggest that peer-to-peer education models do act
   as vehicles for political engagement as youth experience shared
   ownership, cultivate solidarity, and acquire community organizing skills
   through the collective production of oppositional media. At the same
   time, challenges can surface when peer educators juggle multiple roles
   and participating community youth groups espouse differing
   organizational values and pedagogical sensibilities.
   Research limitations/implications - This study offers a potential
   pathway for further research on how peer education and collective media
   making models influence youth citizenship and social change work.
   Originality/value - The focus on the organizational and social dynamics
   of peer education models is useful in understanding youth citizenship
   and digital access as a collective experience for youth living in
   disenfranchised communities that seek out these spaces for not only
   media making but also community building.},

Pages = {91-108},
Abstract = {Purposeful politicization is generally viewed as a cardinal sin by
   intelligence analysts because it degrades objectivity and credibility,
   and inadvertent influence is sometimes tolerated as a necessary evil in
   order to make intelligence useful. Some forms of politicization are
   clearly unethical, but politicization is not inherently evil. In fact it
   is an ethically neutral form of rhetorical discourse which when properly
   controlled can provide policymakers with additional decision advantage.
   When viewed through a rhetorical lens, evidence-based purposeful
   politicization is more objective than inadvertent influence because it
   does not try to hide where the evidence leads. By decoupling objectivity
   and neutrality, it becomes clear that taking a stand on the evidence or
   making a tough recommendation based on professional judgment are not
   practices that need to be avoided. As intelligence practitioners seek to
   remain relevant in the 21st century, embracing ethically-controlled,
   evidence-based, policy prescriptive analysis can give them the tools
   they need to succeed},

Abstract = {Air Force colonel Stig Wennerstrom was the most dangerous spy to Sweden
   in the Cold War era. His espionage was found to have been especially
   crippling to the Swedish air defence and its high-tech systems. That is
   where repair work was seen to be most urgent. As the politicians turned
   down appeals for extra funding, it was up to the military system itself
   to handle the situation. In spite of this, the Supreme Commander appears
   not to have pressed for Air Force priority to repair resources. The
   service's proportion of the defence budget did not increase, and other
   quantitative and qualitative evidence points to a similar lack of Air
   Force priority. Three theoretical approaches are used to explain how
   this failure to act could have come about. A rationality model is
   discussed and compared to an organizational competition approach and to
   an approach based on the character of key individuals.},

Abstract = {Since the late 1990s, a series of pro-LGBT reforms have taken place in
   Latin America, coinciding in part with the region's shift away from
   neoliberalism to the Left. The Ecuadorian state has been at the
   forefront of this trend, decriminalizing homosexuality in 1997 and
   including an anti-discrimination clause on the basis of sexual
   orientation in the 1998 Constitution, the first in the region to do so.
   The 2008 Constitution went further; redefining the family, recognizing
   same-sex civil unions and providing legal protection on the basis of
   gender identity. At the same time, the 2008 Constitution banned same-sex
   marriage and adoption and continues the ban on abortion - indications
   that heteronormativity continues to underlie state policy and law. What
   is at stake in the state's seemingly ambivalent embrace of LGBT and
   feminist struggles for sexual justice? We argue that this contradictory
   stance towards struggles for sexual justice is a result of the interplay
   between homophobic and homoprotectionist state strategies. We draw out
   the implications of this ambivalent form of state inclusion for queer
   and feminist politics and argue that activists' navigation of the left
   turn necessitates a deeply coalitional approach to politics, one that
   fosters alternatives to state-centered configurations of justice.},

Abstract = {This article provides an empirical analysis of orchestration - that is,
   the initiation, support, and embracement of private governance
   arrangements through public regulators - in the field of European Union
   biofuel governance. It examines the emerging sustainability regime and
   shows that orchestration has been extensively practiced. Regulators in
   the European Union have used a range of directive and facilitative
   measures to initiate and support private biofuel certification schemes
   and to incorporate them in their regulatory frameworks. This has given
   rise to a hybrid regime in which public and private approaches are
   closely intertwined. Discussing the benefits and complications of
   engaging with private biofuel sustainability governance, the article's
   findings point to a partial failure of orchestration in this policy
   area.},

Abstract = {The essay explores the significance of questions of knowledge to the
   depiction of prisoners in three prominent katorga narratives from the
   second half of the nineteenth century: Dostoevskii's Notes from the
   House of the Dead, Kennan's Siberia and the Exile System, and Chekhov's
   Sakhalin Island. Comparing the different discourses of unknowability
   these authors employ, it argues that the relationship of the writers or
   narrators to the outcast status of the convicts takes their texts beyond
   the immediate context, to shape views of the penal system as expressing
   the increasing instability of identity, social hierarchies and moral
   life in Russia.},

Abstract = {In numerous product lines, globalization of production has been
   accompanied by increasingly austere product quality and safety
   regulations. These regulations are particularly stringent in the food
   and beverage sectors and put enormous strain on producers from
   developing nations. This article examines a cooperative of sugarcane,
   sugar, and ethanol producers from Brazil that, when confronted with the
   challenge of new regulations, adopted three policies that encouraged its
   members to upgrade quality and safety standards, enabling them to
   compete successfully in a demanding business environment. I argue that
   the co-op's success was due to (1) a new cost accounting methodology
   that monetized some of the differences in product quality, attenuating
   tensions among members; (2) a low-cost, high-powered system of
   regulatory incentives that empowered middle managers vis-a-vis top
   executives within regulated firms; and (3) external auditors who acted
   not as police officers or consultants but as conduits, reestablishing
   information flows and helping to create a business atmosphere conducive
   to productive change.},

Abstract = {The risks at the heart of regulation are most often understood as
   unwanted by-products of an essentially productive endeavor. They are to
   be captured and managed through dedicated technical and bureaucratic
   effort, the preserve of those skilled in the assessment of probability
   and impact and accomplished in the design of effectiveand
   efficientregulatory strategies. Yet such a view seriously misunderstands
   the complexity of risk that regulation must address. When regulation is
   viewed from a social and organizational vantage point, risks of a more
   social and political character emerge. This article teases apart three
   fundamental ideal types of risk inherent in regulatory processes, only
   one of which (labeled as actuarial risk) is apprehensible from a
   scientific or bureaucratic frame of reference. Of equal importance are
   sociocultural and political risks, risks that cannot be relegated to a
   lesser priority by an understanding that labels their impact on
   regulation variously as unwarranted, irrational, or emotional.},

Abstract = {We generally think of regulations as being applied to regulated
   organizations, which are then expected to comply with those regulations.
   Yet this way of thinking often misunderstands regulated organizations
   and misrepresents the complexity of their responses to regulation. This
   article uses evidence from an ethnographic study of the global
   regulation of HIV treatment and research to offer a fresh interpretation
   of the nature of regulated organizations and the part they play in
   complex regulatory systems. I show that regulated organizations do a
   great deal of interpretive work to decipher the rules, adjust rules to
   local realities, and translate local practices into the categories used
   by rule-makers. Such adjustments are especially required when regulators
   have an inaccurate picture of the structure of regulated organizations
   and the physical and sociocultural contexts in which they are embedded.
   HIV clinics themselves play a crucial role in correcting misinformation
   and in wrangling both regulations and regulated entities to bring them
   into closer alignment.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the impact of the European Union (EU) on the
   Turkish-Cypriot civil society, pegged to the Europeanization debate. The
   article contributes to the discussion on Europeanization and the role of
   the EU in contested states, which remains a neglected topic in the
   literature. The argument advanced is that a series of factors that
   relate to the contested statehood of the Turkish-Cypriot case mediate
   the occurrence of Europeanization and they often contribute to an
   exceptional EU impact on domestic civil society. In this regard, the
   Turkish-Cypriot example has strong comparative value for the study of
   the international role of the EU, the Europeanization of contested
   states and the importance that the EU places on contacts with civil
   society, as an alternative avenue to relations with states.},

Abstract = {A UK-based political scientist presents a systematic analysis of the
   basic philosophical arguments and intellectual origins of fundamental
   conservative thought in Russia. Positing that fundamental conservatism
   seeks to displace interpretations of Western modernity in Russia with a
   culturally specific Russian version, she then probes more deeply into
   the methods and tasks of fundamental conservatism, before examining its
   main theoretical arguments. The fact that such thinking is increasingly
   prominent in Russia, including within political circles, is noted as a
   basis for the need to better understand it as a search for new forms of
   rationality and new forms of citizenship rooted in the Russian
   sociohistoric context.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) is often seen as an institutional environment
   that facilitates the exchange of information about the effects of
   policies, and thus promotes convergence towards successful policies.
   However, current qualitative studies analyze only EU members and cannot
   dismiss the hypothesis that the relation between policy success and
   policy convergence is universal and not affected by EU membership. The
   article analyzes a dyadic data set on privatization policies in the
   electricity sector to test the interaction hypothesis that joint EU
   membership not only causes policy convergence, but also increases the
   effect of policy success on policy convergence. The result is that
   economic success of privatizations in role-model countries and joint EU
   membership both increase the probability of policy convergence. However,
   there is no interaction between policy success and joint EU membership.
   Thus, contrary to widely held assumptions, joint EU membership does not
   amplify learning from each other's policy success.},

Abstract = {Although the energy trade is the single most important element of nearly
   all European countries' relations with Russia, Europe has been divided
   by both worldview and practice. Why, in the face of the common challenge
   of dependence on imported Russian gas, have national reactions to such
   vulnerability varied so dramatically across the continent? And why have
   a handful of French, German, and Italian corporations somehow taken
   responsibility for formulating the energy strategy and thus the Russia
   policy for essentially all of Europe? The resolutions of these two
   puzzles are, I show, interlinked; they also demand theoretical
   innovation. With several case studies of Gazprom's decision-making
   during the 2006 and 2009 gas crises, and of the response of western and
   central Europe to their gas dependence I find that: firms are driving
   these political outcomes; those firms are motivated by profits but
   employ sociological conventions along their ways; and firms generally
   seek the necessary inter-firm, cross-border cooperation that will
   deliver corporate performance. Finally, I conclude that the field will
   ultimately require a framework that puts firms at its center.},

Abstract = {Some argue that European financial services regulation is witnessing a
   shift from a market-making' to a market-shaping' paradigm after the
   global financial crisis. This so-called new' political economy
   explanation stresses the role of ideas to understand this change. We
   consider this claim by providing an in-depth examination of recent
   European hedge fund legislation from the perspective of two key
   market-making' coalition members: the UK government and the hedge fund
   industry. We accept that the legislation represents a set-back for the
   market-makers' but question whether it represents a victory for the
   market-shapers'. Moreover, we cast doubt on the causal role of ideas,
   calling for a domestic politics approach.},

Abstract = {After the 2004 eastern enlargement, the European Union has become a
   terrain of competition between different memory narratives. At the core
   of the debate is the status of the Holocaust and its role in the
   identity-definition process of European societies. This article asks why
   similar memory debates have resulted in different policy outcomes when
   taking place in different institutional settings at the EU level. It
   finds, along with Schattschneider's analysis of policy conflicts, that
   the choice of the venue of the conflict determined what the conflict was
   about and how people were divided. Policy outcomes were determined by
   which of the different possible conflicts gained the dominant position
   and this, in turn, depended on losers' in the policy debate being able
   to choose the right venue for the defence of their concerns.},

Abstract = {In analyzing the European Capitals of Culture programme, this article
   argues that transnational experts have had a large impact on this
   flagship of European Union (EU) cultural policy by forming a close-knit
   advocacy coalition with official EU actors. Most recent developments,
   however, have added a new dimension. The Commission has now developed a
   subtle technique of governmentality focusing the programme more on its
   European dimension'. The article discusses this evolution and the role
   of transnational actors, the limits to integration intrinsic to culture
   as a policy domain, and the attempts of both official actors and experts
   to work around such constraints.},

Abstract = {The article argues that in order to grasp fully Brazilian and Korean
   post-WWII developmental and growth experiences, it is first necessary to
   account for global-economy dynamics and the transformations in the
   International Division of Labour. These, together with local factors
   that particularly affect the objective conditions for the valorisation
   of capital in different productive sectors, explain the specific
   characteristics of capitalism in both countries. The article claims that
   capital has accumulated in Brazil and Korea under two different specific
   forms. In Brazil, capital has accumulated while producing on an
   internationally small-scale for domestic markets and compensating the
   resultant high production costs through the appropriation of a portion
   of the abundant ground-rent. While before the mid-1960s capital
   accumulated in Korea under that same specific form (though ground-rent
   was complemented with a portion of small agrarian capital profits and
   foreign aid), it afterwards began to do so through the production of
   specific industrial goods for world markets using the relatively cheap
   and disciplined labour-force available in the country. World-scale
   technological changes associated with computerisation and
   electronics-based automation have changed Korea's competitive
   advantages' as they resulted in sharp advances in the codification of
   technical knowledge and, thus, in the reduction of the tacit know-how
   and skills necessary to perform several labour processes. Though
   resulting in strong growth, these processes have created new
   contradictions and challenges for Korea which it may be incapable of
   overcoming.},

Abstract = {This article provides a detailed account of the use of foreign child

   Although the extensive use of child jockeys ended in 2005, the
   initiation of a class action lawsuit for civil damages in a United
   States (US) federal district court in 2006 posed a serious risk to the
   reputation of the rulers of the UAE. The article describes the resulting
   public relations offensive, which required the post-fact construction of
   a substantive defence and embroiled both the United States and the
   United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in a serious denial of justice
   for thousands of victims of child slavery.},

   strong political machines. Russia's leadership undercut its own
   electoral strategy by replacing popular elected governors with colorless
   bureaucrats who struggled to mobilize votes on behalf of United Russia.
   This is one of the reasons for United Russia's poor performance in

Abstract = {This article examines how historical and geographical relations of
   injustice are made present through the activities of the City of
   Sanctuary network in Sheffield, the UK. In so doing, it exposes the
   limitations of conceptualizing and enacting sanctuary through the frame
   of hospitality, and proposes an analytics of rightful presence as an
   alternative frame with which to address contemporary sanctuary
   practices. In contrast to a body of scholarship and activism that has
   focused on hospitality as extending the bounds of citizenship to include
   those seeking refuge, we consider how the minor politics of City of
   Sanctuary potentially trouble the assumptions on which such claims to
   inclusion rest. Our emphasis on the minor politics of making present
   injustices is important in bringing to bear an account of justice that
   is grounded in concrete political struggles, in contrast to the more
   abstract notion of a justice to come, associated with some accounts of
   hospitality. To explore sanctuary practices through a relational account
   of justice brings to bear a politically attuned account of rightful
   presence, which potentially challenges pastoral relations of guesthost
   and the statist framing of sanctuary with which relations of hospitality
   are intimately bound. This is important, we conclude, in countering the
   assumption that including the excluded solves the problem, or relieves
   the crisis, of asylum.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This study focuses on seventh grade teachers' constructions of
   students' civic awareness as they planned for and enacted a civic
   engagement project with urban youth of color.
   Approach - Drawing on critical and interpretive paradigms, I analyze the
   teachers' dialogues during colloquia on youth civic engagement and their
   pedagogy as observed in the classroom.
   Findings - At the start of the project, the teachers hoped to involve
   students in critical thought and action on a local social problem. Yet,
   they doubted the depth of students' knowledge about injustices in their
   neighborhood. As the students shared their thoughts about budget cuts
   affecting a local park, the teachers expanded their constructs of the
   students' civic knowledge.
   Value - The paper argues that teachers' views of student knowledge are
   malleable and in the context of a learner-centered curriculum, they can
   position students as aware activists.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {5-31},
Abstract = {The relationship between intelligence analysis and policy decisions is a
   contentious one with both policymakers and intelligence analysts
   frequently expressing frustration over its underlying dynamics and with
   each faulting the behavior of the other. This article examines one
   aspect of this relationship, the manner in which intelligence analysis
   can become politicized. Rather than view politicization as an aberration
   it is treated here as a normal feature of intelligence analysis. A
   typology of politicization organized around the concepts of hard and
   soft politicization is presented and illustrated with historical
   examples from the American experience with intelligence analysis},

Abstract = {This article is intended to supplement rather than replace earlier
   reviews of research on survey incentives, especially those by Singer
   (2002); Singer and Kulka (2002); and Cantor, O'Hare, and O'Connor
   (2008). It is based on a systematic review of articles appearing since
   2002 in major journals, supplemented by searches of the Proceedings of
   the American Statistical Association's Section on Survey Methodology for
   unpublished papers. The article begins by drawing on responses to
   open-ended questions about why people are willing to participate in a
   hypothetical survey. It then lays out the theoretical justification for
   using monetary incentives and the conditions under which they are
   hypothesized to be particularly effective. Finally, it summarizes
   research on how incentives affect response rates in cross-sectional and
   longitudinal studies and, to the extent information is available, how
   they affect response quality, nonresponse error, and cost-effectiveness.
   A special section on incentives in Web surveys is included.},

Abstract = {To understand how regulation influences competitiveness and upgrading
   processes, this article focuses on the organizational changes involved
   in rewarding regulation. Through a qualitative study of two clusters in
   the agrifood industry in Nicaragua, it analyzes two types of regulation
   and their interaction with small producers' production organizations:
   food safety and environmental sustainability. The analysis shows that
   regulation plays a crucial role in fostering changes in organizational
   practices and routines. This occurs when local organizations build new
   knowledge and skills to upgrade products and production processes, while
   developing new connections among producers and between them to other
   private and public actors that support economic development. Rewarding
   regulation is part of a process of learning and creating networks that
   help build local know-how and generate supportive collective resources.},

Title = {Why reregulation after the crisis is feeble: Shadow banking, offshore

Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},

Volume = {7},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {A crucial element in the complex chain of factors that caused the recent
   financial crisis was the lack of regulation and oversight in the shadow
   banking sector, which is largely incorporated in offshore financial
   centers (OFCs), but instead of swift and radical regulatory reform in
   that sector after the crisis, we observe only incremental and
   ineffective measures. Why? This paper develops an explanation based on a
   two-level game. On the international level, governments are engaged in
   competition for financial activity. On the domestic level, governments
   are prone to capture by financial interest groups, but also susceptible
   to demands for stricter regulation by the electorate. Governments try to
   square the circle between the conflicting demands by adopting
   incremental and symbolic, but largely ineffective, reforms. The
   explanation is put to empirical scrutiny by tracing the regulatory
   initiatives on shadow banks and OFCs at the international level and
   within the United States and the European Union, where I focus on
   France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.},

Abstract = {This paper surveys constructivist scholarship in the study of
   international political economy (IPE) in China. Chinese scholars in the
   field of IPE have until recently rarely used constructivism as an
   approach to study IPE for two reasons. The first, like Western IPE, is
   the short history of constructivism as a theoretical perspective. The
   second, unlike Western IPE, stems from the long-standing dominance of
   Marxism, China's official state ideology, in the academic field. In
   China, Marxism's materialist core shapes the basic research questions of
   IPE. Unsurprisingly then, constructivist analysis is quite alien to the
   dominant intellectual discourse in China. Nonetheless, of late, more
   Chinese scholars have begun to apply constructivist analysis. This paper
   surveys these developments and is divided into three sections. The first
   section provides an overview of how Chinese Marxist scholars approach
   the major issues of IPE as they relate to China. The second section
   provides an overview of the work of liberal-minded Chinese scholars who
   work on major IPE issues, another counterpoint to the Marxist school.
   The third section, which is the major focus of this paper, examines how
   Chinese scholars have applied the constructivist concepts to study major
   IPE issues in the Chinese context.},

Abstract = {Reflections on hegemonic power have shaped the contemporary field of
   international political economy (IPE) within China. Shifts in the
   thinking of Chinese scholars correlate with China's own changing role
   and location in a system still most profoundly influenced by the United
   States. But real and perceived changes in America's position have also
   influenced the way in which Chinese IPE scholars are now
   reconceptualizing the nature of global authority and the international
   position of China. In one generation, the mainstream of China's IPE
   scholarship has moved away from its rigid Marxist origins and converged
   in substantial part with Anglo-American ideological traditions, now
   prominently including liberal institutionalism. Nevertheless,
   scholarship informed by other traditions, including a re-imagined
   Confucianism, flourishes. Major policy-changing events clearly affect
   the work of Chinese IPE scholars, a phenomenon hardly unknown elsewhere.},

Abstract = {The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) includes
   gender justice provisions, notably the recognition of crimes of sexual
   violence experienced by women in armed conflict. The Statute also
   institutes a complementarity regime, leaving states parties with primary
   responsibility for prosecuting international crimes. However, it fails
   to link these two innovative provisions, leaving a `gender justice
   complementarity shadow.' Through an analysis of ICC preliminary
   examinations in Guinea and Colombia, this article argues that the Office
   of the Prosecutor's apparent inattention to gender biases underpinning
   domestic legal systems has left impunity for perpetrators of sexual
   violence intact and the victims of these crimes unrecognized. It argues
   that to tackle impunity for sexual violence through complementarity
   requires the ICC prosecutor to include an examination of gender biases
   in domestic legal systems when testing state action, willingness and
   ability in order to understand how these biases impede access to justice
   for victims of sexual violence.},

Abstract = {Which major theory of international relationsneorealism, liberalism, or
   constructivismbest explains states' weapons procurement strategies? This
   article addresses that question by examining the case of the Federal
   Republic of Germany (FRG) during the Cold War. Through an in-depth
   analysis of the FRG's armaments strategy from the time the country was
   admitted into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1955 until the
   early 1970s, the article demonstrates that although ideas and external
   security concerns did play a role, economic concerns won out more often
   than not. IR scholars must therefore account for a variety of factors
   when attempting to explain the FRG's weapons procurement strategy during
   this period. Neorealism, liberalism, and constructivism are useful in
   thinking about West Germany's purchases of weapons, but none of the
   three theories is adequate on its own.},

Abstract = {We examine academic research laboratories as examples of intractable
   governance sites. These spaces often elude regulatory warnings and rules
   because of the professional status of faculty members, the opacity of
   scientific work to outsiders, and loose coupling of policy and practice
   in organizations. We describe one university's efforts to create a
   system for managing laboratory health, safety, and environmental
   hazards, thereby constraining conventional faculty habit to ignore
   administrative and legal procedures. We demonstrate the specific
   struggles safety managers face in creating system responsiveness, that
   is, feedback to re-channel noncompliant laboratory practices. We show
   how faculty members are buffered from the consequences of their
   activities, thus impeding the goals of responsibility and
   accountability. We conclude by asking where such pockets of
   intractability reside in other organizations and whether the surrounding
   buffer, if there is one, may nonetheless paradoxically create an
   effective margin of safety.},

Abstract = {The literature on business lobbying has shown that firms increasingly
   extend their interest representation activities from the domestic to the
   European level. Consequently, over the last 20 years, individual firms
   have become influential political actors in Brussels. Yet, after nine
   years of full membership, eastern European (EE) corporations stay away
   from EU-level policy-making. This article argues that the institutional
   structures emerging in post-socialist countries constitute obstacles to
   firms developing the necessary capabilities for supranational lobbying.
   While firms in London and Brussels become increasingly professional in
   their lobbying strategies, large post-socialist firms handle lobbying
   exclusively at the highest level of the organizational hierarchy through
   informal interpersonal networks. It is argued in the article that the
   confinement of lobbying strategy to the top echelon of corporate
   management reduces its effectiveness and scope. Consequently, EE
   companies are unable to integrate into EU lobbying.},

Title = {When do autocracies start to liberalize foreign trade? Evidence from
   four cases in the Middle East and North Africa},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {760-787},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {This paper argues that within autocracies the beginning of IMF-friendly
   trade and capital account reforms is highly contingent on the ability of
   alternative policy regulations to provide respective regimes with
   domestically needed amounts of convertible foreign exchange. A
   longitudinal comparison of four countries (Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and
   Jordan) between the 1960s and the early 1990s in the Middle East and
   North Africa region shows a historical sequencing of reforms. Before the
   implementation of orthodox policy change, foreign exchange scarcity was
   managed primarily by rising restrictions, accumulation of debt and a
   number of unilateral country-specific strategies, including broader
   economic openings (infitah) and selective capital account
   liberalizations. However, IMF-friendly reforms only became a political
   option after the failure of these alternative policies and the
   simultaneous drying up of unconditional finance. These findings
   complement recent debates about the rush to free trade in at least two
   aspects. First, they point to distinct causal mechanisms depending on
   the type of political regime (e.g., autocracy versus democracy),
   explaining the beginning of trade and capital account liberalizations
   among developing nations. They specify, second, one important contextual
   condition in regard to the effectiveness of IMF surveillance power.},

Abstract = {Does criticism of the European Union (EU) by elites cultivate support
   for democratic values among ordinary citizens? All Eurosceptic messages
   are critical of European integration; they do not all vilify similar
   aspects of the European Union. This article proposes a framing model of
   the effects of Euroscepticism on citizens' domestic political attitudes.
   EU critiques that are framed in terms of democratic deficit' lead
   citizens to consider which political values are desirable in democratic
   society and may promote support for liberal democratic norms among
   citizens exposed to these messages. Eurosceptic rhetoric is built into
   framing experiments that vary the content of EU-critical messages.
   Subjects in the United Kingdom and Bulgaria are randomly exposed to a
   cultural threat' or democratic deficit' criticism of the EU. Both
   Eurosceptic frames reduce support for integration, but subjects exposed
   to the deficit frame' more strongly embrace liberal democratic values.
   Under certain conditions, Euroscepticism may carry benefits for
   representative democracy.},

Abstract = {This study examines mobility (short-term movement involving stays away
   from home) among unmarried youths in India and its association with
   their sexual experiences. We look at unmarried young women and men aged
   15 to 24 from rural and urban areas in six states in India-Bihar,
   Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu. Data
   are drawn from a subnationally representative study of Indian youths, in
   which 11,522 young men and 17,362 young women were interviewed
   face-to-face at their usual residences. The study finds that one-third
   and one-fifth of young men and women, respectively, had experienced
   mobility. Mobile youths were more likely than nonmobile youths to
   experience romantic relationships and initiate sex before marriage.
   Moreover, among the sexually experienced, mobile young men were more
   likely than others to report multiple sexual partners.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to debates on the proliferation of bilateral
   free trade agreements (FTAs), by analysing novel empirical material: the
   EU-India FTA negotiations, which have attracted little academic
   scrutiny. By elaborating on the underlying negotiating interests and
   strategies of the EU and India, the article examines the significance of
   overarching interests in ongoing negotiations and articulates the
   defensive and offensive interests of both parties. It presents a vision
   of the controversial and milieu-shaping interests at stake, which offer
   an alternative theoretical explanation for the pursuit of FTAs, and
   highlights possible outcome scenarios.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the role of welfare systems in shaping migration
   patterns in central and eastern Europe. It argues that states have
   played a crucial role in affecting migration by creating and widening
   opportunities for potential and actual migrants through welfare system
   policies. This explains why CEE countries where social spending figures
   have been lower, unemployment benefit schemes less extensive and where
   labour market mismatches remained unaddressed, experienced greater
   out-migration. The article contributes to our understanding of how
   sending countries' institutional factors affect out-migration by
   investigating the role of sending states' institutions.},

Abstract = {This article is a foray into the understudied issue of environmental
   protest politics in Central Asia. Specifically, it uses Kyrgyzstan as a
   case study to test the argument that environmental concerns mobilized
   people to engage in protest and in ways different from other kinds of
   protest. This essay presents the first systematic study of public
   opinion about the environment in Kyrgyzstan. It includes results from a
   2009 nationwide survey, over 100 expert and elite interviews, and
   newspaper content analysis. Furthermore, it spatially analyzes these
   results to identify geographical variation in public perception and
   political event occurrence patterns. Protest engagement is a complex
   process determined by the interaction of several factors, and is not
   explained solely by affluence, rationality, or grievances.
   Eco-mobilization - collective political action about the environment -
   represents a class of protest events that offers a different view into
   mass discontent in the former Soviet Union and neo-patrimonial
   societies. The study finds that these political actions about the
   environment are not necessarily elite driven; there is a basic
   foundation of national concern and salience of these issues, and
   demonstrated environmental beliefs do help to explain protest behavior.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the social consequences of efforts by
   multinational corporations to capture business value through recycling,
   reusing materials and reducing waste. Synthesising evidence from the
   global environmental justice and feminist and international political
   economy (IPE) literatures, it analyses the changing social property
   relations of global recycling chains. The authors argue that, although
   recycling more would seem to make good ecological sense, corporate
   programmes can rely on and further ingrain social patterns of harm and
   exploitation, particularly for the burgeoning labour force that depends
   on recyclables for subsistence living. Turning the waste stream into a
   profit stream also relies on prison labour in some places, such as in
   the United States where the federal government operates one of the
   country's largest electronics recycling programmes. The ongoing
   corporatisation of recycling, the authors argue further, is devaluing
   already marginalised populations within the global economy. Highlighting
   the need to account for the dynamism between social and environmental
   change within IPE scholarship, the article concludes by underlining the
   ways in which green commerce' programmes can shift capital's
   contradictions from nature onto labour.},

Abstract = {The response of Belarus to the global economic crisis was shaped by a
   number of distinctive features of the Belarusian economy and of the
   economic policies implemented before the crisis. The specifics of
   anti-crisis management in Belarus resulted in a distribution of output
   losses for a number of subsequent periods and delayed recession. The
   scenario of stabilisation policies in Belarus can therefore be regarded
   as ineffective. The core reasons for this are an inappropriate choice of
   policy instruments and delayed exit from stabilisation policy. It is
   argued that this policy mix has long-term implications, including
   worsening economic growth prospects.},

Abstract = {This article offers a theoretical framework for thinking about how
   organizations matter for the production, reproduction, and amelioration
   of urban poverty. We draw on the classical concept of integration, in
   both its social and systemic versions, as an important tool for
   advancing urban social theory. A key challenge for urban organizational
   analysts is to keep within view the processes of both social and
   systemic integration, while empirically investigating how they are
   connected (or not). Too many urban researchers focus on one or the
   other, with little conceptualization of the importance of linking the
   two. We argue that urban organizations of all kinds provide a strategic
   site for observing processes of both social and systemic integration,
   and that urban organizational research should examine many of them to
   better understand the multiple urban transformations currently in
   process.},

Abstract = {While much has been written on the violence of honour killings and the
   women who are their victims, little has been written on the production
   of the concept of honour killing', or the ways that concept produces
   meanings, cultures and identities. This article takes on that question,
   looking at when, where and how violence against women gets named as a
   specific crime called honour killing', in which honour comes to be a
   stable and unchanging term, particularly as the term comes to have
   hegemonic meanings which submerge other possibilities, struggles and
   violence. In this article, I argue that the concept of patriarchy has
   been outsourced from the USA and Europe to do its messy work elsewhere.
   I do so by examining the circulations of honour killings' as a concept
   in the media coverage in India and in the West'. This article finds this
   method particularly useful in analysing the concept of honour killings',
   particularly in terms of feminist struggles to give violence a voice and
   bring it to the public. The article concludes that attention to the
   production of the idea of honour killing' along these racialized lines
   is all the more important given the fact that the identification of
   violence as honour killing' may even foreclose an analytic that might be
   more historicized, multifaceted or conflictual.},

Abstract = {Female labour migrants face contradictory expectations. On the one hand,
   they are expected to be their families' and communities' economic
   saviours. On the other hand, they are expected to meet their maternal
   responsibilities even while they are abroad; otherwise, they face
   charges of maternal neglect. My goal in this article is to highlight how
   female migrant workers handle these conflicting demands. I discuss how
   migrant women simultaneously adapt to and challenge imposed family
   separation through the case study of Filipina live-in caregivers in
   Canada. They do this in two ways. First, they exhibit transnational
   hyper-maternalism which allows them to overcome accusations of neglect.
   They mother across borders' by providing for their families and by using
   technology to supervise, monitor and communicate with their children. In
   doing so, they reify and contest established gender roles. Second, they
   are active in civil society. In doing so, they highlight the negative
   consequences migrant women and their families face. Reconceptualized
   notions of motherhood characterize migrant women's transnational
   parenting, while the desire to ameliorate the negative consequences of
   family separation and reunification explain their activism.},

Abstract = {Impact assessments of proposed health programmes in developing countries
   have not been conducted routinely. But with recent evidence that
   well-intentioned health programmes can do harm to health systems, it is
   timely that such assessments become a part of programme design. This
   policy and practice note applies a rights-based health system impact
   assessment to a proposed eye health intervention in Papua New Guinea
   (PNG). The planned stand-alone intervention was based on an Indian model
   of eye health service. The impact of the planned activities on each of
   the World Health Organization (WHO)-defined six blocks of PNG's health
   system was assessed using 22 indicators from a rights-based tool. The
   authors found that all six blocks would have been weakened had this
   programme of activities been implemented. PNG did not have the
   facilities, human resources, information or supply systems, management
   capacity or finances to accommodate and sustain the scale of this
   intervention. Had the intervention proceeded as planned, resources from
   basic health services would have been redirected to eye health, away
   from core services, likely causing a regression in the realization of
   health rights. Use of this tool affords an opportunity to assess and
   improve health programme proposals before raising expectations,
   attracting political and funding support, and, on implementation,
   causing harm to health systems.},

Abstract = {The Multi-level Integrated Database Approach (MIDA) is an innovative
   procedure to improve survey research in general and to assess and adjust
   for nonresponse bias in particular. Its utility for data collection,
   nonresponse measurement, estimate adjustment, interviewer validation,
   and analysis are considered. Also discussed is how MIDA extends survey
   methodology beyond existing practices. A demonstration of a
   MIDA-enhanced sample frame for U.S. households is carried out. Finally,
   further steps for the use and testing of MIDA are covered.},

Abstract = {Between 1958 and 1960, the French domestic security and intelligence
   services came to establish a close, multi-layered, and secret working
   relationship with their German counterparts. The purpose of this
   collaborative arrangement was to enlist German support in combating the
   subversive activities of the Algerian Front de Liberation Nationale,
   whose members had taken refuge in Germany. In particular, the
   metropolitan authorities sought to impose on their German counterparts
   some of the same methods of colonial policing and intelligence that
   characterized their own counter-insurgency in France. These efforts
   proved counter-productive, however, for in internationalizing the
   Algerian war, they drew public attention to the colonial nature of
   France's hold over Algeria.},

Abstract = {This article explores contemporary Russian official and media discourse
   on cases concerning human rights violations in Chechnya which have been
   heard at the European Court of Human Rights. By comparing and
   contrasting the discourses on the Court's rulings which have been
   reproduced by various government representatives and various Russian
   newspapers, the article aims to demonstrate that, while official
   discourse remains critical of the Court's work with regard to Chechnya,
   reporting of such cases provides certain media outlets with the
   opportunity to criticise the government for its perceived failings in
   relation to safeguarding Chechnya's civilian population from human
   rights abuses.},

Abstract = {When national leaders are replaced, the incoming leader often represents
   different interests to those of his predecessor. Such shifts in national
   priorities affect both the onset of WTO disputes and the resolution of
   ongoing disputes. In particular, leader turnover increases the
   likelihood that a nation will be involved in a WTO dispute as either
   plaintiff or defendant, and, if a dispute is ongoing, then leader change
   in a defendant state increases the likelihood of significant concessions
   by the defendant. The impact of leader change on both the initiation and
   settlement of disputes is greater in non-democratic states than
   democratic states.},

Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {It is now widely recognized that regulatory failures contributed to the
   onset of the global financial crisis. Redressing such failures has,
   thus, been a key policy priority in the post-crisis reform agenda at
   both the domestic and international levels. This special issue
   investigates the process of post-crisis financial regulatory reform in a
   number of crucial issue areas, including the rules and arrangements that
   govern financial supervision, offshore financial centers and shadow
   banking, the financial industry's involvement in global regulatory
   processes, and macroeconomic modeling. In so doing, the main purpose of
   this special issue is to shed light on an often understudied aspect in
   regulation literature: the variation in the dynamics of regulatory
   change. Contributors examine the different dynamics of regulatory change
   observed post-crisis and explain variations by accounting for the
   interaction between institutional factors, on the one hand, and the
   activity of change agents and veto players involved in the regulatory
   reform process, on the other.},

Abstract = {This article explores the implications of the financial crisis for the
   relationship between monetary integration and democratic government in
   the European Union (EU). As the crisis has exposed the original balance
   that economic and monetary union (EMU) sought to maintain between
   monetary integration and policy diversity to be unsustainable, the
   eurozone is put before the choice of one of three governance models:
   executive federalism, democratic federalization or EMU dissolution.
   Notably, these three governance models perfectly illustrate Dani
   Rodrik's trilemma of the world economy', which maintains that of the
   three goods - economic (and monetary) integration, the nation-state and
   democratic politics - one will always have to give. In light of this,
   the article concludes that the present course towards executive
   federalism can be justified for preventing euro dissolution and
   recognizing the value of national self-government. Nevertheless, it
   threatens to come at a democratic price. Hence, it is imperative to
   consider possible flanking measures that can mitigate this effect.},

Abstract = {Unaccompanied minors and youth migrants from Mauritania to France are
   almost never listed in French published statistics, even though the
   alarmist response of local Mauritanian organizations indicates that many
   are migrating. To understand this apparent contradiction, we analyze
   data from a qualitative study of 395 male minors (15-18 years old) and
   youths (above 18 years old) in three Mauritanian cities-Kaedi,
   Nouakchott, and Nouadhibou-to shed light on illegal youth migration. We
   find that powerful cultural and family dynamics encourage youth
   migration and that the migration of individual youths is approached as a
   project of families and not of the individuals alone. The article also
   highlights the impact of migration on Mauritanian society and recommends
   a new immigration policy for Europe.},

Title = {International Relations Theory and the ``Social Whole{''}: Encounters
   and Gaps Between IR and Sociology},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {117-135},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article explores some basic issues which arise from International
   Relations (IR) theory also being a form of social theory in a broader
   sense. Many of these issues are related to the question of a social
   whole, that is, whether international relations/International Relations
   is one of many parts of a social whole, on what grounds it is
   differentiated from other parts, and whether it operates on a distinct
   level of social reality. We argue that these questions have been
   addressed in many forms of IR theory, but mostly only implicitly, and
   that the failure to make explicit assumptions about a social whole is
   probably due to the relative neglect of the subject in modern Sociology.
   The article argues that implicit assumptions about a social whole can be
   unearthed by looking at the concepts of systems, levels, and sectors,
   discussing debates about each of these in turn. Openly addressing IR
   theory as social theory, and spelling out images of a social whole,
   allows one to gain a sharper understanding of some of the basic
   analytical categories used, and to judge whether they form plausible
   delimitations of social reality within a wider social context.},

Abstract = {The transmission and interpretation of information generated from
   full-body scanners is increasingly becoming a site of contestation in
   airport security queues all over the world. Body scanning technology
   raises questions surrounding the rights of governments to images of
   human bodies, acts of surveillance and to what extent technologies such
   as full-body scanners are helping to make us more secure' - or are
   disadvantaging particular groups of bodies. We examine the use of
   full-body scanners and their consequences from a feminist perspective,
   demonstrating how the scanners constitute both a gendered technology'
   and a gendered practice'. In addition we present a typology outlining
   several forms of feminist resistance that have manifested in reaction to
   the use of this technology. While these acts do not necessarily pose an
   overt challenge to the larger airport security structure, as they occur
   within rigidly defined boundaries, they do offer the space for
   individuals to exercise some autonomy and control over their bodies. By
   engaging with feminist security scholarship as well as theoretical
   approaches concerned with reclaiming the everyday' as a space for
   feminist agency, we begin to unravel the complicated web of full-body
   scanning technology.},

Abstract = {South Ossetia was the main site of the August 2008 war between Georgian
   military forces, local South Ossetian forces, and the Russian military.
   Soon thereafter, the Russian Federation recognized the territory as a
   state, the South Ossetian Republic. This article reviews the contending
   scripts used to understand South Ossetia and the basis of its claim to
   be a state. Presenting the results of a public opinion survey of
   Ossetians living in the territory in late 2010, we discuss the trust in
   local institutions and leadership, ethnic Ossetian attitudes toward
   other groups, return and property, as well as relations with Russia and
   Georgia.},

Abstract = {Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have been strongly involved in
   lawmaking on children's rights, as has been documented for the drafting
   process of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and its
   Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict
   (CRC-OPAC). In article 45 of the CRC, they have been given a formal
   position in monitoring these instruments. While NGOs have been
   instrumental in putting a complaints procedure about violations of the
   CRC on the agenda, they seem to have failed to impact substantially on
   the norm-setting itself during the drafting process on the Optional
   Protocol providing for a complaints procedure (OP III CRC), which was
   adopted in December 2011. Similarly, NGOs have been given quite some
   space for involvement in the state reporting procedure under the
   International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).
   They faced considerable difficulties in putting the Optional Protocol to
   the Covenant (OP-CESCR) on the agenda, but proved successful in the end.
   Here too, their impact on the actual normsetting seems to have been in
   the end limited, although it was unmistakably greater than with regard
   to the OP III CRC. This article seeks to understand this somewhat
   paradoxical finding - that is, strong involvement in the work of the
   monitoring bodies, but limited impact on recent norm-setting on
   complaints mechanisms - by documenting the role NGOs have played in
   law-making processes on both these complaints mechanisms. The article
   analyses degrees of impact through the},

Abstract = {Responsive Regulation advocates a differentiated style of regulation and
   enforcement that is more responsive to the behavior of the regulated
   parties than a system of general or uniform rules. This article
   investigates whether such a differentiated approach can be reconciled
   with the traditional ideal of general law. On the basis of a conceptual
   analysis of generality, it is argued that the notion of generality is at
   best tautological and not inconsistent with a differentiated approach to
   regulation and enforcement. However, the value of generality is based on
   the assumption that rules function as reasons, rather than as
   instructions. As reasons, rules need not comprise large categories, but
   they do need to last for a long period of time. The conclusion drawn is
   that flexibility (rather than differentiation) is hard to reconcile with
   the notion of rules as reasons, although it may be demanded by a notion
   of rules as effective implementers of policies.},

Title = {Euroscepticism Re-galvanized: The Consequences of the 2005 French and
   Dutch Rejections of the EU Constitution},

Abstract = {In the spring of 2005, the European Union was plunged into a state of
   crisis when two of the Union's founding members (France and the
   Netherlands) rejected the proposed EU Constitution in two separate
   referendums. In this article, it is argued that the no votes in both
   countries, despite the support of mainstream political elites and the
   bulk of the media, should not be viewed with surprise. The article
   begins by examining the background debate to the referendums in both
   countries before considering the major issues that dominated the no
   campaigns as well as the issues that motivated the two countries'
   electorates in their decisions to reject the EU Constitution. From here,
   the article examines the significance of the 2005 no votes in the
   current context within France and the Netherlands and argues that the
   clear polarization of the no vote among those from socio-economically
   less well-off backgrounds is not only the sign of a further widening of
   the gap between mainstream political elites and their supporters with
   regard to European integration, but that in turn it is also having a
   significant impact at a party level in terms of the galvanization of
   Eurosceptic political parties particularly the radical right. The
   article concludes with the argument that 2005 has contributed to the
   growing salience of Euroscepticism within both countries, which in the
   context of the crisis in the eurozone is likely to lead to further
   re-evaluation of the European project among political elites.},

Abstract = {Considerable comparative scholarly attention has been paid to various
   aspects of mass support for democracy and the market. However, despite
   strong theoretical suggestions of a linkage, little is known about the
   impact of social inequality on this support. We address this issue using
   evidence from mass surveys undertaken in 12 post-communist states in
   2007, supplemented by country-level data about economic and political
   performance. Specifically, we investigate whether social inequality
   generates negative perceptions that democracy and the market will lead
   to social conflict and if it increases support for anti-democratic forms
   of governance. Notably, we find little link between citizens
   expectations of social conflict and national-level indices of income
   inequality. However, we do find a link between perceptions of the extent
   of social inequality and expectations of market-generatedbut not
   democracy-generatedconflict. Underscoring these positive and negative
   findings, perceptions of social inequality are also clearly
   consequential for support for strong-hand economic government but not
   for anti-democratic leadership.},

Abstract = {The 2008 financial crisis has had an important, but neglected, impact on
   carbon market governance in the United States. It acted as a catalyst
   for the emergence of a domestic coalition that drew upon the crisis
   experience to demand stronger regulation over carbon markets. The
   influence of this coalition was seen first in the changing content of
   draft climate change bills between 2008 and 2010. But the coalition's
   more lasting legacy was its role in shaping the content of, and
   supporting, the passage of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer
   Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank bill) in July 2010. Although that bill
   was aimed primarily at bolstering financial stability, its derivatives
   provisions strengthened carbon market regulation in significant ways.
   This policy episode demonstrates new patterns of coalition building in
   carbon market politics as well as the growing links between climate
   governance and financial regulatory politics. At the same time, the
   significance of these developments should not be overstated because of
   various limitations in the content and implementation of the Dodd-Frank
   bill, as well as the waning support for carbon markets more generally
   within the US since the bill's passage.},

Title = {Gorillas in the closet? Public and private actors in the enforcement of
   transnational private regulation},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {512-532},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper examines to what extent the background presence of state
   regulatory capacity - at times referred to as the regulatory gorilla in
   the closet - is a necessary precondition for the effective enforcement
   of transnational private regulation. By drawing on regulatory regimes in
   the areas of advertising and food safety, it identifies conditions under
   which (the potential of) public regulatory intervention can bolster the
   capacity of private actors to enforce transnational private regulation.
   These involve the overlap between norms, objectives, and interests of
   public and private regulation; the institutional design of regulatory
   enforcement; compliance with due process standards; and information
   management and data sharing. The paper argues that while public
   intervention remains important for the effective enforcement of
   transnational private regulation, governmental actors - both national
   and international - should create the necessary preconditions to
   strengthen private regulatory enforcement, as it can also enhance their
   own regulatory capacity, in particular, in transnational contexts.},

Abstract = {This article explores the place of feeling in women's decisions around
   infant feeding (and specifically long-term breastfeeding). The argument
   is that policymakers and academics often overlook feeling (or an
   affective/emotional perspective) in favor of a focus on informed choice
   as a means of understanding and influencing behavior in this area of
   social life. In exploring the relationship between ideologies and bodily
   practices, this article therefore suggests that attention to affect and
   emotion might be useful in coming to a more nuanced view of how, why,
   and when individuals make the decisions that they do. Rather than
   advocating policymaking in this intimate sphere, however, the intention
   is to consider some of the implications of this approach for academic

Abstract = {In this article and in Part 2 I advance a critical historiography' of
   IPE which excavates to the deepest foundations of the discipline. For
   while I very much welcome Benjamin Cohen's seminal historiographical
   intervention, nevertheless it obscures two foundational properties of
   IPE. First, identifying 1970 as the birth-year of IPE produces a
   distorted image of the discipline's purpose and historiography that can
   begin to be remedied by rehabilitating the originary era of classical
   political economy. Second, focussing on issues revolving around
   methodology and epistemology obscures the deeper Eurocentric
   metanarratival foundations upon which the vast majority of IPE
   scholarship between 1760-2012 stands. Specifically, I reveal the various
   Eurocentric metanarratives that underpin the orthodox traditions of
   classical political economy (Smith and List) and modern IPE (Gilpin and
   Keohane). My conclusion is that rather than producing
   positivist/objective (or even critical) explanations of the world
   economy, most of IPE has, often unwittingly, defended, promoted or
   celebrated Western civilization as the highest or ideal referent in the
   world. I follow this up in Part 2 by deconstructing open economy
   politics to bring my historiography upto the present while advancing an
   alternative non-Eurocentric empirical and theoretical research agenda
   for what I call inter-civilizational political economy.},

Abstract = {Many feminists have argued breastfeeding is a constraint that may
   prevent women from realizing nonmaternal opportunities. This article
   presents an alternative feminist perspective, arguing that the view of
   breastfeeding as a constraint glosses over the mediating role that
   gender inequality plays in the way breastfeeding impacts women's lives.
   Rather than focus on breastfeeding as a constraint, attention should be
   focused on the ways that socially created policies and practices, often
   based on a gender-similarity framework, sustain gender inequities.
   Policies and practices based on this framework negate the needs of the
   body, which exaggerates gender differences, redistributes gender
   inequities, and raise the costs of breastfeeding. In contrast, locating
   the constraint in the arena of gender inequality better explains how
   social decisions that differentially accommodate men's nonlactating
   bodies privilege men over women and help us recognize how passage of
   polices that accommodate lactating bodies represents progress toward
   equal opportunity.},

Abstract = {The Landless Workers' Movement (MST) has been the principal protagonist
   developing an alternative educational proposal for rural public schools
   in Brazil. This article analyzes the MST's differential success
   implementing this proposal in municipal and state public schools. The
   process is both participatoryactivists working with government officials
   to implement MST goalsand contentiousthe movement mobilizing support for
   its education initiatives through various forms of protest. In some
   locations, the MST has succeeded in institutionalizing a participatory
   relationship with government actors, while in other regions the MST has
   a more limited presence in the schools or has been completely banned
   from participating. Drawing on the concept of coproductionthe active
   participation of civil society actors in the provision of public
   goodsthe author argues that coproduction is a joint product of high
   levels of social mobilization and government orientation. The former is
   necessary in all cases, while the latter can take the form of either a
   left-leaning or clientelistic government.},

Abstract = {Labor migration has become common for adolescents in many African
   populations, where it is a key event in the transition into adulthood
   for both genders. This article examines the experiences of, expectations
   of, and perceptions about adolescent migration from different
   perspectives, taking into account their gender and generation. It is
   based on qualitative data, collected from a rural population in Mali,
   where labor migration is experienced by most adolescents (70-90
   percent). Despite a convergence of migratory practices between genders,
   the subjective experience and the social construction around youth
   migration appear to be in contrast for girls and boys. Male migration is
   part of family economics, and adolescent boys use migration to
   strengthen their family status. Female migration is a personal project
   and includes strong expectations about learning and obtaining life
   skills. Social judgment of female migration is negative, but new lines
   of solidarity are emerging between female generations.},

Abstract = {This article explores correlates of the socioeconomic integration of
   young rural-urban migrants in a host society in China. Using a new
   typology that distinguishes hukou (household registration system),
   migration status, and age, multilevel modeling results indicate that
   young rural-urban migrants achieve a lower socioeconomic status than
   local youths and urban-urban migratory youths. This challenges the
   notion that marketization necessarily promotes rights and legal equality
   in a linear fashion and suggests that the potentially positive impact of
   migration on personal development might be compromised by institutional
   constraints (e.g., hukou) that exclude migrants from rural areas, as
   well as other outsiders, particularly youths.},

   its inception in 1993. Using an original dataset, this article examines
   the economic sectors that have been most prominent over this period, and
   it considers different explanationsorganisational, financial and
   reputationalfor variation in their preponderance over time. It also
   assesses the effects of the sectoral ties of deputies on legislative
   activity. Through the analysis of 100 laws that were the focus of
   lobbying campaigns in the first four Dumas, it finds that the sectoral
   ties of deputies are a powerful predictor of several aspects of
   legislative behaviour.},

Abstract = {Regulation by independent agencies, rather than ministries, is believed
   to result in better policy outcomes. Yet this belief requires one to
   accept a complex causal chain leading from formal independence to actual
   independence from politics, to policy decisions, and, ultimately, to
   policy outcomes. In this study, we analyze the link between the formal
   and actual independence of regulatory agencies in Western Europe. New
   data on the appointment of chief executives of these agencies is used to
   create a proxy for the actual independence of agencies from politics.
   The analysis demonstrates that formal independence is an important
   determinant of actual independence, but the rule of law and the number
   of veto players matter as well.},

Abstract = {This study examines the support for United Russia in 43 regional
   assembly elections which were conducted over the period from March 2008
   to March 2011. In contrast to previous studies, which have tended to
   focus on the overall results of regional elections or just on the
   party-list votes, it provides a quantitative analysis of the votes for
   United Russia in the plural single member district contests. By widening
   the traditional focus on the aggregate results and party-list voting the
   study brings to light important variations in the patterns of United
   Russia's electoral domination of regional assemblies. The specific form
   of United Russia's domination depends on the configuration of regional
   elites and their strategies. Social and economic features of the regions
   have little impact on the degree and modes of United Russia's electoral
   domination, but influence the ability of regional leaders to ensure
   electoral mobilisation in the regions and this is more significant the
   higher the level of the election.},

Abstract = {There is a growing body of literature examining the influence of social
   identification on European Union (EU) attitudes. Broadly speaking, this
   literature can be divided into two strands. One strand examines the way
   social identity affects support for EU integration quantitatively, using
   opinion poll data. The other draws (often loosely) on social
   constructivism, using qualitative research methods. Social Identity
   Theory (SIT) is increasingly invoked in both these literatures and this
   development is to be welcomed. However, so far engagement with SIT has
   been rather tentative, drawing largely on theoretically impoverished
   versions of SIT. It is argued in this article that this practice has
   resulted in SIT's theoretical potential being underutilized. At other
   times, this has resulted in theoretical confusion because SIT
   explanations are being used alongside other theories whose premises
   clash with core SIT assumptions. We conclude that more in-depth
   engagement with SIT's basic and core tenets will enable quantitative EU
   identity researchers to move beyond attachment' to territorial
   identities, and allow qualitative EU identity researchers to move beyond
   shared history', deeply rooted identities' and resonance'.},

Abstract = {This paper makes the case for a tipping point' model for understanding
   economic change in India. This gradual and largely endogenously driven
   path calls for the simultaneous consideration of ideas and politics.
   Exogenous shocks affected economic policy, but did not determine the
   course of economic history in India. India's developmental model evolved
   out of new ideas Indian technocrats developed based on events they
   observed in India and other parts of the world. A historical case for
   the tipping point' model is made by comparing two severe balance of
   payments crises India faced in 1966 and 1991. In 1966, when the weight
   of ideas and politics in India favored state-led import substitution,
   Washington could not coerce New Delhi to accept deregulation and
   globalization. In 1991, on the other hand, when Indian technocrats'
   ideas favoured deregulation and globalization, the executivetechnocratic
   team engineered a silent revolution in the policy paradigm. New Delhi
   engaged constructively with Washington, making a virtue of the necessity
   of IMF conditions, and implemented a home-grown reform program that laid
   the foundations for rapid economic growth in world's most populous and
   tumultuous democracy.},

Abstract = {Responsive Regulation (RR) introduced important new ways of thinking
   about regulation. But RR was designed for domestic settings in which a
   single agency had clear jurisdiction, full regulatory capacity, and
   extensive information, and could (contingently) deploy stringent
   sanctions against well-defined targets. Under globalization, many
   regulatory problems have shifted to the transnational arena,
   characterized by multiple regulators, public and private, with limited
   capacities, authority, and information, and modest sanctioning ability;
   globalized production also renders the targets of regulation diffuse and
   difficult to identify. RR holds important lessons for transnational
   regulation, but it must be adapted to these challenging conditions. Some
   components of transnational RR are already emerging, including numerous
   private and publicprivate schemes that regulate business through
   voluntary norms: transnational regulatory standard-setting (TRSS).
   Alone, however, TRSS schemes face serious limitations. Intergovernmental
   organizations (IGOs) are best positioned to take RR transnational by
   supporting and working with the nascent TRSS system. Two regulatory
   strategies are particularly promising: collaboration and orchestration.
   In regulatory collaboration, IGOs promote business self-regulation, much
   as in RR; they can escalate in response to defection by deploying
   reputational and market sanctions. In orchestration, IGOs support and
   steer intermediaries, including TRSS schemes and NGOs, which use their
   material and ideational capacities to regulate target behavior.
   Orchestration cumulates regulatory competencies, creates avenues of
   escalation, and provides many benefits of RR tripartism.},

Abstract = {This article examines the relevance of national economic conditions for
   European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate setting and whether the
   financial and sovereign debt crises have made national divergences more
   relevant. Officially, the ECB sets policy for the eurozone and considers
   only eurozone data. However, economic shocks in one or more countries
   may warrant a deviation from this rule. Using real-time, forecast data,
   the authors estimate a modified Taylor rule incorporating two
   macroeconomic national influence' measures: first the difference between
   the median and the eurozone measures of inflation and real gross
   domestic product (GDP) growth, and then deviations of the measures of
   inflation and real GDP growth for the core' and periphery' countries
   from eurozone averages. Using rolling-window analysis to test the
   stability of parameter estimates, evidence is found that divergences in
   national data notably developments in the periphery from eurozone
   averages play an increasingly important role during the financial and
   sovereign debt crises.},

Abstract = {How does emigration affect access to and struggles for power in sending
   states? For competing groups in the homeland, emigration presents a
   contradiction: demographic losses but possible economic gains. Wins and
   losses from this trade-off evolve with shifts in who migrates, to where,
   and when. I illustrate these relationships in the case of Lebanon since
   1860, focusing on the balance of power among sectarian communities. The
   country's first migratory wave concentrated material benefits and
   population deficits in the Christian community. It also encouraged
   subsequent emigration that, over time, involved more Muslim Lebanese, as
   well. Such broadening diffused the profits of labor abroad. Due to
   changes in destinations and historical circumstances, however, many of
   these migrants remained more connected to their homeland. This aided
   social mobility for their communities without sapping resident strength.
   Outmigration thereby helped redistribute human and material resources
   among sects, and hence created the demographic and material foundations
   of the competition for power.},

Abstract = {Does gender matter when planning youth peacebuilding projects? This
   article presents research findings from two youth peacebuilding projects
   in Australia and Northern Ireland and identifies several barriers to
   participation girls faced. It sheds light on reasons why girls
   participate in some peacebuilding activities but not others,
   highlighting the role of neoliberal discourse placing the burden of
   responsibility for equal participation on individuals rather than
   program design or other factors. It concludes by proposing important
   questions for future research and identifying the conditions under which
   peacebuilding projects might benefit from including some
   gender-segregated activities.},

Abstract = {During both World Wars, one of the most powerful weapons Belgian
   citizens possessed in resisting German occupation of their country was
   the gathering of intelligence on the enemy for the allied armies. But
   Belgian's first and second secret wars were different in several
   respects, one of the most important being the relationship between the
   Belgian secret services in exile and their British counterparts. If the
   First World War was essentially a story of bitter concurrency between
   them, the Second was mostly a tale of `jealous' partnership. The
   relations with the intelligence networks in occupied Belgium formed a
   delicate but crucial issue, where money played an important role. This
   article explores these dynamics and how they affected the main mission
   of gathering intelligence on the Germans.},

Title = {Elite Decision Makers' Strategic Use of European Integration and
   Globalisation Discourses: Irish and Danish Banking Sector Reforms in the
   1990s and 2000s},

Abstract = {This article investigates decision makers' strategic use of European
   integration and globalisation discourses to justify and coordinate
   national sector reforms. This is done using the example of banking
   sector reforms in two small European Union (EU) member states, Ireland
   and Denmark. Two key arguments are put forward: (1) National
   governments' ability to make credible claims about their ability to
   influence the direction of European integration is crucial in enabling
   them to justify sector reforms. Thus, as a full member of the European
   Monetary Union (EMU), Irish decision makers are able to make credible
   claims about their influence on European financial integration, an
   option not available to Danish decision makers since Denmark is not a
   Eurozone member; (2) Globalisation comprises a particularly compelling
   set of discourses which enables decision makers to carry through sector
   reforms in line with European integration measures, even in the absence
   of national commitment to the latter. Discourses of globalisation have
   thus become the last resort' for Danish decision makers in justifying
   and coordinating reforms that are in line with EU regulations and
   recommendations.},

Abstract = {All over the world, rural and minority communities are vulnerable to
   human rights violations, often due to larger economic interests in their
   land. This policy and practice note argues that it is important to
   recognize community initiatives that denounce and resist such risks as
   acts of autonomous human rights defence. To illustrate this, it looks at
   two experiences of community organization and resistance in Uraba,
   Colombia: the organization CAVIDA and their Humanitarian Zones in
   Cacarica, and the Peace Community of San Jose de Apartado. The paper
   examines the context in which these experiences have emerged, how the
   communities were displaced off their land, and how they developed
   strategies for returning, despite ongoing conflict. It looks at the
   risks they face and the combination of complementary protection
   mechanisms they use in order to remain on their land. While being
   context specific, these experiences also have wider resonance for
   community human rights defence and protection strategies, especially
   against violations linked to economic interests and interests in
   maintaining impunity, and for pioneering the right to non-participation
   in armed conflict.},

Abstract = {Founded in 2005, the East and Horn of Africa Human Rights Defenders
   Project (EHAHRDP) functions as the Secretariat to the East and Horn of
   Africa Human Rights Defenders Network (EHAHRD-Net). Its core mandate is
   to offer protection to and promoting the rights of human rights
   defenders (HRDs) throughout the East and Horn of Africa subregions. In
   this policy and practice note we reflect on strategies, tactics and
   results in four core areas of interrelated work: protection, security
   management, advocacy, and capacity and coalition building. We argue that
   a concerted, holistic approach to the protection of HRDs is necessary to
   mitigate the worst risks that HRDs face as well as to foster an enabling
   environment for the effective defence of human rights. This involves
   complementing urgent responses to HRDs at immediate risk with the
   provision of prevention-oriented security management training, as well
   as conducting sustained institutional and public advocacy. We also
   stress the importance of capacity building as well as coalition building
   and networking in this work. Supporting the growth of national HRD
   coalitions helps to bring protection expertise down to the national
   level, strengthening the regional network model. Finally, we put forward
   areas of work that need further development in the context of the East
   and Horn of Africa.},

Abstract = {The Great Recession and its reverberations resulted in levels of
   economic distress unprecedented since the 1930s. Economic downturns,
   including the Great Recession, are known to affect adult employment and
   income, housing, family composition, and financial strain. Many of these
   family characteristics affect child and adolescent development in the
   short and long run. The nature of children's experiences in economically
   unstable families during the Great Recession is not yet fully
   understood. This article summarizes empirical research on the
   relationship between economic downturns and child and youth development.
   It also discusses theoretical perspectives linking economic downturns to
   child development through the family's emotional and behavioral
   processes, on one hand, and family investments of time and money, on the
   other. The evidence from existing studies of parental job loss,
   residential moves, income instability, and financial strain suggests
   that the Great Recession may ultimately have negative effects on child
   development.},

   popular, sometimes violent, opposition and resistance to its policies
   during the early period of New Economic Policy. The case study concerns
   the ruling Bolshevik Party's repressive approach to the Russian Orthodox
   Church in 1922. This culminated in show trials and executions of clergy
   and lay believers in response to resistance throughout the country to
   the state's campaign of collecting church valuables that year,
   ostensibly to provide relief for victims of a catastrophic famine that
   afflicted much of southern Russia in 1921-1922.},

Abstract = {Russia-EU relations have often been presented in terms of a normative
   gap, with the EU appearing as a normative and Russia as a non-normative
   actor. This article critically analyses this normative argument' which
   sees this gap as the cause of tensions. Pleading for a less dichotomous
   approach to norms and interests, it challenges the normative argument on
   the basis of the assumed congruence between the norm-driven input and
   norm-promoting output of European foreign policy. As an alternative, the
   article explores how the normative agenda in Eastern Europe serves
   instrumental purposes. Selective norm promotion has the potential to
   change the hierarchy of identities among post-Soviet states.},

Abstract = {This research examines conditions under which environmental regulatory
   disclosure is more versus less likely to work, with focus on the case of
   the Philippines. Two major findings arise out of a case study. First, we
   observe a mismatch between the nature of information and the main
   addressees of the disclosed information, which led the operation of the
   subject disclosure program to deviate from its targets. Second, this
   institutional deficiency has to do with the organizational culture and
   routine practice of the implementing agency. The second finding
   challenges a major justification of information-based environmental
   regulation (IBER) administered in weak states and underscores the role
   that administrative capacity plays in making novel regulations come into
   effect. Contrary to the popular belief that IBER creates
   non-governmental forces that offset a limited statehood, it may be less
   likely to work where state administrative capacity is weak.},

Abstract = {Recent research has noted a trend of increased ``politicization{''} of
   international politics, i.e., decisions of international institutions
   are increasingly debated and contested within civil society. What is
   lacking so far are explanations for this trend. In this paper we derive
   four potential explanations and empirically test them. The first two,
   society-centered, hypotheses focus on the process of socio-economic
   modernization on the one hand and civil society structures on the other.
   The second pair of polity-centered hypotheses focuses on the
   decision-making power of international institutions and on their
   legitimacy. We measure politicization on the basis of a quantitative
   content analysis of US quality newspaper articles about four decisions
   of different international institutions in the issue area of
   international taxation. Our finding is that politicization is driven by
   the increasing decision making authority of international institutions
   rather than by the lack of legitimacy of their procedures or the factors
   emphasized by society-centered approaches.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the relationship among major life events,
   household characteristics, and migration among adolescents and young
   adults in contemporary Malawi. Two main questions are investigated: What
   are the socioeconomic and demographic determinants of migration? and How
   do schooling, first marriage, and work relate to migration patterns? The
   study uses panel data collected from a survey designed specifically to
   explore socioeconomic and demographic aspects of youths' transitions to
   adulthood. Respondents were tracked when they moved. Moves are not
   uncommon, and the predominant reasons for moves are noneconomic.
   Although historically ethnic traditions in this area have held that
   girls and women usually do not move upon marrying, young women are now
   more likely to move than young men, with marriage being a main reason
   for doing so. Closer ties to the head of the household are associated
   with less movement for both women and men.},

Abstract = {This article presents an exploration of women workers in general legal
   practice in Australia. An examination of workplace policy documents
   provided the foundation for this study. Specific data were examined
   relative to the work and learning experiences of nine senior auxiliary
   workers from three legal workplaces; data were extracted from
   interviews, observations, and reflective diaries. The women's voices
   confirm that espoused affirmative action prohibits and represses any
   discrimination against women, but learning policies do not provide
   educational opportunities for auxiliary employees. Managers and legal
   practitioners need to consider inflexible milieus and renew policies
   that align with practice.},

Abstract = {Using a national data set, this study demonstrates that religious
   traditionalism and political conservatism are positively related to
   family size and the interactions between these measures result in

   more children may be based on beliefs about traditional gender roles and
   the importance of family in society, which in turn result in political
   engagement around these issues.},

   established with the aim of protecting internal migrant workers' rights
   in China. The organization provides services to migrant communities and,
   by various means, seeks to strengthen migrants' self-esteem and capacity
   for solving the problems they encounter when they enter the cities from
   the countryside. The article argues that new forms of public
   participation are enabled through the reconstruction of identity,
   wherein internal migrants recast themselves as `new workers' who occupy

Abstract = {This article contributes to our understanding of how the motivation to
   migrate varies depending on the stage in the life course, particularly
   during the youth-to-adult transition. Using data from the Mexican
   Migration Project, we estimate discrete-time-hazard models of the
   probabilities of a first migration, using individual, household,
   community, and macroeconomic variables during and after adolescence for
   both men and women. We show that the determinants of migration are
   different for adolescents than they are for adults. While
   migration-related social capital has proved to be an important factor in
   increasing and perpetuating migration, we find that its effect is even
   stronger for teenagers than for other age groups. We also shed light on
   how adolescent migration is influenced by other major markers of the
   transition to adulthood, such as education, labor force experience, and
   family formation.},

Abstract = {While the EU's policies towards non-member states are often discussed
   within frameworks of high politics', one of the most important features
   of the European Neighbourhood Policy is its emphasis on the low
   politics' of sectoral dialogue in functionally differentiated policy
   fields. Examining policy change triggered in Ukraine by the EU's
   neighbourhood policy framework, the essay focuses on environmental
   policy as a typical low politics' policy field. The results show that in
   four sub-fields of environmental policy case-specific constellations of
   domestic veto players, policy-specific conditionality and external
   capacity building determine domestic policy change.},

Abstract = {This essay analyses convergence with EU rules in Ukraine in two policy
   areasforeign and security policy and state aid regulation. Comparing the
   two, we find different levels of convergence, somewhat higher in foreign
   policy (but slowing down after 2010) than in state aid law regulation.
   We explain this by analysing the presence and actions of oligarchs as
   veto players that have had an extensive influence on policy in the
   Ukrainian political system in recent years. In policy areas where
   convergence with EU rules negatively affects the interests of oligarchs
   and their political allies, we see only limited convergence with EU
   legislation and policies.},

Abstract = {Numerous recent reports by non-governmental organisations (NGOs),
   academics and international organisations have focused on so-called
   climate refugees'. This article examines the turn from a discourse of
   climate refugees', in which organisations perceive migration as a
   failure of both mitigation and adaptation to climate change, to one of
   climate migration', in which organisations promote migration as a
   strategy of adaptation. Its focus is the promotion of climate migration
   management, and it explores the trend of these discourses through two
   sections. First, it provides an empirical account of the two discourses,
   emphasising the differentiation between them. It then focuses on the
   discourse of climate migration, its origins, extent and content, and the
   associated practices of migration management'. The second part argues
   that the turn to the promotion of climate migration' should be
   understood as a way to manage the insecurity created by climate change.
   However, international organisations enacts this management within the
   forms of neoliberal capitalism, including the framework of governance.
   Therefore, the promotion of climate migration' as a strategy of
   adaptation to climate change is located within the tendencies of
   neoliberalism and the reconfiguration of southern states' sovereignty
   through governance.},

Abstract = {Previous literature suggests that AIDS Service Organizations (ASOs) play
   an important support role in the lives of impoverished women living with
   HIV. Less is known about the dynamics of institutional support for
   middle-class women living with HIV/AIDS, who are assumed to possess a
   broader base of resources to address their diagnosis. Using qualitative
   data collected from a racially and economically diverse group of
   HIV-positive women in Chicago, this article compares how low-income and
   middle-class women utilize ASOs and reveals how the women's divergent
   approaches to availing themselves of institutional resources have
   important implications for their social and economic coping. For
   example, associating with ASOs can be status-improving for impoverished
   women and status-diminishing for middle-class women. As a result,
   middle-class women report a less robust network of social service
   providers and people living with HIV/AIDS on whom they rely for
   HIV-related information and social support, making them vulnerable to
   HIV-specific social isolation. In sum, the ways that HIV-positive women
   deploy institutional ties to negotiate their HIV/AIDS status differs
   markedly depending on socioeconomic status, suggesting that the role of
   class in gathering social support may be more complex than previously
   understood.},

Abstract = {With a comparative case study of the social welfare systems of an urban
   and a rural county in the United States, I explore variation in local
   welfare implementation by examining organisational strategies. Service
   provision in the rural county is less diverse and less effective than in
   the urban county due to place-based factors; however, in the urban
   county more financial resources and capacity translates into more
   regulation of the clientele as well as resistance to neoliberal
   practices. Organisations whose existence depends upon benevolent elites
   adapt to their funding requirements by regulating clients of social
   services, including tactics of surveillance, elaborate verification, and
   restriction. The enforcement of low-wage work that is bracketed by
   national policy is highly constraining, but can be challenged through a
   welfare organisation when the right conditions are present for an
   empowered grassroots approach. These findings are situated within the
   more general literature on the changing governance of welfare.},

Abstract = {Memorials remain a relatively under-investigated dimension of
   transitional justice. Seeking to address this gap, this empirical
   article focuses on the Croatian town of Vukovar to examine whether war
   memorials can aid postconflict reconciliation, defined as the
   restoration and repair of relationships and the rebuilding of trust. It
   argues that Vukovar's numerous war memorials are obstructing
   reconciliation between the town's Croats and Serbs in two main ways.
   First, they are encouraging selective memory through the erasure of Serb
   victims. Second, they are contributing to a problem of too much memory,
   which is preventing society from moving forward.},

Abstract = {This article examines how the defeated and demoralized Japanese, faced
   with Soviet detention and repatriation policies, were embroiled in Cold
   War antagonism that originated with the division of Europe. The article
   addresses three main questions. First, how did the Japanese government
   seek to facilitate the return of Japanese from the Soviet-occupied zone?
   Second, how did negotiations over Japanese repatriation intersect with
   U.S.-Soviet relations? Third, how did Soviet repatriation policy effect
   Japanese foreign policy in the initial stage of the Cold War? This
   episode brings out important aspects of U.S.-Soviet-Japanese
   interactions during the early Cold War.},

Abstract = {The politics of Supreme Court nominations present a case in which gender
   issues from abortion to diversity are highly salient on the bench.
   However, confirmation politics are also tightly constrained by
   institutional pressure for party loyalty. In the battle to replace
   Sandra Day O'Connor, we find that gender had a limited impact on
   senators' votes on the Roberts and Alito nominations. Republicans
   uniformly supported the president's nominees and the most liberal
   Democrats opposed them. However, gender did impact the votes of more
   moderate and conservative Democrats. Analysis of the explanations
   senators offer to justify their votes and build trust with constituents
   demonstrates that womenparticularly Democratic womenplace greater
   emphasis on women's rights in their floor statements, supporting the
   contention that female senators prioritize women as a constituency and
   bring a different perspective to policy deliberations.},

Abstract = {The decision to declassify selected historical documents from the
   archives of the Security Service in 1997 has been a boon to academic
   historians of intelligence. The declassified files reveal the successes
   and failures of the Security Service in fulfilling its statutory
   function of defending the realm. Yet the activity of Soviet spies
   continues to be one of the most challenging topics in intelligence
   history. The role of Soviet defectors in transforming the Security
   Service's understanding of the nature and extent of Soviet intelligence
   operations, meanwhile, remains largely understudied. In the case of
   Agabekov, for example, the reaction of SIS or MI5 to his `disappearance'
   in the spring of 1938 has long been neglected. It is possible that there
   was no reaction at all, because both services had long-since written off
   Agabekov as a source. This helps explain why Agabekov's case has been
   ignored in the relevant literature in both Russia and the West.},

Title = {Reflections on Werner Bonefeld's `Freedom and the Strong State: On
   German Ordoliberalism' and the Continuing Importance of the Ideas of
   Ordoliberalism to Understand Germany's (Contested) Role in Resolving the

Abstract = {A historian and a political scientist take issue with Bonefeld's
   interpretation of ordoliberalism from the viewpoint of our historical
   knowledge of the Freiburg School. Our major disagreement is with
   Bonefeld's underlying assumption that the ideas of the Freiburgers on
   strong state authority were very durable and continued to be so across a
   divide as great as that of 1945 when a more strictly chronological use
   of the sources would have shown significant transformations. The earlier
   quasi proto-fascist ideas of the strong state were replaced with a much
   more muted role for the state in providing a constitutional framework in
   which the market forces could develop. It is through this break with
   their own initial sympathy with Hitler's strong state that the ideas of
   the Freiburger Ordnungspolitik underwent profound changes to a
   constitutional state as guarantor of economic stability, and only in
   this changed form do the ideas of a legal rule-based system of the
   Freiburger ordoliberals continue to play an important role in
   understanding Germany's role in resolving the Euro crisis. It is this
   significant shift, in the ideas of ordoliberals, that is missing in
   Bonefeld's article.},

Abstract = {Growth in Central and East European countries (CEE) is territorially
   unbalanced, more so than in most other parts of the EU. The benefits of
   transformation in these countries have been unequally distributed among
   particular social groups and territorieswith the emergence of highly
   educated and internationally successful professionals and entrepreneurs
   located mainly in metropolitan areas on the one hand, and structural
   unemployment, persistent poverty and social exclusion in peripheral
   regions on the other. These regional imbalances are characterised by a
   process of metropolisation that has privileged a handful of dynamic
   urban centres while exacerbating the structural problems of old
   industrial regions, vast rural areas and regions located on borders, and
   especially the EU's eastern borders. Different as they are in social,
   cultural and geographical terms, these declining or stagnating regions
   share general problems of economic peripherality and many negative
   effects of structural change, such as rural depopulation, brain drain',
   disinvestment and, frequently, below-average levels of socio-economic
   well-being. This polarised economic and territorial development within
   CEE poses challenges not only for the respective countries, but also for
   European cohesion.},

Abstract = {In debates on the preemptive measures of the war on terror, criminal law
   is often regarded as the antithesis to exceptiona conventional mode of
   response that acts on the basis of past harm. Since September 11, 2001,
   however, significant new terrorism laws have been adopted in most
   countries in order to make possible the disruption and prosecution of
   potential terrorists engaged in preparatory activities. Thus, ancillary
   acts undertaken increasingly in advance of actual violence are brought
   within the remit of criminal law. This paper engages the question of the
   precautionary turn in criminal law itself, and how it plays out in
   actual courtrooms. We examine the terrorist trial as a performative
   space where potential future terror is imagined, invoked, contested, and
   made real. By focusing on the cases of the Hofstad group in the
   Netherlands, and the Rhyme trials in the UK, the paper examines how
   present criminal offenses involving terrorist aims and intent are
   constituted through the appeal to potential future violence. In
   conclusion, the paper teases out the political dynamic of secondary risk
   management thatfrequentlyunderlies contemporary terrorism prosecutions.},

Abstract = {Indigenous peoples are often perceived as custodians of nature owing to
   their close relationship with their environment and their nature-based
   livelihoods. This paper investigates the kinds of environmental agencies
   that are constructed for, and by, indigenous peoples within the United
   Nations (UN) Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (PF) and the Arctic
   Council. The particular focus of this research is the issue of
   responsibility. The article brings together empirical materials from the
   two forums and engages with them using Foucault-inspired approaches. We
   offer a critical discussion of indigenous peoples' environmental agency
   in international politics, addressing the need to problematize
   representations of indigenous agency that to date have been largely
   unchallenged in both the practice and study of international politics.
   We identify three perspectives through which the environmental agency of
   indigenous peoples is validated and justified: having particular
   knowledge, being stakeholders, and having a close relationship with
   nature. Certain kinds of expectations are inscribed in each of these
   perspectives; responsibility becomes intertwined with agency.},

Abstract = {Utilizing data from five census enumerations of Latvia (including the
   most recent 2011 census), this study analyzes temporal and spatial
   trends in ethnic diversity in the country at the national and municipal
   levels. The measure employed, the ethnic diversity index (EDI), makes
   possible a more sophisticated interpretation of the dynamics of ethnic
   diversity than an analysis of the changing percentage shares of Latvia's
   various ethnic groups over time. At the national level, a trend of
   declining ethnic diversity prior to Latvia's incorporation into the
   Soviet Union was followed by a rapid increase during the Soviet period,
   before the onset of gradually decreasing diversity during the
   post-Soviet period. These national-level trends obscure a number of
   trends evident at the municipal level, including salient (depending on
   the period) ethnic diversity gradients Rga-Latvia,
   cities/towns-countryside, and the east-west. Latvia remains one of the
   most ethnically diverse countries of Europe, and the study outlines some
   of the implications of the recent stagnation of regional EDIs at rather
   high levels for the economic and political life of the country.},

Abstract = {The existing international economic order has been heavily shaped by US
   power and the US has been a key driver of globalisation and neoliberal
   economic restructuring, prompting speculation about whether the rise of
   new developing country powers could rupture the current trajectory of
   neoliberal globalisation. This paper analyses the case of Brazil at the
   World Trade Organization (WTO), a core institution in global economic
   governance. In the last decade, Brazil successfully waged two landmark
   trade disputes against the US and EU and created a coalition of
   developing countries - the G20 - which brought an end to the dominance
   of the US and EU at the WTO and made their trade policies a central
   target of the Doha Round. Brazil's activism has been widely hailed as a
   major victory for developing countries. However, I argue that rather
   than challenging the neoliberal agenda of the WTO, Brazil has emerged as
   one of the most vocal advocates of free market globalisation and the
   push to expand and liberalise global markets. I show that Brazil's
   stance has been driven by the rise of its export-oriented agribusiness
   sector. This case demonstrates that business actors from the Global
   South are becoming significant new protagonists in global economic
   governance; they are taking the tools created by the states and
   corporations of the Global North - in this case, the WTO and its
   neoliberal discourse - and turning them against their originators. At
   the same time, their interests are being wrapped in and advanced through
   a discourse of development and social justice and a strategic
   mobilisation of the politics of the North-South divide.},

Abstract = {The discourse surrounding US family planning policies has evolved into a
   highly moralistic one that mirrors US domestic debates surrounding
   abortion rights. However, the original intent of population control' was
   to protect US access to raw resources and maintain US global supremacy.
   US family policies did not first identify woman as the object to be
   controlled, but policies have changed such that women's bodies have
   become a symbolic representation of - and site of resistance to - the
   power relationships between the US and developing states. The change in
   the rhetoric - from population control to family planning, women's
   empowerment, environmental sustainability and human rights - does not
   mean the rules' enforced by the hegemon have changed so much as it
   indicates a process of identity formation occurring through the
   implementation of these rules.},

Abstract = {Individuals participating in the HUD Housing Choice Voucher program,
   formerly Section 8, can rent units in the private market and are not
   tied to public housing projects in a specific neighborhood. We would
   expect vouchers to help poor families leave the ghetto and move to more
   diverse communities with higher socioeconomic opportunity, but many
   voucher holders remain concentrated in poor, segregated communities. We
   use longitudinal qualitative data from one hundred low-income African
   American families in Mobile, Alabama, to explore this phenomenon,
   finding that tenants' limited housing search resources, involuntary
   mobility, landlord practices, and several aspects of the voucher program
   itself limit families' ability to escape disadvantaged areas. We also
   find that the voucher program's regulations and funding structures do
   not incentivize housing authorities to promote neighborhood mobility and
   residential choice. This combination of forces often keeps voucher
   recipients in neighborhoods with high concentrations of poor and
   minority residents.},

Abstract = {Throughout its history, the legitimacy of the European Union has
   constantly been challenged. Eroding levels of political support have not
   left political elites unaffected. This article focuses on legitimation
   strategies formulated by the Commission between 1973 and 1994 and
   applies a post-structuralist framework to account for the development of
   legitimation strategies over time. The formulation of legitimation
   strategies becomes possible within distinct discourses while other plans
   of action to generate political support remain unthinkable. Narrative
   analysis is proposed as a useful methodological tool to analyze
   structures of meaning that restrain the Commission in its choice of
   legitimation strategies.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5},
Pages = {634-654},
Abstract = {Strategic situations create motivational biases that help to predict the
   type of errors intelligence communities are more likely to commit (Type
   I errors predict behavior never observed, while Type II errors fail to
   predict behavior later observed). When the dangers of inaction are low
   and the cost of action high, the intelligence community is more likely
   to fail to predict threats (Type II error). If the dangers of inaction
   are high and the costs of military action low, it is more likely to
   predict mistakenly threats never observed (Type I error). Studies of US
   and Israeli decisionmaking and analyses of two new experimental studies
   support this theory. The key is to recognize the incentives for error
   and to develop systems that, at worst, lead to intelligence errors
   (mistakes consistent with a state's national security needs) and not
   intelligence failures (errors contrary to national security
   requirements).},

Abstract = {Despite a growing recognition of the influence of gender in the
   policymaking arena, few scholars have studied the relationship between
   lawyer gender and decision making on appellate courts. This article
   examines this relationship in the context of the United States Courts of
   Appeals, where there have been a greater number of female judges for a
   longer period of time. The results of the analysis suggest that, in the
   average Courts of Appeals case, judges are generally more likely to side
   with female attorneys, even in the absence of a women's issue. In
   addition, both male and female judges are equally supportive of female
   lawyers even when the circuit is not particularly gender diverse.
   However, circuit judges are less likely to support female attorneys in
   cases in which the circuit reverses the lower court, indicating a
   notable disadvantage for female advocates in the very cases in which
   advocacy might be most crucial at the circuit court level.},

Abstract = {This essay considers deployments of the term Men who have Sex with Men'
   (MSM) through what the author terms a Risk-Rights' strategy in
   international development. Examining two Caribbean initiatives - the
   2011 documentary film Living in the Shadows and the Guyanese NGO Society
   Against Sexual Orientation Discrimination (SASOD) - this paper documents
   and evaluates this strategy. Living in the Shadows demonstrates the
   dominant characterization of MSM as murderous, while SASOD's engagement
   is more consciously critical of the strategy's limits. Both the
   Risk-Rights' strategy and its achievement of success', however, appear
   to ultimately privilege particular Euro-American frameworks of sexuality
   and close possibilities for other forms of sexual cultures and
   identities to emerge.},

Title = {Governing Poverty in a Neoliberal Age: New Labour and the Case of
   Financial Exclusion},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {6},
Pages = {785-810},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {In the UK, from the 1990s, the concept of financial exclusion emerged as
   a focus of policymaking concern. In part, this reflects the growing
   scale and complexity of personal finance markets and how these are
   increasingly interwoven into the everyday lives of individuals. However,
   it is also argued that the development of the concept of financial
   exclusion reflects preeminent neoliberal discourses that emphasise the
   centrality of individual responsibility, autonomy and consumer
   participation within markets. In 2004 the then Labour government, in
   conjunction with academic experts, financial institutions and other
   organisations, established a project of financial inclusion in relation
   to three key domains: banking, affordable credit and financial
   capability. The consequence, it is suggested here, has not been so much
   to alleviate inequality as to nurture the poor to be precautionary, risk
   averse financial subjects. This stands in contrast with the virtues of
   enterprise and risk-taking called up in middle-class investor subjects.},

Abstract = {America's political response to the Great Recession was surprising to
   pundits but mostly consistent with patterns familiar to political
   scientists. Ordinary citizens assessed politicians and policies
   primarily on the basis of visible evidence of success or failure. Thus,
   in 2008, the president's party was punished at the polls for the dismal
   state of the election-year economy. The successful challenger, Barack
   Obama, pushed policy significantly to the Left, as Democratic presidents
   typically do, provoking a predictable thermostatic shift to the Right in
   the public's policy mood. In 2010, slow economic recovery and public
   qualms about ideological overreach exacerbated the losses normally
   suffered by a president's party in midterm elections. In 2012, Obama was
   reelectedas incumbents almost always are when their party has held the
   White House for just four yearsthanks in part to a modest but timely
   upturn in the income growth rate.},
