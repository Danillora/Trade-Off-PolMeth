Abstract = {European integration is a multilayer process consisting of significant
   differences in efforts and capabilities of the Member State's individual
   EU participation. Hence, general statements about the national level of
   European economic integration are very vague. In order to fill this gap,
   this article presents a composite indicator measuring the extent of
   economic integration within the European Union - the EU Index. Existing
   composite indicators concerned with economic integration (globalization
   indices) were not designed to capture the specific European dimensions.
   The EU Index offers a unique basis, as now the national differences can
   be illustrated by one statistical measure. Large heterogeneities are
   found between the Member States with respect to overall European
   economic integration and to various sub-indices. By using cluster
   analysis, it is also shown that the prevailing economic heterogeneities
   in the EU are combined with a strong and even growing clustering of its
   members, thereby challenging present and future steps of European
   integration.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the implications of World Trade Organization (WTO)
   accession for Russian agricultural policy. Using Organisation for
   Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) data on producer support
   from 2010, we identify two major characteristics of Russian agricultural
   and trade policy (a) reliance on sizeable differences between world and
   domestic prices to generate two-thirds of agricultural producer support
   and (b) highly distortionary budget support. We then consider whether
   the disciplines introduced by WTO accession will constrain or even roll
   back these distortionary policies, thereby substantially changing the
   nature of agricultural policies in Russia. Using data from OECD-FAO
   (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) and Russian
   Ministry of Agriculture projections, we conclude that the structure of
   OECD-type producer support in 2020 will be very similar to its current
   state. Market price support will continue to dominate the Producer
   Support Estimate, and the projected Current Total Aggregate Measure of
   Support (AMS) will approach the WTO Bound Total AMS (the ceiling on
   production-distorting support) only in 2018. For the reasons above, we
   conclude that although WTO accession provides opportunities for
   important changes in Russian sanitary, phytosanitary, food safety,
   trade, and tariff policies, membership is not a guarantee of systemic
   change. In fact, a serious look at Russian WTO commitments makes a
   minimum-change scenario quite possible and even likely.},

Abstract = {The academic discipline of International Relations has yet to
   systematically begin tracing the impact of posthumanism on ethics in
   global politics. In a context where a humanist picture of the subject is
   in ``a state of crisis that is more acute than ever,{''} and the ``end
   of humanity{''} is being declared by some, the question arises as to
   whether a moral commitment to liberal cosmopolitanism can be maintained.
   It arises because the moral commitments of cosmopolitanism traditionally
   rest on a humanist foundation, and posthumanism, at first glance, seems
   an obvious threat to it. In this article, rather than reading
   posthumanism as a threat to humanity, I read humanism as the threat. I
   propose that, tricky though it may be, a cosmopolitanism that embraces
   the end of humanity can be formulated and defended as a moral commitment
   to humanity: a cosmopolitanism without foundations. This cosmopolitanism
   without foundations is, I suggest, one way to overcome the skeptic's
   fantasy that we are hidden from each other, and with it the belief that
   our primary relation to the world is one of knowledge anchored to
   foundational promises of certainty. Instead, a life lived in the world
   with others is proposed, and with it a cosmopolitan commitment to
   humanity as an unavoidable ethical responsibility.},

Abstract = {This article aims to better understand the discrepancy between a
   relatively high level of awareness of the ecological crisis on the one
   hand, and insufficient political and social change on the other. This
   discrepancy causes a crisis of what we call the Rio model of politics'.
   We approach the problem from the perspective of the concept of societal
   nature relations' (gesellschaftliche naturverhaltnisse), which can be
   situated in the framework of political ecology and, in this article, is
   combined with insights from regulation theory and critical state theory.
   The empirical analysis identifies fossilist patterns of production and
   consumption as the heart of the problem. These patterns are deeply
   rooted in everyday and institutional practices as well as societal
   orientations in the global North and imply a disproportionate claim on
   global resources, sinks and labour power. They thus form the basis of
   what we call the imperial mode of living' of the global North. With the
   rapid industrialisation of countries such as India and China, fossilist
   patterns of production and consumption are generalised. As a
   consequence, the ability of developed capitalism to fix its
   environmental contradictions through the externalisation of its
   socio-ecological costs is put into question. Geopolitical and economic
   tensions increase and result in a crisis of international environmental
   governance. Strategies like green economy' have to be understood as
   attempts to make the ecological contradictions of capitalism processable
   once again.},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates that the European Parliament has increasingly
   voted with the Council for a more restrictive position on irregular
   migration and asylum since obtaining co-decision authority in these
   areas in 2005, in contrast to its previous liberal position. Roll-call
   votes in the fifth and sixth European Parliaments (1999-2009) in the
   field of irregular migration and asylum were analyzed, and it was found
   that an abrupt change in voting behaviour of many MEPs, particularly
   those members belonging to two of its main liberal-leaning parties, the
   S\&D and ELDR, is evidently linked to the change of authority of the EP.
   Apparently, there is an inverse correlation between the level of
   decision-making authority and the freedom to vote for a liberal
   immigration and asylum policy. The author suggests several explanations
   for this behaviour, including the need for MEPs to be flexible in
   working with the Council in order to pass legislation.},

Abstract = {This article argues in favour of theorizing transitional justice in
   established democracies. Using a New Zealand example, the article
   employs liberal theory to develop a legitimating account of transitional
   justice. This account not only offers ways of replying to those who
   critique the transitional justice aspirations of established democracies
   but also constitutes a response to those who argue against the coherence
   of transitional justice as a theory. Although transregime legitimation
   is certainly not transitional justice's only role, it is an important
   function and provides resources for a unified political theory of
   transitional justice.},

Abstract = {The literature on European Union enlargement has identified misfit and
   membership conditionality as two factors that decisively shape the
   effectiveness of EU policy transfer to the Central and Eastern European
   accession countries. Thus, European neighbourhood countries would seem
   to be less likely cases of EU-induced policy change. Yet, rather than
   inertia or resistance, we find that European neighbourhood countries
   comply with some but not with other EU policies. Our essay investigates
   such policy-specific variation in the compliance patterns of Georgia and
   Armenia that give rise to differential policy change. Comparing the
   fight against corruption, migration and energy policy, we argue that
   policy-specific conditionality and preferential fit are the main factors
   accounting for the EU's differential policy impact in European
   neighbourhood countries.},

Abstract = {Scholars and advocates frequently rank the American states in terms of
   the favorability of their policy positions on a range of issues,
   including women-friendliness. We examine if this is an identifiable
   dimension among 32 policies selected by women's interest organizations
   as important women-friendly planks and adopted by 50 states. We identify
   8 policies that cohere empirically in the adoption pattern of states.
   Our list suggests that if women-friendly policy has a coherent
   theoretical meaning, its focus is on women's self-determination, and not
   on family and children, or even equity in the workplace.},

   Fisheries Certification: Insights from Atlantic Canada},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Over the last decade, the proliferation of social and environmental
   certification programmes has attracted the attention of a growing number
   of political scientists interested in new forms of private'
   transnational governance. However, we still lack analyses on the nature
   and extent of different state responses to and involvement in new
   private transnational governance arrangements in particular sectors and
   in different jurisdictions. This article advances our understanding of
   the interactions between nation-state and private transnational modes of
   governance by analysing the role of national government authorities in
   Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) fisheries certification in Atlantic
   Canada, known more for the disastrous collapse of Northern cod stocks
   than good marine stewardship. Focusing on the 2008 certification of
   Northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis) fisheries off the Province of
   Newfoundland and Labrador, the analysis finds that the implementation
   and maintenance of MSC certification in this case depended on
   significant support from government authorities. The delicate legitimacy
   of both authorities faces a period of uncertainty in this case since
   some certified shrimp stocks appear to be in decline and perhaps also
   migrating northward off Newfoundland and Labrador.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {41},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In multiethnic and multi-religious democracies, the chronic danger is
   that candidates will engage in ``identity politics,{''} appealing to one
   locally preponderant ethnic group against other groups. The usual
   formulas for composing multiethnic democracies-ethnic federalism and/or
   proportional representation-often exacerbate the problem, ethnicizing
   political campaigns and carving up the national legislature into ethnic
   blocs, each beholden only to its own group. An alternative approach-what
   I call ``dispersed constituency democracy{''}a{''}is to match each
   legislative seat with a constituency that reflects the overall ethnic
   composition of the society in question, so as to encourage candidates to
   reach across ethnic divisions rather than play to locally preponderant
   ones. I propose a simple way to do this, and explore the likely
   consequences for national electoral campaigns and legislative dynamics
   over a range of demographic circumstances. I also consider supplemental
   devices for protecting minority rights that would be made possible by
   the proposed constituency system.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This article critically (re) examines the Girl Effect
   narrative in order to problematize the ways that this discursive
   paradigm shapes the forms and possibilities for girls' political
   subjectivity and agency.
   Approach - Based on a close, textual reading of the first Girl Effect
   video, the study adopts the tools of deconstruction to reveal the
   discursive (im) possibilities for differently situated girls. It draws
   from contemporary girls' studies scholarship and postcolonial feminist
   theory to identify the production of oppositional girlhoods and
   neoliberal girl power, while further considering how these disciplinary
   effects inform girls' political practices.
   Findings - The author suggests that the Girl Effect paradigm offers
   limited understandings of girls' political subjectivity: prompting
   Western girls to become agents of missionary girl power and positioning
   Third World girls as perpetual victims waiting for rescue.
   Originality/value - By exploring the effects of the Girl Effect logic,
   this article troubles the political ideologies framing the ``invest in
   girls'' message and contributes original research to the growing field
   of girls' studies.},

Abstract = {Purpose - In recent years, various communities across Canada have
   recognized the need to include young people's input in community/urban
   decision-making processes. As a signatory to the United Nations
   Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), Canadian governments and
   policy makers are obligated to take young people's views into
   consideration when decisions about them are made. The aim of this
   chapter is to examine how some communities have attempted to involve
   young people in such decision making by creating youth advisory
   councils.
   Design/methodology/approach - This chapter draws on an open-ended
   small-scale survey conducted with youth council members and adults
   familiar with the operation of youth councils.
   Findings - The findings suggest that many youth councils were mostly
   initiated by adults for youth. However, the successes of these youth
   councils were many. Participants reported that youth councils provided
   young people with a voice on an array of issues ranging in scope from
   local to national/international. Despite these successes, the ability of
   young people to have a voice in decisions that affected them was
   hindered by the many challenges that youth councils faced (e.g., lack of
   adult support).
   Originality/value - This chapter provides strategies to help overcome
   barriers to genuine youth participation in the decision-making processes
   of communities/cities. It also critically engages with the concept of
   participation as it relates to youth councils as an avenue for enhancing
   young people's civic and political lives. Finally, it adds to the
   literature by examining the Canadian context which has often been
   overlooked in research on youth councils.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes how conjunctures between Indian activism for
   gender/sexual rights, the governmental state and transnational
   developmental agencies create bounded and exclusionary rubrics of gender
   and sexual identification. I argue that such institutional linkages
   serve to consolidate rubrics of legible identification that legitimize
   certain forms of gender/sexual difference for inclusion within
   developmental programs and citizenship, while other forms of subjecthood
   and community formation are rendered unintelligible or illegitimate.
   Drawing from ethnographic research conducted in eastern India between
   2007 and 2012, the article focuses on male-assigned gender variant
   same-sex desiring subjects and their interpellation within identitarian
   categories like transgender and MSM (men who have sex with men). While
   the globalization of transgender as a form of political identity has
   promised greater rights and governmental inclusion for gender variant
   persons, it entails a broader MSM-transgender schema of identification
   based on a standardized divide between cisgendered homosexuals and
   male-to-female transgender persons. Various expressions of lower
   class/caste gender/sexual variance are rendered illegible in this
   rubric, delegitimizing associated subjects who are left without access
   to constitutional rights and protections and/or treated as exploitable
   populations within the development and HIV-AIDS industries.},

Abstract = {This article revisits the creation of NSC 68, a landmark in Cold War
   history, in the light of continuing historical debates and with the
   assistance of archival material recently made available. The article
   reviews the historiography of NSC 68, including controversies over the
   language adopted, together with recent writings that stress a broader
   political economy analysis of U.S. foreign policy. The article revisits
   the contested issue of whether NSC 68 represented continuity with past
   policy or a sharp departure from it. In addressing this issue, the
   article looks closely at the style and tone of the document as well as
   its impact on the U.S. defense budget and finally its convergence with
   the other transformative decision of the time, the commitment of
   resources to the development of the hydrogen bomb.},

Abstract = {This article explores the advocacy efforts of financial industry groups
   since the financial crisis. I describe key changes in the post-crisis
   financial regulatory environment and argue that financial industry
   groups have adapted their advocacy strategies to these new conditions in
   innovative ways. Faced with a more challenging environment, financial
   industry groups have shifted their emphasis along the different stages
   of the policy cycle. Specifically, increased issue salience and a
   strained policy network have weakened financial industry groups'
   capacity to veto regulatory proposals at the stage of actual policy
   formulation. Focusing on the advocacy strategies of the global banking
   and derivatives industries, I show evidence that the response has been
   to invest in more subtle advocacy strategies which focus on other stages
   of the policymaking cycle. Self-regulatory moves attempt to affect the
   agenda setting stage of policymaking, and a strong focus on the timing,
   rather than the content of new regulations, has attempted to affect the
   implementation stage. Such a transformation of advocacy strategies
   differs sharply from most depictions of financial industry groups simply
   blocking regulatory change since the global financial crisis.},

Abstract = {Closing the technology gap to reduce labour productivity disparities
   across Europe is crucial for the European cohesion policy. This article
   explores the sources of labour productivity growth in Europe over the
   period 1993-2007 in light of the enlargement process. Labour
   productivity growth has been mostly driven by capital accumulation. New
   Member States have significantly reduced their inefficiency and their
   technology gap. Disparities in the levels of labour productivity are
   still substantial and, to a considerable extent, they can be attributed
   to technology gap differences. This raises concerns about the process of
   convergence in labour productivity in Europe and suggests further
   policies aimed at reducing the technology gap.},

Abstract = {The involvement of the Soviet bloc in the Greek Civil War, especially
   the weapons and other aid provided by the Communist states to the Greek
   Communist Party (KKE), could not be studied in any serious way until
   very recently. Only a small number of historians addressed this question
   prior to the collapse of the Communist regimes in Europe and the opening
   of East European archives. The newly available documentary evidence
   shows that throughout the conflict the KKE acted in close cooperation
   with the Soviet bloc, particularly through permanent representatives who
   were responsible for coordinating the aid supplied to the KKE and
   ensuring maximal use of it. The Democratic Army of Greece (DAG) was
   completely dependent on weaponry, equipment, and training from the
   Soviet bloc. The insurgency in Greece would have been impossible without
   the external support of the Communist states.},

Abstract = {Cross-border cooperation is recognised as an important aspect of
   regional development and especially EU cohesion policy. Policy
   effectiveness depends on how well programmes are suited to different
   border regional contexts. This essay analyses the factors that shape
   cooperation by comparing the Polish-German and Polish-Slovak border
   regions. Particular emphasis is placed on the cultural factors that set
   these two regions apart. The essay reveals that close-knit networks
   across the Polish-Slovak border promote successful policy definition and
   implementation. At the same time, the absence of such networks across
   the Polish-German border has led to a high degree of policy innovation.},

Abstract = {This article provides insights into the effective regulation of private
   sector innovation. It coins a terminnovation-framing regulationto
   describe a particular quality of much of financial regulation in the
   recent era. It sketches a particular financial innovation
   (securitization and the marketing of securitized assets on derivatives
   markets), and describes three regulatory interactions having to do with
   that innovation. I identify three key assumptions that are ripe for
   re-evaluation: the notion that private sector innovation is beneficial,
   virtually by definition; the assumption that the regulatory moment is
   the crucial moment in regulatory design; and the belief that regulation
   somehow sits outside innovation and can be untouched by it. I argue that
   effective regulation of private sector innovation requires a clearer and
   more nuanced understanding of innovation, and engagement with the
   normative choices underpinning innovation-framing regulation.},

Abstract = {Why do governments choose multilateralism? We examine a principal-agent
   model in which states trade some control over the policy for greater
   burden sharing. The theory generates observable hypotheses regarding the
   reasons for and the patterns of support and opposition to
   multilateralism. To focus our study, we analyze support for bilateral
   and multilateral foreign aid giving in the US. Using new survey data, we
   provide evidence about the correlates of public and elite support for
   multilateral engagement. We find weak support for multilateralism and
   deep partisan divisions. Reflecting elite discourse, public opinion
   divides over two competing rationales-burden sharing and control-when
   faced with the choice between multilateral and bilateral aid channels.
   As domestic groups' preferences over aid policy diverge from those of
   the multilateral institution, maintaining control over aid policy
   becomes more salient and support for multilateralism falls.},

Abstract = {Human rights indicators are an instrument that has received great
   attention in recent years. They provide a way of monitoring compliance
   with international human rights treaties with a view to evaluating
   progress towards the realization of human rights. However, most sets of
   human rights indicators have never been applied. Although there are a
   few examples of using such indicators, discussions on them seem not to
   leave the conceptual sphere, a problem which to date has not been
   discussed. This policy note aims to provide a methodology for developing
   human rights indicators with a view to their subsequent application and
   to elaborate strategies to facilitate this application.
   The paper is divided into three sections. The first section examines the
   origin, purpose and evolution of human rights indicators. The second
   section concerns the development of human rights indicators. After
   examining the reasons for their infrequent application, it proposes a
   methodology for their development divided into different steps, and then
   applies this methodology to the right to education. The third section
   discusses questions to be addressed in order to facilitate the
   application of human rights indicators.},

Abstract = {The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) and the Committee of
   the Regions (CoR) are two advisory bodies of the European Union involved
   in a broad array of policy areas. However, little is known about the
   effects of the two committees on the positions of the other institutions

   under what conditions the CoR and the EESC can exert influence. Based on
   a comprehensive survey conducted in 2010, a series of hypotheses derived
   from a neo-institutionalism framework are tested. It is found that
   consultative committees are not very influential overall. Nevertheless,
   they can exert influence under certain scope conditions, including the
   speed with which they produce recommendations, the quality of the
   recommendations and the resonance with the addressees' prior beliefs.},

Abstract = {There has been considerable growth in the past few years in the number
   and size of Nigerian companies providing services to the oil and gas
   industry. The capacity of these companies, enhanced by local content
   policy, will not only create economic development in the industry, but
   will also likely boost the development of Nigeria's manufacturing and
   service economies. While Nigerian content' faces many challenges in
   terms of implementation, it has made and will continue to make a
   significant impact on the economy of Nigeria and may also be making a
   significant impact on the political economy. Powerful interests have
   helped ensure that the Nigerian elite will be the primary beneficiaries
   of Nigerian content. Through interviews and case studies, this article
   argues that by embracing Nigerian content as a new strategy of
   accumulation, the elite are creating more capitalistic social relations
   of production in Nigeria.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},

Volume = {28},
Number = {5},
Pages = {678-693},
Abstract = {Intelligence is widely misunderstood. Too much is made of secrecy, and
   of covert operations and counter-intelligence ( action domains informed
   by intelligence rather than integral to it). Intelligence is often
   focused on threats, missing opportunities for advantage. A standard
   definition is proposed for better understanding of intelligence by the
   academy, media and public. Intelligence is a corporate capability to
   forecast change in time to do something about it. The capability
   involves foresight and insight, and is intended to identify impending
   change which may be positive, representing opportunity, or negative,
   representing threat. Definitions which converge with this proposal are
   found in several intelligence settings.},

Volume = {28},

Pages = {547-565},
Abstract = {The 9/11 attacks and the subsequent increase of counterterrorism laws
   and regulations in Western democracies have also spurned heavy debates
   on torture and ill-treatment of captured terrorist suspects. However,
   while the Netherlands did deploy troops to Afghanistan and adopted new
   laws and policies regarding counterterrorism, debates on torture
   remained marginal. Indeed, the Netherlands has not suffered the pressure
   of a constant high terrorist threat, or endured a catastrophic terrorist
   attack. However, the author argues that there are more reasons for the
   lack of heated discussions. While this article does not intend to lift
   the Dutch case to an exemplary one, it illustrates how Dutch government
   authorities made good use of the benefits of hindsight regarding torture
   debates and incidents elsewhere and were able to apply lessons regarding
   accountability and oversight concerning interrogation issues at home
   successfully.},

Abstract = {Purpose - Educating active citizens engaged in civic life is a critical
   goal of citizenship education. This study examines how citizenship
   education is practiced in three public high schools in the City of
   Ottawa, Canada, and how teachers through their instruction prepare their
   students for active citizenship.
   Design - This investigation draws on citizenship theories and an
   examination of citizenship pedagogy through observations of class
   instruction and interviews with teachers and students.
   Findings - The research shows that despite shared provincial guidelines,
   in practice, there are dramatic differences in the design and provision
   of citizenship instruction across classrooms, shaped largely by
   teachers' understandings of what constitutes active citizenship. I
   detail three distinct understandings of active citizenship that are
   advanced through class instruction: the duty-based, the
   make-a-difference, and the politically oriented active citizenship.
   Value - The article discusses important implications that these
   differing understandings and pedagogical approaches have as they
   delineate different expectations and paths for youth citizenship
   participation in public life.},

Abstract = {Since the late 1990s, much scholarly work has been done in the field of
   Euroscepticism in terms of mapping and conceptualizing different types
   of opposition to the process of European integration. But even though
   studies examining Euroscepticism in the EU are plentiful, the lack of
   insight into different types of Euroscepticism in non-Member States is
   striking: there is very little research which considers the extent to
   which there are different varieties of Euroscepticism in the European
   states that have chosen non-membership of the Union. What is
   Euroscepticism in these countries, and why are the Icelanders,
   Norwegians and Swiss so Eurosceptic? The article looks at how
   Euroscepticism plays out in Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. It examines
   what Euroscepticism is and why it occurs in these countries, using a
   framework for analyzing Euroscepticism based on the concepts of
   economic, political, post-materialist value-based, right-wing
   value-based, cultural and rural society Euroscepticism.},

Abstract = {The focus of the article is to use the changed landscape of
   Euroscepticism to look broadly across a set of cases of government
   participation by parties holding Eurosceptical positions to examine
   whether government participation has an effect on their European
   positions and whether participation by Eurosceptic parties in government
   has had an effect on their European policy. In general, while there does
   seem to be a moderating effect of government participation on a party's
   Euroscepticism, there are notable cases of Eurosceptic party
   participation in government having some discernible impact on policy,
   but under somewhat specific conditions. The impact is clearly different
   for major and minor parties and, in the case of the latter, moderating
   their Euroscepticism is often a signifier of a wider process of party
   mainstreaming. In some cases, while parties continue to use Eurosceptic
   rhetoric when in office, this does not appear to translate into
   substantial policy change.},

Abstract = {Much of the International Relations literature assumes that there is a
   ``depth versus participation{''} dilemma in international politics:
   shallower international agreements attract more countries and greater
   depth is associated with less participation. We argue that this
   conjecture is too simple and probably misleading because the depth of
   any given cooperative effort is in fact multidimensional. This
   multidimensionality manifests itself in the design characteristics of
   international agreements: in particular, the specificity of obligations,
   monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, dispute settlement mechanisms,
   positive incentives (assistance), and organizational structures
   (secretariats). We theorize that the first three of these design
   characteristics have negative and the latter three have positive effects
   on participation in international cooperative efforts. Our empirical
   testing of these claims relies on a dataset that covers more than 200
   global environmental treaties. We find a participation-limiting effect
   for the specificity of obligations, but not for monitoring and
   enforcement. In contrast, we observe that assistance provisions in
   treaties have a significant and substantial positive effect on
   participation. Similarly, dispute settlement mechanisms tend to promote
   treaty participation. The main implication of our study is that
   countries do not appear to stay away from agreements with monitoring and
   enforcement provisions, but that the inclusion of positive incentives
   and dispute settlement mechanisms can promote international cooperation.
   In other words, our findings suggest that policymakers do not
   necessarily need to water down global treaties in order to obtain more
   participation.},

Abstract = {This article represents the first major analysis of the appearance of
   the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the James Bond novels of
   British spy fiction writer Ian Fleming. The article shows that Fleming
   was remarkably influential during the early Cold War in establishing the
   public profile of the CIA. The novels, which include Manifold references
   to the agency and its staff, were published at a time when the CIA kept
   out of the public limelight and when other cultural forms, including
   Hollywood, refrained from making too much fanfare about intelligence
   matters. Drawing on recently declassified material, including the papers
   of fabled CIA Director Allen Dulles, the article demonstrates that the
   agency took a keen interest in Bond, even drawing inspiration from his
   adventures and the novels' depictions of technology.},

   (referred to in Spanish as IM-Defensoras) during its two years of
   building solidarity, protection and self-care networks among women human

   for the contributions made by WHRDs to the promotion of human and
   community rights; describes WHRD experiences of violence and rights
   violations; and outlines the history, characteristics and strategies of
   IM-Defensoras. The paper concludes by noting key achievements and
   identifying ongoing challenges for IM-Defensoras, namely the need to
   develop safe spaces that allow women to defend human rights, develop
   responses that address the specific protection needs of WHRDs, and
   redefine existing protection and security strategies within a feminist
   framework.},

Abstract = {In April 2012 the Mexican Congress unanimously approved the Law for the
   Protection of Human Rights Defenders and Journalists, mandating the
   creation of a Protection Mechanism to provide protective and preventive
   measures to those defenders and journalists at risk. After more than
   three years of work by civil society organizations, the Law provides
   certain tools to tackle many of the particular issues of concern that
   have permitted different authorities to make excuses for the lack of
   protection. Although many challenges still remain, some lessons can be
   learned from the Mexican process which could be further analysed and
   adapted to other countries where human rights defenders are at risk. In
   particular, the obligation to prevent and the inclusion of civil society
   throughout the whole process make the Mexican Mechanism unique.},

Abstract = {After the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks established revolutionary
   tribunals to judge counter-revolutionary' and political' crimes. Amid
   conflicting reports from contemporaries on the effectiveness of these
   new courts, this essay examines their development over the first year of
   their existence. It argues that whilst tribunals were initially too
   inefficient for the regime, forcing greater central control over them,
   they played an important role in defining what constituted
   counter-revolution. In doing so, they promoted the regime's ideology,
   imparted an image of legality to the regime's actions, and helped the
   Bolsheviks to exert their control over a fragmented and diverse
   political landscape.},

Abstract = {A Tokyo-based economist and a noted western economic geographer, both
   specializing in the hydrocarbon resources of Russia, apply the framework
   of governance studies in an effort to gain a deeper understanding of the
   recent changes in the country's energy policy-making. The authors argue
   that, unlike the international relations paradigm prevailing in studies
   of Russia's energy policy, the country's multiple roles in the
   international energy arena (as producer, consumer, exporter, importer,
   and transit state) warrant a more nuanced approach, reflecting Russian
   energy policy's flexibility over time and diversity across space. This
   paper endeavors, therefore, to apply a political economy and governance
   perspective to an understanding of the significant changes in Russia's
   energy policy-making regarding its dynamic energy relations with the
   Northeast Asia (NEA; China, Japan, and South Korea). In exploring the
   complex interactions between Russia's internal energy policy-making and
   its emerging energy relations in NEA, the authors addresses three key
   questions, namely: (1) how Russia's Asian energy policy corresponds to
   its domestic needs, (2) how much coherence in energy governance and
   cooperation exists between Russia and the Northeast Asian states at the
   institutional and organizational levels, and (3) the extent to which
   Russia's expectations for increased energy cooperation with the
   Northeast Asian states are likely to materialize.},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Ex ante policy appraisals, such as Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIAs),
   are promoted because they are expected to inform decisionmakers and,
   thus, to lead to better quality regulation. Such instrumental use is not
   the only possible use of RIAs. Ex ante policy appraisal can affect the
   policy process in various ways. However, a consolidated theory on the
   conditions for utilization of RIAs in the policy process has yet to be
   developed. In order to explore these conditions, we analyze three case
   studies of Swiss decisionmaking processes and apply concepts from
   knowledge utilization literature. In conclusion, we find that policy
   arenas matter more than the institutional context and design of RIA
   procedures. In line with previous literature, political use seems to be
   a prevalent type of utilization. Yet we find that, under specific
   conditions, RIAs also provide a basis for the optimization of policy
   designs (instrumental use), help improve interagency relations
   (policy-process use), and may change how a policy issue is understood
   (conceptual use).},

Abstract = {This article draws on ethnographic research into a state-funded homecare
   service in rural Russia. The article discusses intersections between
   care, work and kinship in the relationships between homecare workers and
   their elderly wards and explores the ways in which references to
   kinship, as a means of authenticating paid care and explaining its
   emotional content, reinforce public and private oppositions while doing
   little to relieve the tensions and conflicts of care work. The
   discussion brings together detailed empirical insights into local
   ideologies and practices as a way of generating new theoretical
   perspectives, which will be of relevance beyond the particular context
   of study.},

Abstract = {The U.S. prison and jail population has grown fivefold in the 40 years
   since the early 1970s. The aggregate consequences of the growth in the
   penal system are widely claimed but have not been closely studied. We
   survey evidence for the aggregate relationship among the incarceration
   rate, employment rates, single-parenthood, public opinion, and crime.
   Employment among very low-skilled men has declined with rising
   incarceration. Punitive sentiment in public opinion has also softened as
   imprisonment increased. Single-parenthood and crime rates, however, are
   not systematically related to incarceration. We conclude with a
   discussion of the conceptual and empirical challenges that come with
   assessing the aggregate effects of mass incarceration on American
   poverty.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the evolution, content, and fate of the
   back-channel negotiations between senior Soviet and Japanese officials
   in 1989-1990, a time of radical changes in most aspects of Soviet
   foreign policy. Sources that have recently become available especially
   the private papers of Aleksandr Yakovlev and Anatolii Chernyaev and
   several recently published collections of documents not only confirm
   what has long been suspected about this critical channel of negotiation
   but shed valuable light on motives and complications in Moscow that
   precipitated the channel's ultimate failure. Because Japanese documents
   on the matter have not yet been declassified, the article cannot offer a
   full account of these talks, but the Soviet documents are sufficient to
   indicate why a bilateral rapprochement has been so elusive.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate the representation of Mikhail
   Gorbachev in contemporary Russian media discourse. Attention is paid to
   Gorbachev's social roles and activities as well as his personality, as
   presented in Russian news texts. The empirical data were collected over
   the period from 2000 to 2009 from seven major Russian newspapers.
   According to these data, a dual relationship to Gorbachev exists: in the
   West he is an honoured politician with a high profile, whereas in Russia
   the attitude towards him is ambivalent. In most texts he is represented
   as a once important political actor.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a theoretically-informed and empirically-grounded
   cognitive approach to analyse how financial elites from China, the Gulf
   Cooperation Council states and Brazil interpret the euro vs. dollar
   debate. At the theoretical level, we argue that the debate should be
   reframed in order to capture not only the material, but also the
   ideational footprint of the euro, as well as to better conceptualise
   change in the International Monetary System (IMS). Our empirical work
   shows that the euro is perceived by financial elites as a useful
   diversification tool to avoid over-exposure to dollar weaknesses.
   However, despite its appeal as a valuable investment alternative, the
   European currency has a series of structural flaws that prevent it from
   substituting the dollar as the main international currency. Therefore,
   in purely material terms, the euro-sceptical literature is correct.
   However, we also find that the hitherto material inroads of the euro,
   while limited, have been sufficient to ideationally convince these
   elites that a multicurrency IMS is possible and might be more stable
   (and therefore preferable) to current dollar unipolarity. Therefore, the
   euro-optimist literature is far from wrong when it argues that the
   creation of the euro represents a challenge to the greenback, for it
   could be a stepping stone towards the formation of a multipolar IMS.},

Abstract = {The Great Recession tested the ability of the great U.S. jobs machine to
   limit the severity of unemployment in a major economic downturn and to
   restore full employment quickly afterward. In the crisis the American
   labor market failed to live up to expectations. The level and duration
   of unemployment increased substantially in the downturn, and the growth
   of jobs was slow and anemic in the recovery. This article documents
   these failures and their consequences for workers. The U.S. performance
   in the Great Recession contravenes conventional views of the virtues of
   market-driven flexibility compared to institution-driven labor
   adjustments and the notion that weak labor institutions and greater
   market flexibility offer the best road to economic success in a modern
   capitalist economy.},

Abstract = {This article argues that without an attempt to clarify the distinctions
   among transitional justice, jus post bellum and international criminal
   law, none of these concepts will reach its potential. If transitional
   justice is made so elastic as implicitly to absorb international
   criminal law and jus post bellum, this lessens the potential value of
   transitional justice as a discrete, focused practice. After providing an
   empirical analysis of the usage of the concepts and reviewing the
   historical foundations of the terms, the article analyses how each
   operates in practice over time. It then examines how the concepts could
   have been applied to work together in recent Cambodian history.},

Abstract = {Breastfeeding is a uniquely embodied part of parenting. It is a
   time-consuming task that is fundamentally centered on mothers' bodies
   for as long as breastfeeding occurs, which may be weeks, months, one
   year, or much longer. In this article I argue that an enhanced and
   sustained research focus on the embodied dimensions of breastfeeding has
   the potential to raise questions and provide insights about
   breastfeeding initiation and duration, a major concern of policymakers
   and others. Three underexplored areas of research into the embodied
   aspects of breastfeeding include lactation activism (lactivism), the
   dyadic (mother-child/children) body work of breastfeeding, and the
   efforts and beliefs of the professionals who support mothers as they
   initiate and continue to breastfeed. Accomplishing reproductive justice
   for all women requires developing a deeper understanding of variations
   in the social and individual context for the embodied practice of
   breastfeeding and using this knowledge to create effective social
   policies.},

Title = {From disguised protectionism to rewarding regulation: The impact of
   trade-related labor standards in the Dominican Republic},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {299-320},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Policymakers in the Dominican Republic have responded to foreign
   pressure by rewriting their labor laws and revitalizing their labor
   ministry. What are the likely consequences? Is aggressive labor law
   enforcement more likely to protect vulnerable workers from abuse and
   exploitation or to undermine their ability to compete for
   labor-intensive employment in an unforgiving world economy? And what are
   the broader implications of the answer? I address these questions by
   analyzing qualitative as well as quantitative data on workplace
   regulators empowered by the Dominican Republic in response to
   trade-related labor standards imposed by the United States and find that
   they reconcile social protection with economic adjustment by
   simultaneously discouraging `` low road{''} employment practices like
   informality, union-busting, and the exploitation of child labor, and
   encouraging `` high road{''} alternatives that link firms, farms, and
   families, on the one hand, to public educational, training, and
   financial institutions, on the other. The result is a potentially
   inclusive alternative to the repressive industrial relations regime that
   fueled export-led development -and the East Asian `` miracle{''} in
   particular -in the late twentieth century.},

Abstract = {Energy efficiency has long since been a pillar of the European internal
   energy policy. It now takes on increasing importance in European
   external energy relations. It is, for instance, key to the EU-Russian
   Energy Dialogue. I analyse how energy efficiency has been
   institutionalised in EU external energy relations, in particular towards
   Russia. I examine whether energy efficiency can be seen as a new
   paradigm for understanding external energy relations. Based on this
   conceptual delimitation, I describe and assess the regulatory mechanisms
   proposed by the EU to implement this approach in practice.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the domestic politics of financial
   internationalization. Financial internationalization has two components,
   the liberalization of cross-border capital flows and the liberalization
   of foreign ownership restrictions, yet most research to date has
   concentrated exclusively on the former. Building on existing theoretical
   work, this paper argues that in the developing world, domestic finance
   favors the joint abolition of restrictions on the inflow of foreign
   capital alongside continued restrictions on the ability of foreigners to
   own and operate domestic financial institutions. I test the argument on
   a unique dataset of foreign entry restrictions in developing economies
   and by examining interest group pressures for financial
   internationalization in Indonesia and Mexico. The findings complement
   and extend recent work on financial internationalization in the
   developing world and suggest further areas for research in the role of
   domestic interest group preferences for global economic integration.},

Abstract = {This article uses the informal governance framework to elucidate the
   connection between regime transition and participation in regional
   international organizations (IOs). In particular, this study focuses on
   non-democratic regional IOs and examines the empirical case of the
   Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). We investigate how the level
   of regime transition of each CIS member state affects its participation
   in the CIS. The paper utilizes an original dataset that contains
   information regarding the number of CIS-related agreements that have
   been signed by each CIS member state during the 1991-2010 time period,
   which can be used to measure the level of participation of each state in
   the CIS. We find that states with a lower level of democratization and a
   higher level of marketization are more likely to participate in
   agreements within the CIS. The paper contributes to the wider
   application of informal governance framework by demonstrating the
   usefulness of these theories for understanding the nature and dynamics
   of regional IOs, such as the CIS.},

Abstract = {States often create international institutions that impose legally
   binding rules on member states, and then do not even attempt to enforce
   these rules. Why? In this article, we present a game-theoretic model of
   moribund hard law in international institutions. We show that if some
   states face domestic pressure to negotiate a hard law treaty, their
   incentive to insist on hard law in the negotiations is maximized when
   less enthusiastic states expect that the hard law will probably not be
   enforced. Domestic proponents of hard law reward states for negotiating
   a hard law treaty, while states that oppose hard law can accept it
   because they expect no enforcement. As a form of informal governance,
   moribund hard law allows non-compliance by design.},

Abstract = {There can be no question that 2011 marked a turning point for Japan in
   many respects. In addition to the immediate environmental, health, and
   social consequences of the earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear crisis, the
   disaster will have profound political implications. This paper
   investigates the significance of these effects in one area:
   Russian-Japanese relations. Specifically, it is asked whether, in
   combination with pre-existing economic and strategic incentives, the
   closure of Japan's nuclear plants and resulting need to secure abundant
   new supplies of energy will finally prompt a sustained warming in ties
   between Japan and its resource-rich northern neighbor. The merits of
   this proposal are evaluated through close examination of developments in
   the energy and political fields between March 2011 and February 2013.
   Findings indicate that there has indeed been a significant increase in
   energy ties, accompanied by a remarkable turnaround in political
   relations. This demonstrates that large-scale improvements in this
   relationship can quickly be achieved when the incentives are right,
   although whether such progress can be translated into resolution of the
   territorial dispute remains doubtful.},

Abstract = {Social or public housing is an important component of the housing supply
   in most European countries. Nowhere, however, has the notion of social
   housing been taken as far as in the countries that formerly were ruled
   by socialist regimes, most notably the Soviet Union. For this reason, it
   may be argued that the development of theorizations on housing has much
   to learn from this large but inconclusively studied example. One of the
   avowed virtues of socialism was that the system, in theory, guaranteed
   its subjects equal rights to housing. That this was not quite the case
   is well known in the literature, but in fact no robust evidence to
   support this view (or the contrary) has been presented so far.
   Therefore, this paper's aim is to investigate the functioning of the
   Soviet system of housing allocation, assessing its claims to social
   equity and justice. Based on a detailed case study of about 3500
   Soviet-era housing allocation decisions made in Daugavpils, Latvia, at
   five points in time covering various stages in the development of Soviet
   power (full coverage of decisions made in 1953, 1960, 1970, 1980, and
   January-April 1990), we illustrate how much living space was allocated
   to whom. In addition, we detail the characteristics of the waiting times
   involved. We apply both descriptive and regression methods on our
   data-set, making a significant contribution to what is known about the
   outcome of housing allocation under socialism and, at a more general
   level, under strictly supply-constrained conditions.},

Abstract = {In the 20 or so years since transitional justice first emerged as a
   field of practice, its objectives and the contexts in which it is
   applied have expanded greatly. However, its dual role of acknowledging
   the commission of past violence and human rights violations and seeking
   to prevent their recurrence remains central. Recent scholarship has
   begun to explore the impact of transitional justice in practice and also
   to critique its purported narrow focus on civil and political rights.
   Recommendations have emerged that transitional justice should address a
   broader range of violations, such as violations of economic, social and
   cultural rights, on the basis that this would more appropriately
   acknowledge the full ambit of past violence and also provide a stronger
   basis for preventing a return to the violence of the past. Through the
   case study of torture, this article suggests that before expanding,
   stock should be taken of transitional justice's current contribution to
   prevention. It suggests that while transitional justice has generally
   prioritized certain types of torture, it has not taken a preventative
   approach by failing to identify and analyse the full extent of the
   practice and the way in which it supports institutional structures. The
   article assesses the extent to which transitional justice can overcome
   these deficiencies and proposes a possible framework for doing so.},

Abstract = {Following the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual
   Property Rights (TRIPS) intellectual property rights, and more
   specifically copyright, have become the subject of highly politicized
   conflicts. In this paper we analyze how these conflicts shifted from the
   political arena to private standard-setting sites, where two opposing
   coalitions of actors pursued competing initiatives an industry coalition
   which aimed at enforcing copyright protection through Digital Rights
   Management and an emerging coalition of civil society actors which
   sought to develop a digital commons based on copyleft licenses.
   Paradoxically, the industry coalition, which had very successfully
   lobbied international organizations, ran into trouble developing and
   enforcing private regulation in the market place, while the civil
   society coalition proved to be more effective in the market than in the
   political sphere. The findings of our analysis indicate that the
   strategic use of organizational forms and collective action frames can
   be more decisive for the mobilization of users than material resources,
   and that the success of collective action frames depends on their
   compatibility with user practices. Based on the argument that regime
   shifting from intergovernmental to private governance can open up new
   and favorable spaces for weak actors to experiment with alternative
   forms of regulation, the paper contributes to the literature on the
   politics of regime complexity. The paper furthermore highlights the
   importance of studying non-elite actors and their day-to-day practices
   to gain a better understanding of changes within the international
   political economy.},

Abstract = {Most existing studies on the role of business in global governance
   conceive of business as one group acting vis-a-vis the state or NGOs.
   This article highlights that conflicts within the business community can
   be an important factor to explain policy outcomes. Drawing on the
   business conflict school literature from International Relations,
   studies on the politics of markets developed in Economic Sociology, and
   work on corporate political strategy undertaken in Management Studies,
   it develops the concept of the governance-competitiveness nexus to
   theorize how economic competition translates into political competition.
   The article demonstrates how such an analytical angle can add to our
   understanding of the global governance of intellectual property rights
   for pharmaceuticals. It helps explain the motives of different actors to
   become politically involved at specific points in time and the policy
   goals they promoted. Thus, the concepts of business conflict and
   governance-competitiveness nexus help explain the agenda setting process
   on global pharmaceutical IP governance.},

   American Policy},
Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {566-590},
Abstract = {This article reviews the central tenets of selection, training,
   doctrine, and organization in Israeli interrogation to suggest how the
   United States might learn from the Israeli experience. There is
   relatively little in the open literature on these particular issues of
   training and approach in Israel. The contrast between Israeli and US
   approaches raises questions about the effectiveness of US interrogation
   and suggests how the US might better use skill and cunning toward an
   effective, legal, and ethical American policy on interrogation. By
   themselves, professionalism and skill do not prevent torture, but they
   can provide an effective alternative to it. A change in American policy
   is essential, to counter pressures in Congress and elsewhere to sanction
   the use of torture in response to new terrorist threats.},

Abstract = {The article argues that signals intelligence was an organizational
   accomplishment in the sense of requiring a) the establishment of an
   independent organization and b) that this organization combine
   cryptanalysis with intelligence analysis, traffic analysis and
   interception. This was not pre-ordained but the outcome of specific
   conflicts and decisions at Bletchley Park during the first three years
   of the Second World War which transformed the Government Code and Cypher
   School from a cryptanalytical bureau to a fully-fledged signals
   intelligence agency. Detailed archival evidence is presented in support
   of this claim.},

Abstract = {In 1878, Britain developed the first systematic intelligence collection
   and analysis of China by a Western nation. Undertaken in response to
   intelligence failure and military defeat, the British Army in India
   established an intelligence section in Beijing using small numbers of
   Chinese-speaking British military officers. Their reports reveal their
   struggles to understand a culture and government radically different
   than their own and express a strong respect for Chinese military
   capabilities. The intelligence reports produced are a unique window into
   British history, intelligence practices and Chinese strategic thinking.},

Title = {MEXICAN IMMIGRANT CHILDREN AND YOUTH'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO A COMMUNITY
   CENTRO: EXPLORING CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND CITIZEN CONSTRUCTIONS},
Booktitle = {YOUTH ENGAGEMENT: THE CIVIC-POLITICAL LIVES OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH},
Series = {Sociological Studies of Children and Youth},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {16},
Pages = {177-200},
Abstract = {Purpose - The present study looks at the dynamic process of Mexican
   immigrant children and youth's civic engagement through their
   participation in community and family activities. In particular, it
   explores how their collaboration in a grassroots, immigrant
   community-based Centro in New York City allows for civic engagement. We
   demonstrate how active community participation, in the form of civic
   engagement, shapes children and youth's citizenship constructions.
   Methodology - Based on extensive participant observations and focus
   group interviews, this article demonstrates how children and youth's
   civic engagement is mediated by their integration and contributions to
   family and community civic activities and how these activities inform
   children and youth's knowledge of citizenship discourse. We present
   evidence that demonstrates that children and youth's involvement and
   participation in protests, rallies, volunteer activities, as well as the
   creation of a booklet, associated with immigration, human rights, and
   social justice, organized through the Centro Guadalupano, facilitated
   their knowledge about illegality and citizenship issues.
   Findings - Findings suggest that when indigenous Mexican children and
   youth are integrated into the important activities of their community,
   as active and engaged members, they develop a deeper understanding of
   civic engagement and what it means to be a participatory ``citizen.''
   Research implications - The present study provides a starting point for
   future research on the importance of and possibilities for child and
   youth civic engagement in grassroots community organizations. For
   example, children and youth learn that through active civic
   participation and community contributions, they are able to challenge
   dominant discourse on immigration, human rights, and citizenship. This
   study sheds light on the value of involving children and youth in civic
   engagement opportunities - a process that can facilitate the
   construction of citizenship among marginalized groups, particularly
   undocumented Mexican immigrants from indigenous regions.
   Value - The findings presented extend broader discourses on the politics
   of immigration and citizenship, and also challenge, to some extent,
   mainstream constructions of children and youth. More research in these
   areas is needed; our paper is a small contribution to the emerging field
   of indigenous and immigrant children and youth's political socialization
   and activism.},

   its performance in this area does not conform to pessimistic scenarios
   of post-accession compliance. A key positive factor affecting the
   implementation of EU environmental policy in the Czech Republic, and a
   major reason for optimism about future Czech compliance with EU
   environmental law, is the active role of Czech environmental NGOs in the

Title = {A Monstrous Hybrid: The Political Economy of Housing in Early
   Twenty-first Century Sweden},

Abstract = {In the leftist Western political imagination, Sweden continues, for
   many, to represent a vision of a better', more egalitarian
   political-economic model than the neoliberal capitalism that has come to
   dominate the Anglo-American world in particular; and its housing system
   is widely regarded as an integral component of this alternative,
   social-democratic model. The present paper argues that this envisioning
   of the political economy of Swedish housing is thoroughly outdated. Yet
   it insists, equally, that the competing envisioning of Swedish housing
   advanced by prominent scholars within Sweden - of a radically
   (neo)liberalised domestic housing system - is not accurate either.
   Rather, Swedish housing in the early twenty-first century constitutes a
   complex hybrid of legacy regulated elements on the one hand and
   neoliberalised elements on the other. Recognising this hybridity is
   essential, the paper submits, to understanding the nature and source of
   the most pressing issues facing the Swedish housing sector today. The
   system's hybridity, moreover, is monstrous' - following Jane Jacobs's
   coining of the term - in the sense that those issues reveal the pivotal
   role currently played by the Swedish housing system in the creation,
   reproduction and intensification of socio-economic inequality.},

Abstract = {In recent years, global corporations and national governments have been
   enacting a growing number of codes of conduct and public regulations to
   combat dangerous and degrading work conditions in global supply chains.
   At the receiving end of this activity, local producers must contend with
   multiple regulatory regimes, but it is unclear how these regimes
   interact and what results, if any, they produce. This article examines
   this dynamic in the sugar sector in Brazil. It finds that although
   private and public agents rarely communicate, let alone coordinate with
   one another, they nevertheless reinforce each other's actions. Public
   regulators use their legal powers to outlaw extreme forms of
   outsourcing. Private auditors use the trust they command as company
   insiders to instigate a process of workplace transformation that
   facilitates compliance. Together, their parallel actions block the low
   road and guide targeted firms to a higher road in which improved labor
   standards are not only possible but even desirable.},

Abstract = {Plunging tax revenues and soaring social program demand during the Great
   Recession created state budget shortfalls of historic magnitude. After
   reviewing states' aggregate reaction to the economic downturn, we
   conduct an original analysis of the recession's budgetary impact on the
   states and their policy responses. Economic factors such as falling
   personal income and home values explain much of the variation in the
   recession's impact. State budgeting rules and practices conditioned
   states' experiences, but not always as intended: budget gaps were
   smaller in states with stricter balanced budget requirements, but larger
   in states with statutory spending limitations. Personal income tax
   increases were more likely in states with a Democratic legislature or
   greater public unionization rates, while midyear spending cuts were
   smaller in states with larger public sector unions. In sum, we find that
   while states' objective economic situations determined the bulk of their
   responses to the Great Recession, political factors determined these
   responses' shape and form.},

Abstract = {This article develops a framework for understanding what international
   criminal justice (ICJ) is, how it works and why it is arguably the most
   influential approach to transitional justice. More than just a mechanism
   in transitional justice's toolkit, ICJ is a `field' in itself that has
   developed at the intersection of three other well-established global
   fields: interstate diplomacy, criminal justice and human rights
   advocacy. ICJ draws on the rules and practices of these fields,
   operating as a central site for the use and exchange of the delegated,
   legal, moral and expert authority active in them. It can thus mobilize
   authority in ways that make it more powerful at a global level than
   `place-based' approaches to transitional justice. We illustrate this
   through a discussion of the victim of international crimes - a figure
   integral to the rules of ICJ and an increasing focus of the field,
   despite the fact that victims wield very little authority within the
   field.},

Abstract = {Since the end of the second Chechen conflict,(1) Russian authorities
   have struggled to contain the spread of Islamic extremism across
   Russia's entire North Caucasus region, especially in Chechnya,
   Ingushetia, Dagestan and Kabardino - Balkaria. Grave human rights
   violations in the course of counter-terrorism operations in these
   regions have been widely documented during the second Chechen conflict
   and its aftermath.(2) While international non-governmental organizations
   (NGOs) and intergovernmental bodies have long been concerned about the
   level of impunity for human rights violations in the North Caucasus, the
   murder of a well-known Chechen human rights activist in July 2009
   prompted an equally strong focus on the security of human rights
   defenders (HRDs) working in this region. This paper first discusses
   several issues related to the protection of HRDs, specifically: the
   provision of security trainings; the application of the term `HRD'; the
   adoption of `tracking' technology; the need for an integrated
   understanding of `security'; the importance of recognizing threats by
   non-state actors; the specific needs of women HRDs; and the
   effectiveness of evacuation. Finally, this paper presents questions on
   the sustainability of the one security model implemented thus far in a
   situation in which human rights work is simply too risky for local
   defenders to undertake.},

Abstract = {The collapse of the labor, housing, and stock markets beginning in 2007
   created unprecedented challenges for American families. This study
   examines disparities in wealth holdings leading up to the Great
   Recession and during the first years of the recovery. All socioeconomic
   groups experienced declines in wealth following the recession, with
   higher wealth families experiencing larger absolute declines. In
   percentage terms, however, the declines were greater for less advantaged
   groups as measured by minority status, education, and prerecession
   income and wealth, leading to a substantial rise in wealth inequality in
   just a few years. Despite large changes in wealth, longitudinal analyses
   demonstrate little change in mobility in the ranking of particular
   families in the wealth distribution. Between 2007 and 2011, one-fourth
   of American families lost at least 75 percent of their wealth, and more
   than half of all families lost at least 25 percent of their wealth.
   Multivariate longitudinal analyses document that these large relative
   losses were disproportionally concentrated among lower-income, less
   educated, and minority households.},

Abstract = {Some commentators have claimed that breastfeeding benefits are
   overstated or that breastfeeding is not the cause of the improved health
   outcomes. In 2007, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)
   issued a definitive report summarizing the body of evidence on various
   maternal and infant health outcomes in developed countries. The weight
   of this and subsequent evidence supports an association between
   breastfeeding and health outcomes in mothers and infants. While
   confounding factors exist, this association is likely to be causal for
   many or most of these conditions based on the Bradford Hill criteria for
   causation. Policy discussions need to consider the substantial maternal
   health effects of breastfeeding.},

Abstract = {Criticism of trade and investment liberalisation (TAIL) in North America
   has drawn attention to weak economic performance, wage-profit
   redistribution, social dumping and fiscal pressure on government
   programmes as evidence that the TAIL regime has failed to deliver on
   some of its key promises. This criticism has been unable, however, to
   establish satisfactory conceptual and empirical connections between the
   dramatic distributional changes witnessed in the TAIL era and the
   institutional reorganisation of power that the TAIL regime entrenched.
   This article will undertake a quantitative assessment of the Canadian
   political economy to see who the main beneficiaries of the TAIL era have
   been, contrasting returns to labour and to capital in the pre-TAIL and
   TAIL eras. Employing tools from the capital as power framework, two
   pictures are painted: the first picture examines broad changes in the
   distribution of income and the second examines differential business
   performance. The evidence from this inquiry suggests that although the
   official purpose of TAIL was to enhance the prosperity of all Canadians,
   this trade deal actually represented - both in its intentions and
   consequences - a political-economic transformation written by dominant
   capital for dominant capital.},

Title = {Foreign Exchange Accumulation and the Entrapment of Chinese Monetary
   Power: Towards a Balanced Growth Regime?},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {5},
Pages = {680-714},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {This article criticises the notion that China's foreign exchange
   reserves have strengthened its monetary power. While some scholars have
   argued that China's international monetary influence has been entrapped'
   by the domestic interests of its export sector, a one-sided focus on the
   export sector fails to identify the significant constraints on its
   macroeconomic autonomy. This article proposes an extension of the
   concept of entrapment that draws attention to the key role of
   state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and their domestic fixed-asset investment
   in its growth regime: China's external monetary dependency - which is
   understood as both export dependency and the need to maintain foreign
   exchange accumulation - has been caused by a disparity between
   fixed-asset investment and private consumption that reflects a
   redistribution of income from the household sector to the SOE sector. In
   particular, I expose the SOE sector's rising interests in foreign
   exchange accumulation by uncovering a mutually reinforcing dynamic
   between China's external monetary dependence and the financial
   repression of its banking system. By entrenching an investment-led
   growth regime that provides key benefits the SOE sector, this dynamic is
   found to have seriously constrained the macroeconomic policy autonomy of
   Chinese authorities to rebalance growth away from investments and
   exports towards private consumption.},

Abstract = {This essay explores repressions against Zionist political parties in
   Soviet Ukraine in the 1920s, and considers the formation of an efficient
   synergetic structure of Soviet secret organs in Moscow and Ukraine. The
   narrative identifies participants from central and regional secret
   departments who engaged in systematic mass operations against Zionists,
   and reveals that despite Moscow's initial vacillation between tolerance
   and persecution of Zionist parties, the Soviet secret police exhibited a
   continual escalation of repressions against Zionists. The policies of
   the secret police in Ukraine illuminate their personal adaptation to the
   coercive Soviet system of centralisation and ideological exclusion.},

Abstract = {Institutional and ideational crises are characterised by fundamental
   uncertainty about the world, and at the same time require swift action
   on part of decision makers. How do political actors overcome uncertainty
   to enable collective action? The paper argues that actors use the ideas
   of the pre-crisis regime and through processes of bricolage seek to fit
   them to radically different circumstances. This enables action, but it
   also privileges the actors that benefited from these ideas before the
   crisis. This helps explain why so relatively few changes to financial
   regulation are appearing from the recent crisis. The argument is
   illustrated through the case of financial crisis in Denmark,
   demonstrating that the Danish authorities used ideas developed since the
   banking crisis of the 1980s concurring on the discourse that the best
   solution to the crisis would be a further consolidation' of the sector,
   that is, fewer small banks and stronger large banks. This shows both the
   strength and weakness of using old ideas for radically new problems: it
   enables actors to act in concert, but changes are incremental and the
   weaknesses of the previous regime may thus live on in the new regime.},

Abstract = {New technology is fundamental to sustainable development. However,
   inventors from industrialized countries often refuse technology transfer
   because they worry about reverse-engineering. When can clean technology
   transfer succeed? We develop a formal model of the political economy of
   North-South technology transfer. According to the model, technology
   transfer is possible if (1) the technology in focus has limited global
   commercial potential or (2) the host developing country does not have
   the capacity to absorb new technologies for commercial use. If both
   conditions fail, inventors from industrialized countries worry about the
   adverse competitiveness effects of reverse-engineering, so technology
   transfer fails. Data analysis of technology transfer in 4,894 projects
   implemented under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism
   during the 2004-2010 period provides evidence in support of the model.},

Abstract = {The previous literature contends inter alia that states may welcome the
   participation of civil society groups in global environmental governance
   due to their provision of information. The following research takes this
   argument as a starting point for a closer examination of its validity
   within the international climate change regime (UNFCCC) and,
   specifically, with regard to civil society involvement in states'
   negotiation delegations. First, the author theoretically unfolds the
   information provision argument from a demand, i.e., state perspective
   along the bureaucratic quality of a country, the salience of a
   negotiation issue, and regime type. From this foundation, secondly, new
   data on the composition of states' negotiation delegations in the UNFCCC
   is analyzed. The results seem to indicate that the information provision
   mechanism is unlikely to apply in the context under study. The paper,
   thus, concludes by providing alternative explanations.},

Abstract = {Brazil has occupied a central role in the access to medicines movement,
   especially with respect to drugs used to treat those with the human
   immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes the acquired immune deficiency
   syndrome (AIDS). Contrary to previous literature centered on the role of
   the domestic pharmaceutical industry, politicians seeking electoral
   gains, and civil society activists, I argue that the state, especially
   the National AIDS Program, led the struggle in contesting a
   corporate-driven international intellectual property regime. After
   reviewing the origins of Brazil's treatment policies and patent reforms,
   I trace the actions and relationships between the state, civil society,
   transnational corporations (TNCs), and local industry in three instances
   when Brazilian officials used compulsory licenses to reduce the price of
   medicines. Coalition-building and ``naming and shaming{''} tactics
   contributed to Brazil's success, while changing pharmaceutical
   capabilities limited more aggressive actions.},

Pages = {14-29},

Abstract = {Many of the very significant insights in Ian Ayres and John
   Braithwaite's 1992 book, Responsive Regulation, have transcended the
   book's time. At the same time, on the 20th anniversary of its
   publication, two things about the book are striking. The first is the
   direct, personal relationship on which the regulatory interaction is
   premised. The second is the boundedness and manageability of the
   regulatory project. At least in prudential regulation of global
   financial institutions in the wake of the recent financial crisis
   (though surely elsewhere too), neither of these features can be taken
   for granted. This brief essay seeks to open a preliminary conversation
   about responsive regulation in terms of its scalability. It considers
   whether as a practical matter, responsive regulation can be scaled up to
   more diffuse, multiparty, logistically complex contexts, such as
   financial regulation. As a matter of representation, it asks whether by
   projecting the focal object, the responsive relationship, outward,
   responsive regulation distorts our image of regulation in other contexts
   (or even in responsive regulation's own home environment). The essay
   closes by arguing that in order to incorporate responsive regulation's
   considerable discursive and relational benefits into regulatory
   environments like global financial regulation, it needs to be buttressed
   by additional regulatory technologies.},

Abstract = {This article investigates ways that young Nepalese women combine family
   and student roles when transitioning to adulthood. Findings show both
   women's and their parents' education is positively associated with the
   young women's school enrollment after marriage. Furthermore, the effect
   of education on postmarriage schooling is dependent on type of marriage:
   for lower-educated women, those in an arranged marriage are more likely
   to continue education than those in a love marriage. However, for
   better-educated women, those in a love marriage are more likely to
   continue schooling than those in an arranged marriage. The more educated
   ones who balance personal autonomy and obedience to cultural authorities
   win parental support in both their marriage formation and personal
   development. Unlike the increasingly elongated, sequential transition to
   adulthood in the Western context, young Nepalese women experience an
   intense transition to adulthood as they take on family and student roles
   simultaneously with practical familial support.},

Abstract = {This article examines the assumed factuality of globalization in light
   of its persistent conceptual incoherence. Through a diagnosis of five
   reoccurring ambiguities within the globalization literature, I argue
   that the concept of globalization lacks an empirical referent. Scholars
   writing on globalization overcome this absence by asserting that some
   things (the Internet, McDonald's, etc.) and not others (genocide in
   Rwanda, refugee camps, etc.) are essentially global. It turns out,
   however, that who is positioned to posit some things (and not others) as
   global, and therefore posit the foundation for a theory of
   globalization, is shaped by a highly asymmetrical political economy of
   knowledge production. In particular, some scholarsusually in North
   American and European universitiesare materially better positioned to
   produce knowledge about globalization than many of their colleagues in
   postcolonial countries. The seemingly arbitrary positing of some things
   as global, therefore, should be understood as a symptom of the highly
   unequal social relations in which knowledge about globalization is
   produced.},

Abstract = {Recent events illustrate the connection between Internet usage and
   political action, yet non-governmental organizations (NGOs) still seek
   effective Web strategies for human rights advocacy. Although most NGOs
   have websites and engage with technologies such as social networking,
   initial research shows that many organizations simply use the Internet
   to enhance existing programmes and activities. NGOs are far less likely
   than individual activists to undertake cutting edge, creative activities
   that utilize the potential of new technologies. At the same time, adults
   and young people around the world are becoming more dependent on the
   Internet for information and networking. This study analyses the
   websites of 100 human rights NGOs to better understand how such
   organizations currently utilize the Internet and how their advocacy
   efforts may be strengthened. The article outlines existing literature
   related to online activism, stressing the divide between `supersize'
   activities that build on existing strategy and `theory 2.0' actions that
   use the Internet in new and dynamic ways. The results of this study are
   outlined, highlighting statistics that illustrate the current ways that
   NGOs use the Web and paying particular attention to creative models.
   Finally, recommendations are provided for enhancing online strategies
   for more effective human rights advocacy.},

Abstract = {This article begins by showing that Japan was central to Iosif Stalin's
   postwar policy in Northeast Asia. The article then examines how the
   emphasis on Japan led to actions in and with North Korea (and China),
   first to try to block and then to try to compensate for the separate
   peace and military alliance between the United States and Japan. The
   penultimate section recounts meetings between Stalin and leaders of the
   Japanese Communist Party (JCP) in the spring and summer of 1951. The
   article concludes by explaining how Stalin's meetings with the JCP fit
   into his policies in Northeast Asia as they evolved largely in step with
   U.S.-Soviet relations.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},

Volume = {28},

Abstract = {The British government tried to create a peace front against German
   aggression in 1939 and the inclusion of the Soviet Union was
   controversial. This article investigates British intelligence on Soviet
   war potential in 1939 with the aim of comparing intelligence to reality,
   placing intelligence in context by following the British government
   discussion, commenting on earlier research about British intelligence on
   Soviet war potential and trying to find explanations for the fact that
   intelligence was far from reality. British assessments were of
   importance and earlier research is amended.},

Abstract = {Survey researchers and practitioners use nonresponse adjustment weights
   to mitigate the effects of survey nonresponse on sample estimates. One
   challenge in creating these weights is finding useful auxiliary data
   that predict both the probability of participating in the survey and the
   survey variables of interest. This article reviews the use of paradata
   for nonresponse adjustment. Five different types of paradata are
   considered: neighborhood observations, observations of the sampled
   housing unit, observations of persons in the sampled housing unit, call
   records, and observations about the interviewer-householder interaction.
   Empirical evidence about the predictive value of these paradata for
   predicting both participation and survey variables is examined.
   Challenges of using these paradata are also identified, along with
   outstanding issues and opportunities related to the use of paradata for
   nonresponse adjustment.},

Abstract = {What does local self-governance mean in post-communist Russia and China?
   In order to answer this question, the article focuses on village-level
   governance in both countries by employing a four-fold typology of
   village leadership in public affairs. In both countries, the withdrawal
   of state power from local communities and the introduction of
   legislative self-government has not brought autonomy to the local and
   community levels. The findings here suggest that the single state agent
   category of village leadership that emerged under the communist regime
   is shifting to become one of the remaining three types, principal, local
   agent and bystander. There was a growing tendency towards a
   non-autonomous type of bystander-style leadership in China and the local
   agent type in Russia. This article suggests that the development of
   these local governance styles should not be attributed to a common
   transitional process departing from the communist past, but is the
   outcome of four factors that influence village leaders in two countries:
   administrative distance between local and village level, village social
   structure, fiscal arrangements and electoral relationships.},

Abstract = {In the two decades since the emergence of the European Union at
   Maastricht there has been a concerted attempt to build a European
   political space, typified by the debates on constitutionalization and
   democratization. Much less noticed, but no less important, has been the
   mobilization of publics, interest groups and political parties against
   the integration process. In the light of the failure to realize the
   Laeken objectives, the stabilization of an anti-integration bloc in the
   European Parliament, recurrent no votes in national referendums and the
   emergence of an increasingly co-ordinated movement of critical interest
   groups, it is argued in this article that this opposition has become
   embedded and persistent, at both European and national levels. This will
   have considerable consequences for the Union itself and the way it has
   chosen to largely ignore sceptical voices to date.},

Abstract = {In this study I analyse the Russian Marcha political performance which
   emerged in 2005 and which has developed from a protest ritual into one
   of the most important public and visible events organised by the Russian
   ultranationalist movement. The focus of the current analysis is the
   symbolic structure of the march, which is examined at three
   levelscognitive, emotive and archetypal. The case study of the
   development of the Russian March highlights the paradoxes of the
   politics of performativity in Russia as well as the interaction between
   ideological codes and discursive frames in the Russian nationalist
   movement.},

Abstract = {This essay examines the development and demise of one of the least
   studied elements of U.S. homeland defense efforts in the 1950s: the
   Ground Observer Corps (GOC). The article recounts the history of the GOC
   from its founding in the mid-1950s until its deactivation in 1959 and
   concludes that it never came close to achieving its goals for
   recruitment and effectiveness. Yet, despite the major shortcomings of
   the GOC, the U.S. Air Force continued to support it, primarily because
   it was seen as helpful for the public relations interests of the Air
   Force, continental air defense, and, more generally, U.S. Cold War
   policies. The lack of widespread public support for the GOC raises
   questions about the view that Americans were deeply fearful of an
   imminent Soviet nuclear strike in the 1950s.},

Title = {Between Late-Industrialisation and Globalisation: The Hybridisation of
   Labour Relations among Leading South Korean Firms},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {5},
Pages = {625-652},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {South Korea's (hereinafter Korea) labour relations illuminate the
   possibilities for the hybridisation' of non-liberal capitalism under
   globalisation. Unlike the well-known German and Japanese advanced
   non-liberal capitalisms, Korea appeared to be far less conducive to
   hybridisation'. First, inclusive labour practices were not well
   developed. Second, it had introduced comprehensive economic
   liberalisation following the financial crash of 1998. Despite these
   unfavourable conditions, leading Korean firms have tended to maintain or
   even introduce non-liberal practices than to discard them. The resulting
   melding of non-liberal and liberal practices (hybridisation') can be
   traced to three legacies of late-industrialisation: state inclination to
   intervene during crises; countervailing power of labour at leading
   enterprises; and the intensity of big business rivalry as a force for
   the assimilation of inclusive practices. The effects of these legacies
   in generating mixed practices will be illustrated using firm-level case
   studies from Korea's two leading export sectors. It will also be argued
   that Korea's pattern of labour relations hybridity is not conducive to
   convergence with extant forms of advanced capitalism. Hence Korea is
   more suitably denoted as a form of late-industrialisation hybrid
   capitalism whose experience is relevant to other late-developers as they
   achieve advanced' status.},

Abstract = {A veteran Western observer and authority on Russia's political economy
   examines the recent debate on economic growth in Russia. Focusing on
   Sergey Glazyev, a prominent statist and nationalist favored by President
   Vladimir Putin, who reemerged at the top of the public debate, the
   author discusses the essence of his ideas (state capitalism, Eurasian
   integration, and expansionary fiscal and monetary policy). He proceeds
   to analyze the critical response of liberals, citing inter alia
   objections to loose fiscal and monetary policies. Russia's liberal
   economists favor broader international integration, whereas Putin is
   clearly in favor of state capitalism and Eurasian integration. This
   study ends with an up-to-date politico-economic assessment titled Where
   is Putin going?},

Abstract = {Corporate self-regulation has been blamed for many of the worst
   environmental and financial catastrophes of the twenty-first century,
   but the failure of self-regulation in these catastrophes has been
   rivaled by failures of government regulation. This article explores the
   consequences of adopting self-regulation under conditions of failed or
   deficient government regulation. First, it identifies the conditions
   that produce the phenomenon of blue moon self-regulation, or
   self-regulation that successfully achieves public regulatory goals.
   Second, it develops a typology of regulatory voids in which
   self-regulation is commonly adopted and analyzes its prospects for
   success under each set of conditions. It concludes that prospects for
   self-regulatory success are particularly bleak in regulatory voids that
   have been created by the concerted political opposition of regulated
   entities.},

Abstract = {This article takes the European Union's constitution-making as a case
   study to examine how' politicization can emerge through contestation by
   political actors in response to political opportunities. It advances
   understanding of the conditions and processes through which
   politicization emerges by undertaking empirical analysis. The primary
   data source is an original sample of political actors' claims-making
   over European integration issues retrieved from news samples in France,
   Germany and Britain during the constitution event (2000-05). Main tenets
   of prominent theories on politicization are unpacked and tested in
   relation to the evidence from the claims-making analysis. The findings
   demonstrate the transformative impact of the French referendum as a
   specific opportunity: politicization was largely restricted to internal
   national contestation by French actors; political party competition was
   the prominent contestation form; and the Socialists mobilized against
   the constitution by advocating Social Europe'. This transformed the
   political space by introducing competition over Europe into the party
   system's core.},

Abstract = {Who is watching the financial services industry? Since 1980, there have
   been multiple waves of thought about whether the ministry of finance,
   the central bank, a specialized regulator or some combination of these
   should have supervisory authority. These waves have been associated with
   the convergence of actual practices. How much and through what channels
   did internationally promoted ideas about supervisory best practice'
   influence institutional design choices? I use a new dataset of 83
   countries and jurisdictions between the 1980s and 2007 to examine the
   diffusion of supervisory ideas. With this data, I employ Cox
   Proportional Hazard and Competing Risks Event History Analyses to
   evaluate the possible causal roles best practice policy ideas might have
   played. I find that banking crises and certain peer groups can encourage
   policy convergence on heavily promoted ideas.},

Abstract = {This article uses fieldwork collected in four villages of the Sarnyere
   Dogon in Mali between 2002 and 2010 to explore the impact of
   unprecedented individual youth mobility. This small Sahelian population
   has been challenged by declining natural resources and an opening up to
   the outside world. Temporary migration of families before each rainy
   season or harvest has always been part of this population's adaptation
   to an arid environment, but youth mobility, especially among girls, is
   new. Although migration is short term and over relatively short
   distances, it is an increasingly prevalent alternative to agricultural
   subsistence strategies. Whereas economic reasons underpin boys'
   mobility, for young unmarried girls, the predominant driving force is
   the discovery of the outside world. Broadly speaking, youth migration in
   this population is one part of changing intergenerational and gender
   relations and is especially related to youths' more individual choices
   of spouse.},

Abstract = {Shareholder-owned corporations were the central pillars of the US
   economy in the twentieth century. Due to the success of the shareholder
   value movement and the widespread ``Nikefication{''} of production,
   however, public corporations have become less concentrated, less
   integrated, less interconnected at the top, shorter-lived, and less
   prevalent since the turn of the twenty-first century, and there is
   reason to expect that their significance will continue to dwindle. We
   are left with both pathologies (heightened inequality, lower mobility,
   and a fragmented social safety net) and new technologies suitable for
   being repurposed in more democratic forms. Local solutions for
   producing, distributing, and sharing can provide functional alternatives
   to corporations for both production and employment; what is needed is
   the social organization to match the tools that we already have, or will
   have shortly. The time for democratic local economic forms prophesied by
   generations of activists may finally be at hand.},

Abstract = {When states face an international cooperation problem requiring
   enforcement, when do they decide to make that enforcement formal versus
   informal? I introduce a research design for investigating how informal
   mechanisms might be relevant to formal international agreements. I
   present an overall theory of punishment provisions and a set of
   hypotheses about whether any needed punishments will be formalized or
   not. This theory gives rise to a two-part empirical analysis conducted
   on a large-n dataset. First, the presence of enforcement mechanisms in
   agreements is predicted, and, second, those cases that are
   ``misclassified{''}aEuro{''}ones in which the model predicts the
   presence of such mechanisms, but the agreements lack them-are analyzed.
   These misclassified agreements, candidates for informal enforcement, are
   characterized by regime heterogeneity and military asymmetries among
   parties. Case study evidence supports the results.},

Abstract = {Russia is usually considered as being obstructive to European
   integration in the EU's Eastern neighbourhood, while the EU is portrayed
   as being the key promoter of convergence with EU rules. Thus, strong
   economic dependence on Russia and EU active leverage should account for
   cross-policy variation in convergence with EU rules. By comparing
   convergence in Ukraine's telecommunications and food safety regulations,
   I show that active leverage exerted by Western European multinationals
   rather than by the EU accounts for divergent outcomes. Further, Russia's
   bad guy' image does not hold if we stop treating Russia as a unitary
   actor but distinguish between passive and active leverage exerted by
   Russian government policies, the Russian market and Russian
   multinationals investing in the Eastern neighbourhood countries on
   domestic policy choices.},

Abstract = {Gender and politics scholars have yet to recognize political leaders'
   deciding to run accounts as storytelling performances that draw from and
   contest dominant cultural discourses. In this article, I present
   findings from interviews I conducted with 33 women candidates in Texas,
   analyzing my subjects' deciding to run accounts as narratives that
   illuminate much about women's attempts to negotiate contradictions
   between dominant racegender values and their drive for public office. I
   find that women tell quite different narratives about their decisions to
   run for office, with Black women and Latinas expressing more confidence
   and self-direction in their stories than white women. I also reveal that
   many of these stories contain complexities and contradictions that are
   not illuminated in survey research on candidate emergence.},

Title = {Relational republican regulation},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {124-144},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This response refutes point (i) in the Ayres comment's abstract. It
   argues that at its heart responsive regulation is about seeking
   strategies that will render regulation more relational when it counts.
   This is possible even in domains like tax compliance where 99 per cent
   of the routine regulatory action occurs without face-to-face encounter.
   A number of critiques in the special issue are embraced. While
   practitioners who reject civic republican values can learn from the
   responsive regulation literature, regulation conduces to tyranny if it
   is not explicit in a value commitment to reducing domination in the
   world. Concern that the republican elements of the argument have been
   insufficiently prominent in subsequent writing of the authors is
   therefore embraced. Freedom as non-domination requires a transnational
   regulatory vision for strategies with transnational leverage that reduce
   domination globally, not just nationally. A paradox advanced is that the
   largest regulatory errors of recent history on the global stage are best
   corrected by micro relational strategies invented with a global
   imagination for crafting micromacro linkages.},

Abstract = {Early in the Northern Ireland conflict the army took the lead in
   intelligence operations, including Humint. This article examines the
   case of `Observer B', an agent run jointly with MI5. Using testimony and
   documents provided to the Bloody Sunday Inquiry as well as original
   archival sources, it offers a unique Humint case study that discusses
   the agent's recruitment, motivation, reliability, handling, product, and
   utility. This represents the most complete account that we have of this
   case, but gaps remain. It illustrates some of the limitations of
   clandestine Humint collection in situations where information may be
   time-sensitive. The article challenges the conventional wisdom about
   army/MI5 relations and shows how the two improvised and cooperated in
   agentrunning.},

Abstract = {The article examines if and, if so, why and how political parties
   opposing the European Union have thrived. It looks at the role of
   national parliaments and national media in failing to engage
   convincingly with the European dimension of politics, and asks why the
   forces of European federalism have been so relatively ineffective. By
   analyzing the tensions between national and European political parties
   especially in the conduct of elections to the European Parliament, the
   article traces the rise of the nationalist forces within the EP and
   assesses their impact on the legislative and other work of the
   institution. It concludes by proposing measures to tackle the
   nationalist challenge to European unification, including more
   differentiated forms of integration, more direct democracy, the
   development of federal political parties and the constitutional
   settlement of a federal union.},

Abstract = {A large share of decision makers in modern democratic systems are
   appointed. To what degree do those officials represent constituents?
   Representation in this case is determined in part by the extent to which
   constituents influence the appointment process. This article examines
   the influence of women's organized interests and constituency
   preferences on Supreme Court confirmation votes. With topics such as
   sexual harassment, privacy, and Roe v. Wade looming large, gender
   politics became a salient issue during confirmation battles in the late
   1980s and early 1990s and has remained so since. Original data from the
   contentious appointments of Justices David Souter, Clarence Thomas, John
   Roberts, Samuel Alito, and Sonia Sotomayor are analyzed. Results confirm
   that women's organized interests and popular preferences have an impact
   on contentious nominations. Implications for popular influences on
   appointments and for representation in government writ large are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Neo-imperial free-market capitalist shifts depend on animating slavery
   as terror, and queerness as a speculative economy, to mediate political
   value conflicts and displace antagonisms. I engage with two archives on
   queerness, a 2012 speech by Hillary Clinton at the UN on African states'
   violation of human rights of gays and lesbians, and a report on the
   violation of human rights of Iraqi gays (2011). Through these archives,
   I interrogate how slavery and queer economies are drawn upon by a
   resurgent neoliberalism to constitute and erect regimes of value while
   generating structures of violence and governance that impede our
   understanding of the emergence of fungibility as a modality of slave
   terror. The slave' emerges as the suturing inert matter out of which
   epistemologies and practices of economies of sexuality, race and
   geopolitics are harvested. Importantly, the African' is marked as black
   through lack of gay rights and Africa' in multiple sites is figured as
   the a-historical scene out of which flesh is captured. I trace the
   ruptures in discourses and corporeal practices presupposing that the
   existence of non-procreative sex as foundational capacity threatens the
   reproduction of the global order and the fulfilment of democratic
   promises while continuing the production of a structuring ontology that
   requires blackness and the suffering of the slave, the extracted energy
   necessary to differentiate and to suture queerness as a speculative
   economy.},

Abstract = {Developments in the information society in Russia have led to the
   creation of an abundance of online primary texts by political actors and
   institutions. This article surveys a large selection of official
   electronic texts with the aim of encouraging more extensive use of
   online sources and easing researchers' navigation of Russian
   politicians' use of the internet. While the authors do not claim that
   online data can replace the insights gained from elite interviews, the
   article suggests that online texts could be used more extensively as a
   valuable addition to existing methods applied to the study of Russian
   political elites.},

Abstract = {Traditionally, much of the focus of the study of politics has been on
   formal arrangements and formal institutions. In recent years, however,
   this dominant focus has given way to an increasing concern with informal
   aspects of politics. This can be said for both the study of comparative
   politics and international relations more generally and for research on
   governance within the European Union in particular. Against this
   background, the aim of this research note is, first, to review the
   findings of research on informal governance and, second, to explore
   whether analytical concepts can be applied to the EU, with the aim of
   bringing greater conceptual clarity to the field and identifying future
   research agendas in this area. In a final section, the article also
   addresses the normative dimension of informal governance in the EU,
   discussing both the benefits and the risks of such arrangements from the
   perspective of transparency, efficiency and democratic accountability.},

Abstract = {This article explores gender depictions in Bukusu folktales compiled in
   From our Mothers' Hearths: Bukusu Folktales and Proverbs (2005). The
   folktales portray males as courageous and possessing inordinate power,
   even over death. In contrast, females are confined to the domestic
   sphere; they can be malicious and are often indecisive as well as
   subordinate and dependent on menfolk. Women take leadership roles in the
   absence of males. Since documented folktales reinforce a gender
   hierarchy, narrators, consciously or not, perpetuate negative female
   imagery and invisibility. Folktales depicting women's agency highlight
   the ambivalent contradiction of women's social role.},

Abstract = {The history of Israel-EU relations has received considerable scholarly
   attention. The conventional starting point for this history is almost
   invariably April 1958, when Israel became the third country in the world
   to request the establishment of a diplomatic mission in Brussels. The
   background and the lead up to that request, however, have been largely
   neglected. The article seeks to fill this scholarly lacuna by relating
   the hitherto untold story of Israel's exploration in 1957 of the
   possibility of obtaining full economic and political EEC membership. A
   centrepiece of the article is the revelation of the 1957 clandestine
   meeting(s) between Shimon Peres, then director general of the Israeli
   Ministry of Defence and special envoy of Prime Minister David
   Ben-Gurion, and Jean Monnet, in which the two discussed possible full
   Israeli membership in the EEC. The article is based on some newly
   revealed archival documents and interviews with former high-ranking
   Israeli officials.},

Abstract = {This essay examines newspaper narratives depicting model youth in
   Komsomol'skaya Pravda in the early 1960s in order to cast light on the
   Party-state's efforts in the Khrushchev years to use the press as a
   means of re-energising the drive to forge model communist citizens. In
   contrast to most studies of Soviet media, this study offers a glimpse of
   the reception of official signals, by drawing on sociological studies
   that Komsomol'skaya Pravda conducted of its readers in the early 1960s.
   Throughout, the paper explores recent scholarly discussions of
   resistance, conformism and agency in the Soviet context.},

Abstract = {This article provides empirical findings on the relationship between the
   open method of co-ordination and participation (OMC). Empirically, it
   draws on within-case analysis to examine how participation, venues and
   outcomes have varied in different domains of information society policy.
   This is a challenging case for claims about the participatory effects of
   the OMC because it is not a policy originally designed to address social
   policy concerns or unemployment problems. The main conceptual argument
   is that the OMC is a political opportunity structure that distributes
   participatory gains. The article examines this opportunity structure by
   separating out the dimensions of procedure' and outcomes' and including
   transparency' as a moderating variable. The findings point to
   participatory effects in all but one case, although not for the same
   actors and at the same level (European Union or national/sub-national).},

Abstract = {This is a qualitative study that examines the process through which
   young adults who were born in Mexico and immigrated to the United States
   in their formative years have managed to attain a college education, and
   the uncertainty that besets their future careers. The article focuses on
   successful college attainment but seeks to add to the debate about
   resilient migrants along the following lines. The young adult immigrant
   population (referred to as Generation 1.5) deserves special attention
   since they experience a different process of socialization and insertion
   into American society, compared to first-generation adult migrants and
   to their children born in the United States (the second generation). The
   outcome of this different socialization process is a group of high
   achievers in the academic arena, with a heterogeneous prospect in labor,
   mainly due to their migratory situation. Their professional prospects
   fall into one of two patterns: upward mobility or glass-ceiling
   mobility.},

Abstract = {In this article, we argue that understanding the impact of economic
   structures on low-wage workers requires the study of emerging worker
   centers and networks and that individual labor market outcomes and
   experiences are mediated and impacted by the work of these institutions.
   We focus on the formation of sectoral worker center networks and address
   three key issues: (1) What are some of the reasons why worker centers
   and worker center networks have developed? (2) How do these
   organizations manage their roles as labor market institutions and social
   movement organizations? and (3) Why did worker center networks focus on
   employment and in particular sectors of the low-wage labor market? We
   find that sector-based organizing (1) facilitates the development of
   worker-and sector-targeted service strategies, thereby enabling low-wage
   worker groups and organizations to better achieve their service and
   policy goals; (2) maximizes opportunities for the organizations to
   obtain national resources; and (3) expands the reach of organizational
   networks by bringing organizations together to share resources and best
   practices. By providing a range of worker-, employment-, and labor
   market-centered services in specific labor market sectors, worker
   centers and their networks solidify their role as labor market
   institutions and become more effective advocacy and social movement
   organizations.},

Abstract = {This collaborative article examines how two academic institutions and
   one non-governmental organization cooperated to map recent trial
   activity for past human rights violations, applying social science
   techniques to assist survivors' and relatives' groups as well as
   litigators in making informed strategic choices in their interactions
   with the formal justice system. The article discusses how
   methodologically rigorous data collection and data requests to public
   bodies can be used to advance a proaccountability agenda. The authors
   show how a range of civil society and state actors have changed justice
   system outcomes in Argentina, Chile and Peru and highlight some lessons

Title = {`The Burqa is just like a Maxi Dress': A Muslim Adolescent Perspective
   on Human Rights},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {125-152},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {One of the original aims of the UK's Human Rights Act was to disseminate
   human rights values to ordinary citizens and foster a human rights
   culture. While research suggests that such a culture has yet to
   materialize, there are also indications that people broadly support the
   values underpinning the Human Rights Act. However, in a multicultural
   society it would be wrong to assume that different groups will interpret
   human rights in a uniform way. Instead, there are likely to be several
   coexisting human rights cultures that are shaped by a variety of
   normative frameworks. Adopting a legal-pluralist perspective, this study
   sets out to explore how Muslim adolescents experience human rights.
   Contemporary Western political discourse places great emphasis on the
   conflict between human rights and Islam, shaping young Muslims' own
   sense of self as torn between fundamentally incompatible normative
   influences. Muslim students from a school in Birmingham were invited to
   participate in a group deliberation about human rights issues. The
   discussion was based around vignettes foregrounding potential clashes
   between human rights and competing interests. A prominent theme emerging
   from the conversations was that the cultural practices of Muslim
   communities should not be confused with religious beliefs. The students
   felt very protective of their faith and were keen to portray Islam as
   liberal and pro-human rights. On the other hand, they acknowledged that
   there was a level of conflict between aspects of their religious beliefs
   and human rights but they also believed that it was possible to
   accommodate conflicting norms by assigning different spheres of
   influence in which they can legitimately prevail.},

Abstract = {In the crucial period from 1978 to 1975, Japan jettisoned its
   ``omnidirectional{''} foreign policy and embraced a closer and more
   integrated defense alliance with the United States. Concern about the
   Soviet threat was the chief motive for this shift. The deployment of
   Soviet troops in the Northern Territories (Southern Kuriles), the Soviet
   invasion of Afghanistan, and the deployment of Soviet Backfire bombers
   and SS-20 nuclear missiles in the Far East all provided impetus toward
   closer U.S.-Japanese defense cooperation. As Japan closely aligned its
   defense policy with the United States, Soviet-Japanese relations
   correspondingly deteriorated. Normal channels of communication were
   broken off. As the Japanese government elevated the Northern Territories
   issue to the forefront of Soviet-Japanese relations, Soviet criticism of
   Japan escalated. By the time Mikhail Gorbachev took power in 1985,
   Soviet-Japanese relations had sunk to their lowest point.},

   suggests that it appeals to practitioners because it provides a
   theoretical endorsement of the professional autonomy to which
   practitioners aspire. It was, and is, still appealing to scholars
   because it provides a practical means to improve regulation, which is
   congruent with the dominant neoliberal reflex to depoliticize the
   regulation of capitalist economies. All in all, because responsive
   regulation has very largely been reduced to the enforcement pyramid, the
   literature has neglected the normative issues surrounding the regulation
   of capitalist economies that were central to Ayres and Braithwaite.},

Abstract = {This article takes as its starting point the emergence of the so-called
   Development Agenda at the World Intellectual Property Organization
   (WIPO) in 2004. It seeks to provide a diachronic view of the origins of
   the Agenda that goes beyond understanding it simply as an effort by some
   developing countries and civil society actors to bring about
   organisational change at WIPO. Building upon insights from sociological
   institutionalism, it argues that the Development Agenda is the
   manifestation of a founding contradiction in the institution of
   intellectual property itself, which has been the source of a great
   number of conflicts throughout its history. Actors involved in them have
   often used frames in an effort to legitimise their actions, such as the
   frame of development in the case of the Agenda. After exploring the
   development frame, the article concludes by arguing that the Agenda is
   likely to bring about only incremental changes, rather than transcend
   the tensions that helped bring it about.},

   Pearl Harbor and Midway},
Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {68-90},
Abstract = {After surprise attacks and other intelligence failures, the complaint is
   often heard that if only decision-makers had listened more closely to
   the warnings they had received, disaster might have been avoided. But
   even though it is generally agreed that intelligence is of little use
   unless it is received and understood by policymakers, we actually know
   little about why some leaders are receptive toward intelligence, while
   others are not. This article argues that the willingness of decision
   makers to listen to intelligence depends primarily on two factors: their
   belief in the seriousness of the issue or threat involved, and their
   trust in the utility of intelligence. It examines contrasting
   receptivity toward intelligence in the cases of Pearl Harbor and the
   Battle of Midway, and suggests that our current models of intelligence -
   policy relations need to be revised},

Abstract = {Japan's diplomatic codes were broken by the Soviet Union in the late
   1930s. This was due to Kozo Izumi (1890-1956), a Japanese diplomat and
   Soviet specialist stationed in Eastern Europe, who provided Japan's code
   books and keys to the Soviet secret police. Married to a Muscovite of
   noble origin working for the Soviet Foreign Intelligence, Izumi was
   entrapped and ultimately chose love over country. He thus led an
   unwitting Japan to conduct `open diplomacy' towards the Soviet Union.},

Journal = {POST-SOVIET AFFAIRS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {31-55},
Abstract = {In Russia, politicians routinely select technical, non-party cabinets
   whose political outlook is difficult to decipher. The article asks how
   variation in politicians' preferences along the democratic-authoritarian
   dimension shapes political skills sought in cabinets and how ministers
   sharing politicians' aims are selected. The account of ministerial
   selection is tested in a controlled, comparative analysis of ministerial
   appointments in Russia, using an original dataset covering all full
   ministers appointed by presidents Boris Yel'tsin and Vladimir Putin,
   1992-2008. The results clarify several important debates about the
   political implications of changes to cabinet composition in Russia and
   contribute to a more nuanced general understanding of the politics of
   technical cabinets.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Pages = {230-251},
Abstract = {In 2011 intelligence reform became a timely and pertinent topic in Egypt
   with the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak by mass demonstrations.
   Yet two outstanding questions persist: can Egyptian intelligence be
   reformed? What would intelligence reform entail in the Egyptian context?
   An examination of historical Egyptian intelligence reforms suggests that
   `reform' in the Egyptian context usually means greater efficiency and
   centralization at the expense of public oversight and accountability.
   Prospects for fundamental intelligence reform are further hampered by
   Egypt's authoritarian traditions, its relatively weak legislature and
   judiciary, lack of an empowered civil society, censorship and an
   apparent official addiction to secrecy.},

Abstract = {This article explores the role of US public interest groups in the
   promotion of government transparency, as part of a broader agenda on
   civil liberties. Drawing on a set of declassified documents, and
   extensive oral testimony from protagonists, it is argued that such
   groups occupy a significant position as facilitators of intelligence
   accountability in the United States. Public interest groups represent a
   tradition of pluralism that lies at the heart of the American conception
   of democracy. A survey of the tactics deployed by interest groups to
   support liberal democratic principles demonstrates that these groups
   always rely on government institutions to carry out their oversight
   function. By virtue of this, public interest groups support intelligence
   accountability rather than hold to account the US government and its
   intelligence agencies.},

Abstract = {Surprisingly little research investigates a stark reality: the vast
   majority of today's international intergovernmental organizations (IGOs)
   were crafted not by states alone, but with participation by
   international bureaucrats working in pre-existing IGOs. What explains
   this phenomenon? Drawing on international relations scholarship, this
   article develops predictions involving the capabilities of states, or a
   matter's salience to states. The predictions are tested with a new and
   original dataset that captures, for the first time, variation in the
   roles that international bureaucrats play in the institutional design
   arena. Statistical analyses find that states' need for expertise, as
   well as the design negotiations' distance from high-politics, leave
   openings for international bureaucrats to enter institutional design
   processes. The findings enhance our understanding of institutional
   design, principal-agent relationships, non-state actors, and divisions
   of labor in contemporary global governance.},

Abstract = {According to conventional wisdom, in areas where the Council of the
   European Union is supposed to decide by qualified majority voting, it
   does not vote but rather decides by consensus'. This article aims to
   explain why the Council does not vote and what consensus' means. Given
   that consensus is often used by international organizations and EU
   institutional bodies, it is important to explain how it differs from
   unanimity. The article argues that formal voting is avoided because it
   would disclose the identity of opponents and would be detrimental to the
   negotiation process. Furthermore, ministers tend not to register their
   opposition even when they remain unsatisfied with an adopted measure
   because they expect to be blamed by their constituencies for having
   failed to defend national interests. Consensus is not necessarily used
   to signal that a general agreement is reached. It sometimes results from
   a strategy of blame avoidance that conflicts with democratic
   accountability.},

Abstract = {This article examines the link between constructed identity,
   socialization and interests in the Europeanization of national foreign
   policy. Theoretically, it contributes to the understanding of the
   conditions motivating Member States to have recourse to European Union
   (EU) opportunity structures in order to balance normative foreign policy
   interest with material interests. Empirically, the article contributes
   to understanding the influence of Europeanization on the foreign policy
   of Denmark and Sweden in their relations to China. It discusses
   perspectives on Europeanization of national foreign policy in the
   analysis of change in identity, institutions and policy, and explores
   the misfit thesis in relation to European identity construction and
   elite socialization, strategic calculation and the influence of
   alternative sources outside the EU. The research aims, study design and
   case selection are then presented prior to the analysis of the
   Europeanization of Denmark's and Sweden's relations with China.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the leadership of three Commission Presidents:
   Jacques Delors, Jacques Santer and Romano Prodi. It questions whether
   these Presidents performed as transactional or transforming leaders -
   that is, whether they mattered' as forceful promoters of the European
   project. Drawing on leadership theory, the article identifies three
   factors providing opportunities and setting constraints, as decisive for
   exercising political leadership: the institutional setting, the
   situational context and the personal qualities of the office holders. It
   analyzes to what extent these factors, and the interplay among them,
   shape the leadership of the Commission Presidents, and which of these
   factors are conditional for the exercise of transforming leadership. It
   concludes that only Delors was able to act as a transforming leader,
   whereas Santer and Prodi mainly performed as transactional leaders.
   These differences are explained by variations in the situational context
   and the personal qualities of the incumbents and the interplay between
   all three factors determining political leadership.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS},

Abstract = {This paper examines how the staff exercise informal governance over
   lending decisions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF or Fund). The
   essential component of designing any IMF program, assessing the extent
   to which a borrowing country is likely to fulfill its policy
   commitments, is based partly on informal staff judgments subject to
   informal incentives and normative orientations not dictated by formal
   rules and procedures. Moreover, when country officials are unable to
   commit to policy goals of the IMF, the IMF staff may bypass the formal
   channel of policy dialogue through informal contacts and negotiations
   with more like-minded actors outside the policymaking process.
   Exercising informal governance in these ways, the staff are motived by
   informal career advancement incentives and normative orientations
   associated with the organization's culture to provide favorable
   treatment to borrowers composed of policy teams sympathetic toward their
   policy goals. The presence of these sympathetic interlocutors provides
   the staff both with greater confidence a lending program will achieve
   success and an opportunity to support officials who share their policy
   beliefs. I assess these arguments using a new dataset that proxies
   shared policy beliefs based on the professional characteristics of IMF
   staff and developing country officials. The evidence supports these
   arguments: larger loan commitments are extended to countries where
   government officials and the Fund staff share similar professional
   training. The analysis implies informal governance operates in IOs not
   just via state influence but also through the evolving makeup, incentive
   structure, and normative orientations of their staffs.},

Abstract = {By employing a feminist analysis of the conscientious objection movement
   in South Korea, this study reveals the close causal dynamics between
   masculinities and anti-militarism. This, in turn, shows links between
   feminist politics and effectiveness of anti-militaristic campaigns. The
   conscientious objection movement in South Korea is one of the most
   distinctive and controversial anti-militaristic movements launched in
   the country since 2000. In this movement, the explicit contestation of
   dominant militarized masculinities has become a major factor in the
   formation of activists' identities, relationships and perspectives, as
   well as the building of the movement's popular legitimacy. Despite South
   Korea's male-only conscription system, women activists and feminist
   ideas have played important roles in helping young male conscientious
   objectors as they face or are motivated by pressures to act according to
   widely held and state-fostered militarized masculinities. These women
   activists and their feminist ideas have helped create a new dimension in
   both the conscientious objection movement and in the political culture
   of national security.},

Abstract = {While the effects of cultural disparity and common institutional
   foundations on international trade and foreign direct investment (FDI)
   have been much analyzed, little analysis of languages' transaction costs
   has been done in either the international relations or international
   business literatures. This paper integrates literature from
   international political economy, international business and economics,
   and linguistics, to examine the transaction costs of languages under
   three different measures of language closeness, same language, direct
   communication, and language distance. Language is both a tool in
   international economic transactions and a vehicle to transmit cultural
   values, but our results point out that major trade languages are
   employed differently in international trade and in FDI. Communication
   costs, for both FDI and international trade, show a hierarchy, with
   English the most inexpensive among major trade languages. We introduce
   the concept of language intensity to explain why communication costs are
   much more important in FDI than in international trade. Major trade
   languages may obtain considerable power from their economic use; we
   examine the asymmetric nature of this power. We empirically test these
   ideas in gravity equation models.},

Abstract = {This article asks a series of very direct, if not simple, questions.
   How, and why, is it that we assume that modern knowledge is universal,
   despite its European genealogy and its historically recent provenance?
   What warrant do we have for considering this knowledge superior to the
   premodern knowledges of the West and the autochthonous knowledges of the
   non-West? Are we, in short, right to assume that modern Western
   knowledge transcends the circumstances of its historical and
   geographical emergence and thus that the social sciences are true for
   everyoneeven though to do so is to privilege the modern and the Western
   over the premodern and the non-Western? In addressing these questions,
   this essay highlights the exclusionsof gods and spirits, and of
   naturethat have gone into the constitution of the concept of the social,
   a taken-for-granted object which provides the ground and the subject
   matter for the social sciences.},

Abstract = {The renaissance in the theoretical analysis of intergovernmental
   organizations (IGOs) has focused on formal IGOs (FIGOs), but many IGOs
   are subject to no formal treaty and/or have no permanent secretariat.
   Important examples of informal IGOs (IIGOs) include the G-groups that
   are the locus of much high-level interaction among states. We develop
   the spectrum of intergovernmental arrangements to show the wide
   variation in the formalization of international institutions and
   theorize when states will choose informal arrangements such as an IIGO
   over (or in combination with) a FIGO. A paired case comparison
   illustrates our claims that states use IIGOs when they need flexibility,
   to protect their sovereignty, to maintain close control of information,
   to lower short term transaction costs for speed, to minimize bureaucracy
   and to manage uncertainty during times of crisis. Finally, we examine
   how institutional choice is influenced by power.},

Abstract = {Political riskrisk that investments are damaged by policy action of
   authoritiesincreased during the financial crisis due to controversies
   about the distribution of accumulated losses among stakeholders.
   Authorities interconnected by cross-border banks considered unilateral
   policies that minimised losses for domestic stakeholders at the expense
   of their foreign counterparts. This is at odds both with the assumption
   behind financial integration which presumes multilateral responses to
   cross-border shocks and with the typical definition of political risks
   that ignores the fact that not only host-country, but also home-country
   authorities can create such risks. This paper recasts the definition of
   political risk and reviews instances when political risk materialised
   within the EU banking market between 2007 and 2011. The analysis reveals
   that the EU regulatory framework needs to be enhanced to contain
   resurgent political risks systematically rather than through ad hoc
   interventions of the EU and international bodies.},

Abstract = {Drug courts have been widely praised as an important tool for reducing
   prison and jail populations by diverting drug-involved offenders into
   treatment rather than incarceration. Yet only a small share of offenders
   presenting with drug abuse or dependence are processed in drug courts.
   This study uses inmate self-report surveys from 2002 and 2004 to examine
   characteristics of the prison and jail populations in the United States
   and assess why so many drug-involved offenders are incarcerated. Our
   analysis shows that four factors have prevented drug courts from
   substantially lowering the flow into prisons and jails. In descending
   order of importance, these are: drug courts' tight eligibility
   requirements, specific sentencing requirements, legal consequences of
   program noncompliance, and constraints in drug court capacity and
   funding. Drug courts will only be able to help lower prison and jail
   populations if substantial changes are made in eligibility and
   sentencing rules.},

Abstract = {This study examines courtship and activities leading to courtship among
   Japanese youths. Courtship is an important topic because it influences
   the chances of eventual marriage. The analyses of the Japanese Life
   Course Panel Survey show 42 percent of young unmarried people without a
   partner actively sought a dating partner during the past year. The most
   popular activity among both men and women was asking friends for
   introductions. Men tended to engage in partner-search activities when
   they were highly educated, had a full-time job, intended to get married,
   and had opportunities to meet the opposite sex. Among women, the
   intention to marry was the key factor in predicting the likelihood of
   partner-search activities, in addition to family assets. The effect of
   the partner search on the chances of finding a partner appears to be
   greatest for the men and women least likely to engage in partner
   searches.},

Abstract = {This paper claims that investors dislike political uncertainty about
   future policies and value stability in the political environment. We
   test the validity of this hypothesis by first studying variations in
   equity flows from global investment funds to emerging markets in periods
   surrounding elections. Second, we interpret changes in democracy score
   as another event potentially creating political uncertainty and assess
   their effects on equity flows. Our results corroborate our hypothesis.
   They indicate that the period following an election is generally
   characterized by a fall in equity flows, and that this occurs only where
   the incumbent is not re-elected, suggesting continuity is valued by
   investors. We also find that this effect is confined to presidential
   regimes, a result we interpret as further evidence that potentially
   radical swings in policy affect investors choices. Finally, a decrease
   in the democracy score implies lower equity flows, while democracy in
   itself does not affect equity flows, which is consistent with our view
   that equity funds are vigilant when potentially adverse changes in the
   political environment arise.},

Abstract = {Rapidly expanding world fruiticulture markets provide developing country
   producers with new income opportunities and much development literature
   and policy is orientated towards facilitating export production in these
   countries. However, it has been widely observed that the global retail
   revolution is accelerating the exclusion of small producers from export
   markets and (increasingly) from many domestic retail chains due to
   rising entry barriers. Small producers are thus often only able to sell
   their produce on to relatively low price traditional markets. This paper
   is based on data collected from a recently emerged fruiticulture sector
   in north-east Brazil. It shows that (a) export fruiticulture does
   generate significant economic benefits, (b) that modern domestic retail
   markets are increasingly demanding and exclusionary, but also, and
   counter to much of the literature concerned with export promotion, that
   (c) small-farms producing fruiticulture products for traditional
   domestic markets do generate positive local economic impacts.
   Policymakers should, therefore, consider new ways of assisting smaller
   producers to enter these markets.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the experimentation with shareholder activism by
   employee representatives in several large German corporations. I argue
   that these experiments are a manifestation of a new politics of
   solidarity that has emerged in the wake of the financialisation process
   in Germany. What unites the employee-shareholder activists is a strong
   rejection of short-term shareholder value maximisation, particularly as
   it affects the corporation's employees. To this end, they have created
   of a new form of interest organisation, the so-called employee
   shareholder associations (Vereine der Belegschaftsaktionare or ESAs)
   that have institutionalised local practices of employee-shareholder
   activism within German corporations. In this article, I will take a
   closer look at three ESAs and their activities, each representing a
   different type of employee-shareholder activism: a front door strategy'
   at Deutsche Telekom, a back door strategy' at Siemens, and peeking
   through the window' at TUI. This article will demonstrate that
   shareholder activism by local employee representatives offers an
   innovative variation on the typical conflict lines within the
   corporation identified by scholars of corporate governance.},

   Failure or a Failure of Response?},

Number = {4},
Pages = {453-494},
Abstract = {The teleological narrative that has dominated the handling of
   intelligence by the British state in the events that led up to the 1916
   Irish Rebellion in Dublin has been characterised as a cocktail of
   incompetence and mendacity. Using new and existing archive material this
   article argues that both the cabinet in London and key members of the
   Irish Executive in Dublin were supplied with accurate and timely
   intelligence by the Admiralty's signals intelligence unit, the Royal
   Irish Constabulary and the Dublin Metropolitan Police with respect to
   this event. Far from being a failure of intelligence here is evidence to
   show that there occurred a failure of response on behalf of key
   decision-makers. The warnings that were given by intelligence
   organisations were filtered through the existing policy preferences and
   assumptions. As a result of these factors accurate evaluations and sound
   judgement were not exercised by key officials, such as Sir Matthew
   Nathan, in Dublin Castle.},

Abstract = {This article outlines the response of three U.S. geneticists-Hermann
   Muller, Theodosius Dobzhansky, and Leslie Dunn-to the anti-genetics
   campaign launched by the Soviet agronomist Trofim Lysenko. The Cold War
   provided a hospitable environment for Lysenko's argument that genetics
   was racist, fascist science. In 1948, at a session of the Lenin
   All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Lysenko succeeded in banning
   genetics in the USSR. The movement against genetics soon spread to
   Soviet-allied states around the globe. Efforts to rebut Lysenkoism were
   launched in the United States, Great Britain, and other Western
   countries by scientists who saw Lysenko as a pseudo-scientific
   charlatan. Muller, Dobzhansky, and Dunn were among the biologists most
   active in this counter-campaign. The history of their campaign reveals
   the challenges scientists faced at an important moment in the field of
   biology, with the recent synthesis of genetics and Charles Darwin's
   theory of natural selection, as well as the difficulties of engaging in
   politics and persuading a lay audience to support their ideas.},

Abstract = {In contrast to analyses that regard health policy and industrial policy
   as anathema to each other, either because an emphasis on health implies
   neglect of industry or because gains in industrialization come at the
   expense of health, we show positive synergies between the two realms.
   Government intervention into the health sector can catalyze
   interventions to promote industrial development in the pharmaceutical
   sector, which in turn can make health policies more effective. We focus
   on two pathways by which health policies can trigger industrial
   policies. A demand-driven pathway entails government commitments in
   health revealing weaknesses and deficiencies in pharmaceutical
   production, and thus inspiring efforts to build capabilities to
   stabilize the flow of drugs to the public sector. A regulation-induced
   pathway consists of sanitary policies revealing mismatches between what
   is required for firms to continue to participate in the market and
   pharmaceutical producers' prevailing levels of capabilities, and
   government measures then being developed and deployed to address the
   mismatch. We demonstrate both pathways with the case of Brazil.},

Abstract = {The paper considers the extent to which domestic regional policy in the
   Central East European EU member states has been subsumed' into cohesion
   policy approaches. It acknowledges that directions of domestic regional
   policy change vary with processes of EU policy transfer, adaptation,
   emulation or resistance. This variation occurs across time and across
   member states. Crucially, the paper argues that interaction between
   cohesion policy and national regional policy systems also varies
   according to different regional policy components. Drawing on research
   from across the member states, the analysis breaks policy down into a
   number of key dimensions (objectives, instruments, spatial targeting and
   governance) and assesses the interaction between EU and domestic
   approaches and agendas.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COLD WAR STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {4-24},

Abstract = {This article gives an overview of TPBEDAMN, a large covert operation the
   U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) carried out in Iran for several
   years in the early 1950s. TPBEDAMN was a psychological warfare operation
   intended to undermine the influence of the Soviet Union and its Iranian
   ally, the Communist Tudeh Party, through covert propaganda and political
   action activities. When U.S. officials decided in early 1953 to
   overthrow Iran's prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddeq, they relied heavily
   on TPBEDAMN's large network of Iranian agents and subagents to plan and
   implement a coup d'etat. The overview of TPBEDAMN presented here helps
   to clarify both the nature of the organizational apparatus the CIA used
   against Mosaddeq and the broader context within which the coup occurred,
   especially the intense Cold War climate that prevailed and the
   prevalence of psychological warfare in this era.},

Abstract = {In the new country of Timor-Leste, women constituted in 2011 32 per cent
   of the parliament, a relatively high figure in the world and in the
   region. But to what extent has the presence of women in parliament
   contributed to progress towards gender equality? In this article we
   argue that the passage of a parliamentary resolution on
   gender-responsive budgeting in Timor-Leste was an act of substantive
   representation, and we draw on a range of data to examine what made it
   possible. We find that while newness', international norms, women's
   movement unity, women's machinery in government and parliament and
   networks linking them were important, it was the development of a
   cross-party parliamentary women's caucus that was crucial to success.
   The role of gender-focused parliamentary institutions in supporting
   critical actors has rarely been examined in the literature on
   substantive representation. This is in contrast to the rich literature
   on institutions such as women's policy agencies. Our study suggests that
   more focus on parliamentary institutions is needed to discover what
   enables women parliamentarians to become critical actors.},

Abstract = {The past 10years have seen an increase in legislation pertaining to
   marriage migration in Europe. Such attention betrays various concerns
   and anxieties that intersect not only with issues of risk management,
   rights, and citizenship, but also with less tangible dimensions such as
   emotions, which become embedded in legal as well as in surveillance
   practices. Emotions such as love are integral to the institutions,
   procedures, analyses and reflections, calculation, and tactics that
   Foucault identified as part of governmental processes; the latter should
   not necessarily be equated with (and limited to) rationalized
   technocratic processes detached from emotional components. Technologies
   of love are central to the governmentality of marriage migration; as
   modes of subjectification and governing practice, they connect intimacy
   with citizenship. More than the manifestation of the rationalization of
   a specific emotion, technologies of love allow for an exploration of
   what an engagement with emotions such as love does to governmentality.
   Illustrations of the ``attachment requirement{''} in Denmark, and the
   case of ``Catgate{''} in Great Britain, show that technologies of love
   play a significant role in stirring and disciplining specific migration
   flows (what kind of marriage migrants the state welcomes or keeps at
   bay), but also in challenging, even if inadvertently, those policies and
   practices designed to gauge ``true{''} relationships.},

Abstract = {This article evaluates mini-publics as a potential means of realizing
   deliberative democratic values in transnational contexts. A mini-public
   is a group of citizens that is chosen by random or near-random selection
   to debate matters of public concern in a suitably structured
   deliberative environment. The argument of the article is that
   mini-publics can be an important deliberative resource, but only as
   supplements to rather than replacements for alternative means of
   reforming transnational institutions. These forums can be used to
   prefigure transnational publics, but entrenched institutional
   assumptions about the delineation and definition of these publics must
   be subject to critical scrutiny by other elements of a transnational
   deliberative system. This argument is developed through a critical
   engagement with the literature on mini-publics, an analysis of a
   prominent example of a transnational mini-public, and a defense of the
   role of civil society as a resource for counteracting the shortcomings
   of mini-publics.},

Abstract = {For almost 30 years, industrialised, emerging and developing countries
   negotiate on a substantive patent law harmonisation under the umbrella
   of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Although a
   common approach or at least some vague outlines of common ground seem
   beyond reach, all participants regularly agree on a continuation of the
   discussion process. Despite an incessant wheeling and dealing among
   delegates and WIPO officials, the only effect is that discussions still
   keep going on. In our paper, we draw on a synthesis of both
   neo-mercantilist and liberal institutionalist insights in order to
   explain the vibrant stalemate of substantive patent law harmonisation
   talks. We argue that WIPO's involvement in the negotiation process
   offers an incentive structure for states to continue negotiations even
   when a successful conclusion appears rather improbable or downright
   undesirable. WIPO officials do not necessarily oppose the alternative
   deployment of their resources and services, because national
   negotiators' tactics at least partially coincide with their own
   interests. The paper concludes with a summary of the major results and a
   discussion on their potential empirical and theoretical relevance for
   further studies.},

Abstract = {Through the analysis of Regulation 1082/2006 (also known as The European
   Grouping of Territorial Co-operation'), which enables regional and local
   authorities from different European Union (EU) countries to set up
   co-operation groupings as legal entities for projects of cross-border
   and trans-European significance, this article aims to assess whether the
   daily politics of the EU is still state driven in a zero-sum game, and
   conversely, whether states and state representatives are no longer the
   only interface between the sub-national and supranational levels and the
   operation of power across the various levels of governance on a
   local/national/supranational level in a non-zero-sum game. The article
   will show that a type of multi-level governance' is emerging in
   cross-border regions in which cross-border activities are empowering the
   regional/local level (sub-national level), permitting it to
   circumvent/supersede the national level through a process of negotiation
   and alliances'. Furthermore, it will be highlighted that Regulation
   1082/2006 is a clear example of multi-level governance in practice.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article examines transitional justice in the age of the French
   Revolution. It argues that the democratizing thrust of the Revolution
   gave rise to new moral and political dilemmas around accountability and
   shows how French society faced these dilemmas in the aftermath of the
   Reign of Terror, an episode of massive repression and violence. In this
   sense, the article makes a case for a broader view of the history of
   transitional justice and, indeed, for the inclusion of historians in
   ongoing debates in the field. In making its case, the article draws on
   primary sources as well as on the extensive secondary literature on the
   French Revolution.(1)},

Title = {Practical Anarchism: Peer Mutualism, Market Power, and the Fallible
   State},
Journal = {POLITICS \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {213-251},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The article considers several working anarchies in the networked
   environment, and whether they offer a model for improving on the
   persistent imperfections of markets and states. I explore whether these
   efforts of peer mutualism in fact offer a sufficient range of
   capabilities to present a meaningful degree of freedom to those who rely
   on the capabilities it affords, and whether these practices in fact
   remain sufficiently nonhierarchical to offer a meaningful space of
   noncoercive interactions. The real utopias I observe here are perfect on
   neither dimension. Internally, hierarchy and power reappear, to some
   extent and in some projects, although they are quite different than the
   hierarchy of government or corporate organization. Externally, there are
   some spectacular successes, some failures to thrive, and many ambiguous
   successes. In all, present experience supports neither triumphalism nor
   defeatism in the utopian project. Peer models do work, and they do
   provide a degree of freedom in the capabilities they provide. But there
   is no inexorable path to greater freedom through voluntary open
   collaboration. There is a good deal of uncertainty and muddling through.
   The last part of the article suggests a theory of freedom that supports
   the significance of even these obviously imperfect peer systems with
   incomplete coverage of necessary human capabilities, and explains why
   expanding the domain of mutualism improves freedom and well-being under
   conditions of persistent market imperfection and an inevitably fallible
   state. Peer mutualism doesn't have to be perfect; it merely needs to
   offer a new dimension or sufficient diversity in how it instantiates
   capabilities and transmits power to offer us, who inhabit the systems
   that these peer systems perturb, a degree of freedom.},

Abstract = {This article systematically investigates both regional and
   issue-specific variation in external perceptions of the European Union
   (EU) as a global power and an international leader. While most studies
   on EU external perceptions focus on a one-dimensional vision of EU
   leadership and/or great-powerness, it is argued here that these
   perceptions are highly issue-specific, multilayered and differentiating.
   This study draws on data collected through elite interviews in three
   regions: the Pacific, Southeast Asia and Africa. The findings make a
   contribution to the debate on the perception of third states on the
   international role of the EU.},

Abstract = {European Union agencies are increasingly used to stimulate domestic
   compliance with EU law, without concrete evidence for whether and how
   these bodies actually realize this. Through in-depth analysis of the
   European Railway Agency, this article enhances our empirical
   understanding of the working and functioning of EU agencies, and
   advances our thinking about compliance in international settings. It
   leads us to the insight that in order to be capable of stimulating
   domestic compliance agencies should be flexible to resort to a mix of
   compliance strategies in order to be able to cope with the varying
   domestic compliance situations.},

Abstract = {This article aims to (1) describe trends for Chinese young adults'
   pathways into adulthood for birth cohorts that have experienced distinct
   historical events over the past half century and (2) examine factors
   that shape young adults' transitioning behavior. We draw data from the
   2005 to 2008 Chinese General Social Survey. In contrast to the
   increasingly protracted trend seen in many Western societies, the more
   recent Chinese cohorts transitioned to marriage and parenthood sooner
   than those who grew up during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural
   Revolution. The economic and education reforms since the late 1970s have
   greatly increased urban-rural disparity in youths' life trajectories
   despite their generally positive impact on young adults' educational
   attainment and economic wellbeing. While near-universal marriage and
   childbearing within marriage prevail and son preference remains strong
   in modern China, evidence suggests that today's young Chinese are
   exploring new pathways to adulthood, including cohabitation and
   premarital sex.},

Abstract = {Purpose - To examine children and youth's participation in civic society
   in Norway with a particular focus on immigrant children's participation
   in May 17 (Constitution Day).
   Methodology - We observed May 17 activities in Trondheim, Norway, over
   several years and conducted in-depth interviews with immigrant children
   about their participation in May 17 activities. We also relied on
   archival data and statistical reports of youth participation and
   immigration policy as well as attitudes toward immigrants to provide
   context for the observations and interviews.
   Findings - We found three clear patterns in the data. First, the
   children continually expressed their enjoyment of traditional
   intergenerational activities and in the discussion we see how certain
   activities helped to integrate themselves and their families into their
   communities. Second, the children displayed a keen knowledge of the 17th
   of May traditions, their history, and their symbolic value in Norwegian
   society. Third, especially the older children and youth often discussed
   their feelings of being Norwegian while also expressing an awareness of
   their immigrant status and cultural heritage. Their reflections on these
   dual identities provide more general insights into immigrant status,
   assimilation, and multiculturalism in Norway.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to broaden the study of Euroscepticism by developing
   a basic system of analysis for investigating civil-society-based
   opposition to European integration. Existing studies of Euroscepticism
   have almost exclusively focused on examining political parties and, as a
   result, theoretical approaches to understanding opposition to European
   integration have been strongly influenced by the party-based literature.
   By drawing from the body of work on both party-based Euroscepticism and
   European civil society, this article formulates a series of hypotheses
   and applies them to the case studies of Ireland, the United Kingdom and
   Denmark. Its main conclusion is that civil-society-based Euroscepticism
   generally conforms to the hard/soft model of opposition to the EU, but
   that this Euroscepticism is drawn from a more mainstream societal base
   than its party equivalent. Additionally, this study argues that
   civil-society-based Euroscepticism can be interpreted as a form of
   grass-roots civic engagement with the EU that mobilizes mainly around
   the salience of EU-related referendums.},

Abstract = {Surveys undergird government statistical systems and social scientific
   research throughout the world. Rates of nonresponse are rising in
   cross-sectional surveys (those conducted during a fixed period of time
   and not repeated). Although this trend worries those concerned with the
   validity of survey data, there is no necessary relationship between the
   rate of nonresponse and the degree of bias. A high rate of nonresponse
   merely creates the potential for bias, but the degree of bias depends on
   how factors promoting nonresponse are related to variables of interest.
   Nonresponse can be reduced by offering financial incentives to
   respondents and by careful design before entering the field, creating a
   trade-off between cost and potential bias. When bias is suspected, it
   can be countered by weighting individual cases by the inverse of their
   response propensity. Response propensities are typically estimated using
   a logistic regression equation to predict the dichotomous outcome of
   survey participation as a function of auxiliary variables. The
   Multi-level Integrated Database Approach employs multiple databases to
   collect as much information as possible about the target sample during
   the initial sampling stage and at all possible levels of aggregation to
   maximize the accuracy of estimated response propensities.},

Series = {Sociological Studies of Children and Youth},

Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to provide insight into high school students'
   understanding and experience of citizenship and civic engagement in the
   United States today.
   Methodological approach - To supplement literature that reports the
   causes and correlates of youth civic engagement, this qualitative study
   explores the form and meaning of citizenship to young Americans. Drawing
   on observations and interviews with 116 high school students aged 14-19
   years, this study explores how youth construct the meaning of
   citizenship and civic engagement.
   Findings - I find that race and racial identity are emergent in young
   people's construction of citizenship. Youth articulate the status of
   citizen on the basis of ``privilege'' and feel fortunate to be American.
   Forms of civic engagement vary by race with white students positioning
   themselves as helpers and delineating lower income minorities as
   ``others'' while also engaging in civic activity out of individual
   motivations and weak community connections. Minority youth express a
   desire to stay out of trouble, but also contest the boundaries of
   citizenship through forms of engagement that connect them to community.
   Value of paper - This paper contributes to understanding how race is
   emergent for young people's definitions of citizenship and civic
   actions. In addition to demonstrating how the categories of race and
   citizen are mutually constructed, it shows the value of looking beyond
   simple measurements of civic activity and exploring the meaning of youth
   civic work to gain insight into contemporary youth and democracy.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {353-367},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {One of the defining features of post-Cold War international relations
   has been the correlation of development practices and rationalities with
   those of security, and the emergence of what has been called the
   development-security nexus. While the development-security nexus remains
   relevant, semantic shifts in the conceptualization of both development
   and security are occurring. Demands for development are increasingly
   tied not simply to demands for security, but to a discursively new
   object of resilience. And this shift from security to resilience is
   likewise tied to a reconceptualization of development as sustainable
   development. Are these, then, merely semantic shifts, or do they signify
   changes in the rationalities that have shaped the development-security
   nexus during the post-Cold War period? Are the rationalities that
   distinguish resilience different to those underpinning demands for
   security? And are those of sustainable development different to what was
   once known simply as development? Does the weaving of a nexus of
   relations between sustainable development and resilience represent a
   departure from the development-security nexus in some way? And, if so,
   what explains that shift and what are its political implications? This
   article answers these questions through an analysis of the neoliberal
   biopolitics of the sustainable development-resilience nexus. While
   sustainable development deploys ecological reason to argue for the need
   to secure the life of the biosphere, neoliberalism prescribes economy as
   the very means of that security. Economic reason is conceived within
   neoliberalism as a servant of ecological reason, claiming to secure life
   from economy through a promotion of the capacities of life for economy.
   This is the paradoxical foundation on which neoliberalism constructs its
   appropriation of sustainable development. Sustainable development and
   neoliberalism are not the same, nor is the former simply a proxy of the
   latter, but they do come into contact powerfully on the terrain of their
   rationalities of security which, on account of the interplay between
   ecological and economic reason, is increasingly conceptualized as
   resilience. This surface of contact ought to make for a tense and
   political field of contestation, but has instead made largely for a
   strategically manipulable relation between the two doctrines.},

Abstract = {China's rapid integration into the global economy has had undeniable
   implications for the Chinese state - it raises questions about how the
   state has simultaneously encouraged globalization and, at the same time,
   tried to control for globalization's impact on China's economy, its
   culture, and on state policy and the state itself. These implications
   have not been lost on PRC-based scholars of international and
   comparative political economy, who have focused considerable - if, as we
   shall argue, incomplete - attention on globalization's challenge to
   state sovereignty, to economic sovereignty, and on the economic role of
   the state. The article highlights features of the Chinese scholarship
   that are quite distinctive. This literature reflexively favours a strong
   role for the state in the context of globalization. We also observe that
   the literature in general is not oriented to theory-building. Instead,
   scholarship is largely policy-driven; there is a strong impulse to
   provide positive policy advice to Chinese policy-makers. Most striking,
   the understanding of the state in the Chinese literature remains
   partial; there is a marked reluctance to delve into either empirical or
   theoretical study of the Chinese state itself - the state itself as a
   subject of critical analysis is rarely considered.},

Abstract = {Recessions can alter family life by constraining the choices that
   individuals and couples make concerning their family lives and by
   activating the family's role as an emergency support system. Both
   effects were visible during and after the Great Recession. Fertility
   declined by 9 to 11 percent, depending on the measure, and the decline
   was greater in states that experienced higher increases in unemployment.
   The decline was greater among younger women, which suggests postponement
   rather than forgoing of births. The fall in fertility was sharpest for
   Hispanics, a result the authors attribute to a drop in Mexican
   immigration, which reduced the number of recent immigrants, the group
   with the highest fertility. Substantial increases occurred in the
   percentage of young adults, single and married, who lived with their
   parents, augmenting a long-term trend toward intergenerational
   coresidence. There was a slight decline in divorce and separation in
   states with higher unemployment.},

Abstract = {To become successful, the American policy of promoting democracy abroad
   needs to be scaled down and decoupled from geopolitics. In the
   post-Soviet world, the democracy-geopolitics doublespeak breeds cynicism
   and achieves mixed results at best. Particularly discouraging are the
   outcomes of democracy promotion in the so-called cleft countries,
   straddled by a cultural divide. In Ukraine, American foreign policy
   achieved some success at the price of intensifying inter-regional
   antagonisms, which subsequently compromised and offset the progress that
   had been achieved in democratic forms of governance. In Belarus,
   democracy promotion failed altogether because inter-regional antagonisms
   in that country are too modest and are therefore difficult to leverage.},

Abstract = {While struggles over land dispossession have recently proliferated
   across the developing world and become particularly significant in
   India, this paper argues that existing theories of political agency do
   not capture the specificity of the politics of dispossession. Based on
   two years of ethnographic research on anti-dispossession movements
   across rural India, the paper argues that the dispossession of land
   creates a specific kind of politics, distinct not just from labor
   politics, but also from various other forms of peasant politics that
   have been theorized in the social sciences. It illustrates how the
   process of land dispossession itself shapes the targets, strategy and
   tactics, organization, social composition, goals, and ideologies of
   anti-dispossession struggles. It concludes with reflections on why land
   conflicts are less easily institutionalized than labor conflicts and may
   therefore constitute a significantly disruptive force in the emerging
   centers of global capitalism for the foreseeable future.},

Abstract = {Theories and analyses of regionalism, from both orthodox' and critical'
   strands of international political economy (IPE), have tended to
   conceptualise regional integration as a process led by intra-regional
   actors typically in reaction to external forces such as globalisation
   and the hegemonic power of international actors. This article sheds new
   light on theories of regionalism by arguing that international actors
   can have a direct and significant influence on the dynamics of
   regionalism, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, by examining the
   influence of the European Union (EU) on the Southern African Development
   Community (SADC). Building on the recent literature on Africa and
   international relations, which shows how lines of sovereignty between
   domestic and international actors are blurred in the case of African
   political economies, the article shows how the EU played a significant
   role in the SADC's inception and has been directly influential in
   shaping the SADC's strategies and priorities in the post-Lome period. In
   the latter instance, this article explains how the EU's institutional
   embeddedness in the SADC's aid structures and its asymmetrical
   bargaining power in the SADC Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) has
   encouraged the SADC's pursuit of a neoliberal, trade-oriented form of
   regionalism.},

Abstract = {The article discusses the role of norms in the foreign policy making of
   Central and East European states in the 2000s. It deconstructs the
   normative foundations of the so-called Atlanticist' orientation of
   Central and East European states, going beyond the standard neorealist'
   notion whereupon strategic and security concerns lead small states to
   align with superpowers. The case studies of the Czech and Slovak
   republics demonstrate that norms, such as human rights and democracy,
   have an autonomous and traceable effect on state behaviour. More
   specifically, we argue that norms have translated themselves into policy
   outcomes via the agency of influential norm entrepreneurs', such as
   ex-dissidents and their associates.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the causes of the crisis in Romania and other
   new EU member states were different from those affecting Western Europe
   or the US. The main argument of this paper is that bad domestic
   monetary, fiscal and regulatory policies were the real crisis
   generators, while exogenous crisis mechanisms, including contagion from
   the global financial crisis, were just the trigger. Romania, and other
   new EU member states, has been facing the crisis of a consumption-led
   development model, not just a financial crisis imported from more
   developed economies. This paper brings insights into the impact of the
   flat-tax regime on consumption and the impact of speculative capital
   inflows disguised as foreign direct investments.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {291-312},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper examines the ability of Board members of the most important
   multilateral donor to developing countries, the International
   Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank, to influence IDA
   allocations toward their home countries. I show that a system of Bank
   staff ratings of individual countries' policies, which has become more
   important in IDA lending over time, has systematically reduced the
   informal power of Board members. I show that while IDA Board members
   received more IDA commitments than their counterparts prior to 1989,
   this influence has disappeared since, as the importance of the policy
   index has increased. The findings are robust to the inclusion of fixed
   effects and a variety of relevant controls. In order to further support
   my argument, I also investigate the influence of Board membership on the
   Bank's policy index itself. I am unable to establish any positive
   relationship between Board membership and the index, either during the
   Cold War or afterwards. The findings not only shed important light on
   the internal workings of World Bank allocations to poor countries, but
   also highlight the ways in which institutional designs can affect the
   balance of informal power in international institutions.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how credible commitment evolves when sovereign
   states borrow jointly. In 2006, Venezuela and Argentina issued a package
   of joint' sovereign bonds, which were later tradable separately. Despite
   the fact that Venezuela did not explicitly guarantee the Argentine
   component of the bond, this paper shows through a series of GARCH models
   that the financial markets have traded the bond on the basis of news
   about Venezuela's politics, macro economy and its commitment to the bond
   and other regional integration projects. This is because the bond was
   embedded in a more extensive set of financial and political
   relationships between the two countries, and served as a commitment
   mechanism, enhancing Argentine credibility. The article demonstrates
   that bilateral economic and political relationships can serve as a
   credible commitment device in the absence of changes to domestic
   institutions or longer-term re-establishment of reputation.},

Abstract = {By triggering a wave of organisational restructuring, reconfiguration of
   supply chains and consolidation of business processes at multinational
   companies, the crisis offered significant upgrading opportunities for
   peripheral actors in globalised production networks (the so-called
   global value chains). Drawing on Hungarian case studies of local
   subsidiaries in the automotive and electronics industries, this essay
   investigates the crisis-induced product, process and functional
   upgrading opportunities in low-cost locations. We show Hungary's high
   level of integration into global value chains and document the rapidly
   ongoing process of functional upgrading.},

Abstract = {This article aims to assess the role of neoliberal ideas in shaping
   Russia's transition to a market economy. Prevailing ideas of the
   Washington Consensus undoubtedly encouraged Russia's leaders to embrace
   radical reforms, but Russia's reformers were not blindly following an
   ideological agenda set for them in Washington, DC. The actual policies
   that were implemented diverged considerably from the prevailing
   neoliberal orthodoxy and were heavily shaped by the self-interest of the
   elites who were making the policy decisions. While prices were freed and
   international trade and currency flows opened up, an insider-dominated
   privatization process left the Russian economy in the hands of a narrow
   circle of oligarchs. Russia's corrupt, oil-dependent and state-centered
   economy is far removed from the decentralized, competitive market system
   that the reformers had envisaged. Democracy, which was initially seen as
   integral to the transition process, also fell by the wayside. While
   critics argue that Russia suffered from an overdose of market
   fundamentalism', neoliberals themselves still insist that Russia did not
   go far enough in unleashing genuine market forces. Either way, Russia
   has now joined the global market economy, while at the same time
   preserving many of the institutional features that are the product of
   its unique geography and historical heritage.},

Abstract = {This article examines the European Commission's contribution to the
   configuration of internal European Union borders. The focus is on
   several policy areas related to free movement of people. It engages with
   the literature examining the tools used by the Commission in influencing
   the EU decision-making process. It also looks into the studies
   summarizing the developments in EU migration that show the restrained
   manoeuvring space the Commission has in the policy areas. Building on
   these, the discursive techniques that are likely to be used in
   Commission articulations are conceptualized. The analysis of Commission
   documents shows that in the common visa policy and the common European
   asylum system (CEAS), the Commission has configured borders indirectly.
   In distinction, in the fields of intra-Community border controls and
   movement for work purposes of highly skilled third country nationals
   (TCNs), the Commission has managed to play a leadership role and to
   significantly and directly challenge the underlying logic upon which
   these policies are based.},

Abstract = {This article addresses a gap in the international political economy
   (IPE) literature on housing finance by highlighting the ways in which
   the deepening of mortgage debt is part of a broader attempt to
   individualise and (re)privatise relations of social reproduction under
   neoliberalism. While the extension and deepening of debt has been
   underpinned by policies and discourses that assume the formal equality
   of individuals, the attempt to erase the gendered subject in the context
   of ongoing inequalities in paid labour markets, in asset ownership and
   in the division of unpaid labour has served to reproduce various
   overlapping social divisions and inequalities. In linking social
   reproduction to financial markets, the promotion of homeownership in the
   US has also rendered the social reproduction of present and future
   generations increasingly insecure. This work contributes to feminist and
   other critical IPE debates by highlighting the ways in which
   accumulation in financial markets has been based on the perpetuation of
   divisions and inequalities between social classes, between men and women
   and along certain racial and ethnic lines. It also centralises the role
   of the state in conditioning these processes.},

   Reassessing French Colonial Security after the Setif Uprising, 1945},
Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {28},

Pages = {377-396},
Abstract = {In May 1945, as France celebrated the end of the Second World War in
   Europe, its foremost overseas dependency, Algeria, erupted into
   rebellion. Revisiting the roles and responses of the colonial security
   forces to what came to be known as the Setif uprising, this article
   suggests two things. One is that the intensity of repressive violence
   pursued becomes more explicable once we consider the part played by
   political intelligence gathering in the operation of French colonial
   government in Algeria. The other is that the decision to use the
   political intelligence amassed before, during, and after the rebellion
   to coerce the Algerian population at the rebellion's epicentre signified
   a fundamental shift in the nature of the French colonial state in
   Algeria. Intelligence-led security policing, much of it later adopted by
   police agencies in metropolitan France at the height of the Algerian
   War, became more repressive, less selective, and highly violent.},

Abstract = {In the 1980s, the Soviet Union was believed to have targeted Sweden by
   sending submarines into Swedish archipelagos and naval bases, which
   forced Prime Minister Olof Palme to terminate his ambitious foreign
   policy. The `imminent Soviet threat' changed Swedish public opinion
   drastically. Twenty years later, statements made by the responsible US
   and UK leaders, including then US Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
   and then UK Navy Minister Keith Speed, show that these operations were
   run by US and British submarines testing Swedish coastal defences. Then
   US Secretary of Navy John Lehman and the Swedish Secretary of the
   Submarine Inquiry, Mathias Mossberg, indicate that these operations were
   also deception operations and psychological operations. Swedish former
   defence ministers have said that `it was wrong to point to the Soviet
   Union', indicating that the more visible submarines may have been from
   the West. Ralf Lillbacka's article in Intelligence and National Security
   in 2010 does not take this information into consideration. The technical
   evidence we now have is proof of Western submarines operating in Swedish
   archipelagos. This evidence confirms the statements made by responsible
   leaders.},

   Constructing a Global Market for Microfinance},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},

Abstract = {This article argues that the concept of performativity deepens our
   understanding of contemporary, expertise-driven processes of global
   economic governance. Tracing the World Bank's role in constructing a
   global market for microfinance, the paper suggests that the World Bank
   was instrumental in translating selected parts of economic models into
   practice, thereby changing microfinance practices globally.
   Socio-technical networks centered on the World Bank were created to
   equip actors to become part of a global market, which incorporated not
   only donors but also commercial investors. The paper makes a critical
   intervention in the performativity literature by arguing for the need to
   take positional power and dominance in the socio-technical networks of
   International Organizations more seriously. This move improves our
   ability to specify how economic ideas and models are translated into
   practice in transnational arenas.},

Abstract = {In this paper we examine how Finnish Governments dismantled the Nordic
   welfare state paradigm from the 1990s onwards and adopted Schumpeterian
   ideas of a competitive workfare state. In the early 1990s, Finland went
   through a financial crisis that was the most severe in OECD countries
   since the Second World War and came to play a major role in the paradigm
   change. In the crisis, the Ministry of Finance gained a central role as
   a consensus-building power broker, and formulated a political strategy
   of national competitiveness, which was adopted as a rationale of power
   for consensual governments and has been maintained since. We suggest
   that financial crises can become formative moments in which new ideas
   are adopted and policies are reformulated. They can also become moments
   which provide opportunity to overcome citizen opinion. In Finland, the
   wide popular and party support for the Nordic welfare model was not
   reflected in the new paradigm.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the Roman Catholic Church's role in the
   process of European integration from the first Hallstein Commission in
   1958 to the failure of the Holy See's application to establish a
   diplomatic representation at the European Economic Community in 1964.
   The article focuses on the Church's response toward emerging European
   institutions and shows that local mobilization in Luxembourg,
   Strasbourg, and Brussels was instrumental in shaping relations between
   the Catholic Church and the European Communities (EC). The Church's
   position toward the EC, placing local communities as prime actors in
   dialogue with European institutions, reflected the sensitive nature of
   religion during the Cold War.},

Abstract = {Rewarding regulation involves pursuing the complex goal of bringing
   labor protection and firms' economic performance together. A central
   element in achieving such goals refers to how regulatory bureaucracies
   operate. This paper examines the organizational structures, processes,
   and internal dynamics that allow regulatory bureaucracies to innovate
   and meet such developmental challenges. It reviews well-established
   interpretations about state bureaucracies that have emphasized either
   hierarchical structures and control processes or discretion and disperse
   individual behaviors. In addition, it suggests alternative analytical
   paths for combining flexibility and control by examining the relational
   processes and dynamics within bureaucracies. The analysis of the
   Brazilian Labor Inspectorate, based on qualitative data and extensive
   fieldwork, and of other empirical examples from the literature,
   indicates that internal tensions and conflicts instigate a process of
   technical vigilance between members of the same bureaucracy, inducing
   innovation and responsible uses of discretion.},

Abstract = {Jean-Pierre Bemba is on trial before the International Criminal Court
   (ICC) based on the legal theory of command responsibility for crimes
   allegedly committed by Congolese soldiers deployed in the Central
   African Republic (CAR) at the request of the country's President
   Ange-Felix Patasse during the 2002-2003 conflict. Various ICC actors,
   including prosecutors, judges, witnesses, defense lawyers and victim
   representatives, have uncritically adopted the term `Banyamulenge,'
   ordinarily an ethnonym for an eastern Congolese community, to refer to
   the purported perpetrators of these crimes. This article digs into the
   origins of the collective labeling of Bemba's combatants in the CAR. It
   also examines the possible impact that negative narratives associated
   with Banyamulenge in the Bemba case may have on the already explosive
   identity politics in (eastern) Democratic Republic of Congo.},

Abstract = {The emergence of quasi-markets - new regulatory tools to design and
   manage public service delivery through competition - has led to a new
   ecology for local authorities, who increasingly operate alongside
   for-profit, not-for-profit and other governmental contractors for social
   service provision. This raises a series of challenges related to the
   secondary regulatory measures to correct for market and government
   imperfections under conditions of competition between entities with
   different objective functions. In shared governance systems, such as the
   European Union structural funds, additional tensions are generated by
   the double role of the public sector as purchaser and potential provider
   of services. This analysis presents empirical evidence from a
   transitional context in which quasi-markets have been newly established,
   based on data from the Romanian human resource development operational
   programme (RO-SOPHRD) between 2007 and 2011. These findings enhance our
   understanding of the dynamics of distortions created by quasi-market
   environments for public service delivery in emerging economies.},

Abstract = {Using an event study approach, this article examines whether crisis
   meetings of European heads of state and government, as well as their
   agreed and communicated results, had a significant impact on Europe's
   financial markets. The analysis is based on daily data for seven Member
   States of the eurozone (France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,
   Portugal and Spain), starting in autumn 2008 and covering the time
   period until April 2012. To summarize the findings, the high-profile
   meetings appear to have only minor effects that ceased quickly.
   Therefore, it can be concluded that investors consider Europe's economic
   and political crisis management insufficient and its communication
   strategy little convincing. While controlling for additional effects, it
   was found that European Central Bank policy measures may have had
   short-run effects on bond returns and the exchange rate, but no intended
   influence on stock prices, except for Italy.},

Abstract = {James J. Angleton, who served as chief of counterintelligence for the
   U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from 1954 to 1974, was an
   important figure in the Cold War and, in a sense, the first line of
   defense against clandestine Soviet intelligence operations directed
   against the United States and its allies. In 1975 a U.S. Senate
   investigative committeeinformally known as the Church Committee and led
   by Senator Frank Churchcalled Angleton to testify in public on his
   approach to counterintelligence, especially how he had become involved
   in illegal domestic operations in the United States. His testimony to
   committee staff investigators preceding the hearing, along with his
   public statements to senators during the hearing, displayed an extreme
   view of the global Communist threat. Amid ongoing revelations in the
   mid-1970s of illegal CIA actions, Angleton proved unable to mount an
   effective public defense of his approach.},

Abstract = {The design of current regional economic organizations (REOs) is
   remarkably diverse. Some REOs address numerous economic issues, while
   others have only limited mandates. Some REOs have an independent
   bureaucracy and a legalized dispute settlement mechanism (DSM), while
   others do not. What determines this institutional variation? Thinking
   about these institutions as devices that generate credible commitment to
   a rule-based regional cooperation, institutionalists maintain that the
   intensity of commercial ties determine regional institutionalization and
   institutional independence. A number of studies question this logic and
   argue that it is ``na < ve.{''} Empirical evidence on the links between
   commerce, economic scope, and regional institutions is scant, however.
   Using an original data set that contains detailed information on the
   economic activities and institutional structure of twenty-eight REOs
   over three decades, this paper presents one of the first systematic
   analyses of these relationships. The empirical analysis indicates that
   the institutionalist wisdom is right after all. It shows that higher
   levels of regional trade are associated with greater
   institutionalization and economic scope, but only if implementation of
   signed agreements is accounted for, and that regional commerce and
   greater economic scope are associated with more independent
   bureaucracies and more legalized DSMs.},

Title = {Measuring Change of Capitalist Varieties: Reflections on Method,
   Illustrations from the BRICs},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},

Pages = {503-532},

Abstract = {How to indicate institutional diversity and gradual change in capitalist
   political economies? What is the appropriate typological method, how
   could a suitable typology look? In the Weberian tradition, this article
   pleads for a method that rigorously distinguishes ideal types from
   empirical cases. Ideal types (like liberal capitalism) idealise reality
   by emphasising certain aspects, cases (like Brazilian capitalism) are
   hybrids more or less approximating the types. Contrasting static
   classifications that do not allow for gradual change, the latter has to
   be understood as the movement of cases in the field between the types.
   Using the state-economy and capital-labour relationships as criteria the
   article proposes a typology consisting of liberal, statist, corporatist,
   meso-communitarian and patrimonial types. Liberalism, statism and
   particularly patrimonialism are relevant for emerging economies. In the
   second half, the article illustrates its methodological recommendation
   by indicatively mapping institutional change from 1998 to 2008 in
   political economies that recently gained importance: the BRICs (Brazil,
   Russia, India, China), Turkey and a few Eastern European ones. It turns
   out that most of them liberalised but that this change was rather modest
   in the BRICs, while it was more significant in Eastern Europe. Yet
   statism and patrimonialism appear still to be strong.},

Abstract = {Most descriptions of the spread of neoliberal economic policies since
   the 1980s overlook the significant contribution of international
   organizations not only to the dissemination of these policies, but also
   to their making. The scholarship often regards international
   organizations as passive transmission belts that merely comply with the
   demands of their member-states. Scholars who do identify the
   constitutive role of international organizations consider them to be
   enthusiastic supporters of the neoliberal project. There were cases,
   however, when international organizations were opposed to neoliberal
   reforms imposed from above. This paper draws on the experience of the
   World Health Organization (WHO) to show that in the process of adapting
   to the emerging neoliberal regime, international bureaucracies actively
   restructured this regime in accordance with their own institutional
   cultures. Some neoliberal prescriptions were successfully transmitted,
   but others were transformed, with the result that the global regime was
   hardly monolithic and included elements that were introduced by the
   international bureaucracies themselves. In developing this argument, the
   paper identifies the adaptive strategies that allow international
   bureaucracies, in spite of their vulnerability to external forces, to
   incorporate their own organizational agendas into what has consequently
   become a more heterogeneous global neoliberal regime.},

Abstract = {What does it cost to do business under a dictator? In 1949 the Soviet
   state had entered its most secretive phase. One of the Gulag's most
   important secrets was the location of its labour camps. As this secret
   was guarded more closely, camps found it increasingly difficult to do
   business without disclosing a state secret: their own location. For
   months and then years Gulag officials worked around this dilemma,
   expending considerable efforts. Rather than resolve it, they eventually
   normalised it. This study of the transaction costs of an autocratic
   regime raises basic questions about how Soviet secrecy was calibrated.},

Abstract = {In this article I investigate the possible uses of Cynthia Enloe's idea
   of patriarchal confusion' in understanding gay and lesbian military
   identity. Through an analysis of military discourses surrounding the
   inclusion of gays and lesbians in the British military since 2000, and
   using original interview data with serving personnel, I examine the
   contradictory ways in which queer identity has been incorporated within
   a military dominated by heteronormative masculinity. By examining
   conflicting attitudes towards gay and lesbian soldiers' participation in
   Pride marches, I show how patriarchal understandings of military
   identity become confused' by both heterosexual and lesbian, gay,
   bisexual and transgender personnel. I argue for a move away from viewing
   the integration of non-traditional recruits through the dichotomous lens
   of subversion or co-option, and instead call for an engagement with the
   ambiguities and confusions that arise from that integration. Reading
   this confusion through Butler's concept of performativity, I demonstrate
   how even confused ideas about gender can reproduce patriarchy, and why
   patriarchy often simultaneously fails to reproduce itself. A
   performative reading of patriarchal confusion' therefore indicates the
   radically contingent character of the reproduction of patriarchal norms
   in the military and suggests that sites of confusion might be fertile
   grounds for feminist interventions.},

Title = {The limits and variety of risk-based governance: The case of flood
   management in Germany and England},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {236-257},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Risk-based governance is argued by many to hold the promise of a more
   rational and efficient state, by making explicit the limitations of
   state interventions and focusing finite resources on those targets where
   probable damage is greatest. This paper challenges the assumption that
   risk-based governance has the potential for universal and uniform
   application, by comparing contemporary flood management in Germany and
   England. On first inspection, flooding appears to be a paradigmatic case
   of risk colonizing European policy discourses, with the traditional
   notion of flood defense giving way to flood risk management in the
   context of climate change, increasingly frequent flood disasters,
   political and cost pressures on flood protection, and publicly available
   European-wide flood assessments. Drawing on in-depth empirical research,
   this paper shows how the role, and even the definition, of risk is
   institutionally shaped, and how the respective institutional
   environments of German and English flood management practices impede and
   promote risk colonization. In particular, the use and conceptualizations
   of risk in governance are variously promoted, filtered, or constrained
   by the administrative procedures, structures, and political expectations
   embedded within flood management and wider polities of each country. The
   findings of this research are important for the design and
   implementation of supranational policies and regulations that endorse
   risk-based approaches, such as the recent EU Flood Directive, as well as
   scholarly debate as to how to legitimately define the limits of
   governance in the face of uncertainty and accountability pressures.},

Title = {The Universal Basic Income: Why Utopian Thinking Matters, and How
   Sociologists Can Contribute to It},

Abstract = {Utopian thinking consists of formulating proposals for radical reforms,
   justifying them on the basis of normative principles combined with the
   best possible scientific analysis of the root causes of the problems the
   proposals are meant to address, and subjecting these proposals to
   unindulgent critical scrutiny. Such utopian thinking is indispensable,
   and contributing to it is part of sociology's core business. This
   article illustrates these claims by considering one particular utopian
   proposal: an unconditional basic income paid to every member of society
   on an individual basis, without means test or work requirement. It
   summarizes the main arguments that support this proposal, mentions a
   number of contexts in which it is being taken seriously, and sketches a
   number of ways in which sociological insights and research are crucially
   relevant to the discussion of the economic and political sustainability
   of an unconditional basic income.},

Abstract = {This article proposes an analytical model of implementation that is used
   to examine the implementation of the European Union's cultural heritage
   policy in Bulgaria. It begins by outlining a rational choice framework
   conceptualizing implementation as a three-stage game with key roles for
   an enforcer, domestic policy-makers and implementing actors. This model
   is then applied to the case of transposition and implementation of the
   EU rules regarding cultural heritage in Bulgaria. Different
   implementation outcomes stemming from one and the same formal policy are
   found. To explain the variation of implementation outcomes, the
   theorized model is applied and it is found that, given the high levels
   of polarization between political decision-makers, the implementing
   actors have broad discretion to apply different informal policies. The
   analysis of implementation also shows that under these conditions
   implementing players have followed their normative orientations to apply
   different policies as if they live in parallel universes of
   implementation.},

Abstract = {This article aims to uncover major career trajectories among one
   particular cohort of Chinese urban residents whose transition to
   adulthood was greatly disrupted by the Cultural Revolution. Based on the
   career histories of respondents from a subsample of the 2003 China's
   General Social Survey, and with the adoption of the optimal matching and
   cluster analysis techniques, the analysis reveals a four-cluster
   typology for career sequences of this cohort from their first employment
   to the labor market status in the 25th year since first entry. The
   preservation of the temporal order of career events helps to define a
   discernible career pathway type for each cluster. A multinomial logistic
   regression explains how cluster membership relates to a string of
   background characteristics, specifically showing that the
   state-initiated rustication experience in youthhood and family resources
   impacted the Cultural Revolution cohort's labor market prospects after
   the economic transformation.},

Abstract = {This article offers an overview and reconsideration of the idea of
   European demoicracy in the context of the current crisis. It defines
   demoicracy' as a Union of peoples, understood both as states and as
   citizens, who govern together but not as one', and argues that the
   concept is best understood as a third way, distinct from both national
   and supranational versions of single demos polities. The concept of
   demoicracy' can serve both as an analytical lens for the European
   Union-as-is and as a normative benchmark, but one which cannot simply be
   inferred from its praxis. Instead, the article deploys a
   normative-inductive' approach according to which the EU's normative core
   transnational non-domination and transnational mutual recognition is
   grounded on what the EU still seeks to escape. Such norms need to be
   protected and perfected if the EU is to live up to its demoicratic
   nature. The article suggests ten tentative guiding principles for the EU
   to continue turning these norms into practice.},

Abstract = {This article challenges the way liberal economic governance has come to
   be theorised as a passive and depoliticised form of governance. Using
   the classic case of the gold standard, it shows how state intervention
   came to be shaped by considerations of state power and diverged
   considerably from the traditional emphasis on free markets and stable
   conditions of investments. As I argue, the gold standard was constructed
   through political struggles over monetary governance which involved
   significant constraints for capitalist investors. Its institutions
   helped establish a new structure for exerting control over finance. By
   resituating the gold standard in a broader historical perspective, I
   show how nineteenth-century monetary governance, far from leading to a
   retreat of the state, established in fact the foundations of a new form
   of state intervention: modern central banking.},

Abstract = {Euroscepticism has been treated as a marginal phenomenon in European
   Union studies. It has been portrayed as exceptional, belonging to the
   realm of pariah politics. This article contests this view arguing that
   although the term was first coined during the mid-1980s in Britain, its
   features were present since the early stages of integration. Pointing to
   its changing nature over time, it calls for a holistic approach that
   would examine the phenomenon beyond the study of party politics and
   public opinion. It urges scholars to explicitly treat Euroscepticism as
   an independent as well as a dependent variable. The next generation of
   Euroscepticism should be performing comparative analysis identifying and
   explaining different patterns of opposition to the EU, and focusing on
   their implications for the process of European integration, the
   direction of EU policy, domestic European politics and the development
   of EU studies.},

Abstract = {One of the fundamental questions in the study of international political
   economy (IPE) is the foundation of order, stability and justice in
   international politics and economy. The study of international
   institutions and global governance is part of this larger inquiry. With
   China's rising importance in the global economic system, it might be
   expected that IPE scholarship in China would give rise to uniquely
   Chinese' approaches to this area of inquiry, approaches informed by
   China's position in the world and China's rich cultural and intellectual
   traditions. However, our examination of Chinese scholarship shows that
   thus far, it has produced little new knowledge and theoretical
   innovation. Why has this been the case? We argue that it is because (1)
   as a new field of study, IPE in China - including the study of
   international institutions and global governance - is still under the
   strong socialization effect of Western scholarship; and (2) the
   institutional environment in China constrains the kind of research that
   promises new insights and innovative perspectives. We also discuss how
   scholarship in China could contribute to the positive evolution of IPE
   globally in the future, and the obstacles that may hinder this
   development.},

Abstract = {The EU accession aspirations of the de jureEuropean country Turkey
   remain a highly contested issue. Due to the national preferences and
   mainly socio-cultural resentment in some EU Member States and due to its
   limited integration capacity, the EU offered Ankara a discriminatory
   full membership minus'. The current EU law and the various paradigms of
   differentiated integration' do not only provide the spatial, temporal
   and thematic scope for a conceptual framework on accession alternatives,
   they also limit it. In this context, the gradual integration/membership
   concept could be an interesting option for both parties. The
   depreciation of full membership in the case of Turkey has weakened the
   EU conditionality policy in general. On the other hand, external'
   flexibilization can help to overcome deadlock by allowing the Member
   States and accession candidates such as Turkey to co-operate at
   different levels of integration.},

Abstract = {This article attempts to conceptualise violence, and to determine the
   value of that concept as a lens through which to understand the Soviet
   collectivisation drive and its legacy. The central claim is that
   objective violence, the very real experience of the collectivisation
   drive, becomes subjective violence as it is internalised over time. In
   the context of the process of collectivisation violence, the lines
   between victims and perpetrators were blurred in important ways. The end
   of the Soviet Union triggered a re-evaluation of the meaning of that
   violence which is still in a state of flux today.},

Abstract = {This article quantifies for the first time the European employment
   effects of extra-EU exports and the correct number of jobs generated
   through the intra-EU trade (single market) associated with the
   production of such exports. The literature has neglected very often the
   latter effects mainly due to the lack of an appropriate methodology and
   data. The main results of the article show that, between 2000 and 2007,
   an increasing number of European jobs were dependent on extra-EU exports
   and on the strengthening of the trade linkages across the internal
   market. During the period considered, the EU employment supported by
   extra-EU exports grew from 22 to 25 million jobs, out of which 9 million
   jobs (in 2007) were due to spillover and feedback effects associated
   with the single market. Between 2000 and 2007 the EU also became a more
   vertically integrated economy, and reduced the labour intensity of the
   extra-EU exports.},

Abstract = {Although the impact of World Bank and IMF structural adjustment loans on
   developing country borrowers has been the subject of considerable
   analysis, our understanding of the origins of these operations remains
   poor. This article rectifies this deficiency by providing an account of
   the genesis of the Bank's program of structural adjustment. Drawing on
   documents from the Bank's archives as well as interviews with former
   Bank officials, the paper argues that the creation of structural
   adjustment lending in 1980 resulted from frustration among the Bank's
   senior management at the slow disbursement of the organization's regular
   project loans. Rather than a reaction to demands from powerful states,
   as many observers have assumed, structural adjustment was an internally
   driven response to flaws in the Bank's operations. In emphasizing the
   Bank's autonomy, this article supplements approaches that emphasize the
   importance of budget maximization and mission creep as determinants of

Abstract = {Why have some democracies made considerable progress in prosecuting
   dictatorship-era human rights violations or in publicly exposing the
   truth about repression while others still have amnesty laws that
   prevent, or at least hinder, even the judicial review of such abuses?
   This article compares Spain, Chile and Argentina to understand the
   impact of their contrasting histories of repression on how they have
   dealt with their violent pasts. I assess whether a greater degree of
   legal repression and direct judicial involvement in repression explains
   why there is more resistance to prosecuting those responsible for human
   rights violations, establishing truth commissions or annulling the
   political sentences of the past during democratization. Once democracy
   has been consolidated, different dynamics may emerge, but this history
   of judicial complicity has proved to be a key factor in understanding
   the continuous lack of judicial accountability in Spain.},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of law in a number of disputes concerning
   collective memory and the legacy of colonialism in France, and addresses
   the implications of this intersection of law, memory and politics
   concerning colonialism for French national identity. It is argued that
   the trials and other legal interventions analysed in this article are a
   means by which contested versions of the colonial past claim publicity
   and legitimacy. The article illustrates the state's use of law to
   maintain a particular narrative of French colonialism, increasingly
   contested in the present by postcolonial memory politics, and analyses
   the role and impact of collective memory, as constructed in the legal
   realm, in how nations address the past. Through this French case study,
   the article argues that the law has particular relevance as an
   instrument of history and memory politics in `belated' transitional
   justice settings.},

Abstract = {Faced with the twin challenges of anthropogenic climate change and peak
   oil', the need for an urgent and radical transformation of transport
   energy has been widely recognised. Adopting a neo-Polanyian economic
   sociology approach, this article asks what conditions European
   governance capacity to respond to these challenges, at either national
   or regional levels, using biofuels as a case study. It asks if the
   complexity of its political institutions, and the heterogeneity of
   interests and economic organisations, present the biggest obstacle of
   all' (Cohen 2007) to reduce fossil fuel dependency. By examining the
   European Commission level and comparing five countries, evidence is
   produced for a political failure in terms of continued fossil fuel
   dependency. Incumbent interests in the agricultural sector and a
   distinctively European legacy of a transport fleet dependent on fossil
   diesel, have led to a marriage of convenience between rapeseed farmers
   and vehicle manufacturers. As a consequence, rather than escaping from
   the path dependency on fossil fuels (Unruh 2000), Europe has gone down a
   cul-de-sac of rapeseed biodiesel inherently limited in scope, and with
   the low levels of greenhouse gas emissions savings. Ironically this
   outcome is in part an unintended consequence of opposition to biofuels
   from environmentalist groups and politics.},

   They find that the likelihood of using a charity or business rather than
   a government or tribal provider increased with family income. Also, the
   likelihood of using a congregation or a government facility rather than
   a business, charity, or household increased with being Hispanic. The
   authors discuss the implications for the urban division of labor on

Abstract = {The debate on the European Union's democratic deficit usually operates
   within a national-democratic framework of analysis. This article argues
   for a change in methodology. It follows the thesis that the EU is a
   demoicracy' a polity of multiple demoi and has to be evaluated as such.
   Core principles of demoicracy are developed and the EU is assessed
   accordingly. Such an evaluation is not only more adequate, but also
   provides original insights: it is found that, whereas the constitutional
   development of the EU has approached demoicratic standards in general,
   major deficits remain at the national level.},

Abstract = {How do memorials shape who we think we are? And how are our identities
   involved when we debate, create and interact with memorials? This
   article engages in a conversation with scholarship on intersectional
   identities and memorial practices in Berlin. Intersectionality
   scholarship, with its roots in US critical race feminism, has much to
   offer for thinking about the complexity of identities, yet it does not
   consider the role of memory, time and temporality. The scholarship on
   memory and memorials, in turn, does not sufficiently consider the
   complexity of identities of those who are memorialized and of those who
   visit memorials. The article asks how two different memorials for Nazi
   victims in Berlin allow for or facilitate the memory of complex
   identities, illustrates that memorial practices can be crucial in
   contemporary identity politics and social movements and calls for a more
   self-reflexive approach to the role of identities and complexity in
   memorial scholarship and practice.},

Abstract = {From late 2008 onwards, in the space of six months, international
   financial regulatory networks centred around the Swiss city of Basel
   presided over a startlingly rapid ideational shift, the significance and
   importance of which remains to be deciphered. From being relatively
   unpopular and very much on the sidelines, the idea of macroprudential
   regulation (MPR) moved to the centre of the policy agenda and came to
   represent a new Basel consensus, as the principal interpretative frame,
   for financial technocrats and regulators seeking to diagnose and
   understand the financial crisis and to advance institutional blueprints
   for regulatory reform. This article sets out to explain how and why that
   ideational shift occurred. It identifies four scoping conditions of
   presence, position, promotion, and plausibility, that account for the
   successful rise to prominence of macroprudential ideas through an
   insiders' coup d'etat. The final section of the article argues that this
   macroprudential shift is an example of a gestalt flip' or third order
   change in Peter Hall's terms, but it is not yet a paradigm shift,
   because the development of first order policy settings and second order
   policy instruments is still ongoing, giving the macroprudential
   ideational shift a highly contested and contingent character.},

Abstract = {This article empirically tests how determinants of public support in
   Poland for the European Union change before and after accession. Despite
   studies on public attitudes towards EU integration and Euroscepticism
   that flourished in the run-up to accession, there is no evidence of how
   determinants changed over time. This study suggests that in Poland
   citizens support the EU on the basis of a form of unconditional support
   and general benefits for the country before accession, while personal
   benefits can become more determinant after accession.},
