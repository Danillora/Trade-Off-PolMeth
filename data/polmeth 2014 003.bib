Abstract = {Social democratic parties have changed their electoral appeals
   substantially to cater to new voter segments. This article examines
   social democracy's fortunes in attracting new voters among the salaried
   middle class across different electoral systems. Previous research
   ignored the importance of electoral systems and was inconclusive as to
   whether social democratic parties succeeded in mobilizing new
   constituencies. I argue that electoral systems play a crucial role since
   proportional systems enhance the electoral competiveness of
   left-libertarian parties, social democracy's most serious challengers
   among the salaried middle class. In contrast, majoritarian systems allow
   social democratic parties to gain a foothold among these voters as
   left-libertarians remain marginalized. Using ISSP data for 11 Western
   democracies, the findings demonstrate that social democratic parties
   were outperformed by their left-libertarian challengers among the
   salaried middle class under highly proportional systems, but not under
   majoritarian systems.},

Title = {Electoral Incentives and Legislative Organization: An Examination of
   Committee Autonomy in US State Legislatures},
Journal = {STATE POLITICS \& POLICY QUARTERLY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {297-320},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We investigate the relationship between electoral institutions and
   committee autonomy in the context of U.S. state legislatures. The
   distributive theories of legislative organization suggest that electoral
   rules that make personal reputations more important motivate legislators
   to decentralize power and enhance committee autonomy to be able to
   target particularistic goods to their local constituencies. We argue
   that the distributive theories have direct implications for the
   relationship between candidate selection procedures and committee
   autonomy. The need to reach out to a large number of voters and to amass
   significant financial resources in states with more inclusive candidate
   selection procedures such as the open primary makes representatives more
   dependent on special interests, which is conducive to legislative
   particularism and committee autonomy. We take advantage of the great
   variation across the American states to investigate the effects of
   candidate selection procedures, a factor neglected in the previous
   literature. Examining 24 state legislatures from 1955 to 1995, we find
   that the inclusiveness of the selectorate, or the body electing
   candidates, has a significant effect on committee autonomy with more
   inclusive primary elections leading to more autonomous committee
   systems. By contrast, however, term limits were not a significant
   predictor of committee autonomy. This contributes to our understanding
   of how legislators amend institutional arrangements to achieve their
   electoral goals.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {37},
Number = {5},
Pages = {903-931},

Abstract = {In this article, two unexplored trends in European electoral politics
   are highlighted. Using newly collected data the article tracks the
   politicisation of corruption in electoral campaigns from 1981 to 2011,
   an electoral strategy that has been increasing over time in most
   European countries. It then empirically tests two aspects of this
   campaign strategy. First, what are the factors that are systematically
   associated with a party's decision to politicise corruption? Second,
   what are the electoral effects in terms of relative vote share for
   parties that politicise corruption? Using an original data-set that
   employs multi-level data (parties nested in countries) the results
   demonstrate first that politicisation of corruption occurs
   systematically more often among established parties from the main
   opposition, new parties and parties on the political right, and occurs
   as a function of country-level corruption, district magnitude and public
   party financing. Second, it is found that the main opposition and new
   parties that use such a campaign strategy make significant electoral
   gains relative to the previous election compared to parties that do not
   politicise corruption. Yet gains are offset in low-corruption countries.
   The findings demonstrate salient implications for research on party
   systems, corruption studies and democratic legitimacy, among other areas
   of investigation.},

Abstract = {Developing the concept of state-corporate environmental crime, this
   article examines the government and corporate response to the 2010 Gulf
   of Mexico oil spill. US federal responders functioned in coordination
   with BP and an extensive array of privately contracted oil spill
   response organizations to systematically conceal the environmental
   damage caused by the spill through various means. State-corporate
   responders applied unprecedented amounts of toxic chemical dispersants
   in an effort to hide the oil, blocked public and media access to
   response operations, and relied upon a network of federal, state and
   local law enforcement agencies alongside private security firms to
   enforce the ban. In combination, these efforts constitute a
   state-corporate cover-up of environmental crimes in the Gulf of Mexico
   oil spill.},

Abstract = {Congressional elections have occurred every 2 years since the nation's
   founding, yet we know surprisingly little about these electoral contests
   outside of the modern era. This is unfortunate as our understanding of
   how Congress performs and has evolved over time is directly linked to
   how its elected representatives reach and maintain office. In an effort
   to better understand early U.S. House elections, we revisit the era of
   the partisan press where newspapers were the main source of news for
   American voters and were typically operated by one of the two major
   parties. Using a data set linking the geographic location of partisan
   newspapers with electoral data during the early 19th century, we examine
   district-specific factors impacting the competitiveness of House races.
   We uncover previously unidentified evidence of candidate-specific
   effects during this historical era along with confirmation of media
   influence in the context of early American elections.},

Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {275-296},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Under the Labour governments of 1997-2010, UK economic immigration
   policy was transformed from one of the most restrictive to one of the
   most liberal in Europe. This development was especially puzzling given
   the noted path dependence of immigration policy, as well as the absence
   of any public demand for liberalisation. In this article we explain
   immigration policy liberalisation under Labour using the concept of a
   `critical juncture': a short window of opportunity in which structural
   influences on political action are relaxed. Based on over 50 elite
   interviews, the article argues that during Labour's second term in
   office (2001-2005) three factors combined to cause policy
   liberalisation: a strong economy with labour and skills shortages; a
   government ideologically committed to globalisation; and institutional
   reforms to the policymaking machinery that introduced new actors, both
   governmental and non-governmental, into the immigration policy field.
   While none of these factors would have been sufficient on their own,
   together they were sufficient combined causes for immigration policy
   change.},

Abstract = {The idea of ``what's normal{''} has two importantly different uses. On
   one hand, ``what's normal{''} is a statistical concept: what's normal is
   what is statistically probable. On the other hand, ``what's normal,{''}
   is a normative concept. What's normal is how things ``ought{''} to be,
   or how things are when circumstances are favorable. The normative sense
   of `normal,' can be linked to the historical concept of essence. Things
   manifest their nature or essence under normal conditions; in other
   conditions they emerge deformed: a normal pregnancy will result in a
   normal offspring. Moreover, the normatively normal is invoked to back
   social norms: women ought to stay home with their babies because it is
   in the nature of things, or in the nature of things when circumstances
   are favorable. However, what's `` normal{''} is not always natural, and
   what's natural is not always best. Interestingly, the confusions just
   sketched are reinforced by the fact that we use generics such as `cars
   have radios,' `birds fly,' or `boys don't cry,' to state all three sorts
   of claims: statistical regularities, claims about natures, and claims
   about norms. Scholars have suggested that the variety in different forms
   of generics prevents a unified account. In this essay, I offer a
   proposal for understanding how the many different kinds of generics can
   be understood as differing in their implicatures due to essentialist
   assumptions that are included by default in the common ground of
   conversation. This helps explain how essentialist ideology is expanded
   and sustained.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses EU-Turkey relations with a specific reference to
   regional developments in the Middle East after the Arab Spring In the
   last decade, the Turkish government has tried to intensify Turkey's
   influence in the region. However, increasing activism in Turkey's
   foreign policy toward the region was not accompanied by a parallel
   commitment in its relations with the EU. In the meantime, the EU was
   caught unprepared by the Arab Spring in the middle of the Euro-zone
   crisis, and now its strategic interests are being threatened by regional
   instability. Both sides have been faced with the task of adapting their
   policies to the political transitions in the region. After an analysis
   of their contemporary regional policies, this article argues that even
   though their strategies are not totally in line with each other, Turkey
   follows the same objectives that the EU neighborhood policy has pursued
   towards the Middle East.},

Abstract = {Incumbent parties in Southern Europe experienced losses in their
   electoral support that came along with a series of economic reforms
   imposed by the EU and the IMF. However, recent theories of
   accountability would predict lower levels of economic voting given the
   limited room left for national governments to manoeuvre the economy. To
   resolve this puzzle, the paper presents and models quarterly vote
   intention time series data from Greece (2000-2012) and links it with the
   state of the economy. The empirical results show that after the bailout
   loan agreement Greek voters significantly shifted their assignment of
   responsibility for (economic) policy outcomes from the EU to the
   national government, which in turn heightened the impact of objective
   economic conditions on governing party support. The findings have
   implications for theories linking international structures, government
   constraints and democratic accountability.},

Abstract = {Over the past years, new civil societal actors have emerged in the field
   of migration policy who have neither formal authorization nor
   decision-making competence but who nevertheless have an impact on the
   design of migration policy. The appearance of actors such as the Expert
   Council of German Foundations on Integration and Migration or the
   High-Level Consensus Group on Skilled Labour Demand and Immigration
   reflects new governance structures in the field of migration policy. The
   article focuses on the strategies of legitimation applied by these
   actors in order to compensate for their lack of state mandate. The
   analysis is based on a qualitative case study using a mixed methods
   approach consisting of expert interviews, document analysis and
   qualitative media content analysis. The article concludes that the new
   actors are primarily characterized by quasi-state forms of organization,
   an extensive media strategy and forms of informal governance. They have
   been able to emerge due to changes in civil society and an increasing
   politicization of actors in the foundation sector. Due to these
   developments, new forms of informal governance have recently been
   established in the field of migration policy in Germany and the field
   has experienced a new dynamic in processes of governance.},

Abstract = {The extensive estimates of party policy preferences produced by the CMP
   (Comparative Manifesto Project, now MARPOR) have proved robust and valid
   over a wide variety of research applications. But all estimates carry
   some error. We demonstrate that one of the two existing assessments of
   non-systematic error in the CMP data strongly overstates their
   reliability while the other understates it, leaving much potential for
   mis-estimation. We develop a new method which extends classical test
   theory and directly estimates overall data reliability; reliabilities
   and standard errors of measurement for each party system; and standard
   errors of measurement for each data-point. These should facilitate use
   of the CMP policy scores which are usually the only ones available for
   extended party and policy research. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {To transfer power successfully at the top and prevent a leadership split
   during this process has always been extremely challenging for
   authoritarian regimes. Yet, power succession in China has demonstrated a
   high degree of stability in the past two decades. How did the
   authoritarian regime in China perform its leadership transition in an
   orderly and smooth manner? This paper argues that 30 years of
   institutionalization has resulted in the development of a power
   succession system with Chinese characteristics. By offering a large
   amount of primary and secondary data on Chinese elite politics, this
   paper analyses the institutional development of succession politics and
   its impacts on regime stability and legitimacy in China. The case of the
   Chinese succession system provides a dramatic example in understanding
   `authoritarian resilience'.},

Abstract = {Both corruption and market imperfections are important facets of modern
   arms markets. In the standard literature of arms market, production,
   procurement, sales (exports) and purchases (imports) of arms take place
   in the shadow of corruption. Corruption is an integral part of the
   environment of the arms trade that exerts an influence upon the outcome
   in the arms market. In our work, we make corruption as a choice variable
   of the powerful players in the global arms market and examine the
   equilibrium consequence of corruption that is strategically chosen by
   armament firms. We develop a simple duopoly to characterize a perfect
   Nash equilibrium of cash-for-favors and establish perplexing comparative
   static properties of this equilibrium. The primary intuition here is
   that cash-for-favors can have serious impacts on the equilibrium of an
   oligopoly through their effects on the incentives of and constraints on
   individual firms. We offer a model of endogenous corruption, to our
   understanding for the first time, to examine the global arms market in
   order to establish that the equilibrium outcome in the arms market
   cannot be fully captured by the standard results of oligopoly.
   Researchers have to extremely careful in applying the standard tools of
   oligopoly to the arms market as our results suggest that endogenous
   corruption can reverse most of the known results of oligopoly.},

Abstract = {Municipal governments play a vital role in American democracy, as well
   as in governments around the world. Despite this, little is known about
   the degree to which cities are responsive to the views of their
   citizens. In the past, the unavailability of data on the policy
   preferences of citizens at the municipal level has limited scholars'
   ability to study the responsiveness of municipal government. We overcome
   this problem by using recent advances in opinion estimation to measure
   the mean policy conservatism in every U. S. city and town with a
   population above 20,000 people. Despite the supposition in the
   literature that municipal politics are non-ideological, we find that the
   policies enacted by cities across a range of policy areas correspond
   with the liberal-conservative positions of their citizens on national
   policy issues. In addition, we consider the influence of institutions,
   such as the presence of an elected mayor, the popular initiative,
   partisan elections, term limits, and at-large elections. Our results
   show that these institutions have little consistent impact on policy
   responsiveness in municipal government. These results demonstrate a
   robust role for citizen policy preferences in determining municipal
   policy outcomes, but cast doubt on the hypothesis that simple
   institutional reforms enhance responsiveness in municipal governments.},

Abstract = {The article proposes the concept of essential democracy without
   cooptation in Latin America as a model that integrates dimensions of
   liberty, equality and fraternity. Co-optation is to deny the autonomy of
   the other as axis of bad practices that make democracy a formal process:
   elections captured by parallel powers, equality without empowerment
   equality, coexistence without recognition. The proposed model is an
   alternative to approaches that emphasize only the liberal elements of
   individual rights.},

Abstract = {The case studies revealed that the constitutional nature of a
   multi-level system indeed shapes its modes of day-to-day
   intergovernmental coordination and, with it, the way competences are
   (re)allocated in the longer term. Both in federal arrangements and in
   confederations, the `subunits' whose status is constitutionally
   protected could more easily defend their decision-making capacity within
   their areas of jurisdiction because they can veto changes in the
   allocation of competences, an advantage lower-level governments in
   regionalized systems do not enjoy. Similarly, in federal and confederal
   systems day-to-day interaction in Inter Governmental Relations (IGR)
   predominantly took place in multilateral structures, while in
   regionalized systems bilateralism was more pronounced. The relative
   influence of party-political (in)congruence on IGR, in contrast, was
   more varied than theoretically expected.},

Abstract = {The presidential-parliamentary distinction is foundational to
   comparative politics and at the center of a large theoretical and
   empirical literature. However, an examination of constitutional texts
   suggests a fair degree of heterogeneity within these categories with
   respect to important institutional attributes. These observations
   indicate that the classic presidential-parliamentary distinction, and
   the semi-presidential category, may not be systemic. This article
   investigates whether the defining attributes that separate presidential
   and parliamentary constitutions predict other attributes that are
   stereotypically associated with these institutional models. The results
   suggest the need for considerable skepticism of the `systemic' nature of
   the classification. Indeed, the results imply that in order to predict
   the powers of a country's executive and legislature, it is more useful
   to know where and when the constitution was written than whether the
   country has a presidential or parliamentary system.},

Abstract = {While contemporary scholars generally view the Senate's nominee approval
   role as impacting bureaucratic capacities and the president's ability to
   realize campaign pledges, empiricists and theorists focus on different
   elements of bargaining. Since empiricists typically study confirmation
   delays, and theorists normally analyze equilibrium nomination
   preferences, theory and data rarely inform one another.
   We remedy this by specifying an executive appointment model jointly
   incorporating delays and appointee ideologies. Besides predicting
   appointees' equilibrium ideologies, and contrary to past claims about
   the relationship between ideology and duration, this theory details how
   ideological differences between the president and his opposition do not
   straightforwardly induce longer delays; rather, effects are conditioned
   by factors such as the office's policy importance and divided
   government. Additionally, different pathways for parties to impact
   appointee ideology and duration are flexibly incorporated. Empirically,
   theoretical hypotheses receive support and evidence of parties impacting
   Senate trade-offs between delay and policy outcomes and successfully
   pressuring key members over high-stakes appointments are uncovered.},

Abstract = {This article examines the tragic dimension of political action which,
   according to the interpretation of Isaiah Berlin, was expounded by
   Machiavelli where he defended the political priority of civic values of
   the classical world with the incompatible predominance of the Christian
   values of his time. The interpretation of Berlin is discussed first and
   then the article continues reflecting on the harm that derives from
   failing to take into account the tragic component of political
   decisions. However, flaws of adequacy and consistency are noted in the
   pluralistic philosophy developed by Berlin beginning with the
   proposition that not all ends are compatible with each other. These
   flaws in the philosophy of Berlin can be corrected if one chooses not to
   base pluralism in the incommensurable, taken as an inevitable fact.
   Instead, it is proposed to interpret pluralism as a contingent result of
   moral and political interaction. According to Berlin, toleration is
   pluralism political correlation. However, it is debatable that the
   former can be derived from the latter. Similarly, the manner in which
   pluralism sets its own limits appears to be inconsistent. This involves
   toleration claimed by Berlin becomes as uncertain as liberty and
   autonomy in the context of Machiavelli's thought. In this connection, it
   will be submitted an interpretation of consequentialism as propounded by
   Machiavelli suitable for managing the risk in democratic societies.},

Abstract = {As one of the most stable unitary states in the world, Finland has
   largely been overlooked in the literature on multi-level political
   systems. However, this categorisation of Finland neglects the
   substantial autonomy that has been fought for, and accorded to, the
   Swedish-speaking Aland Islands over the twentieth century. Aland is the
   only province that has been granted significant legislative powers
   vis-a-vis the Autonomy Act (1921) and thereby constitutes a federalised
   arrangement. It possesses its own regional assembly and regional
   executive with exclusive powers in the fields of education, health,
   culture, industry and policing and elects a single representative to the
   Finnish Parliament. As the Aland party system diverges significantly
   from Finland's (Finnish parties do not compete on the island), this has
   led to a vertical disconnect between the Finnish and Aland governments.
   This article will explore the struggles for, and attainment of, autonomy
   for the Aland Islands within the centralised Finnish state, and the
   effects of this on intergovernmental relations.},

Abstract = {Cyberwarfare has become a fashionable topic in the last decade, partly
   because of the ever increasing sophistication of computer attacks,
   partly because of malicious actors setting their sight on industrial
   systems such as plants. Modern production systems are characterized by
   an IT-infrastructure controlling effects in the physical world. Such
   systems are called cyber-physical systems. In this paper the authors
   draw a distinction between information cyberattacks and cyber-physical
   attacks. Thereafter we provide insights into the specifics of
   cyber-physical attacks and examine to which extent they are similar to
   conventional warfare.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the BBC World Service has undergone the most radical
   overhaul of its governance, finance and working practices since the
   Second World War. In examining these changes, the Foreign Affairs Select
   Committee report on The Future of the BBC World Service articulates
   clear differences' between it and the BBC about how the World Service
   should be governed, and serious reservations' about the transfer of
   funding in April this year from government grant-in-aid to the licence
   fee. With a new BBC Charter due in 2017, will the distinct ethos and
   culture of the World Service survive this major reorganisation?},

Abstract = {This article explores the factors that contribute to the success or
   failure of gender quota campaigns through an analysis of two case
   studies from the Pacific Islands region: Samoa and Papua New Guinea.
   While Samoa became the first Pacific independent state to implement a
   parliamentary gender quota in 2013, a campaign for 22 reserved seats in
   the Papua New Guinea Parliament before the 2012 general election was
   unsuccessful. Drawing on media analysis and interviews with key players
   in the gender quota debates in both countries, this article examines why
   the push for a quota succeeded in Samoa and not in Papua New Guinea. The
   local, external and structural factors commonly found in gender quota
   literature can help to explain the divergent outcomes of the gender
   quota campaigns in these two countries. In particular, I highlight one
   structural factor - political stability - as fundamental to our
   understanding of the different outcomes in the two cases.},

Abstract = {Increasing numbers of social movement scholars now advocate
   participatory and collaborative research approaches. These are often
   premised upon the assertion of a convergence between movement and
   researcher that implicates the latter in the struggles of the former.
   Naming this approach ``solidarity research{''}, in this article I
   identify the components that provide the rationale for its pursuit. As
   well as affirming movement-researcher solidarity, this rationale also
   comprises a situated epistemology that asks academics to think
   reflexively about their research practice, the roles they play, and the
   interests they serve. This reveals the diverging positionality, of
   knowledge and interests, that often exists between movements and
   academics. Such concerns give rise to specific methodological and
   ethical principles that indicate the importance of negotiating this
   positionality to successful collaboration. Reflecting on my own
   experiences trying and sometimes failing to conduct participatory
   research with transnational agrarian movements, I identify dynamics that
   enable and constrain the pursuit of such collaborative research within
   commitments to broader methodological and ethical principles of
   solidarity.},

Abstract = {To what extent does the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa
   (BRICS) bloc constitute a paradigm shift in global health and
   development? This paper interrogates the concept of paradigm shift with
   the help of a framework familiar to scholars working in the field of
   International Relations. It distinguishes between the BRICS' material
   capabilities, institutions and ideas, and assesses the extent to which
   the BRICS contribution represents `a potentially transformative' source
   of new resources and innovation for global health and development. It
   has been argued that the BRICS bloc champions a qualitatively different
   development discourse from industrialised countries that has made
   possible a progressive set of development practices. The BRICS discourse
   and praxis gives weight to the claim that a paradigm shift in global
   health is underway. However, the extent to which such discourse will be
   effective in improving global health will depend on the bloc making
   greater use of institutions and further deploying its material
   capabilities.},

Abstract = {`Is political science out of step with the world?' This question, raised
   by John E. Trent in a recent issue, is part of a recurring debate about
   the development of our discipline. In that article, and in a subsequent
   book with his colleague Michael Stein, John Trent blames adherents of
   the `scientific method' for political science's growing irrelevance. We
   challenge this claim by arguing that Trent falls back on outdated
   polarities between `objective and normative', and `explanation and
   interpretation', in order to justify his allegation. We argue for the
   need to review our methods continuously, rather than dig up a fruitless
   and biased division between qualitative and quantitative approaches.},

Abstract = {The last decade has seen a remarkable transformation in the study of
   European national and EU interest representation toward mid-range
   theories tested with large-N research. One result of these developments
   is renewed anticipation about the emergence of a true comparative theory
   of interest representation, one fully attentive to the importance of
   institutional and issue context. Given this expansion of large-N
   research on interest representation, the articles in this special issue
   examine several of the most important methodological issues inherent in
   such analyses as typified by the still on going INTEREURO (Comparative
   Research on Interest Group Politics in Europe) Project, sponsored by the

Abstract = {Highly flexible in nature, ``contingent coordination{''} may be an ideal
   response mechanism for many of today's increasingly complex problems.
   However, the existing literature lacks a conceptual discussion regarding
   factors that contribute to its success or failure, as well as an
   empirical application of the theory. When the Deepwater Horizon offshore
   drilling unit exploded in April 2010, it resulted in the largest
   response effort in American history, involving personnel representing
   numerous organizations stretching from the southern coast of Louisiana
   through the panhandle of Florida. This article explores five underlying
   themes of contingent coordination, and applies those themes to the
   Deepwater Horizon incident response. We find that contingent
   coordination holds promise as a means to address transient, complex
   problems.},

   The Case of Estonia},
Journal = {BALTIC JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {137-165},

Abstract = {Gaining understanding about customers' mindset and information on their
   experiences is a precondition for the formulation of an effective
   country branding strategy. What potential tourists might learn and how
   they can be made to feel about a place can help small and not very
   well-known countries compete with bigger and more popular tourist
   destinations. The article focuses on the effectiveness of Brand Estonia
   and claims that it is still a challenge, despite the existence of an
   ongoing strategy. It also favors the revision of the brand identity
   selection and the promotion of Estonian brand, and supports a
   customer-based approach for their assessment. Documentary and empirical
   evidence show that the image of Estonia among its most important target
   audiences in the field of tourism does not match the Estonian brand
   identity. The gap in-between was evidenced by the results and content
   analysis of 24 in-depth interviews made with a selected group of people
   well acquainted with the country as well as some branding experts. This
   article contributes to the existing case study literature with findings
   that also manifest opportunities to strengthen the country brand, if its
   formulation develops a realistic brand identity and its promotion is
   based on accurate, unique and appealing ideas. It proposes academic
   support to innovative or alternative concepts for the country branding,
   and comments on applications of this study to more specific fields and
   further research.},

Title = {Understanding Informal Payments in the Public Sector: Theory and
   Evidence from Nineteenth-century Sweden},

Abstract = {Informal payments for public services such as health care are a major
   problem in many countries around the world. Explanations for their
   prevalence include cultural factors, lack of enforcement as well as
   insufficient funds and low wages for public employees. This paper
   analyzes the phenomenon from an economic perspective, arguing that they
   are a logical consequence of low wages in the public sector. However,
   informal payments from citizens to public employees for services may be
   preferable to a situation in which no services are delivered. Given that
   the informal payments thus can be seen to have a functional element, and
   that reforms aimed at eliminating them largely have been unsuccessful,
   formalization and legalization rather than increased enforcement may be
   a way forward. Many government employees in nineteenth-century Sweden
   received their salary through semi-informal payments (sportler') from
   citizens. A case study reveals that politicians at the time reasoned
   along the lines of what could be expected from economic theory: although
   undesirable and problematic, sportler were necessary to finance the
   wages of the government employees, given the lack of tax revenue and
   monitoring capabilities. In contrast to previous research, this article
   argues that reform efforts were aimed at pragmatically improving the
   existing system through formalization and regulation rather than simply
   prohibiting the informal payments.},

Title = {The Google Spain case: search engine as data controller and the
   recognition of the right to be forgotten (analysis of the CJEU judgement
   of 13 May 2014)},
Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2014},

Abstract = {This article analyses the ECJ's judgment of 13 May 2014 resolving a
   preliminary question referred by Spain's Audiencia Nacional (AN)
   national court on a case on the right to be forgotten. The facts giving
   rise to this judgment involve an individual requesting the erasure of
   the search results listed when his name is entered into the search
   engine.
   The Spanish Data Protection Agency accepted the request although the
   information was not deleted from its source (a newspaper). The ECJ ruled
   on various questions posed by the AN. Firstly, the court finds that EU
   regulations are applicable to the extent that the matter involves
   services aimed at EU citizens. Furthermore, the ECJ, in contrast to the
   Advocate General, considers that the search engine must be regarded as
   the data controller to the extent that its activity allows obtaining,
   through the list of results, a structured view of information about a
   person and enables making profiles of data subjects. The ECJ considers
   that given the seriousness of the interference, the mere economic
   interests of the search engine (legitimate interest) cannot justify said
   interference.
   The Luxembourg court makes a different assessment of the rights involved
   from that of the Advocate General. Regarding the right of erasure (when
   the processing breaches data protection requirements), it finds in
   favour of the affected person. Furthermore, it considers that such an
   affected data subject may also exercise their right to block information
   they believe harms them before the search engine (as the data
   controller). Although this may infringe on the public's interest in
   having access to information, the ECJ considers that, except in the case
   of public persons who may be subject to a greater amount of personal
   information being published about them, the interest of the affected
   subject must prevail.
   Basically, the right to data protection prevails and the search engine
   is given a responsibility that must be assessed in cases where this
   right comes into question should circumstances exist that justify
   erasing the search results even where the original source remains.},

Title = {Isaiah Berlin's Pelagian Soul: Response to Riley},
Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3},
Pages = {338-344},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This essay responds to the argument that Jonathan Riley offers in the
   February 2013 issue of Political Theory for rendering Isaiah Berlin's
   theory of pluralism consistent with his commitment to negative liberty.
   I show that the ``standard of humanity{''} that Riley attributes to
   Berlin fails to take account of Berlin's distinction between
   ``political{''} liberty (which has nothing to do with our humanity as
   such) and what Berlin calls ``basic{''} liberty (which does).
   Consequently, Riley ends up conflating the conditions for living in a
   decent society (one which respects a minimal core set of human rights)
   with being a human being. And this leads him to make the further,
   mistaken assumption that humans need to ``exercise{''} their generic
   human capacities in order to remain human and not become, in Riley's
   words, ``robots or moral idiots.{''} While Riley's essay is a valuable
   contribution to our understanding of what we might call Berlin's ethic
   of human rights, it ultimately fails in its effort to show that the
   domain of human rights constitutes Berlin's standard of humanity (as
   opposed to decency), and therefore it fails to show that normal human
   beings must assign overriding moral priority to a modicum of political
   liberty in order to secure their humanity.},

Abstract = {Many studies suggest that strict balanced budget rules can restrain
   sovereign debt and lower sovereign borrowing costs, even if those rules
   are never enforced in court. Why might public officials adhere to a rule
   that is practically never enforced in court? Existing literature points
   to a legal deterrence logic in which the threat of judicial enforcement
   deters sovereigns from violating the rules in the first place. By
   contrast, we argue that balanced budget rules work by coordinating
   decentralized punishment of sovereigns by bond markets, rather than by
   posing a credible threat of judicial enforcement. Therefore, the clarity
   of the focal point provided by the rule, rather than the strength of its
   judicial enforcement mechanisms, determines its effectiveness. We
   develop a formal model that captures the logic of our argument, and we
   assess this model using data on U. S. states. We then consider
   implications of our argument for the impact of the balanced budget rules
   recently imposed on eurozone states in the Fiscal Compact Treaty.},

Abstract = {In response to urgent call for international cooperation against
   HIV/AIDS, all members of Development Assistance Committee (DAC)
   converged in foreign aid policy decision for the health crisis within a
   relatively short period of time frame. However, there also existed
   variations among the DAC with respect to developing pattern of global
   AIDS funding. The research attempts to explore both convergence and
   divergence in the policy choices of global AIDS funding of DAC
   countries. When it comes to the convergence, it is the mechanism of
   norms teaching that encouraged the DAC to make financial contribution
   for the global fight against HIV/AIDS based on the sense of obligation
   and urgency. With regard to the distinctive pattern of the policy
   choices, it depends on the different norms stage each country was
   embedded in. The norms stage was distinctively constituted by each
   country's different historical background, political institutions and
   public opinion. I examine the cases of Norway and Belgium both of which
   converged in the decision of the foreign aid yet varied in the policy
   choices of funding increase. Institutional harmonization and policy
   coherence took place in Norway in the stage of norms internalization,
   while Belgium launched transformation of institutional structure at the
   stage of norms acceptance.},

Abstract = {This article argues that a within-case analysis of the causes and
   patterns of the institutionalisation of rating in the German financial
   system offers fresh insights into change in the major socioeconomic
   institutions of advanced capitalism. Using the method of systematic
   process analysis, the article explores the expansion of credit rating in
   the German banking system from three perspectives: historical (power),
   sociological (diffusion) and behavioural institutionalism (prospect
   theory). It demonstrates that the proliferation of credit rating
   resulted from a change of preference on the part of large banks. With
   Germany as a least likely case for successfully implementing rating, the
   study's main lesson is that institutional analysis may benefit from
   incorporating behavioural institutionalism into the analysis of
   preference change because this cites economic motivations as causes of
   preference shifts and institutional changes.},

Abstract = {Are there returns to office in an authoritarian parliament? A new
   dataset shows that over 500 deputies to China's National People's
   Congress are CEOs of various companies. Entropy balancing is used to
   construct a weighted portfolio of Chinese companies that matches
   companies with NPC representation on relevant financial characteristics
   prior to the 11th Congress (2008-2012). The weighted fixed effect
   analysis suggests that a seat in the NPC is worth an additional 1.5
   percentage points in returns and a 3 to 4 percentage point boost in
   operating profit margin in a given year. Additional evidence reveals
   that these rents stem primarily from the ``reputation boost{''} of the
   position, and not necessarily formal policy influence. These findings
   confirm the assumptions of several prominent theories of authoritarian
   politics but suggest the need to further probe the nature of these
   institutions.},

Abstract = {This article examines which political parties are the most likely
   targets of negative campaigning in a multiparty system. The choice of
   target is an important strategic decision parties make when deciding on
   their campaign strategy. The article advances existing research on
   negative campaigning in several ways. First, it is the only paper of its
   kind to statistically test which parties are most likely to be attacked
   in a multiparty system and in a non-US setting. Second, it contributes
   to the development of a general theory on negative campaigning by
   examining its use in a multiparty system. Finally, it presents new
   content analysis data on negative campaigning from ten Dutch
   Parliamentary elections between 1981 and 2010. The findings show that
   large parties, ideologically proximate parties, parties close to the
   median party position and government parties are the most likely targets
   of negative campaigning in the Dutch multiparty system.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how Locke employed the notion of religion to answer
   two questions: What binds citizens together into a community? How are
   individuals transformed into citizens? In the Two Treatises, Locke
   creates, through a political contract, a community that proves fragile.
   The bonds necessary bra civil society are unnatural; they go against the
   very self-interest that gave rise to a civil society. According to
   Locke, for a political community to simultaneously appeal to and
   overcome self-interest, the state must provide an institutional place
   for religion. To be sure, Locke defends extensive liberty of conscience
   in A Letter Concerning Toleration. He nonetheless retains a clear role
   for religion within the state and, furthermore, requires that all
   citizens in political society belong to some religious society. Locke's
   carefully designed argument merges community interest with
   self-interest, while being built on individual consent.},

Abstract = {In this article, I offer a reassessment of the influence of two
   disparate bodies of thought - republicanism and existentialism - on
   Hannah Arendt. Arendt, I argue, is not involved in an `agonistic
   appropriation' of Heidegger. Arendt identifies two opposed attitudes in
   Heidegger's work. The first Promethean moment places Heidegger squarely
   in the tradition of Western political philosophy, and the second
   seemingly correcting for this recommends a quietism. Arendt rejects both
   these attitudes. Machiavelli rather than Heidegger, I argue, is the key
   influence on Arendt's political thought. Through a reading of Arendt's
   published works and her unpublished 1955 lecture notes on Machiavelli I
   show that the central categories of Arendt's thought emerge from her
   meditation on Machiavelli's texts. Arendt finds in Machiavelli a
   performative understanding of politics, an accurate understanding of the
   connection between morality and politics, and a primacy given to
   politics that she thought it deserves.},

Abstract = {Previous research has found a positive relationship between having voted
   for a party that is part of the government and satisfaction with
   democracy. However, no research has examined this relationship in the
   specific case of a two-round system. Relying on original panel data
   survey conducted before and after the 2012 legislative election in
   France, this article addresses the question of how vote choices in the
   first and second rounds affect satisfaction with democracy. We find that
   both rounds have a similar impact and that voters who rallied a winning
   party in the second round are as happy with the democratic process as
   early supporters.},

Abstract = {Elites face a daunting coordination problem when contemplating a coup.
   Citizens, who desire political reform, face a similar coordination
   problem when contemplating protest. Since elites and citizens interact
   with the same leadership, these coordination problems are invariably
   linked. We develop a model which exploits this link to isolate an
   informational mechanism connecting popular protests and coups. Protests
   aggregate citizen information and provide elites with a public signal
   which helps them coordinate in a coup. We show that elites
   ``overreact{''} to protest as a consequence of its publicity, and we
   provide a microfounded explanation as to why elites use protests to
   facilitate coordination. Our model also suggests that protests in
   countries with media freedom better facilitate elite coordination. To
   test this, we examine how media freedom affects the relationship between
   protests and coups. The empirical analysis shows the effect of protests
   on coups is exacerbated in countries where media is free.},

Abstract = {Who are the people who should govern themselves in a democracy? This is
   the famous boundary problem to which this article offers a new approach.
   Most democrats, even nationalists and cosmopolitans, delimit the demos
   by relying on territorial jurisdictions. However, territory is not
   explicit in their arguments. This article urges democrats to recognize
   territory's normative importance rather than overlook the role it
   already plays in their theories. Acknowledging territory is a risky, yet
   promising, strategy. Risky, because it may lead to a vicious circle: one
   needs well-defined territorial borders to delimit the people, yet one
   needs a well-defined people to establish legitimate territorial borders.
   Promising, because it forces democrats to scrutinize implicit
   assumptions and find new resources for dealing with the vicious circle.
   The article describes four possible tacks by which theorists could
   navigate the waters of people, territory, and legitimacy in democracies:
   asserting, circumventing, solving, and dissolving the circle.},

Abstract = {The informational usage of media has been identified as one of the most
   important factors that facilitate citizens' participation in political
   activities. This relationship becomes exceptionally intriguing in the
   21st century, which is characterized by a growing popularity of new
   media, and concurrently, a decline of political and civic engagement in
   maw societies, particularly among young people. Research findings about
   the link between new media usage and political participation have been
   inconclusive, and specific processes through which new media usage,
   especially the informational usage of such media, may affect political
   participation remain less than lucid. In this study, we propose a
   theoretical framework under which political knowledge and political
   efficacy are used to explain the possible connection between online news
   consumption and political participation. Through a survey of university
   students in Singapore, this study shows that the young peoples
   consumption of online news is directly related to both online and
   offline political participation. At the same time, the consumption of
   online news is also indirectly related to online and offline political
   participation via political efficacy. Political knowledge, however: is
   found to be a mediating factor between online news consumption and
   online political participation but not offline political participation.
   This study not only allows us a more holistic view of the impact of
   online news on young peoples political and civic engagement but also
   contributes to the existing literature on the relationship between news
   consumption and political participation by incorporating both online and
   offline political activities in the proposed theoretical model.},

Abstract = {A sperm donor is the biological father but not the social father of a
   child conceived through donor insemination. What is the significance, if
   any, of the genetic connection between the donor and donor offspring?
   How do the various stakeholders perceive the significance and how does
   the variety of views influence legislation? Initially, donor
   insemination was an informal arrangement between doctor and patient in
   which the genetic connection with the donor was downplayed or even
   concealed. As the practice became formalised through specialist clinics,
   the anonymity of donors was maintained. As donor- conceived children
   reached adulthood, however, some of them challenged the policy. The
   ensuing debate has resulted in significant legislative changes.},

Abstract = {Financial markets react to major political events. The three nuclear
   tests conducted by North Korea in 2006, 2009 and 2013 are a sober
   confirmation of its on-going nuclear weapons program with the
   concomitant potential security threat this poses for the stability of
   the greater region. This article examines how nine regional stock
   exchanges reacted to the three nuclear tests given their important
   security repercussions. The results, although not uniformed across all
   countries and markets, revealed a greater adverse effect in the case of
   the second of the three tests. Given that the first test was announced
   in advance and the third was conducted in the midst of an on-going
   military crisis, this finding suggests that following the initial shock
   an unanticipated event can cause, markets can evaluate and absorb in a
   more efficient manner the news.},

Abstract = {Athenian democracy is rightly recognized for its extensive network of
   accountability institutions. This essay focuses instead on popular
   unaccountability in democratic Athens: ordinary citizens participating
   but not speaking in the Courts and the Assembly were unaccountable. I
   explore possible justifications of popular unaccountability, including
   arguments from democratic sovereignty and epistemic arguments, and
   stress the importance of a third strand: the identification of jurors
   and assemblymen with deservedly unaccountable, because comparatively
   weak and powerless, idiotai (private citizens), whose political activity
   failed to reach a level requiring intense scrutiny and control.
   Nonetheless, such a justification was always tenuous in light of the
   power jurors and assemblymen collectively wielded in the city. As I show
   through a reading of Aristophanes's Wasps, it was always possible to
   destabilize the juror idiotes identity and replace it with a much more
   troubling image: the identification of the juror with the dangerously
   unaccountable tyrant.},

Abstract = {Twitter has made deep inroads into political communications over the
   past three years. It allows for endless real-time worldwide discussions,
   and is increasingly being used by politicians to engage citizens.
   However, this article considers how and whether Twitter opens up
   possibilities for gauging `authentic' dialogue between politicians and
   citizens. `Authentic talk' has been identified as `spontaneous,
   unrehearsed discourse', and we suggest, in the context of crisis in
   public communication and its lament about the current state of political
   communication, that it may be an important component in the
   reconstruction of political trust between politicians and people. This
   article examines Twitter's use in presenting to citizens an `authentic'
   view of Scottish Members of Parliament (MPs) and its conveyance of
   trust. In order to identify authentic talk, a content analysis has been
   undertaken on the entirety of Scottish MPs' tweets (n = 14,066) between
   25 December 2008 (the earliest recorded tweet made by a Scottish MP) to
   7 August 2010. Using bespoke content analysis software we mine this data
   set to identify occurrences of both authentic discourse and civic
   engagement. The findings conclude that authenticity is being conveyed
   and is quantifiable, opening a new avenue for the study of crisis
   theory.},

   These ``ghost cities{''} are a result of excessive housing and

   urbanisation. Land-centred urbanisation is rooted in local GDPism, which

Abstract = {Kurds constitute one of the largest ethnic groups without a state of
   their own, with an estimated population of 25 to 30 million dispersed
   across Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. This article highlights the
   dynamics of Kurdish autonomy during the Ottoman era and outlines the
   driving forces behind the assimilation policy implemented towards the
   Kurds by the founders of the Turkish Republic. In doing so, the article
   points to rising fascism in Europe, the pervasive fear of further
   fragmentation of the Republic, and the legacy of the Ottoman millet
   system.},

Title = {A generational model of political learning},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {33},
Pages = {7-18},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We propose a mathematical framework for modeling opinion change using
   large-scale longitudinal data sets. Our framework encompasses two
   varieties of Bayesian learning theory as well as Mannheim's theory of
   generational responses to political events. The basic assumptions
   underlying the model are (1) that historical periods are characterized
   by shocks to existing political opinions, and (2) that individuals of
   different ages may attach different weights to those political shocks.
   Political generations emerge endogenously from these basic assumptions:
   the political views of identifiable birth cohorts differ, and evolve
   distinctively through time, due to the interaction of age-specific
   weights with period-specific shocks. We employ this model to examine
   generational changes in party identification using survey data from the
   1952-2008 American National Election Studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Year = {2014},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Can natural disasters undermine democratic legitimacy? This article maps
   a causal pathway from natural disaster damage to shifts in opinion and
   behavioral tendencies in less established democracies. It theorizes
   citizens who suffer damage in such contexts will tend toward lower
   evaluations of democratic institutions, lower support for democratic
   values and practices, and stronger dispositions toward action. These
   expectations are tested with national survey data collected following
   Chile's 2010 earthquake and tsunami by analyzing intracountry
   differences in damage with matching techniques and regression analyses.
   Results are consistent with expectations, with important implications
   for Chile and other less established democracies.},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of the Stamp Act, prominent American thinkers of
   otherwise unquestioned Whiggish affiliation adopted an expansive view of
   the king's prerogative powers while simultaneously denying Parliament's
   authority to interfere in the internal governance of the colonies.
   Scholars have generally attributed this stance, known as ``patriot
   royalism,{''} to political necessity: with no other means of disputing
   Parliament's oppressive actions, desperate pamphleteers sought to revive
   the discredited constitutional ideas of the Stuarts. In contrast, we
   argue that this position was deeply rooted in the institutional context
   of colonial governance. More specifically, we show that revolutionary
   Americans directly experienced lawmaking by Privy Council and the Board
   of Trade over which, as a practical matter, there was no higher
   authority. This ``conciliar{''} form of governance, which survived the
   break with England, exerted a significant influence on the
   constitutional framers and their handiwork.},

Abstract = {Even though the last war between Greece and Turkey ended nearly 100
   years ago, the ill feelings generated by the conflict are still quite
   common in both societies. In this article, the author traces the roots
   of this enmity, analyzing the effects of the resultant ``us vs. them{''}
   dichotomy in perpetuating pervasive misperceptions. By sharing examples
   from her documentary film The Other Town, which she made in
   collaboration with Hercules Millas, the author points out the ways in
   which ``myths{''} have become constructed that have led both peoples to
   think in a certain, and certainly detrimental, way about the
   ``other.{''}},

   Experiment},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},

Abstract = {The presence of heterogeneity in treatment effects can create problems
   for researchers employing a narrow experimental pool in their research.
   In particular it is often questioned whether the results of a particular
   experiment can be extrapolated outside the specific location of the
   study. In this article, we use a population-based field experiment in
   order to test the extent to which treatment effects for impersonal
   mobilisation techniques (direct mail and telephone) are sensitive to
   where they are carried out (geography) and the context of the election
   in which they were conducted. We find that on the whole it does not much
   matter where an experiment is conducted: the treatment effects are to
   all intents and purposes geographically uniform. This has important
   implications for the external validity of get-out-the-vote field studies
   more generally, especially where single locations are used. However,
   there is one important exception to this: experiments carried out in
   high turnout locations at high salience elections may show larger
   effects than those carried out in low turnout areas.},

Abstract = {Debates about how to respond to climate change have largely focused on
   the difficulties in agreeing on national targets for reducing greenhouse
   gas emissions. By assuming that the main obstacle to emissions reduction
   lies in the inability to reach agreement internationally, the current
   debate underplays the challenges of building the state capacity that
   will be needed to ensure mitigation takes place. The implementation of
   mitigation strategies is far from straightforward. It requires careful
   balancing of competing priorities and deliberate strategies to bring
   different interest groups on board. We analyze the way this balancing
   act has been carried out in promoting energy efficiency measures in
   China and India. The balancing act has been done differently as each
   country has tailored its approach to the specific context of competing
   priorities and differing state capacity. We encapsulate these
   differences by referring to China's approach as ``state-signaling{''}
   and India's approach as a ``market-plus{''} approach. China's approach
   is more explicitly statist than India's, but in both countries, the
   state plays a central role in building the support base for its policies
   through processes that we describe as the bundling of policies and
   interests. These bundling strategies are used to help build informal
   coalitions in favor of energy efficiency measures.},

Abstract = {The period from 1983 to 1992 witnessed an intensification of the state
   use of the Special Air Services (SAS) in the deployment of the ``set
   piece{''} killing tactic in Northern Ireland against the Irish
   Republican Army (IRA), a separatist insurgent group embroiled in
   political conflict in the region. The vast majority of these ``set
   piece{''} killings occurred within the geographical confines of the East
   Tyrone region and were directed at the IRA's East Tyrone Brigade. This
   article will argue that the use of the ``set piece{''} tactic in East
   Tyrone was a deliberate security policy choice. In doing so, this
   article interrogates the political and military value that the tactic
   had for the state and security forces. This article will identify how
   and why the tactic came to be implemented in East Tyrone when it did,
   and why the area appears to have borne the brunt of the tactic while
   other hotbeds of IRA activity were not targeted in a similar manner.
   Locating this research in the broader realms of British
   counter-insurgency it will evaluate what contribution the tactic made to
   the containment of IRA activity in the East Tyrone area.},

Abstract = {Both the classic mass party model of democracy and the more recent
   Downsian model initially appear consistent with the same, simple,
   principal-agent model of democratic party government. Once party is
   disaggregated into its three faces', however, the models are shown to be
   quite different. And once intra-party democracy is imposed on the
   Downsian model, or the idea that parties compete for unattached voters
   rather than each simply mobilizing its classe gardee is imposed on the
   mass party model, the simplicity of the original principal-agent model
   breaks down, with the party in public office forced to serve two masters
   with competing objectives and making incompatible demands. The result is
   to highlight both the complexity of democratic government and the
   limitations of principal-agent models in explaining it.},

   in this article were later forced to emigrate, and all eventually ended
   up in Greece. Their works have become classics in contemporary Greek
   literature. Describing the reign of Abdulhamid II as the community's
   golden years, these writers chronicle a gradual descent into chaos and
   violence following the Balkan Wars. In what has become a topos in Greek
   literature and oral history, these writers attribute the deterioration
   of their fortunes not primarily to the Turkish side, but to German
   propaganda during the Great War.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article discusses the challenges of moving towards
   student-centredness in East-Central Europe through the example of
   Hungary's subject-focused academic culture and the (re-)design of a
   political science research methods course at the University of Szeged
   for Spring 2012. Although countries participating in the Bologna Process
   undersigned the importance of student-centredness, few countries have
   actually yet moved in this direction. In addition, we know very little
   about how these instructional methods work outside the Western
   democratic context. I show that research into teaching is art important
   means to improve the process of education and that there are specific
   problems in transferring student-centredness into post-Communist higher
   education settings. Finally, I argue that knowing one's teaching context
   is vital for planning student-centred courses effectively, which would
   be greatly fostered by experiencing other teaching contexts through
   early-career teacher exchanges. The European Commission has recently
   affirmed its commitment to staff exchanges, but such opportunities are
   only likely to be beneficial if they go beyond the current 6-week long
   exchange scheme that the Erasmus programme offers.},

   persistence of election fraud},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {33},
Pages = {233-245},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Why would an autocrat want, or at least make it appear to want, to
   reduce election fraud? In recent years, non-democratic rulers have
   surprisingly begun to embrace fraud-reducing technologies, like web
   cameras or transparent ballot boxes. The reason for this is found in the
   relative ease by which one type of fraud can be replaced with another.
   With the help of new fraud identification techniques, I argue that the
   installation of web cameras in polling stations changes how fraud is
   conducted. Web cameras do not reduce fraud, but rather make certain
   blatant forms of fraud, like ballot box stuffing, more costly. Autocrats
   then substitute for other types of fraud, such as fabricating the vote
   count out of view of the cameras. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Access and agenda-setting in the European Union: Advocacy NGOs in

Abstract = {In the European Union (EU), rights advocacy NGOs increasingly seek to
   influence supranational policy making. The success of immigration and
   asylum NGOs in inserting themselves into policy making depends on
   existing (in) formal ties to EU institutions. In contrast, human
   rights-based NGOs received institutional support through the Fundamental
   Rights Agency (FRA) containing a civil society platform that aggregates
   NGO claims. This article applies a comparative framework derived from
   the literature on transnational advocacy, using the distinction between
   venues and frames as starting points for analysis. It compares both sets
   of NGOs, exploring issues of institutional access and agenda-setting,
   and examines the strategies and objectives of advocacy NGOs in these two
   different political settings: while immigration and asylum advocates
   rely mainly on pluralistic lobbying strategies and pre-given, exogenous
   institutional opportunity structures, Fundamental Rights Platform NGOs
   engage in a novel approach in which civil society actors endogenously
   co-constitute aspects of participatory governance in the EU. On the
   basis of interviews with NGOs and EU officials, we conclude that each of
   these strategies exhibit specific trade-offs based on the nature of the
   relationship to the EU institutions. It is argued that each type of
   access has its idiosyncratic drawback: while immigration and asylum
   advocacy may result in dispersed opportunities to steer outcomes at the
   EU level, the inclusion of rights-based NGOs in the FRA limits their
   strategic repertoire. Finally, issue-specificity also conditions
   agenda-setting as higher issue convergence enables more focused framing,
   while a diffuse issue spectrum yields weaker frames and authority.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the nature and strength of the relationship
   between political parties and the state. Expanding on the analytical
   framework we developed earlier (van Biezen and Kopecky, 2007), we
   identify three different dimensions of the party-state linkage: the
   dependence of parties on the state, the management of parties by the
   state, and the capture of the state by parties. We provide an updated
   cross-national empirical analysis of the relationship between political
   parties and the state in contemporary European democracies, building on
   two recently developed datasets on party regulation and party patronage.
   Our analysis underscores the considerable importance of the state for
   political parties in general, but also highlights important differences
   between the older democracies, and the more recently established
   democracies that emerged in the third wave of democratization. We show
   that the different dimensions of the party-state linkage do not
   necessarily work in the same direction, which suggests that the
   assumption of a close relationship between parties and the state
   ultimately undermining the democratic legitimacy of political parties
   requires some qualification.},

Title = {Gamson rule not for all: Patterns of portfolio allocation among Italian

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {53},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {This article investigates the dynamics of portfolio allocation within
   political parties to shed light on the patterns of conflict and
   cooperation between rival party factions. It provides a game-theoretic
   model that helps in explaining differences in portfolio allocation due
   to alternative modes of party organisation or party system
   competitiveness. Focusing on party congresses to estimate the number,
   strength and policy positions of party factions, the Italian case is
   analysed by testing some hypotheses generated by the theoretical model.
   The results shown that, overall, spoils are shared in proportion to the
   strength of each faction, in line with the prediction of Gamson's Law.
   However, there are also some important deviations from this path. Rules
   that foster party leaders' autonomy in fact provide them with a higher
   degree of discretion that will be used to reward their followers and to
   ward off any credible and harmful threat to party unity. Indeed,
   strategic portfolio allocation might balance out a lower amount of
   policy payoffs and becomes a strategy to restrain minorities from
   breaking away, thus contributing to the preservation of party unity in
   highly competitive political systems.},

Abstract = {Two new studies challenge the prevailing consensus that proportional
   representation (PR) systems produce greater ideological congruence
   between governments and their citizens than majoritarian ones. This has
   led to what has become known as the ideological congruence controversy'.
   G. Bingham Powell claims to resolve this controversy in favour of PR
   systems. Specifically, he argues that the results from the two new
   studies are based on an anomalous decade and that PR systems generally
   do produce greater government congruence. In addition, he also asserts
   that PR systems exhibit less variability in government congruence. In
   this article, the empirical evidence for these two claims is
   re-evaluated using exactly the same data as employed by Powell. The
   analysis indicates that although PR systems produce better and more
   consistent representation in the legislature, they do not hold an
   advantage when it comes to representation at the governmental level.},

Abstract = {How does the institutional context affect government responses to fiscal
   austerity? Despite the institutional turn in political science, we still
   possess an incomplete understanding of the relationship between a core
   aspect of the institutional setting of countriesnamely institutional
   fragmentationand the policy consequences of fiscal pressure. The article
   advances research on this question by integrating theories on the
   blame-avoidance effect of institutional fragmentation with theories on
   the effect of party constituencies on social policies. The result is a
   set of novel hypotheses about the conditional effects of institutional
   fragmentation that are tested empirically on quantitative time series
   data on unemployment protection from 17 advanced democracies. The
   analyses show that institutional fragmentation is an important
   determinant of government responses to fiscal austerity, but the effect
   depends on the partisan composition of the government.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {103-117},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {This article has two main purposes. The first is that of providing a
   longitudinal analysis of the global politics of untying aid, by looking
   at a number of debates that have occurred within the Development
   Assistance Committee and in the context of a number of high-level forums
   on aid effectiveness. The second is that of proposing some explanations
   for the lack of significant progress in these contexts. The focus is on
   the European Union (EU), which has been widely perceived as one of the
   most fervent supporters of promoting the aid untying agenda. In all
   these debates, the EU's leadership aspirations have remained largely
   unfulfilled. Thus, the EU has failed to adopt a EU-wide vision on aid
   untying; persuade non-EU donors to untie their aid, even when it has
   played the reciprocity card; and promote a pro-poor use of foreign aid,
   by supporting local ownership and facilitating greater access of
   developing country firms to aid contracts.},

Abstract = {Four main features characterize socio-political events in Costa Rica
   during 2013 and early 2014. First, voters cast their votes in
   presidential and legislative elections held under the most adverse
   political context since the restoration of electoral democracy in 1953.
   Three aspects characterize this context: popular support to the
   political regime is in decline, the longest period of social protests,
   and high instability in the cabinet. Second, Congress has ignored the
   recommendations offered by a Presidential Commission in democratic
   governability. Third, in judicial politics, overcrowded prisons became
   an important issue that put a lot of pressure in both the judiciary and
   the Executive. Finally, the territorial conflict with Nicaragua
   dominates foreign affairs.},

Abstract = {On 13 May 2014 the ECJ ruled on the interpretation of EU Data Protection
   Directive in order to conclude whether or not there was a right to be
   forgotten on the Internet and who and how should make it effective. The
   ECJ concluded, first, that there was a right to be forgotten on the
   Internet as one of the faculties that integrate fundamental right to
   data protection of european citizens (as guaranteed by article 8 EUCFR);

Abstract = {The article claims that cultural and historical ties between Russia and
   Serbia have crucial effect on their political interactions. The author
   highlights continuity of the special relations between the two
   countries. From this perspective the articles assesses prospects
   available for Post-Communist countries, including Serbia related to the
   Eurasian integration initiative presented by Moscow. While starting from
   the beginning of 1990s Belgrad could have associated its development
   entirely with the West and with the European Union primarily, today it
   could also attempt to join Russian initiatives. This option will enable
   this country to avoid the loss of its sovereignty. The article heavily
   relies on sociological studies, including results of opinion surveys
   conducted in several Post-Communist countries. Moreover, it examines
   statements of Russian and Serbian politicians.},

Abstract = {What brings about normative change in developing states with histories
   of corruption and poor governance? Post-NAFTA Mexico gives us a unique
   opportunity to study a single norm (rule of law) in two different
   sectors (environment and labor). Much can be controlled-the timing of
   new oversight pressures from outside (NAFTA and the US) as well as
   inside (courts and freedom of information agency). Socialization of rule
   of law norms is therefore best explained by looking carefully at
   differences between the relevant agencies. I show that variation in 1)
   levels of professionalization among agency officials and 2) permeability
   of domestic agencies to outside influence, explains much of the
   variation between labor and environmental officials over attitudes to
   rule of law. Labor agencies were far more constrained by legacies of
   highly influential vested interests, and this limited their capacity to
   adapt to new normative pressures. These findings sharpen our
   understandings of how a pro-rule of law culture can be embedded, because
   the two sectors were simultaneously subject to the new oversight and
   spotlighting pressures.},

Abstract = {The delegation of decision-making competences to international
   organizations has led to an intensive debate about their independence
   and autonomy. In this article, we map patterns of autonomy and show that
   the way these concepts have been conceptualized and operationalized does
   not differ as much as we had initially expected. We distinguish four
   particular perspectives of organizational autonomy derived from
   principle-agent analysis, organization-structure,
   organization-environment, and social constructivism. In a second step,
   we analyze the empirical foundations of representative studies in these
   four theoretical approaches. Finally, we discuss the implications of our
   findings for current and future debates in the field of organizational
   autonomy.},

Abstract = {Low take-up of stigma-free social benefits is often blamed on
   information asymmetries or administrative barriers. There is limited
   evidence on which of these potential channels is more salient in which
   contexts. We designed and implemented a randomized controlled trial to
   assess the extent to which informational barriers are responsible for
   the prevalent low take-up of government benefits among Colombian
   conflict-driven internal refugees. We provide timely information on
   benefits eligibility via SMS to a random half of the displaced household
   that migrated to Bogota over a 6-month period. We show that improving
   information increases benefits' take-up. However, the effect is small
   and only true for certain type of benefits. Hence, consistent with
   previous experimental literature, the availability of timely information
   explains only part of the low take-up rates and the role of
   administrative barriers and bureaucratic processes should be tackled to
   increase the well-being of internal refugees in Colombia.},

Abstract = {Despite all the differences in the political climate in Russia in the
   2000s and in the 2010s there is an important overarching feature -
   almost maniac passion of state structures for introducing norms and
   regulations. At most various levels, from the local to the national,
   authorities seek the possible strongest control over all actors located
   on the territory under their jurisdiction. Focusing their attention on
   the ideological justification of this attitude by the governors and a
   response to such justification by the governed, the authors show how
   stable semantic complexes (myths), which guide the governors, manifest
   themselves when confronted with the governed reality. The clash between
   reality and mythology of political management is analyzed on the example
   of the Russian system of higher education.},

Abstract = {The article studies the impact of enlargement on subnational governments
   in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland. It compares the resources
   and political constellations of subnational governments and analyses how
   these variables interact with Europeanization to influence domestic
   intergovernmental relations, the management of structural funds and the
   European Union relations of subnational governments. The article argues
   that stronger regional governments (in Poland and the Czech Republic)
   have been able to resist attempts to centralize intergovernmental
   relations. Decentralizing reforms occurred where incumbent governing
   parties dominated subnational government (Poland). Under `vertically
   divided' government (Czech Republic), subnational governments sought
   unmediated access to European Union institutions.},

Abstract = {We adopt the perspective of deliberative democracy to analyze the
   ``Dialogues for Peace{''} between the Mexican Federal Government and the
   Movement for Peace with Justice and Dignity. The origin of such exchange
   was a social movement that demanded the Mexican State to assume
   responsibility for the humanitarian consequences of President Calderon
   administration's war on drugs. Our purpose is to evaluate the
   contributions of this episode to the strengthening of the deliberative
   features of politics in Mexico. We will show that this case is
   meaningful because of the exchange of reasons and justifications that
   took place between political actors with conflicting positions. This
   episode, however, also highlights the enduring difficulties that hinder
   deliberation to become a common and consequential practice in Mexico's
   democracy.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to advance understanding of strategic nonviolent
   action through providing a more comprehensive assessment of the factors
   that may contribute towards the failure of nonviolent campaigns than has
   been undertaken to date. It disaggregates the wide range of
   international and national circumstances relevant to the failure of
   nonviolent action, illustrated with reference to experience of
   nonviolent action in Bahrain, Egypt, Libya and Syria since 2011. Through
   exploring these cases, the article proceeds to reveal how adherence to
   the assumed principles of nonviolent strategy may be insufficient in
   contributing towards success. It concludes by outlining four pathways by
   which nonviolent strategy may contribute towards its own failure,
   including its supersession by armed conflict.},

Abstract = {This lecture evaluates the claim made by one of his closest followers,
   Francois Ewald, that Foucault offered an apology for neoliberalism,
   particularly of the American school represented by Gary Becker. It draws
   on exchanges between Ewald and Becker in 2012 and 2013 at the University
   of Chicago shortly before the latter's death. It places Foucault in
   relation to the then emergent Second Left in France, the critique of the
   welfare state, and, more broadly, the late-twentieth-century
   social-democratic take-up of neoliberal thought. It indicates three
   limitations of his thought: the problem of state ` veridiction'; the
   question of inequality; and the concept of the economy. It also
   indicates how these might be addressed within a general appreciation of
   his thought.},

   resilience that emphasizes interpretation and the role of networks.
   After discussing past contributions to the study of social resilience
   and proposing an alternative analytical framework that builds on Max
   Weber's approach to social action, the article illustrates the proposed
   strategy through a discussion of the acquisition of transnational skills
   as a strategy of social resilience. Available empirical evidence shows
   indeed that fluency in foreign languages works both a resilience
   strategy and a vehicle toward the emergence of an European demos.},

   libraries now barely acquire German-language books. This finding also
   applies to other languages and disciplines. The decline continues
   despite the economic boom. The fact that some libraries have access to
   periodical databases does not compensate for this. Only, a few benefit
   from them, because there is a lack of infrastructure and transparency
   for users. Serious scholarly work or even participation in international
   research is impossible under these conditions. State policy is
   responsible for this absence of books. It is grotesque that years
   celebrating German-Russian cultural exchange are observed and strategic
   partnerships evoked, while today, fewer books are acquired than during
   the Brezhnev era. Relief is needed.},

Abstract = {To establish the scope and level of corruption in the contemporary
   United States, a collaborative project of political scientists is
   needed. Such a study should start with explicating the definition of
   corruption various scholars use. Three are noted here: using public
   goods for personal gains, deflecting public goods to private groups, and
   making such moves when these are legal although they are still illicit.
   To assess corruption on these levels, we must consider that various
   forms that ``capture{''} takes beyond the corruption of the laws
   themselves. A study of the major differences in the level of corruption
   among the three branches of government may improve our understanding of
   the prevalence and causes of corruption. A study of ``rent{''} may help
   predict that future course of corruption. Other topics whose study
   warrants collaborative investigation are listed.},

Pages = {109-121},
Abstract = {In 2012, the simultaneous elections at the federal, state and municipal
   levels in Mexico reopened the debate about the path of democratic
   consolidation in the country. With the return of the Revolutionary
   Institutional Party to the presidency in 2013, there are renewed signs
   that Mexican democratic consolidation is underway. Particularly
   important in this process is that the 2012 gubernatorial and mayoral
   elections have been more competitive, resulting in higher political
   alternation in power between political parties. Under a changing
   subnational political context, there are indications that subnational
   politicians are no longer under the shadow of a dominant party system.
   As a more consolidated federal democracy, the political landscape in
   Mexico has become more complex.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {32-51},
Abstract = {This article argues that advances in biotechnology and the life
   sciences, particularly the ongoing neuro-revolution, have changed the
   relationship between science and politics. Since the ``Decade of the
   Brain{''} project of the 1990s, new neuroscientific terms and biological
   understandings of the self have given rise to what Paul Rabinow refers
   to as ``biosociality,{''} that is, groups that organize around, and
   identify with, a specific disease or disability to lobby for
   recognition, better treatment options, access to resources, and, in some
   cases, equal rights. This biopolitical relationship between citizens and
   scientific experts in the policy-making process can be seen in the
   current debate between the neurodiversity movement and anti-autism
   groups over the needs of autistic people. However, this article shows
   that within policy discussions, both groups have been (re) constructed
   by competing medical discourses and illness narratives in a way that has
   limited their ability to voice their needs and effectively evoke policy
   change.},

Abstract = {The UK's 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review asserted that there
   would be no `strategic shrinkage' despite the significant cuts to be
   made to the defence budget, and thus to the country's military
   instrument. However, Robert Fry argues that this claim has since been
   shown to be unrealistic; indeed, the UK is suffering from a growing
   `strategic deficit' - a gap between its ambitions and the means with
   which to fulfil them. What is needed, therefore, is not just a
   reassessment of the UK's national power, but a new understanding of
   power itself.},

Abstract = {Interpretive political science scholars argue that language does not
   only describe social realities but also serves as a medium of their
   construction. This minimal consensus, however, leaves one crucial
   question open. What are the techniques on which this construction of the
   world is based and how do these rhetorical devices bring about their
   performative effects? In this article we argue that narratives shape
   social praxis through the process of narration and, in doing so, enable
   the political dimension of language. A dialogue between political
   science and literary studies opens a promising avenue for such a
   research perspective. We introduce the basic narratology of Albrecht
   Koschorke to develop a methodology for researching political narratives.
   To illustrate a narrative analysis and to reflect on its methodological
   difficulties, we examine different narratives about the riots in the UK
   in 2011.},

Abstract = {In recent years, one of the most interesting and potentially promising
   developments in European Union (EU) party politics has been the
   establishment of European political foundations. At the time of writing,
   no less than 12 European political foundations are active in Brussels
   and beyond, and the total EU grant available to them for 2012 amounted
   to almost 12 million euro. However, very little is known as to how
   exactly these European political foundations perform their tasks. Taking
   stock of the first five years of their operation, this article analyses
   European political foundations empirically and comparatively, based on
   the study of primary resources and a number of semi-structured
   interviews, alongside existing research. The central questions concern
   the purposes European political foundations serve and the nature of
   their relationship with Europarties. From a theoretical perspective,
   this article addresses the issue of the development of European
   political foundations within the wider debate on EU party politics, and
   offers a number of insights regarding the actual and potential role of
   European political foundations in strengthening Europarties.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE PEACE \& SECURITY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-83},
Abstract = {The common narrative of how International Relations (IR) has evolved is
   based on a chronological linear view of continual progress. This story
   divides the history of the discipline into phases punctuated by the
   three Great Debates. However, the analytical categories of race and
   indigeneity have been missing from all these debates; these erasures in
   the stories of IR are made possible through a series of ontological and
   epistemological manoeuvres. These in turn, structure a `common sense' of
   what the boundaries of IR are, or what they should be. This is evident
   in the exclusion of what can be seen as major international security
   issues, which are largely ignored by the discipline. This paper employs
   an IR post-colonial perspective, using the example of sex trafficking in
   Canada and the US to demonstrate how the field of IR remains silent on
   its colonial legacy, with the wider aim of thinking about the
   implications that omission has for the discipline.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {178-197},
Abstract = {The motivation problem is a common component of discussions about
   democratic planning. This paper focuses in particular on individuals'
   motivation to work hard and to engage in the scrutiny of public affairs,
   both necessary traits for the success of a planned economy. The analysis
   draws on tools from the evolutionary game theory literature to consider
   whether the models of Pat Devine (Negotiated Coordination Economy, or
   NCE) and Michael Albert and Robin Hahnel (Participatory Economics, or
   Parecon) offer convincing solutions. I argue the proliferation of those
   traits would not naturally occur at the outset of democratic planning. I
   discuss selection mechanisms that increase the likelihood of successful
   proliferation of individually costly traits: segmentation, conformism,
   and group-level interactions. However, I argue that, under the impact of
   the defining institutions of NCE/Parecon, segmentation or conformism
   would not achieve the desired proliferation. The central conclusion of
   this paper is, then, that more sanctions and incentives at the
   group-level should be incorporated to the institutional design of these
   models.},

Title = {Varieties of Capitalism and the Euro Crisis},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {37},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {1223-1243},
Abstract = {This article examines the role played by varieties of capitalism in the
   euro crisis, considering the origins of the crisis, its progression, and
   the response to it. Deficiencies in the institutional arrangements
   governing the single currency are linked to economic doctrines of the
   1990s. The roots of the crisis are linked to institutional asymmetries
   between political economies. Northern European economies equipped to
   operate export-led growth models suitable for success within a monetary
   union are joined to southern economies whose demand-led growth models
   were difficult to operate successfully without the capacity to devalue.
   The response to a tripartite crisis of confidence, debt, and growth is
   explained in terms of the interaction of institutions, interests, and
   ideas, and its importance for the future of European integration is
   explored.},

   the insert of the municipal association validly as an alternative to
   achieve a better materialization of this principle, in view of the
   perspectives of the institutional improvement that suppose the
   Guidelines of the Economic and Social Politics of the Party and the
   Revolution. In this investigation it is appealed to the use of the
   doctrinal juridical method in order to specify the content and reach of
   the main studied variables; the method of analysis of documents like
   base for the study of the consulted doctrinal and legal sources; and the
   analytic-juridical method as means for the exam of the systemic
   character of the current norms in municipal matter in order to specify
   the sense and reach of the principle of heterogeneity in the same ones,

Abstract = {One of the key elements of the strategies of interest representation of

   in the co-ordination processes within the member state. This article
   argues that Europeanization of inter-governmental relations leads to a
   greater emphasis on cooperation in the formal rules on
   inter-governmental cooperation in EU affairs. However, when informal
   practices are taken into account, some member states become more
   cooperative, others arguably less. This divergence can be explained by
   the circular interplay of formal and informal practices.},

Abstract = {This article argues for a political science discipline and teaching
   framework predicated empirically on the study of ``real-world problems''
   and normatively on promoting civic engagement among political science
   students. I argue for a rethinking of political science and political
   science education in view of the pragmatist thought of John Dewey as
   well as more recent ideas on higher education of David Orr. This way of
   thinking calls for that which is lacking from various theory-or
   method-driven approaches to political science: (1) a problem orientation
   that explicitly clarifies that political science is for responding to
   what Dewey called ``concrete human woes'' and (2) promotion of civic
   engagement, defined as concern for the well-being or improvement of
   state and society, as an explicit learning outcome of political science
   education.},

Abstract = {We investigate whether the existence of a required graduate course on
   ``Teaching in Political Science'' is related to overall job placement
   rates reported by graduate political science programs. We examine this
   in light of evidence from 73 public PhD- granting political science
   departments across the country. We find that the existence of such
   courses has a marginally positive effect on placement rates,
   particularly with regards to the placement rates of lesser ranked
   research departments at primarily teaching institutions. However, the
   most consistent predictor of placement rates across all models is the
   research productivity of the graduate department from which the students
   received their degree.},

Abstract = {In the face of capitalist responses to environmental and economic
   crisis, in which the notion of ``property{''} is often expanded or

   autonomous escape from the destructive machine of capitalism take on a
   variety of forms. This work is designed to visualize the ways in which
   spontaneous collective actions and reconfigured notions of
   ``property{''} can take root in a notion of `` life{''} itself: e. g.
   promoting of the potentiality of land without the spectre of
   monetization; free knowledge production or Lok Vidya (people's
   knowledge) that exceeds the territorial enclosure of the private
   university; reclamation of the right to be and to speak through
   encirclement; and the collective performance of street actions and

Title = {CRISIS OF RUSSIA'S MULTIPARTY SYSTEM},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2014},
Number = {4},
Pages = {76-95},
Abstract = {The article states that multi-party system developed in Russia in the
   wake of radical reforms, has been in a constant state of crisis. Based
   on the data from representative sociological surveys it examines the
   signs and the main causes of the crisis, paying special attention to
   peculiarities of the modern transformation of multiparty system. The
   authors emphasize that the ongoing changes of party policy implemented
   ``from the top{''} to optimize the party system, only hinder the
   creation of a truly competitive political parties and disorient people.
   Recent years have seen the low level of trust in political parties, lack
   of interest in their activities, weak linkages of large groups of
   population with traditional political institutions, the constant
   loosening of newly formed party loyalties. Compared to modern democratic
   societies, where parties are viewed as the most important structural and
   functional elements of the political organization of society, in Russia
   political parties are estimated by a large majority of citizens as less
   important in comparison with other political institutions. Russians
   claim that the possibilities of the parties, except for the ruling
   party, to adequately respond to the increased demands and requirements
   of groups whose interests they express are very much limited. There are
   noticeable signs of weakening of the opposition parties in the Duma, not
   able to compete with the ruling party. As well as strengthening of
   barriers to the creation of new authoritative political forces capable
   to improve political life in the country. The authors emphasize that
   constant and considerable changes of party politics prevent the
   establishment of a stable system of party loyalties, weaken the
   dependence of political behavior of citizens on society traditions of
   political choices and increase the likelihood of unpredictable political
   behavior. Analysis of the balance between the party reform plans and
   mass political sentiments leads to the conclusion that the course of
   creation of a multi-party system with wide pluralistic orientation finds
   no support in the overwhelming majority of Russians.},

Abstract = {I build a static, complete information, three-player bargaining model of
   war. Without dynamics or incomplete information, war is always avoided.
   However, the threat of war determines the nature of alliances. The model
   uses a notion of cooperative stability to predict balancing and
   bandwagoning behavior in alliance formation. Given the assumptions of
   the model, a stable state always exists. Stronger allies increase the
   potential for war threats against a non-allied player. However, stronger
   allies also demand larger shares of an alliance's total payoff.
   Balancing (bandwagoning) alliances form when the within alliance utility
   of a player is uniformly decreasing (increasing) in the resources of an
   alliance partner.},

Abstract = {Forms of public service financing and delivery have changed
   significantly in recent years. A promising theory to explain such
   changes is the veto players approach. Despite considerable scientific
   interest, empirical tests, and applications are still rare. Taking the
   spread of public-private partnerships (PPP) as a new policy tool in 14
   European countries since the 1990s, this article tries to test core
   assumptions of the veto player approach in a mixed methods design. The
   results show that the number of party political veto players is a good
   indicator for predicting the probability of a policy change towards an
   intensified use of PPP, while a correlation with e. g. privatization
   proceeds could not be demonstrated.},

Abstract = {With the fall of the USSR, the virtues of `liberal democracy' have
   become major claims of Western hegemonic nations. A democratic status is
   necessary for states to be considered a legitimate component of the
   modern world. Building democracy is the counterpart to the move to the
   market and private ownership in the transformation of the state
   socialist societies. However, though there is general approval of things
   democratic, its nature is subject to wide and often contradictory
   meaning. Of one thing we can be clear; there is no single thing called
   democracy. In this chapter I consider the different meanings given to
   `democracy'. The main approach considered is that of electoral
   democracy. A second objective is to examine the performance of electoral
   democracies in promoting human well-being. Here I consider studies
   measuring the relationship between democracy, on the one hand, and
   economic growth, equality, happiness and peace, on the other. It is
   concluded that, in terms of social and economic outputs, there does not
   appear to be an overwhelming case to prioritise electoral democracy as a
   political objective. The strength of electoral democracy lies in
   promoting processes of accountability and types of political order. As
   far as promoting economic growth, happiness, equality and peace, it
   sometimes promotes them but sometimes not.},

Title = {From Washington Consensus to Flexible Keynesianism - the International
   Monetary Fund after the Financial Crisis},
Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {55},
Number = {3},
Pages = {427-444},
Abstract = {In the wake of the latest financial crisis, the International Monetary
   Fund returned to its core business providing liquidity to cope with
   external imbalances. The crisis also seemed to mark an ideological break
   with the past. At the London G20 summit in 2009, leading politicians
   declared the `Washington Consensus' dead and anti-cyclical economic
   policy the order of the day. This article analyzes elements and driving
   forces of a paradigm change in the crisis policy of the IMF. I argue
   that a transformation towards a new economic philosophy of a ``flexible
   Keynesianism{''} is proceeding, driven both by large member states and
   the IMF staff.},

   Methodological Lessons},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Pages = {13-27},
Abstract = {A basic theory of electoral accountability is widely accepted by
   academic opinion: voters cause politicians to gain or lose office
   through periodic elections, thereby influencing policy through the
   threat of electoral sanction. Empirical studies run the gamut from
   findings of strong support for this theory, to mixed or conditional
   support, to weak or negative results. When electoral processes are
   analyzed in terms of two distinct causal linkages within a three-part
   chain of accountability, however, positive findings are revealed as
   weaker than they appear while a compelling trend emerges toward findings
   ranging from conditional to negative in the last two decades. This trend
   is visible in three topical areaseconomic voting, political corruption,
   and ideological congruence-and it holds for both presidential and
   parliamentary regimes as well as for a variety of electoral systems. The
   new electoral skepticism's unsettling results and insightful methods may
   help to improve future research and reform efforts alike.},

Abstract = {This article offers an analysis of the origins, evolution, and impact of
   the Obama administration's Race to the Top (RTTT) competitive grant
   program and places it in the broader context of the debate over
   President Obama's aggressive use of executive power. Faced with divided
   control and partisan gridlock in Congress - which has been unable to
   reauthorize ESEA, the largest federal education program - the Obama
   administration has opted to make education policy from the executive
   branch. While many observers have questioned the - expansive
   interpretation of statutory and regulatory authority that undergirds
   RTTT - and the NCLB waiver process - there is little doubt that the
   efforts have had a significant impact on the national political
   discourse around education and pushed many states to propose or enact
   important policy changes, particularly around charter schools, common
   core standards, and teacher evaluation processes. Along with health
   care, education reform is likely to be remembered as the most
   significant policy legacy of the Obama administration. However, while
   the Affordable Care Act was drafted by Congress and secured through the
   ``normal{''} legislative process, the Obama education agenda has largely
   been designed and enacted through unilateral executive branch authority.
   As a result, these actions may well set significant precedents for the
   separation of powers as well as for education policy.},

Abstract = {On the basis of analyzing the evolution of the established model of
   tolerant interaction and its current state in the US, N. Medushevsky
   concludes that, despite the apparent welfare of the American society, it
   is on the brink of crisis, the essence of which lies in breaking the
   historical tradition of integrating migrants and disfranchised groups of
   citizens into the system of national political dialogue. This crisis is
   caused by the fact that a certain ``limit of concessions{''} has been
   reached, beyond which the traditional `` white majority{''} would lose
   its privileged status, which forces them to switch to defense and
   confrontation with the forces that ruin their identity. The latter are
   represented by ethnic and racial minorities that during the struggle for
   their civil rights and liberties are gradually realizing commonality of
   their interests and a possibility of a different, `` non-white{''} path
   of development, where it is they who may be assigned a role of the
   national history creator.},

Abstract = {Watchmen (1987), written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Dave Gibbons,
   is a 12-part graphic novel that portrays real-life superheroes in a
   fictional United States of the 1980s. An alternate universe where
   ordinary people without superpowers were inspired by superhero comics
   and took on the crime-fighting in tights in the 1940s, the comic
   portrays an America vastly different from our reality. Since its
   publication more than two decades ago, the comic has been the subject of
   extensive study due to its breathtaking narrative structure as well as
   its acute deconstruction of the superhero genre itself. Indeed, one of
   the text's most brutal deconstructions comes from the way it addresses
   superheroic masculinity, from the misogynistic vigilante Rorschach to
   the emasculated ex-hero Nite Owl. Through its cast of male heroes,
   Watchmen deconstructs the superhero genre by rewriting masculine tropes
   such as vigilantism and patriotism and by exposing the inherent
   contradictions within these gender-bound tropes from the fascist
   undercurrents of violent patriotism to the often-hinted sexual
   dysfunction of the costume-fetish variety.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes some components of New Public Management (NPM)
   that were introduced in the Mexican education sector, for example,
   transparency, evaluation and accountability. To this end, this article
   is divided into four parts. In the first, we review the doctrinal
   elements of NPM. The second provides a characterization of the Mexican
   educational system and some of its financial management problems. The
   third offers a brief review of the literature on educational
   accountability, or in other words, the relationship between
   accountability, government spending and school performance. The fourth
   presents a number of possible ways to improve our educational
   accountability system, basically, those located in the recent
   constitutional reform in education. Finally, we address the analysis'
   findings.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2014},
Number = {6},
Pages = {32-51},
Abstract = {Presented and analyzed in the article are the results of an
   investigation of the influence of the human factor on the spread of
   corruption relations in the sphere of public power. According to the
   adopted investigative hypothesis, the extent to which corruption is
   spread in the sphere of public power is determined: 1) by the
   institutional quality of the public sphere and 2) by individual
   qualities of the officials realizing the public power and, concretely,
   by their being or not being predisposed to corruption relations. In
   order to analyze and to estimate the influence of public officials'
   individual qualities on the extent to which corruption is spread in the
   sphere of public power, socio-anthropological approach was resorted to.
   It has been demonstrated that corruption erosion of public power is
   definitely connected with personal motivation of those who desire to
   take up political and administrative posts. Therefore, in order to
   counteract the spreading of corruption in this sphere, it is necessary
   to erect institutional barriers to protect public power against
   penetration and activity of those who desire to exploit it in favour of
   their own mercenary interests. One of the main lines of advance in the
   course of preventive counteraction against corruption in the sphere of
   public power is pursuit of higher quality of those who ``populate{''}
   institutions of public power, answering the latter's demand for
   personnel. This may be achieved by: honest and transparent political
   competition at the elections; meritocratic approach to appointment and
   advancement of administrative personnel; depolitization of the activity
   of public officials occupying administrative posts; following the
   ethical codes, as well as the behavioral standards; prevention of
   conflicts of interests in the system of public power; practice of public
   officials and their natives laying down their financial and property
   status. Furthermore, the whole complex of institutional orders and rules
   directed on prevention and suppression of public officials' corruption
   relations and corruption behaviour, may prove efficient only on
   condition that specialized internal and societal external control and
   superintendence of public power be constantly secured.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between the European Union (EU) and
   the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), with a
   particular focus on the restart in cooperation occurring at the turn of
   the century. This was due to the rediscovery of the organisations'
   common past, shared values, similar goals, the drawing of identical
   security strategies and an increased field presence in the same regions.
   The EU-OSCE relationship has not been without its shortcomings, but the
   successes of the cooperation have outnumbered the various hurdles.
   Furthermore, the relationship can be classified as a case of mutualism,
   as both partners have benefited therefrom.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to determine the relationship between the
   implementation of drone strikes and any changes in al-Qaeda's portrayal
   of the United States. To this end, the study examines the changes in
   frequency of 26 different accusations made against the United States in
   al-Qaeda propaganda published ``pre-drone strikes,{''} as compared to
   propaganda published during the ``drone strike era.{''} The statistical
   significance of changes in frequency was evaluated by conducting a
   series of proportions tests in STATA. The results indicate that al-Qaeda
   has shifted from more ambiguous claims that the United States meddles in
   foreign countries' affairs, tolerates immoral acts, and is an occupying
   force to more specific accusations that the United States cowardly
   commits illegal acts and indiscriminately kills civilians.},

Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {24-44},
Abstract = {This article analyzes how the idea of local ownership is functioning in
   the context of security sector reform in the Democratic Republic of the
   Congo with a focus on European Union's efforts in the area. The authors
   argue that despite discursive emphasis on ownership, in practice local
   resistance in combination with the notion of security sector reform and
   the idea of ownership being externally constructed concepts with vague
   definitions create counterproductive dynamics between local and
   international actors. The result has been a paralysis of the security
   sector reform efforts in the Congo. Real progress in security sector
   reform is possible only if the local authorities ``own{''} the reforms,
   but if progress means less power for these authorities, they are
   unlikely to sustain it. While the literature traditionally emphasizes
   the role of external inconsistency in ownership's shortcomings, this
   article demonstrates that a full picture also requires highlighting the
   local dynamics of ownership resistance.},

   proportional representation within the same legislature. Despite a
   sizable literature, little attention is placed on how the public
   perceives these electoral systems. Survey data prior to Taiwan's second
   mixed legislative election allow for an analysis of technical knowledge
   of the system. Empirical analysis finds low levels of knowledge across
   five preelection survey waves, with supporters of smaller parties more
   likely to correctly identify electoral rules. Ultimately, this analysis
   contributes to our understanding of how the public adapts to electoral
   reforms.},

Abstract = {Starting from explicit materialist premises, this paper develops a
   general conceptualization of productive (P) and unproductive (U)
   activities. This distinction is implicit in the concept of a social
   surplus derived (often) through exploitation and redistributed
   (typically) through social mechanisms that channel portions of the
   surplus to reproduce U activities. But the P/U distinction for labor is
   inherently multidimensional, so a ``topological{''} partitioning of the
   conceptual space is needed. Relevant ``axes{''} of distinction are (1)
   capitalist versus noncapitalist labors, (2) production versus non
   production labors, and (3) basic versus nonbasic labors. The meaning and
   relevance of each of these axes is explored, referring to the
   literature, and six conceptual viewpoints are distinguished. The
   theoretical and political implications of these different specifications
   are examined, with special focus on the status of the financial (FIRE)
   sector. It is argued that no single specification of the P/U distinction
   is adequate for considering all questions.},

Abstract = {The article is based on the results of a comprehensive sociological
   study of professional ethics of state and municipal employees conducted
   by the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public
   Administration in 2012-2013. On the basis of 150 detailed biographical
   interviews the author analyzed perception of corruption by public
   officials, determined the main discursive elements of corruption topic
   and proposed an explanatory model of formation and development of
   corruption in the modern Russian society. Six discursive areas that
   constitute corruption discourse were determined: ``no bad guy
   around{''}, ``all the evil is outside{''}, ``to solve problems{''},
   ``personification of a service{''}, ``fight as an ordered procedure{''}.
   The article demonstrates that corruption can be interpreted not only in
   terms of economic gain at the expense of the third parties, but also in
   terms of reproduction of shadow relations parasitizing upon the legal
   social order.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},

Volume = {10},

Pages = {136-154},
Abstract = {Political bias in the academy is a topic of great controversy. Many
   conservatives have argued that liberals dominate American campuses and
   use their classrooms to indoctrinate students or to discriminate against
   those with differing political beliefs. Liberals have responded by
   calling studies that purport to demonstrate these claims as flawed or as
   attacks on academic freedom. Regardless of the magnitude of campus
   political bias, it is ill-advised for the scholarly community to argue
   that it is immune from bias because scholars simply are fair. This
   article focuses on one element of political bias: partisan ``outcome''
   bias in grading. We proceed in several steps. First, we provide an
   overview of the problem of grading bias and the concerns about political
   bias. Next, we consider the attributes of political grading bias and the
   forms that it can take. We present the analytics of partisan outcome
   bias and logic of using ``paired'' assignments to eliminate outcome
   bias. We provide data and analysis concerning outcome bias from a course
   Rom has taught. We conclude with a discussion of the ethics of grading.},

Pages = {90-107},
Abstract = {Social political crises and revolutions become more frequent in the new
   period of global turbulence. All revolutionary powers and regimes sooner
   or late meet the problem of legitimacy. The classical Weber's division
   of legitimacy is insufficient, and a new typology of legitimacy is
   suggested on the basis of evaluating agent (the popular legitimacy, the
   legitimacy of coercive force, the authoritative legitimacy, the
   international legitimacy) and on the legal basis (the legitimacy de
   facto and de jure, the last one includes formal legality and general
   legal legitimacy). The principles and criteria of revolutionary
   legitimacy are presented and discussed: relation to illegitimate
   repressive laws, conditions for the transition to armed resistance, the
   problem of provocations, conflict resolution between revolutionary
   center and a counterrevolutionary province ({''}Vandea{''}). It is shown
   how the fundamental legal principles and values of general significance
   (basic humanistic values) are used for legitimating of revolution in
   situation of formal legacy deficiency.},

Journal = {PS-POLITICAL SCIENCE \& POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {47},
Number = {1},
Pages = {199-203},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Although professors may be aware that rubrics shorten grading time and
   improve grading consistency, many are not aware that rubrics offer a
   powerful analytical punch. Given the demands for active learning in
   today's college classroom, rubrics allow instructors to focus on
   analytical quality while engaging students in a variety of assignments.
   Rubrics are useful not only in more traditional applications-for
   example, papers and oral presentations-but also for more creative
   purposes. Using rubrics in both self and peer assessment engages
   students more in assignments, allowing them to reflect on their own
   performance and their peers. Going one step further, instructors can
   engage students in the construction of rubrics that will be used to
   grade their own work. Finally, rubrics force instructors to be clear
   about their own purposes for an assignment, and over time, instructors
   can become more attuned to the analytical possibilities in even
   traditional ``busywork{''} assignments.},

Abstract = {The article examines evidence and methods in the recent human rights
   literature which reports on the impact of economic and social rights.
   The article is structured according to the four main analytical entry
   points under which distinct methods of social rights impact assessment
   are used: social rights litigation (evidence through analysis of legal
   texts and mainly qualitative evidence), the results of ratifications and
   constitutionalisation (evidence through comparative quantitative data
   analysis), the results of human rights policy reforms (evidence through
   the use of quantitative data and qualitative interpretation) and the
   results of civil society advocacy and human rights-based approaches
   (predominantly qualitative evidence). The paper concludes that positive
   changes are documented with respect to all methods examined, but the
   causal linkages between the social rights analysed and the results on
   the ground are not always well-established, or they provide conflicting
   interpretations, demonstrating that this field of research is still
   relatively young.},

   situationin Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. The study
   shows that the constitution in so far as they relate to theacts of
   secondary EU law in the national legal system may raise some confusion.
   In Poland and Slovakia the constitutions guarantee the primacy of the EU
   secondary law, however, they do not precise there lation ship between
   those acts and the EU secondary law. In the Czech Republic the
   constitution does not relate to the acts created by the European Union.
   In Hungary, in turn, EU law is treated as anational law, but it does not
   eliminate the doubts about the possibility of its control with the

   Civilizations are the basic actors of history because they exist longer

   history than any other historical entity. Until today the basis of the
   international relations was formed by principles of inter-European
   relations. But the model of relations within one civilization inevitably
   has the limited value. Moreover, it is not the only model possible.
   Growing threat to Euro-Atlantic's main advantage - economic superiority,
   has opened prospects to other trends. BRICS will inevitably develop from
   economic group into international political and intercivilizational
   consortium.},

Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {65-85},
Abstract = {This article revisits the security dilemma theory and its application to
   civil conflict. Based on a careful reading of existing studies, it
   exposes the deviations from the original theory developed in the 1950s
   and more recent amendments, which have substantially reduced the
   explanatory value of the theory. The article shows that when the
   original and the amended versions of the theory are applied to civil
   conflict, neither can explain the outbreak of armed conflict. While
   anarchy might be present as a precondition for the dilemma to operate, a
   previous history of violent interaction often leaves little room for
   misperception of intentions. Absent uncertainty about malign intentions
   toward the other group, the security dilemma theory loses relevance to
   explain the outbreak of civil conflict.},

Abstract = {This article examines the current problems and tensions that
   characterize the idea of the right to have rights, considered as a
   cornerstone of the European Union's project. The systemic deficit matter
   is discussed as the main issue to grasp the entirety of the previous
   concept, and some systemic deficit profiles are identified. Moreover
   through the example of the Greek experience the article shows a possible
   way of common action to solve the systemic deficit. Finally, the authors
   talk about how to evaluate these kinds of interventions and what are
   their risks.},

Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3},
Pages = {506-521},
Abstract = {The contemporary context of the struggle for immigrant rights is
   characterized by the detention and deportation of children, ongoing
   militarization of the border, the demonization and criminalization of
   migrants, heavily armed vigilantes who kill, humiliate, and threaten
   immigrants with impunity. The public discourse on immigration is defined
   by racist antiimmigrant editorials, ballot measures, Congressional
   speeches, and public affairs ``debates{''}, that are often more
   adequately described as hate speech. All these things contribute to an
   environment that definitely undercuts Latino voters and perhaps more
   importantly Latino non-voters including children, undocumented people,
   and people residing in detention. This stage of the struggle for
   immigrant rights reminds people of slavery, bondage, the convict lease
   system, and resistance to them as well as the direct action taken to
   mobilize after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act and to press for
   Anti-Lynching legislation. It is not accidental that this toxic
   atmosphere reminds us of enslavement-because slavery has an afterlife of
   enduring gratuitous violence at its heart. Using Saidiyah Hartman's
   concept of the ``after-life of slavery{''} and Dale Tomich's work on the
   ``second slavery{''} this paper more fully articulates the relationship
   between slavery and myths about emancipation, on the one hand, and
   immigration from colonized places, on the other. Robust pan-ethnic
   coalitions must support immigration rights that are more keenly aware of
   their relationship to contemporary black survival, struggles for racial
   justice, and the role that race plays in US empire.},

Abstract = {From the beginning of formation as an independent state, Ukraine has set
   a goal to become a part of global open society. The young state at that
   time was going through the process of rebuilding the social and
   political principles, which were established during the Soviet regime
   and managed to take root in the mass consciousness. The Ukrainian
   society, while it was staying in the ideological toils of Soviet
   authorities for considerable time, was subjected to restriction not only
   in the choice of lifestyle, but also got used to fear punishment for
   attempting to think freely and critically. Consequently, it is quite
   logical to form the public desire to change the old social and political
   way of life and create a new state model, which would be drastically
   opposite to pre-existing pattern In this context there are two examples
   of two large public bursts - the Orange Revolution (2004) and Euromaidan
   (Fall-Winter 2013-2014 years). The main reason for it was the
   community's desire to get rid of the Soviet totalitarian past and to
   implement the idea of democracy, which was based on Western experience.},

Abstract = {During the last decade international development assistance became an
   indispensable aspect of Turkish foreign policy. While expanding
   development cooperation activities both geographically and in the
   variety of development programs, Turkey's successful demand-driven aid
   policy and effective responses to humanitarian crises gained global
   attention. Displaying a systematic increase, Turkey has become the 4th
   largest donor in development assistance and 3rd in humanitarian aid
   generosity in 2012, providing development assistance to 131 countries
   listed as aid recipients in 2011. This study, providing the most
   up-to-date and comprehensive data on Turkish developmental assistance,
   aims to provide a history of Turkey's international assistance policy
   with a focus on the last decade.},

Title = {Bosnia and Herzegovina between Negative and Positive Peace: View from
   the Local Level},
Journal = {ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {4-36},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {The recent critical standpoint argues that the peace-building process in
   Bosnia and Herzegovina has not been successful since it has not achieved
   the state of broadly defined positive peace. According to this
   widespread opinion, the international peace-building policies have been
   formulated in terms of negative peace, and rather cemented the division
   of the country than supported its reintegration. The aim of this paper
   is to test this argument at the local level of analysis using the
   conceptual framework of continuum between narrow and wide understanding
   of peace. Based on interviews with direct actors of the examined
   processes, we carried out a comparative study within a representative
   sample of 11 Bosnian municipalities assessing the four alleged divisions
   that are used as arguments of the critical standpoint. More concretely,
   we analyze identitary, political, historical and societal division of
   the society. Our findings confirm, to a large extent, the general
   patterns assumed by the tested arguments. However, we have also
   identified positive local developments in all of the respective areas,
   which question to certain extent the validity of the critical standpoint
   and give promising prospects for the future. We have also suggested a
   relation between the state and the local level in some of the discussed
   problems as negative phenomena, which are proliferating top-down from
   the state to the local level. Thus, while we have recorded better
   results in areas independent on higher level developments, results in
   issues dependent on state-level politics are either directly or
   indirectly weakened from the top. Overall, we have diagnosed the
   recorded positive developments on the local level as a potentially
   promising channel for the international community to bypass the
   deadlocked state-level politics and give the peace-building process the
   sorely needed boost from below.},

Abstract = {This study assesses whether public disclosure of campaign contributions
   affects citizens' willingness to give money to candidates. In the
   American states, campaign finance laws require disclosure of private
   information for contributors at relatively low thresholds ranging from
   \$1 to \$300. The Internet has made it relatively easy to publicize such
   information in a way that changes the social context for political
   participation. Drawing on social influence theory, the analysis suggests
   that citizens are sensitive to divulging private information, especially
   those who are surrounded by people with different political views. Using
   experimental data from the 2011 Cooperative Congressional Election
   Studies, it demonstrates how individuals refrain from making small
   campaign contributions or reduce their donations to avoid disclosing
   their identities. The conclusion discusses the implications of
   transparency laws for political participation, especially for small
   donors.},

Abstract = {Existing research concludes that acculturation converges Latino
   immigration policy views with those of Anglo-Americans. Yet, polls show
   few Latinos support restricting immigration. This article reconciles
   these statements with theory and evidence. I argue acculturation is part
   of a broader give-and-take process, the two-way street in which the
   contrast between expected and perceived treatment by the receiving
   community shapes whether or not Latino acculturation leads to
   restrictionism and convergence with Anglos. Regression analysis of
   survey data shows that perceived group discrimination, but not perceived
   individual discrimination or Latino within-group discrimination,
   moderates the link between acculturation and support for restrictive
   policy.},

Abstract = {The relationship between politics and religion is, al least, as ancient
   as the first written records that West has a memory of. Even if this
   relationship has been a constant in the political history of peoples, is
   particularly in classic Age where is often said that politics and
   religion are indistinguishable. This is verified with a particular
   emphasis in Rome where, at the time that religion officiate as a
   constitutive element of social bond, politics was proclaimed as the one
   to keep religious observance to ensure, through it, the welfare of the
   Urbs. Despite this, we believe that with the repetition of the
   indistinction topic they often overlook the relationships and interests
   of those who formed the power roman elite, denying so a chance to
   understand the still in force relationship between the sphere of the
   divine and the affairs of state. Thas is why this paper intends to
   inquire about the limits between religion and politics where some of the
   sensitive logics to understand the operation of power in Rome would lie
   and, maybe, of our own time.},

Abstract = {Political knowledge is a central concept in the study of public opinion
   and political behavior. Yet what the field collectively believes about
   this construct is based on dozens of studies using different indicators
   of knowledge. We identify two theoretically relevant dimensions: a
   temporal dimension that corresponds to the time when a fact was
   established and a topical dimension that relates to whether the fact is
   policy-specific or general. The resulting typology yields four types of
   knowledge questions. In an analysis of more than 300 knowledge items
   from late in the first decade of the 2000s, we examine whether classic
   findings regarding the predictors of knowledge withstand differences
   across types of questions. In the case of education and the mass media,
   the mechanisms for becoming informed operate differently across question
   types. However, differences in the levels of knowledge between men and
   women are robust, reinforcing the importance of including
   gender-relevant items in knowledge batteries.},

Abstract = {Using critical theory of media and technology as a theoretical
   framework, we describe the dialectical interrelation between (media)
   technology and democratic changes, where new media technology only paved
   the way to organization and exchange of information during ``Arab
   Spring{''}, but was not its cause. ``Arab Spring{''} as the case in
   point proved a negative correlation between the level of communication
   technology (new media) and the intensity of protests, according to which
   a higher level of accessibility to new media led to a lower level of
   protests. Also, we observe an uneven impact of new media on democratic
   changes, i.e. internet social networks had a secondary role in creating
   media news, compared to satellite TV which at an early stage of ``Arab
   Spring{''} enabled the actors of online civil society to have an impact
   on state politics to a large extent. Arab new media cannot yet lead to
   democratic changes nor explain their causes, but merely alter patterns
   of mobilization and organization of social and political events.},

Abstract = {The 2010 Child Poverty Act placed new obligations to address child
   poverty upon each of the national governments in Britain and all of the
   local authorities in England and Wales. Local authorities in Scotland do
   not have the same legal requirement to tackle child poverty, but it is
   evident that their actions, in conjunction with local partners within
   the context of Community Planning Partnerships, will be critical to the
   success of the Child Poverty Strategy for Scotland introduced by the
   Scottish Government in 2011. At the present time, local interventions to
   tackle child poverty must be enacted under particularly challenging
   conditions, as measures to reduce child poverty are undermined by a
   prolonged economic recession, fiscal austerity, reductions in UK welfare
   spending, and welfare reforms introduced by the UK government which
   appear likely to increase the number of households and children
   experiencing poverty. This paper examines what measures Scottish local
   authorities, Community Planning Partnerships and other local bodies
   could take to address child poverty at the local level and meet the
   national commitment to eradicate child poverty by 2020.},

Abstract = {According to John Tomasi's Free Market Fairness, there are serious
   constraints on what a liberal state may do to promote economic justice.
   Tomasi defends this claim by arguing that important economic liberties
   ought to be regarded as ``basic{''} and given special priority over
   other liberal concerns, including those of economic justice. I argue
   that Tomasi's defense of this claim is unsuccessful. One problem takes
   the form of a dilemma: depending on how the claim is formulated more
   precisely, Tomasi's argument seems either to be compatible with standard
   (e.g., Rawlsian) liberalism or to tell against even the minimal taxation
   that would be necessary to support the social safety net he supports.
   Second, granting ``basic{''} status to economic liberties would in many
   cases defeat the goal, self-authorship, that Tomasi sees himself as
   sharing with other liberals. Third, contrary to Tomasi's suggestions, no
   inconsistency arises when liberals (such as Rawls) refuse to recognize
   the economic liberties as basic. Fourth and finally, the special
   significance that Tomasi attaches to agency does not provide any
   additional reason for accepting Tomasi's conclusions.},

Abstract = {This article critically evaluates the agenda and strategy of the
   Australian American Leadership Dialogue (AALD) for protecting and
   strengthening the Australia-US alliance. Nominally an exercise in
   informal diplomacy dedicated to fostering mutual understanding, the AALD
   functions more like a pro-American lobby group as it seeks to preserve
   orthodox thinking and eschew dissenting perspectives. The AALD performs
   this function in three main ways: by carefully framing discussion and
   debate, by socialising Australian elites into the alliance orthodoxy and
   by serving as a `gatekeeper' of the status quo.},

Abstract = {This article addresses two research questions: which course did the CDU,
   CSU-FDP coalition government choose to follow in social policy from 2009
   to 2013? And what relationships exist between social policy in this
   period and the Bundestag election in 2013? The analysis of primary and
   secondary data reveals both continuity and discontinuity in social
   policy in the 17th legislative period of the Bundestag. The decisions
   and non-decisions on social protection and labour market regulation in
   this period mirror a wide variety of determinants. These include
   partisan effects, electoral cycles, co-governing judges and anonymous
   social policy of market forces. The data also suggest that the CDU/CSU
   has been relatively successful in its strategy of `asymmetric
   demobilisation', the strategy of changing its social policy profile to
   one more similar to that of its social democratic opponent, in order to
   demobilise the SPD's voters rather than mobilising them. More ambivalent
   has been the electoral outcome of the FDP's role in social policy. The
   FDP's first foray into leading a large welfare state ministry, the
   Federal Ministry of Health, in 2009 to 2013 did not prove to be a
   winning proposition for the Liberals electorally. Social policy in
   general and welfare state recalibration in particular thus seem to be an
   electorally especially risky project for a liberal party such as the
   FDP.},

Volume = {49},
Number = {4},
Pages = {677-693},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {This article reviews existing scholarly debates about Australia's
   pragmatic federalism and seeks to refine it conceptually. It does so
   against the background of burgeoning international governance literature
   informed by insights from philosophical pragmatism, as well as in the
   context of disjuncture in Australian inter-governmental experiences.
   Pragmatic federalism is posed not merely as a one-dimensional notion
   referencing a series of ad hoc inter-governmental arrangements over
   time. Rather, it is conceptualised as multi-dimensional and
   encapsulating a confined range of institutional designs and postures
   that can (potentially) be observed across different policy fields and
   over time. An initial demonstration of the utility of the heuristic to
   recent empirical experience and change is presented. The consequence is
   more serious engagement with both the formal and informal features that
   characterise inter-governmental arrangements at different levels of
   government, and attention to the degrees to which dialogue and practices
   are connected.},

Abstract = {The quadrennial presidential nominating conventions are the biggest
   campaign events of the election cycle. Previous studies find that
   conventions significantly impact national-level candidate preferences;
   however, scholars have not yet specified the effects that such large
   campaign events have on residents of the host areas. As fairly uniform
   and one-sided interventions across years and parties, the conventions
   offer an opportunity for a cross time, cross-sectional analysis of the
   local effect of campaign events. We develop a difference-in-difference
   analysis to show conventions significantly affect the presidential
   candidates' county-level vote shares. Individual-level data from panel
   surveys from before and after the 2000 and 2004 conventions are used to
   validate the aggregate-level findings. Beyond providing strong evidence
   of meaningful campaign event effects, the results demonstrate how
   campaign effects can be conditional on local political characteristics
   and geography. Overall, we find Democrats are more likely to gain
   support in convention host communities than Republicans.},

Abstract = {Nine secondary teachers who were taught to use one model of
   deliberation, Structured Academic Controversy (SAC) (Johnson and Johnson
   1979), were matched with nine teachers in their schools who taught
   similar grade levels and subjects. Teachers in the Deliberation Classes
   engaged students in three deliberations across six months. Deliberations
   focused on current public issues, such as whether violent juvenile off
   enders should be tried as adults. Five of the nine classroom pairs were
   analyzed using both pre- and post-questionnaires. There were no
   statistically significant differences in the pre- and post-questionnaire
   responses of students in the Deliberation Classes (n = 244) and
   Comparison Classes (n = 249) in terms of self-reported issue knowledge.
   Variance in student opinion in the Deliberation Classes showed a
   significant decrease. Students in the Deliberation Classes (n = 297)
   demonstrated greater perspective-taking abilities than students in the
   Comparison Classes (n = 238). Within classes, diversity of opinion
   regarding issues was evident.},

Abstract = {This article takes as its starting point the attack on the late Ralph
   Miliband, the left-wing intellectual and father of the current Labour
   leader Ed Miliband, by the Daily Mail in late 2013. It argues that this
   attack was a response by the Mail to its failed campaign to dub the
   Labour leader Red Ed'. The article demonstrates that ever since Miliband
   won the Labour leadership in 2009, the Mail has sought to other' him by
   presenting him as alien'this by constant references to his Jewish
   background, his upbringing in a wealthy North London intellectual
   milieu, his supposed extreme left-wing views and his ineffable
   oddness'at least, an oddness as characterised by the newspaper. The
   paper will conclude by asking why the Daily Mail's Red Ed' moniker
   failed to catch on, while noting that their Odd Ed' moniker seems to
   have had more resonance.},

Abstract = {Political preferences are multi-dimensional, covering topics like
   redistribution, immigration, and abortion. But what accounts for
   people's political preferences? We argue that an individual's work
   experiences on the job play an important part in shaping attitudes. In a
   process of generalization and transposition, people apply the kinds of
   reasoning, heuristics, and problem-solving techniques they learn and use
   at work in all realms of life. In this article, we briefly discuss the
   dimensionality of the political preference space and then explicate our
   account that links work experiences with attitudes. We use European
   Social Survey data to establish correlations between work experiences
   and attitudes and find evidence that is consistent with our account.},

Abstract = {While there are many formal models that generate predictions about
   polarization, only a handful address the question of how, with no change
   in electoral rules, levels of polarization can dramatically vary over
   time, as they have in the US House during 150 years of two-party
   competition. We propose a model that emphasizes national party
   constraints on district candidates' ability to locate at positions far
   from the national party stance. The model predicts a close relation
   between tight tethers maintained by the national parties and
   congressional polarization, suggests implications for political
   competition, and generates the empirically accurate prediction that
   partisan polarization and within-party differentiation are negatively
   correlated. When the tethers of the two parties are not equally strong,
   the model suggests modifications to the conditional party governance
   approach and helps explain ideological shift/drift affecting both
   parties, with the party with the tighter tether moving the other party
   toward its ideological wake.},

   cities. China is highly likely to meet the target of 100 million more
   urban hukou population by 2020. A big challenge is the integration of

Abstract = {This article will explore the dilemmas that Albania has been
   experiencing in implementing the rule of law during the past two decades
   with particular attention to the political institutional obstacles,
   including the difficulties of establishing an independent judiciary and
   the pervasiveness of corruption. The concept of the rule of law will be
   the lens through which the difficulties of the democratization process
   will be examined. The lack of transparency in the legislature and more
   broadly in the political decision-making process, and the divisive and
   leader-dominated political party system are two additional obstacles
   that Albania is facing in consolidating democracy. Since its first
   post-communist election in 1991, Albania has experienced challenges in
   conducting legitimate elections that meet international standards. The
   political and cultural environment where these political institutions
   operate and from which they have been constructed will provide the
   backdrop for analysis.},

Abstract = {Throughout history, the Crimean Tatars have challenged Russian
   aggression by utilizing two main strategies: engaging and confronting.
   Since its annexation of Crimea in March 2014, Russia has left no room
   for engagement and has demanded the complete submission of the Crimean
   Tatar population. This article argues that the Crimean Tatars should not
   yield to Russian demands, but rather pursue an integrated policy aimed
   at rallying potential allies such as Turkey, Ukraine, and the EU around
   their cause, lobbying through their diaspora organizations, and
   advocating for their human rights through non-violent means. In
   addressing Turkey's conflicting allegiances to the EU and the Crimean
   Tatars on the one hand and a burgeoning strategic and economic
   partnership with Russia on the other, the author argues that Turkey has
   the capacity to address this challenge creatively, rather than reacting
   to involved actors.},

Title = {Developments in Icelandic Security Policy},
Journal = {ICELANDIC REVIEW OF POLITICS \& ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Iceland has been slow in developing a national security concept, for
   reasons that include a long period of reliance on US protection
   post-World War Two, and divided internal views over this defence
   solution. Since the withdrawal of all US stationed forces in 2006,
   Iceland's security partnerships have diversified and attempts have been
   made to frame security in more multi-functional terms. The Risk
   Assessment Report of 2009 made important progress in itemizing
   non-military threats and risks. On this basis, a cross-party
   parliamentary committee was invited to start work in 2012 on guidelines
   for a security strategy. Its report, published in March 2014,
   establishes a large area of consensus on `softer' security issues and on
   remaining in NATO, with a few dissenting voices on the latter. Its main
   omission is a proper treatment of economic and financial security, still
   tied to the divisive issue of EU membership. Meanwhile, Iceland's recent
   security experience in 2014 has helped to highlight the reality of both
   harder and softer security challenges. The government can now proceed to
   draft a full official security strategy, to be laid before parliament
   possibly in 2015.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the effects of deliberation and increased
   political knowledge on vote choice. The observed knowledge gains result
   from participation in a deliberative experiment in the context of
   second-order elections, which facilitates realistic estimates of
   information gains that can be expected if citizens were politically more
   engaged than they actually are. Using survey data on 333 participants in
   the deliberative experiment and 729 respondents from a control group, we
   find that deliberation is associated with significant changes in vote
   choice. Specifically, participating in the deliberative event is related
   to an increased likelihood of vote switching in favour of Green parties.
   However, there is no support for the expectation that changes in
   citizens' party choices are related to the observed increase in
   political knowledge.},

Abstract = {Much of the protest literature has examined the policy consequences of
   social protests. Few studies focus on the effect of social protests on
   public opinion. We examine the impact of the 2006 immigration protests
   on the saliency of immigration among Latinos. The 2006 Latino National
   Survey was in the field before and after the protests began, creating a
   natural experiment. Using these data, we discover protests increased
   Latinos' perception of undocumented immigration as the most important
   problem facing Latinos. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the effect
   of protest was not uniform across the population but rather contingent
   on individuals' characteristics.},

Abstract = {This article argues that Turkey is going through a paradigm transition
   regarding its migration characteristics and has changed from an
   emigration to an immigration country. It briefly reviews the history of
   immigration of mostly ethnic Turks or other Muslims to Turkey, but then
   concentrates on contemporary non-Turkic and non-Muslim immigrants. In
   the first part, it distinguishes between flows of travelers and migrants
   and stock of immigrants. Notably, it illustrates national diversity,
   assesses the quantitative level of immigration to Turkey, including
   estimates on irregular immigration. In the second part, it analyzes the
   macro-level economic, political and social factors and discrepancies
   between Turkey, its neighbors and other countries in the wider region.
   It concludes that immigration to Turkey is still comparably low but that
   due to macro-level factors, it could grow. In order to develop adequate
   policy responses, more research must be done.},

Abstract = {The article considers the tension between formality and informality in
   the processes of governance in Great Britain and Germany from a
   comparative perspective. After having related the research question to
   the pertinent theories, the article outlines the distinct cultures of
   formality and informality in the respective systems of government. On
   this basis, the author studies the formal and informal leadership
   resources at the disposal of the prime minister and the chancellor in
   core areas of government, or, to be exact, in contexts of action of
   government formation, the cabinet as well as government headquarters.
   The author argues that increasing informality as well as increasing
   formality represent strategic responses to existing restrictions of
   action. The article concludes by outlining further research options for
   such a gradual as well as dynamic conceptualization of informality.},

Abstract = {Although many policy process and diffusion theories follow the premise
   that scientific and technological knowledge plays a crucial role in a
   wide variety of policy fields, very few empirically assess the impact
   that institutional and process-relevant factors may have on the position
   of science within a process. The present study addresses the question of
   what role science plays in policy processes. To answer this, we apply
   the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) and investigate three
   complementary assumptions using a qualitative comparison of four cases:
   the ACF claims that scientific experts can take very different positions
   in the policy process, depending on how conflictive or
   consensus-oriented the relations among actors and coalitions are within
   a so-called policy subsystem. Put differently, the type of subsystem
   impacts on the position of science within the process. The results show
   that subsystem-specific factors impact upon whether scientific
   representatives act at the periphery of a process or as policy brokers
   seeking feasible policy solutions.},

Abstract = {Political parties are considered to be vital elements of political life
   in modern democracies, and whether in democratic regimes they maintain
   democratic mechanisms within their own organizations and structures has
   been an intriguing topic. The most important issue is which factors
   influence the internal democracy in parties. This article examines the
   relationship between functioning of democracy in parties and party
   leadership, candidate selection mechanisms, membership systems, policy
   formulation systems and communication channels. In addition to the
   commonly used indicators of intra-party democracy in three areas - the
   leader's power and control, nomination process and determining policy
   preferences - this article deals with the process of membership
   recruitment and membership rights. It analyses the factors that
   influence intra-party democracy in Turkey focusing on the multiparty
   period after 1946 by giving examples from the political parties and
   previous research results.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {35},

Abstract = {Second-order elections are characterized by low turnout. According to
   the second-order theory this is because people feel there is less at
   stake. This study tests whether the less at stake argument holds at the
   macro and micro level using panel survey data obtained in three
   different Dutch elections. Furthermore, it examines whether campaigns'
   mobilizing potential differs between first- and second-order elections.
   We find that at the macro level perceived stakes and low turnout go hand
   in hand and differ strongly between national, local and European
   elections. At the micro level the impact of perceived stakes on turnout
   is limited and contingent on the type of election. Also, campaign
   exposure affects turnout, but the effect is substantially larger in
   second-order contests. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {383-394},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article considers the role and relevance of liberal
   multiculturalism in contemporary political theory. Liberal
   multiculturalism is a form of multiculturalism that emphasizes
   group-specific rights for minority groups within a liberal framework.
   Minority protections are adopted to secure basic liberal rights. The
   article first reviews Will Kymlicka's formulation of liberal
   multiculturalism; Kymlicka's work receives focus here as he provides the
   standard liberal multiculturalist position. The article then moves to
   exploring responses to the position. First I explore liberal responses
   and second I look at a recognition-based approach. In the final section
   the article provides a brief response to both of these critiques. I find
   that the liberal criticisms are overstated and that recognition-based
   approaches can help identify a possible way for liberal multiculturalism
   to respond better to the claims of minorities.},

Title = {Who controls the wealth? Electoral system design and ethnic war in
   resource-rich countries},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {35},
Pages = {171-187},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Both natural resource wealth and electoral system design are frequently
   investigated factors in the civil wars literature. So far, however,
   there is no well-known study which explicitly considers the interaction
   effect between these two factors on the risk of violent ethnic conflict.
   We argue that resource-rich countries with a proportional electoral
   system for the legislature are less prone to ethnic civil war than
   resource-rich countries with a majoritarian or mixed electoral system,
   as proportional electoral systems tend to increase the effective number
   of parliamentary parties and thus the number of groups who can share
   state control over resource wealth. We find empirical support for this
   argument using binary time-series-cross-section analysis covering 83 to
   140 countries between 1984 and 2007. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {This essay first outlines Alexis de Tocqueville's well-known argument
   from Democracy in America that religion shapes the mores that keep
   American ``equality of conditions{''} from deteriorating into the
   ``tyranny of the majority.{''} The paper then turns to the superb
   research of scholars who have published the notes, letters, and journals
   that Tocqueville and his traveling companion, Gustave de Beaumont,
   produced during their 1831-32 US journey. That material allows a clearer
   picture of where Tocqueville was perceptive, where he failed to record
   important aspects of American religion as it actually existed, and where
   what he observed accurately in 1831-32 changed significantly shortly
   thereafter. More attention to the neglected book that Beaumont published
   after their trip, Marie; or, Slavery in the United States, shows that
   his detailed assessment of United States' deeply ingrained racist
   attitudes would have helped make Tocqueville's insightful analysis of
   American democracy even more compelling.},

Abstract = {Russia's actions in Ukraine have polarized the German public. While some
   simply condemn the annexation of the Crimea and the war in Donbas by
   referring to international law, others have a different understanding of
   Russia. Some even openly legitimize the annexation. For them, ``the
   West{''} is mainly responsible for the crisis. The apologetics of
   ``Putin's friends{''} feed on a persistent anti-Americanism, the
   consensus culture and pacifism that emerged in Germany after the Second
   World War, a historically reductionist and unreflective feeling of guilt
   towards Russia because of the war, cliches regarding Eastern Europe, and
   a poor knowledge of Ukraine. This mix is fertile ground for the
   widespread attitude of non-interference.},

Title = {Building policy scales from manifesto data: A referential content
   validity approach},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {35},
Pages = {88-101},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Researchers using scales based on MRG/CMP/MARPOR's manifesto dataset
   face a bewildering array of different scales. The validation of these
   scales has tended to focus on external, convergent validity. The actual
   content of these scales has received less attention and the choice of
   the manifesto components which make up these scales has often been
   conducted by either opaque or questionable methods. This article
   develops a critique of existing methods of component selection and
   proposes a new method of component selection based on the covariance of
   components with `naive' provisional scales, which are refined in an
   iterative process. It uses this method to construct a set of comparable
   one (general left right) and two (economic and social) dimensional
   scales filling a gap in the existing body of scales that will allow
   researchers to compare dimensionality across models without
   inadvertently comparing different assumptions that underlie the
   construction of the scales. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {To enhance explanations for party polarization in the U. S. Congress, we
   focus on an unappreciated legal structure known as the sore loser law.
   By restricting candidates who lose partisan primaries from subsequently
   appearing on the general election ballot as independents or as nominees
   of other parties, these laws give greater control over ballot access to
   the party bases, thus producing more extreme major party nominees. Using
   several different measures of candidate and legislator ideology, we find
   that sore loser laws account for as much as a tenth of the ideological
   divide between the major parties.},

Abstract = {The issue of an independent Scotland's relationship with the European
   Union (EU) has been one of the most contentious and recurring issues of
   the referendum campaign. Discussion, to date, has been characterised by
   competing assertions from the two sides of the campaign. There has been
   little in the way of reasoned debate and consideration of the issue.
   Instead it has become grist to the mill of two campaign meta-narratives,
   one concerning the uncertainty inherent in a `Yes' vote and the other
   concerning the continuity and stability that Scotland would enjoy
   following a `Yes' vote. In this essay I will problematise the official
   position set out by the European Commission, clarify some of the
   outstanding issues, and raise questions about the proposed timescale for
   securing an independent Scotland's continuing membership of the EU. I
   argue that it would be in the interests of all parties, in the event of
   a `Yes' vote, to avoid a scenario in which Scotland found itself outside
   of the EU and its legal framework for any period of time.},

Abstract = {Electoral gender quotas have become the subject of a growing literature
   in comparative politics, with the potential to affect how scholars study
   a wide range of electoral and representative processes. Yet, debates
   have emerged over how to define and categorize these policies, with
   implications for the ability to compare cases and draw broader
   conclusions about their impact in countries around the globe. Reviewing
   these perspectives, this article draws on work on concept formation to
   propose a pragmatic approach, focused on matching typologies to research
   questions. It emphasizes the advantages of this solution for promoting
   cumulative research and concludes with some thoughts for future research
   on gender quotas and comparative politics.},

Abstract = {We argue that interjurisdiction competition in authoritarian regimes
   engenders a specific logic for taxation. Promotion-seeking local
   officials are incentivized to signal loyalty and competence to their
   principals through tangible fiscal revenues. The greater the number of
   officials accountable to the same principal, the more intense political
   competition is, resulting in higher taxation; however, too many
   officials accountable to the same principal leads to lower taxation due
   to shirking by uncompetitive officials and the fear of political
   instability. Using a panel dataset of all Chinese county-level
   jurisdictions from 1999-2006, we find strong evidence for an inverse
   U-shaped relationship between the number of county-level jurisdictions
   within a prefecture-our proxy for the intensity of political
   competition-and fiscal revenues in most provinces but not so in
   politically unstable ethnic minority regions. The results are robust to
   various alternative specifications, including models that account for
   heterogeneous county characteristics and spatial interdependence.},

Abstract = {There are a number of tall tales about how religion shapes opinions on
   Scotland's constitutional future. This article outlines some of the more
   common of these, as well as claims of a recent `silent revolution'
   amongst Scotland's Catholics. These are examined through the evidence of
   Scottish Social Attitudes Surveys. The article concludes that the
   apparent associations between religious group and support for
   independence in fact spring from differential experiences of
   secularisation. Far from demonstrating shifts in religious opinion, the
   evidence suggests that religious belonging now has little or no
   relevance to attitudes towards independence.},

   the author presents the political programs and activities of the
   Croatian Party of Rights (HSP) from 1990 to 1992. This work analyzes the
   political aims of the party, the most important personalities associated
   with it during this period, the significance of its electioneering as
   well as of its results in the election of 1992. Once the multiparty
   system was established, HSP was rebuilt by Dobroslav Paraga and Ante
   Paradzik. The main party's program was the establishment of an
   independent Croatian state. Political action of HSP resulted in
   political killings, political trials of leading party officials and the
   Party's schism. The fundamental obstacle to renewal and further
   development of HSP was the Croatian Democratic Union and its attitude
   towards HSP.},

Abstract = {This article examines support for radical left ideologies in 32 European
   countries. It thus extends the relatively scant empirical research
   available in this field. The hypotheses tested are derived mainly from
   group-interest theory. Data are deployed from the 2002-2010 European
   Social Surveys (N = 174,868), supplemented by characteristics at the
   country level. The results show that, also in the new millennium,
   unemployed people and those with a lower income are more likely to
   support a radical left ideology. This is only partly explained by their
   stronger opinion that governments should take measures to reduce income
   differences. In contrast to expectations, the findings show that greater
   income inequality within a country is associated with reduced likelihood
   of an individual supporting a radical left ideology. Furthermore,
   cross-national differences in the likelihood of supporting the radical
   left are strongly associated with whether a country has a legacy of an
   authoritarian regime.},

Abstract = {Since the late 1970s, but especially since Unification in 1990, the
   German federal system has come under considerable stress. On the one
   hand, party competition is increasingly played out through the
   Bundesrat, the body representing the Lander governments at the federal
   level, making intergovernmental coordination more difficult and leading
   to accusations of `Reformstau' (reform log jam). On the other hand,
   Unification not only added five new Lander to the system, but also led
   to economic disparities between the Lander at a hitherto unknown level,
   and deepened territorial conflicts over Lander competencies and the
   allocation of finances. Both developments have led to demands for a
   reform of the federal structure aimed at disentangling joint
   policymaking structures to ensure greater autonomy for both the federal
   level and the Lander. However, as the article will argue, the
   developments have resulted in a triangular constellation of interests
   between the federal level, the richer and the poorer Lander that makes
   reforming the system almost impossible.},

Abstract = {The concept of justice is difficult to exclude from conflicts and
   resolution strategies. Frequently, it plays a negative, hardening role.
   In the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia argues the right to
   self-determination of peoples, Azerbaijan the right of territorial
   integrity. Both sides link their approach to the pursuit of ``historical
   justice{''} in order to lend more legitimacy to their demands. This
   charges the conflict emotionally and makes it difficult to find a
   balance between the conflicting principles of international law. If
   forward-looking principles of justice were considered instead of
   backward-looking ones, a resolution of the conflict could be found. It
   is the responsibility of external mediators to make sure that this
   happens.},

Abstract = {Unilateral presidential actions, such as executive orders, are widely
   cited as a key strategic tool for presidential power. However, is
   unilateral action evidence of unilateralism or might it represent
   executive acquiescence? We answer this by (1) specifying three competing
   models, each with a different presidential discretion assumption and
   generating alternative hypotheses; (2) extending the canonical
   item-response model to best measure executive-order significance; and
   (3) comparing competing theoretical models to data for 1947-2002.
   Theoretically, we show that legislative preferences may impact
   unilateral actions differently than previously thought and indicate how
   parties may be influential. Empirically, a model where the president is
   responsive to the chamber's majority-party median fits the data better
   than models assuming responsiveness to the chamber median or no
   presidential acquiescence. Unilateral action appears not tantamount to
   presidential power, as evidence implies that legislative parties, or the
   judicial actors enforcing their will, are key conditioning factors.},

Abstract = {This article argues that human rights could be improved by motivating
   politicians and bureaucrats to put more effort into protecting human
   rights. It conceptualizes the production of human rights practices as
   the outcome of two principal-agent relationships that constrain
   politicians and bureaucrats. Reliance on taxes is a non-electoral,
   fiscal factor that makes politicians more willing to protect human
   rights. Increased government revenue, no matter the source, raises
   bureaucratic compensation and helps create a more accountable
   bureaucracy. Thus both a higher reliance on taxes and larger state
   revenues lead to the better protection of human rights. Each fiscal
   factor promotes a different type of accountability, both of which
   independently contribute to good human rights practices.},

Abstract = {When it comes to analyses of financial power in Latin America, there has
   been a tendency to assume it is mostly external, relatively homogeneous,
   and usually constraining of domestic policy autonomy. Increasingly,
   however, when speaking of financial power in the region, a focus
   exclusively on foreign capital misses a significant part of the
   empirical landscape, one inhabited by large domestic institutional
   investors: public and private pension funds. A focus on these funds
   reveals that a neat state-finance dichotomy is often unrepresentative of
   the type of blurred web of interests, influence and ownership that
   characterizes even those economies that have embraced a significant
   degree of liberalization. In fact, pension finance is far from uniform
   across countries. In order to capture this diversity in Latin America, a
   new typology is suggested that departs from the Anglo-American notion of
   `pension fund capitalism' and further specifies pension finance as also
   revealing dynamics best described as `pension fund developmentalism and
   statism'. The typology is not only aimed at capturing more empirical
   nuance in Latin America; it can also serve as reference for
   cross-regional analyses of these often neglected, but increasingly
   powerful financial actors in emerging economies.},

Abstract = {This article compares the types of knowledge democracy and the market
   require to rationally allocate resources. I argue that high levels of
   public ignorance and voters' inability to compare the effects of
   different parties' policies make it difficult for parties and elections
   to rationally allocate resources. Markets mitigate these problems
   because the simultaneous existence of multiple firms' products
   facilitates comparisons that mimic the conditions of scientific
   experimentation. The economy of knowledge involved in such comparisons
   indicates there are epistemic advantages to using firms and markets,
   instead of political parties and elections, to allocate scarce
   resources. However, in contrast to arguments that markets merely provide
   better information than political decisions, I argue markets' epistemic
   advantages are derived from the way they facilitate comparisons that
   minimize decision makers' need for knowledge or understanding.},

Abstract = {In this note, we revisit the work of Carson and Crespinto examine the
   effect of different redistricting plans on competitiveness in U.S. House
   elections. Similar to the previous results, our probit estimates on an
   expanded dataset that includes redistricting cycles from 1972 to 2012
   reveal that commission and court-drawn districts experience more
   competition on average than those drawn by legislatures. These results
   provide additional support for the hypothesis that one way to increase
   the competitiveness of congressional elections is to allow
   extra-legislative bodies to draw congressional district boundaries.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Do economic perceptions influence partisan preferences or vice versa? We
   argue that the direction of influence between government approval and
   economic perceptions is conditional on the state of the economy. Under
   conditions of economic crisis, when economic signals are relatively
   unambiguous, perceptions of the economy can be expected to exogenously
   influence government approval but this is not found when the economy is
   experiencing a more typical pattern of moderate growth and economic
   signals are more mixed. We test these arguments using British election
   panel surveys covering electoral cycles of moderate economic growth
   (1997-2001) and dramatic and negative disruption (2005-2010). We examine
   the most commonly employed measures of retrospective economic
   perceptions and estimate a range of models using structural equations
   modelling. We demonstrate that when the economy is performing extremely
   badly economic perceptions have an exogenous effect on government
   approval and provide a means of electoral accountability, but this is
   not the case in under more normal circumstances.},

Abstract = {Implementation of the insurance-exchange and Medicaid-expansion
   provisions of the Affordable Care Act offers an opportunity to analyze
   the sources and extent of state and federal government leverage in
   bargaining over the rollout of amajor federal program. What stands out
   from this study is state officials'ability to leverage their
   administrative capacity and policy expertise as well as their power to
   decline participation in federal programs in order to influence
   implementation of a federal initiative. State officials' influence is
   heightened when the program depends on state participation to achieve
   key federal objectives, when state threats to decline participation are
   meaningful, and when state nonparticipation threatens the success of a
   signature item on a president's policy agenda.},

Abstract = {A variety of scholars have theorized about the importance of political
   forces as safeguards of federalism. However, many of these theories have
   yet to be tested empirically. This study draws on data from a survey of
   1,182 local party chairs in 49 states in 2010 to determine whether
   political parties may act as bridging mechanisms between the interests
   of political officials at the state and national levels. The results
   suggest local party activity has an impact on the election outcomes of
   candidates for national office, and this effect is more pronounced in
   state contexts that are competitive or unfavorable to the local party.},

Abstract = {The article examines the impact of the new European Union member states
   from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) on the Common Agricultural Policy
   (CAP) during the period 2004-2013. This article specifically addresses
   the agricultural policy preferences of the newcomers, emerging
   coalitions and voting behaviours in the Council of Agricultural
   Ministers on CAP issues. The analysis shows that the CEE Member States
   have not been speaking with one voice on specific CAP issues. However,
   they have become a united and determined group in the quest for more
   even direct payments under the CAP. This has led to the first
   redistributive reform in the history of the CAP. Therefore, the
   preferences of the new members for aligning levels of direct Union-wide
   aid combined with broader budgetary constraints have provided an
   additional lever in the CAP reform process. However, at the same time,
   the CEE member states lack a broader long term vision of the CAP, a fact
   that reduces their impact on the CAP reform agenda.},

   Interests Shapes Business Attitudes Toward Social Partnership},

Abstract = {In recent decades, business interests became protagonists of welfare
   retrenchment in many countries. In contrast, Austria's national business
   organization, the WKo (Wirtschaftskammer osterreich), defended welfare
   programs and social partnership against government initiatives to
   dismantle them. Drawing on interviews and media reports, this article
   analyzes the reasons for this deviation, focusing on reforms in two
   fields: (a) public pensions and (b) social insurance administration. The
   article suggests that the institutional setup of interest representation
   in Austria explains this stance better than alternative explanations
   that focus on competitive advantages. The article identifies compulsory
   membership, equal voting rights, and encompassing organization as the
   relevant features of the institutional setup. These features shaped the
   WKo's social policy attitudes in two ways: first, by ensuring a strong
   role for small firms, and second, by reducing the vulnerability of the
   organization to discontented minorities. The findings point to the
   importance of organizational structures in shaping associational policy
   preferences.},

Abstract = {This paper employs an online voting simulation to examine how the vote
   decision process affects the vote choice. We focus on proximity voting,
   an empirically powerful but informationally demanding model of voter
   behavior. Holding contextual factors constant, we find that more
   politically knowledgeable individuals engage in a deeper and broader
   decision process prior to casting their ballot, and, in turn, a more
   detailed decision process boosts the likelihood that one will vote
   proximately. In addition, we find that detailed decision processes have
   a stronger link with proximity voting among the most knowledgeable
   individuals, who are able to skillfully engage with new information. (C)

   This arouses our legal consideration in construction of the settlement
   mechanism of collective labor dispute. We should flexibly call the
   traditional labor organization pattern, namely, the system of workers
   and staff congress, construct and improve the early warning mechanism of
   labor relationship and enhance the settlement mechanism of the current

   mobilization of this sector of the Brazilian population, especially in
   the state of Sao Paulo. Forms of exclusion to which we refer here, can
   also be considered as opportunities for action of various black
   associative forms present in the country since the beginning of
   twentieth century.},

Abstract = {The EU has been successfully exercising its conditionality as a key
   aspect of its enlargement strategy since the 1990s. However, with no
   accession prospect in sight and the perceived lack of credibility and
   consistency of the EU's conditionality, Turkey's already unequal
   partnership with Europe has been thrown further off balance. This
   article argues that this is not the case, as the EU retains its leverage
   over Turkey, even in the absence of factors that are known as central to
   the successful implementation of the EU's conditionality. This article
   suggests two main reasons. First, despite the rhetoric on the
   interdependence of Turkish and the EU economy, this interdependence is
   not on equal footing and the Turkish economy is heavily dependent on the
   EU. Second, there is rising concern in Turkey over free trade talks
   between the EU and the United States, with its potential impact on the
   Turkish economy.},

Abstract = {This article investigates Yugoslavism in the first two decades of
   socialist Yugoslavia by focusing on a specific case study: the capital
   city of the federal State. The research takes into consideration a
   period of greater centralization of the Federation during which new
   important representative functions were envisaged for Belgrade; at the
   same time, this was a phase of a more intensive promotion of ``socialist
   Yugoslavism{''}. Based on both archival material and published sources,
   it focuses on the identity politics implemented to transform Belgrade's
   image, paying particular attention to identity vectors such as
   monuments, street and place names, museum exhibitions, public
   celebrations, and their role in the urban public space. The main goal is
   the analysis of some aspects of the Yugoslav identity discourse emerging
   in this particular context, trying to recognize the forms of
   representation of Socialist Yugoslavism promoted in the political
   practice and to contribute to a better understanding of the relationship
   between Yugoslavism and socialism.},

Abstract = {In a multinational country such as Ukraine, the language question is a
   sensitive issue. Language can quickly become a political issue. This was
   seen shortly after the fall of Viktor Yanukovych, when the Ukrainian
   parliament attempted to suspend the language law of 2012 and downgrade
   the status of Russian. Ukraine needs a new language policy. The starting
   point must be human rights. A positive attitude towards linguistic
   diversity and the special role of Ukrainian as a symbol of national
   independence should be core elements of such a language policy. It is
   imperative to reconcile Russian-speaking citizens to their country and
   at the same time create conditions for improving mastery and boosting
   use of the Ukrainian language.},

Abstract = {The metaphor of the humors in Machiavelli has been the subject of an
   important number of studies. Essentially concentrated on his major
   works, scholars have emphasized that Machiavelli uses this category of
   medical origin in a context marked by a reflection on institutional
   forms and the role of conflicts. This article proposes to study the use
   of this metaphor in a less-studied source: the political correspondence
   of Machiavelli during the crisis of the Florentine territorial state in
   the beginning of the XVIth century. The goal of our study is double: it
   aims to present a level of analysis of the body politic relative to the
   phenomena of opinions which, until now, have escaped critical analysis;
   it intends to question the residual cognitive value of this metaphor in
   the light of the recent historiographical debate concerning the nature
   and the forms of public opinion in pre-modern societies.},

Abstract = {The separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine is supported by several
   groups. The first wave, in early April 2014, consisted mostly of
   journalists and local politicians who were integrated into transnational
   neo-Nazi, neo-Stalinist, and ultra-orthodox networks operating out of
   Moscow. After the men of this first wave had been arrested, a second
   generation of separatists took its place. This group involves first and
   foremost heavily armed former soldiers of the wars in Afghanistan and
   Chechnya. In addition, it includes special units from Russia's military
   intelligence service GRU, renegade members of Ukrainian police and
   security forces, Cossacks, radical right-wingers seeking adventure in
   war, and humiliated, violent young men from Ukraine and Russia.},

Abstract = {It has been theoretically and empirically shown that ideological
   diversity complements the effect of institutions on the development of
   party systems and the number of political parties that ensue. Thus,
   students of party and electoral systems now commonly employ ethnic
   fractionalization as an indicator of ideological differences; however,
   there is no unilaterally agreed upon data set that scholars use. In
   addition, extant data sets measure heterogeneity at the national level,
   rather than at the district level, where electoral competition takes
   place and where both institutional and social factors matter most. Using
   a multi-level empirical analysis, this article illustrates the
   interactive effect of the two main district characteristics magnitude
   and heterogeneity on the number of parties. It demonstrates the
   analytical benefit of using district-level characteristics in explaining
   party system size and aims to reduce the data gap by providing a
   district-level ethnic heterogeneity data set for 18 European states.},

Abstract = {In Ukraine, calls for the country's federalisation have grown loud.
   Advocates see federalisation as a way to reduce tensions between the
   regions. Opponents fear an increase in centrifugal tendencies. Moscow
   propagates federalisation in order to maintain its influence in the
   country or even to paralyse it along the lines of Bosnia. Instead of
   pondering federalisation a la russe, Kiev should build functioning state
   institutions and launch reforms aimed at decentralising and
   strengthening self-determination at the local and regional level. That
   would be the most important contribution Ukraine's leaders could make to
   strengthening statehood and democracy.},

Abstract = {While much has been written about the formation and termination of
   coalitions, comparatively little attention has been paid to the policy
   output of multiparty governments. The present study attempts to narrow
   this research gap by analysing policy-making in three Austrian coalition
   governments between 1999 and 2008. Drawing on the party mandate
   literature, a manually coded textual analysis of election manifestos is
   conducted that yields a dataset containing over 1,100 pledges. The
   fulfilment of these pledges is taken as the dependent variable in a
   multivariate analysis. The results indicate that institutional
   determinants (adoption in the coalition agreement, ministerial control,
   and policy status quo) significantly influence the chances of pledge
   fulfilment and thus present a powerful predictor of coalition policy
   output. By contrast, factors related to parties' preferences (consensus
   between parties, policy distance, pledge saliency, and majority support
   in parliament) do not have an impact.},

   as values voting) or of poor polities (such as patronage and ethnic
   appeals) fail to explain this important phenomenon. Instead, I outline a
   novel strategy predicated on an electoral division of labor enabling
   elite parties to recruit the poor while retaining the rich. Recruitment
   is outsourced to nonparty affiliates that provide basic services to
   appeal to poor communities. Such outsourcing permits the party to
   maintain programmatic linkages to its elite core. Empirically, I test
   this argument with qualitative and quantitative evidence, including a
   survey of more than 9,000 voters. Theoretically, I argue that this
   approach is best suited to elite parties with thick organizations,
   typically those linked to religious social movements.},

Abstract = {In recent years, we have witnessed renewed interest in metaphors in
   political theory. In this context, Hobbes's theory of metaphor is of
   great importance as it helps us understand aesthetic qualities in theory
   and politics. This article argues that in the work of Hobbes - often
   portrayed as hostile to the use of metaphor, especially so by himself
   there is a remarkable discrepancy between his professed enmity to
   metaphor and his own use of the very word `metaphor'. In a philosopher
   who censures conceptual imprecision, we find a fundamentally
   inconsistent and ever-changing use of this key term. This inconsistency
   can be accounted for if we relate it to Hobbes's own often neglected
   poetics and his theory of the need for conceptual innovation. This will
   help solve riddles that have haunted Hobbes studies. Moreover, we must
   discover Hobbes's theory of metaphor as a source of potential insights
   into the way in which political and theoretical languages operate with
   regard to aesthetic pleasure through linguistic change. Hobbes's theory
   can thus make us understand the importance of something being new, that
   is, how theoretical languages need novelty in order to be pleasant and
   persuasive.},

Abstract = {This article examines the experience of political, social and cultural
   rights for Malaysia's ethnic minorities. Using a survey method, our
   research finds that while Malaysia has made substantial economic
   progress, lack of attention to political, social and cultural rights for
   ethnic minorities in Malaysia has meant that ethnic minorities have
   become increasingly dissatisfied with their experience of citizenship.
   Experiences of institutional and social discrimination within Malaysia's
   ethnically differentiated model of citizenship are common. Such
   experiences can lead to low levels of confidence in Malaysia's national
   institutions and have the capacity to undermine the kind of political
   support that is necessary for good governance and national stability.},

   with reference to the 1990 and 2010 Osh riots as well as to the popular
   revolts of 2005 and 2010. In addition, the political and legal reforms
   of the post-Soviet period are evaluated. Structural reasons for the
   political instability, the recent transition to parliamentary system and
   the future of parliamentary democracy are discussed in the light of
   domestic and global dynamics and the socio-political history of the

Abstract = {This article argues that the existing literature focusing on the effects
   of the global economic crisis on, and the subsequent change in, British
   politics have thus far failed to adequately consider the role of
   extra-parliamentary political activity. The present article partly
   responds to this absence by presenting the results of event data
   analysis covering a period from December 1978 to December 2012. The key
   trends observed are a cycle of contention that occurred between the
   collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 and the end of 2011, in
   addition to a general rise in the numbers of extra-parliamentary events;
   a shift towards a new form of materialist politics; an initial rise in
   the confrontational nature of extra-parliamentary activity, followed by
   a move towards a more informational form; and the emergence of two new
   key actors within British extra-parliamentary politics anti-cuts
   campaigners and radical activists. Although these trends do not appear
   yet to be producing corresponding policy outcomes, the article suggests
   that we might be witnessing signs of cultural change resulting from the
   rise of extra-parliamentary British political activity.},

Abstract = {Political parties are the integral components of democratic systems.
   Without political parties, democratic systems cannot function. Yet, not
   all political parties embrace the existing `rules of the game'. After
   the experience with Nazi Germany and fascist Italy during the interwar
   period, dealing with anti-systemic parties has become a central debate
   in democratic systems. Even though party closures have taken place in
   some European democracies, the high frequency of party closures in
   Turkey raised criticisms that Turkey has become the `graveyard' of
   political parties. Since the 1960s, a total of 27 parties were banned in
   Turkey. The purpose of this article is to provide a comparative analysis
   of the justifications of party closures in Turkey. In doing so, the
   article examines two major political causes of party closures on two
   major party traditions in Turkey: (1) Political Islamists and violation
   of secularism (separation of religion and politics) and (2) Kurdish left
   and violation of territorial integrity/national unity.},

Abstract = {The 2011 Scottish Conservative leadership election presented the party
   with two radically different visions for the future. The Scottish
   Conservatives rejected Murdo Fraser's plan to create a new independent
   Scottish Party of the centre right and elected Ruth Davidson, who
   promised to reform the party within the UK Conservative Party. The
   Conservatives' rejection of a radical break with the past suggests they
   will continue along a path of incremental change and supports an
   institutionalist analysis of party adaptation to devolution. This
   article explores why Davidson won and examines some of the implications
   for the Scottish and UK Conservative parties. The centre-periphery
   tension played out during the campaign is a dilemma for all territorial
   branches of statewide parties but poses especially difficult problems
   for the Conservatives because of the tension between unionist and
   centre-right agendas.},

Abstract = {The principles of humanitarian assistance dictate that aid be
   distributed in accordance with need while remaining neutral with respect
   to the political stakes. However, these principles have unique
   implications in the postconflict context, where need is often correlated
   with opponents' performance in the previous contest. In these cases,
   humanitarian assistance is likely to be biased towards the conflict
   loser. Using a crisis-bargaining framework, this article describes a
   simple logic for how humanitarian aid can inadvertently undermine peace
   by creating a revisionist party with the incentive to renegotiate the
   postwar settlement. The empirical expectations of the theory are tested
   using a panel dataset of cross-national humanitarian aid expenditures in
   civil conflicts since the end of the Cold War. As the theory predicts,
   postconflict states treated with higher levels of humanitarian
   assistance exhibit shorter spells of peace; however, this effect only
   occurs after conflicts that ended with a decisive victory.},

Abstract = {State fiscal policy frequently focuses on stimulating a healthy business
   environment with the assumption that this is linked with long-term
   economic growth. The conventional wisdom is that a state's tax rates are
   negatively correlated with economic development, prompting states to
   decrease business-targeted taxes to stimulate the economy. Surprisingly,
   however, very few studies have documented the long-term effects of these
   tax policies on different facets of the state economy and overall
   business atmosphere. In short, we do not know how the level of business
   taxation actually affects the economies of states. Using panel data for
   all 50 U.S. states from 1977 to 2005, this article examines the impact
   of state business taxes on the overall economic position of the state,
   specifically looking at their effect on economic development and
   business growth. With an elaborate set of controls, the article finds
   that state business tax cuts have little to no positive impact on gross
   state product, job creation, personal income, poverty rates, and
   business establishments.},

Abstract = {Political science departments often require a senior-capstone course as
   part of the major. The Wahlke Report (1991) recommended including such a
   course more than 20 years ago, and the Association of American Colleges
   and Universities considers it a high-impact practice. Colleges and
   universities are also advocating broad efforts of civic engagement-an
   approach to academic work for which political science majors are
   uniquely qualified. This article describes the successes and failures of
   partnering a senior-capstone course with seven public agencies in a
   small city. By developing a multistage process for interacting with
   agencies, city officials, and the public, this ``State of the
   Community{''} project provides students with a real-world opportunity to
   serve as political consultants. By emphasizing the importance of
   timeliness, teamwork, presentation skills, and professionalism, this
   project can be a turning point for political science students who must
   soon transition from students in the undergraduate world to citizens in
   the community.},

Abstract = {Numerous historical or truth commissions have been set up in the last
   few decades. They have generally contributed to laying the foundations
   of a new coexistence in context of conflicts. In this regard the
   recognition of the past events is playing a crucial role, and has often
   opened up the path to the development of new societal relationships.
   This article addresses the normative bases of formally constituted
   historical commissions, briefly analyzing several experiences of such
   commissions. Finally, the article evaluates whether such a mechanism
   could be relevant within the normalization process of Armenian-Turkish
   relations, and its possible benefits for the future of the region.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Abstract = {Why do policies often seem to converge across countries at the same
   time? This question has been studied extensively in the diffusion
   literature. However, past research has not examined complex choice
   environments, especially where there are many alternatives. This article
   fills this gap in the literature. I show how Fine and Gray's Competing
   Risks Event History Analysis can be used to tease apart the causes of
   policy convergence. I apply the method to an examination of the reasons
   why, from the mid-1990s to 2007, many countries created independent
   deposit insurers. I find an interaction between international
   recommendations and regional peers' choices, particularly in the
   European Union. However, convergence appears to slow under the
   particular conditions of a banking crisis, regardless of how well
   independence is promoted. Possibly due to electoral incentives,
   democracies seem to have been more likely to create independent
   insurers. Ultimately, I demonstrate how competing risks analysis can
   help enable future research on policy choices, complementing methods
   previously applied in political economy.},

Abstract = {The civil war in Syria continues to devastate social and political
   structures, precipitating floods of refugees and surging populations of
   internally displaced people. Syria has degenerated into sectarian- and
   ethnic-based warring mini-states vying for power as their country faces
   utter social disorder. It mass-produces a growing cadre of battle
   hardened foreign and domestic jihadists affiliated with the various
   al-Qaeda brands. The war weariness of America and the unmanageable chaos
   in Syria combine to create shifts in regional politics. This article
   seeks to put into perspective the crucial role that regional mediation
   can play in nudging along practical solutions. Without regional
   commitment and coordination among key Middle Eastern powers, namely
   Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, international diplomatic efforts to
   restore order and stability in Syria are not likely to succeed.},

Abstract = {Although the 2004 Constitution of Afghanistan establishes a highly
   centralized political system, this article suggests Afghanistan is an
   informal federation in which customary organizations comprise a
   legitimate level of government capable of providing many public goods
   and services at the village level. Despite the absence of formal village
   government, governance in practice involves extensive power sharing
   between district government officials and customary representatives
   appointed by villagers themselves. The effectiveness of such
   self-governing customary arrangements is anticipated by the work of
   Elinor Ostrom, while the finding that day-to-day relations between
   levels of government are based in local norms rather than parchment
   institutions of the state demonstrate the continued insight of Vincent
   Ostrom into intergovernmental relations.},

Abstract = {Sixty years ago, in late 1953, Quebec launched the hearings of the Royal
   Commission on Constitutional Problems-or Tremblay commission. Commenting
   the publication of its report, political scientist Alexander Brady
   boldly argued in this journal that Quebec had been, until the late
   1950s, the ``guarantor{''} of Canada's fiscal system's flexibility
   (1959: 270). Emphasizing the system's evolution since the 1950s
   ``constitutional problems,{''} some specialists now contend, as the
   economist Robin Boadway does, that Canada became the ``textbook
   best-practice of fiscal federalism{''} (2007: 99). The Tremblay
   commission's sixtieth anniversary and the termination, in 2014, of the
   current agreement on federal transfers, provide an opportunity to
   reassess this evolution and question the validity of this kind of
   statement.},

Abstract = {Sensitive to the differences between centers and peripheries of
   knowledge production, this article explores how scholars in peripheral
   fields use knowledge from central fields to structure their academic
   careers. The article presents the findings of a case study of career
   choices of political scientists in Argentina. In order to understand the
   interplay between foreign knowledge and local strategies of enacting
   networks, this article focuses on the beginning of academic careers. At
   this early stage, political scientists in Argentina usually have to make
   a decision whether to stay in the country or go abroad for postgraduate
   education. Relying on positioning theory and recent developments in
   Science and Technology Studies, we identified two alternative
   positioning strategies. Those who stay in Argentina tend to hoard as
   many scholarly positions as possible, enacting local networks oriented
   towards teaching. Scholars who go abroad enact networks with
   international dimensions, in the process enrolling persons and objects,
   though not always successfully. Scholars with international experience
   tend to be research oriented, and they mention the working conditions
   abroad as particularly attractive. We show the extent to which these
   findings challenge some views of centers and periphery and highlight the
   active role of scholars in peripheral scientific fields.},

Abstract = {My initial studies in comparative literature trained me to focus on
   words that are metaphors that symbolize a larger meaning; social science
   concepts should have the same purpose. My study of architectural history
   taught me that technical terms can have a precise meaning distinguishing
   Gothic from Renaissance buildings. Exposure to positivism at Oxford put
   me on guard against jargon words that have no specifiable denotation.
   Exposure to Wittgenstein made me appreciate both the strengths and traps
   of words heavy with connotations. In reaction against the brute
   empiricism of Oxford politics discourse, I searched for ideas in lodes
   of American political science. Once the great mass of dross was
   discarded, there remained enough conceptual gold to produce an
   un-English book on politics in England that remains in print a half
   century on.},

Title = {Multilevel `venue shopping': The case of EU's Renewables Directive},
Journal = {INTEREST GROUPS \& ADVOCACY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {30-58},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Lobbying has traditionally been an enterprise of national interest
   organizations, which chiefly seek to influence national actors,
   especially governments. However, studies find that national interest
   organizations increasingly also target the European Union (EU). As the
   EU agenda has increased in depth and scope, interest organizations at
   national and EU political levels might be expected to align in
   coalitions in order to influence EU legislation. Such strategies
   potentially increase interest organizations' political leverage
   significantly; despite that, lobbying coalitions consisting of
   organizations aligned to different political levels have been scantily
   studied in the literature on EU lobbying. Therefore, the first aim of
   the article is to illustrate a case where coalition lobbying is highly
   likely: the lobbying strategies employed by the interest organizations
   of Germany's energy industries in the process leading up to the EU's
   Renewable Energy Directive. These industries are represented by several
   organizations at both the national and the European level. The second
   aim of the article is an investigation into how the Renewables Directive
   came about, as the outcome has profound impact on power production and
   consumption, and future prospects for EUs mitigation of greenhouse
   gases. Large controversy was connected to the legal proscriptions of
   support mechanisms for enhancing renewable energy production in
   particular. Two of the organizations that would be the most severely
   affected by the Renewables Directive were the European utilities
   industry and renewables industry, together constituting all power
   producers and their affiliates in Europe. The utilities and renewables
   industries disagreed deeply on core issues, such as legislation on
   support mechanisms for expanding production of renewable energy in the
   EU. The utilities industry favored an EU-wide green certificate scheme,
   whereas the renewables industry pressed for national choice of support
   mechanisms. Because the stakes were high, both had large incentives to
   invest substantial resources into lobbying on this legislation. The
   third aim of the article is to discuss what such multilevel lobbying
   reveals about perceptions of where real decision-making power is located
   in the EU. Energy policy is traditionally a strong national domain,
   which makes the governance theory of liberal intergovernmentalism (LI)
   relevant to use. However, as the EU is increasingly expanding its
   legislation on energy issues, the multilevel governance theory (MLG)
   also might describe how interest organizations perceive power to be
   located when EU legislation is formulated. The results indicate that
   despite all lobbying that organizations targeted toward the German
   government, which played a key role in the negotiations, the
   observations of the lobbying behavior is still better described by MLG
   than LI; the limited leverage of LI is illustrated by three points.
   First, all the German interest organizations lobbied institutions at
   both the national and at the EU levels. Second, national and European
   interest organizations participated in informal multilevel political
   coalitions consisting of a broad church of actors, as regards the
   renewables industry in particular. By coordinating political positions,
   pooling resources and developing common strategies, the interest
   organizations probably increased their leverage substantially, not the
   least because these coalitions also were backed by governments in key
   member states and members of the European Parliament.
   Third, all the EU-level interest organizations lobbied both the core EU
   institutions and central national governments. Summing up, these
   findings suggest that multilevel strategies should be considered for
   inclusion in analyses of national and European-level interest
   organizations' lobbying of EU legislation. The interest organizations
   themselves seem to see power as distributed across multiple levels of
   governance, and lobby accordingly. In order to grasp momentum of the
   lobbying process, it is moreover often probably relevant to assess
   coordination of strategies between interest organizations at different
   levels in complex multilevel advocacy coalitions. By demonstrating that
   all organizations covered, regardless of sizes and resources, lobbied at
   multiple governance levels, this study also nuances the picture of which
   actors participate in EU policymaking. When legislation on crucial
   issues is created, small national interest organizations might also
   target EU institutions. Finally, at least one national interest
   organization cooperated with private companies to share tasks and
   enhance lobbying strength. Such cooperation between an interest
   organization and its private members is a relevant topic of research in
   future studies on interest organizations.},

Abstract = {Based on a within-case comparative analysis of Turkish democratization
   since the 1920s and data on elite values, this article develops a
   general theoretical framework to better explain the moderation of
   religious and secular politics and democratization. First, it is
   maintained that the content of moderation and its effects on democracy
   will vary across countries depending on its domestic and international
   context - called a country's ``centre{''} - and political rivals'
   reactions. Second, moderation can further democratization only insofar
   as it happens with a democratic centre. Third, absent a democratic
   centre, moderation may involve adoption, retention and reproduction of
   the centre's undemocratic attributes. In such cases, the challenge of
   democratization is not moderation per se but the construction of a new,
   democratic centre by transcending the existing centre. Fourth,
   moderation is interactive between religious and secular actors,
   multidimensional and reversible. Turkish democratization began with the
   moderation of authoritarian-secular actors, but generated only a
   semi-democracy because the changes were not institutionalized through
   explicit and formal compromises to produce a fully democratic centre.
   Turkish political Islamism moderated during the 1990s. But, despite
   major achievements, democratization remained ambiguous under the rule of
   moderate Islamists because they compromised and associated themselves
   with the semi-democratic centre, and secular-religious cooperation
   failed while some secular actors de-moderated.},

Abstract = {Intensifying processes of globalization have led to a series of tensions
   around the way in which even the most cosmopolitan democracies now treat
   people who move across their borders. Non-citizens have become problems.
   The postcolonial settler nation-states - Australia, Canada, the USA and
   others - were `founded' by immigrants and refugees who moved globally to
   become citizens in these `new lands'. Such countries were made by
   migrants displacing indigenous others. However, in a conflict-ridden
   world in which the displacement of persons has become endemic - and in a
   media-connected world where the possibility of finding a better place to
   live has become increasingly imaginable and desired - these countries
   are now attempting to manage that global flow of people by stringent
   homeland security measures that are becoming increasingly problematic.
   While they are constituted through the modern imaginary of liberal
   democratic norms, human rights and rule of law, in each country over the
   last few years, rules have been bent, breached or bolstered in order to
   keep people out. The essay argues that given the globalization of people
   movement, the nation-state has reached the limits of responding though
   unilateral or even regional multilateral arrangements.},

Abstract = {Scholars have debated whether citizenship regimes in Western democracies
   are tracking a liberal universalistic path or continue to follow
   distinctive national traditions. This essay argues that the Australian
   case does both through a distinctive liberal nationalist architecture.
   Increasingly since the 1970s, Australian citizenship acquisition and
   status have largely followed a civic nationalist or liberal universalist
   formulation. However, this has been executed within a broader liberal
   nationalist approach to national identity and culture that accommodates
   these aspects of national life. The essay discusses the idea of liberal
   nationalism as a political architecture of differentiated domains,
   Australia's construction of this architecture, and how Australia's two
   recent citizenship tests illustrate this framework in action. It
   concludes with some thoughts on the symbolic significance of citizenship
   tests for liberal legitimacy and the future of the liberal nationalist
   project.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Numerous developing countries have substantially increased their number
   of subnational administrative units in recent years. The literature on
   this phenomenon is, nonetheless, small and suffers from several
   theoretical and methodological shortcomings: in particular, a unit of
   analysis problem that causes past studies to mistakenly de-emphasize the
   importance of local actors. We posit that administrative unit
   proliferation occurs where and when there is a confluence of interests
   between the national executive and local citizens and elites from areas
   that are politically, economically, and ethnically marginalized. We
   argue further that although the proliferation of administrative units
   often accompanies or follows far-reaching decentralization reforms, it
   likely results in a recentralization of power; the proliferation of new
   local governments fragments existing units into smaller ones with lower
   relative intergovernmental bargaining power and administrative capacity.
   We find support for these arguments using original data from Uganda.},

Abstract = {Our article focuses on a question that is at the core of comparative
   capitalisms (CC) scholarship and historical materialist state theory:
   What is an appropriate theory of institutions in capitalism? How can we
   conceptualise institutions in relation to the fundamental contradictions
   and power relations of capitalism? Starting from the social foundations
   of institutions, the aim of this article is to show how institutional
   complementarity and institutional change can be explained through
   analysing shifting relationships of social forces. With our newly
   developed method of a `historical materialist policy analysis', in which
   we have integrated insights of CC approaches, we seek to show how an
   empirical investigation of relationships of forces can be
   operationalised. This is briefly illustrated in an analysis of the
   constellation of forces in the current Euro crisis.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to elaborate a framework for the study of diversity
   in forms of labour using Trotsky's theory of uneven and combined
   development (UCD). It argues that labour markets are constituted by
   systemic processes of capital accumulation and uneven development in the
   global economy, but that these processes have highly differentiated
   outcomes in terms of the forms of labour that have historically emerged
   within and across national boundaries. Exploring some of the neglected
   elements of different forms of labour, including non-waged labour, the
   article demonstrates how we might conceptualise the way in which
   combinations of labour forms exist within any given space of the world
   economy. Using the examples of both internal and transnational
   migration, it argues that charting the social and spatial relations of
   production, and the labouring experiences and forms of worker politics
   associated with them, is an effective way of understanding the
   constitution and restructuring of different forms of labour.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {In many European party systems, the radical right has challenged
   established patterns of political competition. This article studies the
   consequences of this by using the case of the Freedom Party of Austria
   (FPo) and data from Austria's first national election study (AUTNES). It
   is found that the FPo has weakened Austria's previously highly stable
   system of socio-structural and ideological divisions as expressed by the
   two mainstream parties, the People's Party and the Social Democrats. In
   socio-structural terms, the FPo has undermined the Social Democrats'
   support base. In ideological terms, FPo voters have distinct views on
   newer issues such as immigration, European integration and
   dissatisfaction with the political system, but its supporters' views on
   Austria's traditional conflicts surrounding the economy and social and
   religious values cannot explain the party's success. These findings
   further our understanding of the transformation of political conflicts
   not just in Austria, but in Western Europe in general.},

Abstract = {Calls for increased regulation are sometimes made in response to what is
   dubbed an arms race' in elections - a cost explosion in electoral
   expenditure driven by the competitive dynamics of elections. In 2010,
   New South Wales (NSW) adopted the first comprehensive caps on electoral
   expenditure in Australia on this basis. This paper examines the evidence
   for a cost explosion over the course of three NSW elections (1999-2007).
   It finds a significant but unevenly distributed increase in electoral
   expenditure - over 3 per cent per annum over and above inflation and the
   growth in voter population. In terms of explaining this spending
   increase, it finds a close relationship between electoral expenditure
   and the availability of campaign funds but a less clear one between such
   expenditure and the winnability' of the
   elections.???????????????????????????????????2010?,????????????????????,

Abstract = {Without disregarding them, this volume seeks to go beyond the
   controversial and extensively researched Economic Partnership Agreements
   to offer new perspectives on the evolution of the trade-development
   nexus in the European Union against dramatic changes in the
   international context. In particular, it focuses on the reform of the
   Generalised System of Preferences, the negotiation of various
   Preferential Trade Agreements, the application of trade sanctions, the
   allegedly ambitious agendas on decent work, Aid for Trade and aid
   untying, and the implications of the changing balance of power in global
   economic relations. Taking diverse approaches and, at times, reaching
   different conclusions, contributors directly or indirectly address one
   or more of the three general themes that are discussed in this
   introduction: differentiation, coherence, and norms.},

   evidence},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1},
Pages = {68-83},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {There is a vigorous international debate about lowering the voting age
   to 16, with some jurisdictions already moving in this direction. The
   issue of the voting age also intersects with broader normative and
   empirical approaches to youth political engagement. Using evidence from
   Australia, this article evaluates empirically the arguments put forward
   for lowering the voting age. The findings suggest only partial support
   for lowering the voting age to bring it into line with other
   government-regulated activities. There is no evidence that lowering the
   voting age would increase political participation or that young people
   are more politically mature today than they were in the past. The
   absence of empirical support for the arguments in favour of lowering of
   the voting age has implications for how to transform democracy in order
   to attract greater youth
   engagement.?????????16?,????????????????????????????????????????????????

Title = {The Place of the State in a Differentiated Society: Historical and
   Systematic Perspectives},
Journal = {POLITIKON},

Abstract = {What used to be called primitive societies may best be designated as
   traditional societies or as undifferentiated societies. While focusing
   on the place of the state within a differentiated society, it is
   meaningful to account for the differences between differentiated
   societies and undifferentiated societies, because such an analysis will
   help us to advance important systematic distinctions. Usually, the
   extended family (Grossfamilie) is seen as the smallest undifferentiated
   society with a typical undifferentiated form of organization. Even the
   lowest level of undifferentiated societies contains an ordering and
   relations of super- and subordination. Paying attention to the sib or
   clan is followed by a characterization of the tribe and Roman law.
   Diverse undifferentiated societies of the medieval era are found in the
   feudal system, guilds, and manors. All of these societies included
   activities which within a differentiated society are performed by
   societal entities with their own distinct forms of organization.
   Therefore, the state was not yet visible as a distinct societal entity.
   In the absence of tribal punishment, only relatives would take revenge,
   owing to the fact that there was not yet an integrated monopoly of power
   on a limited territory capable of enforcing the resolution of legal
   conflicts. Within early Germanic as well as early Greek and Roman Law,
   the practical enforcement of liability therefore had to appeal to
   private execution. After the Renaissance, the idea of popular
   sovereignty surfaced, but it was only when church and state parted ways
   that we observe the process of development which led to what we
   currently experience as differentiated societies. In such societies, the
   limitations of undifferentiated societies are superseded through an
   acknowledgment of the fact that every human being transcends any and all
   societal collectivities in which such a person merely functions without
   being fully absorbed by these functions. Finally, attention is briefly
   given to the legal competence of a government and to the nature of
   cultural-historical power within the state (its `sword-power'). As a
   public legal institution, the state is supposed to integrate all (and
   only) legal interests on its territory within one public legal order.
   Just as little as societal entities which are distinct from the state
   are parts of the state, is it correct to sacrifice the state by
   surrendering it to any non-political community or collectivity. Only
   this perspective avoids a totalitarian view regarding the place of the
   state within a differentiated society.},

Abstract = {After the collapse of the Soviet Union Kazakhstan faced two options for
   further sovereign development: ``European{''} and ``traditional{''}. The
   strategic government plans were built on the European socio-economic
   basis, whereas the titular population, which is for the most part rural,
   inclined to the traditional version. As a result, the compromise was
   taken as a basis - modernization relied upon the national specificity.
   Carefully analyzing the results of such choice, A.Alekseenko shows that
   its most important consequence was not simply mass urbanization of
   autochtons, but also a transfer of traditional views of yesterday's
   rural residents to the urban environment. Democratic ``European{''}
   forms were gradually filled with the archaic content. At the same time,
   the urban space markedly deformed traditional values of the Kazakhs.
   According to the author's assessment, the intensive exploration of the
   urban space can lead to the loss of the foundations of the national
   culture, which immediately brings the issue of a possibility of
   coexistence of different civilization priorities in the socio-political
   space of the modern Kazakhstan to the forefront.},

Abstract = {Since the 2000s, the international community has increasingly recognised
   two basic aspects of development cooperation. First, international
   development cooperation faces a systemic crisis. Because of the way it
   is organised and implemented, it is part of the problem it wants to
   solve. As a response, there has been the attempt of a systemic reform,
   which in terms of ambition and recognition is unprecedented in the
   history of development cooperation. Second, the environment of
   development cooperation has considerably changed. This goes for both the
   development problematique to which development cooperation reacts and
   the global context in which it operates. This contribution to the edited
   volume discusses both processes and draws conclusions for development
   cooperation.},

Abstract = {We generalize two classes of statistical sequential incomplete
   information games: (1) those resembling typical signaling games, in
   which a single agent represents each player, allowing for information to
   be revealed about future play; and (2) those in which each player is
   represented by a set of independent agents, where moves do not reveal
   private information. The generalized model we develop, the Correlated
   Agent Model, relies on a parameter, , which denotes the correlation
   between two agents' private information, i.e. the extent to which a
   player knows the future private component of her preferences. The
   independent agent and single agent models are special cases, where =0
   and =1, respectively. The model also allows 0 < < 1, a class of games
   which have not yet been considered. We apply the model to crisis
   bargaining and demonstrate how to estimate , as well as parameters
   associated with utilities.},

Abstract = {During 2013 the President Correa strengthened his
   authoritarian-competitive model initiated at 2007. Regardless of
   infrastructure and public investment that any government with economic
   resources could also have done the Correa administration was
   characterized by the persecution of any person with opinions contrary to
   his performance in office. Given this political scenario, the last
   obstacle for Correa to consolidate his permanence in office after 2017
   was the constitutional reform that permits his reelection without limits
   -or at least for an additional period. If the political and economic
   conditions do not vary in the short run, Ecuador will have a government
   characterized by many public works and few liberties until 2021. Hence,
   the massive popular acceptance generated by Correa's
   authoritarian-competitive model should orient future research on
   Ecuador.},

Abstract = {Does rhetoric highlighting social norms or mentioning science in a

   willingness to take action? We draw from framing theory and
   collective-interest models of action to motivate hypotheses that are
   tested in two large web-based survey-experiments using convenience
   samples. Our results show that attitudes about global warming, support
   for policies that would reduce carbon emissions, and behavioral
   intentions to take voluntary action are strongly affected by norm- and
   science-based interventions. This has implications for information
   campaigns targeting voluntary efforts to promote lifestyle changes that
   would reduce greenhouse gas emissions.},

Abstract = {This article reviews the burgeoning literature on democratic
   authoritarianism, which examines two related but distinct questions: why
   authoritarian regimes adopt institutions conventionally associated with
   democracy, and how these institutions strengthen authoritarian regimes
   and forestall democratization. The literature suggests that
   authoritarian regimes adopt and utilize nominally democratic
   institutions to augment their strength through five main mechanisms:
   signaling, information acquisition, patronage distribution, monitoring,
   and credible commitment. After evaluating each of these mechanisms, I
   discuss the empirical challenges facing this research agenda and suggest
   how the field should proceed to overcome these challenges.},

   their hair and their skin tone influences their experiences as state
   legislators. In sum, this essay contends that Black women's appearances

   self-confidence, internal fortitude, and building their character, which
   they attribute to assisting them with dealing with adversities. In turn,
   these experiences impact their practices as state legislators.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {It is hypothesized in the fields of political education and citizenship
   studies that a discrepancy exists between the rhetoric of political
   education as expressed in official policy documents, guidelines, and
   curricula, on the one hand, and the reality of what happens in the
   classroom, on the other. This study tests this hypothesis in relation to
   the five new states created in 1990 in the eastern part of Germany on
   the territory of the former German Democratic Republic. Following German
   reunification, reform of political education in eastern German schools
   was considered necessary in this region and legislative changes
   introduced relating to the aims, content, teaching methodologies, and
   assessment criteria associated with this subject. This study
   investigates the extent to which these changes were actually implemented
   in the classroom. In addition, some conclusions are drawn regarding the
   management of change in political education in times of transition from
   dictatorship to democracy.},

Abstract = {How do rebel groups determine their targets during intrastate conflict?
   We build upon two competing theories in conflict studies that emphasize
   either the social or economic determinants of violence during war and
   use geographic information systems (GIS) analysis to explore these
   competing theories. To do this, we utilize a subnational analysis of the
   most likely case of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to understand
   whether ethnicity or natural resources motivates the location of
   conflict events. Accounting for geography, we find that economic
   endowments in the form of natural resources are highly related with the
   number of violent attacks, while the presence of competing ethnic groups
   does not offer much help in understanding the location of conflict
   events.},

Abstract = {Can democracy consolidate in electoral systems without power
   alternations? Using public attitude data collected by the Afrobarometer
   in 16 sub-Saharan African countries (2005-2006), as well as
   country-level variables, this study examines how alternations in power
   that result from electoral contests affect mass perceptions of
   democratic durability. By examining durability, we shift the focus from
   individuals' own preferences and attitudes regarding democracy to their
   perceptions about the degree of societal commitment to a democratic
   regime. Multilevel analysis finds that a lack of alternation among power
   holders undermines popular confidence that democracy, weak as it may be,
   will endure. Moreover, the gap in perceptions of democratic durability
   between the political majority and the minority narrows considerably in
   systems where one or more alternations have occurred.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the evolution of the institutional setting that
   the Spanish multi-level system provides for regional European Union (EU)
   adaptation, and the effects that recent developments of the EU (the
   Eastern enlargement, the Treaty reform process and the Euro-zone crisis)
   have had on the more or less pro-European positions and adaptive
   strategies of Spanish regions and on inter-governmental arrangements. It
   thus describes the increasing institutionalization of regional
   participation and EU policy coordination, both at the domestic and
   supra-national level, and the evolution of regional strategies, looking
   at its effects both on the degree of vertical and horizontal
   coordination, and the actual relative power and discretion of both
   levels of government. It argues that regional strategies have
   increasingly become more defensive and less pro-European and that
   increasing participation in European matters seemed to have favoured
   multi-lateralism and increased coordination without having produced
   further centralization until the recent crisis and associated budget
   consolidation targets induced new coordination requirements and a
   centralization of power towards the central government and EU
   authorities. This has, as a side-effect, reinforced some centrifugal
   tendencies of the system and therefore may affect the operation of IGR.},

   administrations in our country happens for strengthening the
   performance, policy evaluation and accountability. The reforms must not
   be a mere exercise in balance or budgetary adjustment but must lay the
   foundations of a new sustainable, efficient, effective and open
   government that redesign a new model of society. Strategic reforms must
   to renew and enhance the public value and role of the government from a
   thorough change in his mission, and management and administrative
   structures that may lead, in turn, a change in the way we do politics.},

Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {145-155},
Abstract = {The work of Russell Dalton has played a seminal role in the study of the
   relation between political sophistication and partisan dealignment. It
   has to be acknowledged furthermore that there is a consensus on the
   occurrence of a decline of partisanship in Germany. Using panel data as
   well as pooled cross-sectional observations, however, it is clear that
   generational replacement is not the sole driving force of partisan
   dealignment, but that period effects should also be taken into account.
   While on an aggregate level rising levels of political sophistication
   have occurred simultaneously with decreasing partisanship,
   individual-level analysis suggests clearly that the least sophisticated
   are most likely to feel alienated from the party system. The article
   closes with some very specific suggestions on how to address the
   democratic consequences of declining levels of partisanship.},

Abstract = {Some recent events raise new questions concerning the evolution of
   global terrorism, especially the Boston Marathon's bombing (15th April,
   2013) and the Woolwich killing (22nd May, 2013). Differently from Al
   Qaeda traditional strategy of random attacks causing mass murders, these
   two episodes seem to belong to so called ``lone wolves{''} category. The
   aim of this paper is to explore whether this definition really fits to
   the brutal episodes. The author takes a critical look at recent attempts
   to reduce both the events to the responsibility of loners: The author

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Legal mobilization has spread in China over the past 20 years and is
   generally considered by both activists and scholars as a way to advance
   democracy and rule of law. Focusing on the mobilization in favour of
   migrant workers and on politically moderate practices, which are both
   more frequent and widely held as more successful, I argue to the
   contrary that resistance and reproduction of political domination are
   mutually constitutive. Public interest litigation and administrative
   litigation appear as new forms of political participation that
   constitute an internal regulation to the authoritarian regime, thus
   contributing to explain the regime's capacity to adapt and its
   durability. This article also accounts for new strategies developed by
   some lawyers that shun the courts and use law to `empower civil society'
   and that thus do not contribute to structural reproduction. Though
   activists are struggling to turn their strategies into more
   institutionalized practices, they remain an ad hoc mechanism of internal
   control.},

Abstract = {This paper studies, for the Colombian case, the relationship between
   illicit crops, coca crops eradication strategies and citizens'
   perceptions of trust on the local executive and the police. Using survey
   data from the America's Barometer and contextual level data on coca
   crops and eradication strategies it was possible to conclude: a higher
   local incidence of illicit drugs trafficking has a negative relationship
   with citizens' perceptions of trust on the local governments. These
   relationships are not homogeneous as they are conditioned by individual
   level variables such as evaluations of the economy and the provision of
   public goods.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},

Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {223-238},
Abstract = {The article argues that we need to analyse the way protest is being
   channelled in illiberal regimes, in order to understand how they manage
   to prevent the emergence of political challengers to authoritarian rule.
   Drawing on the Cuban case, the text shows that such channelling allows
   the intentional as well as unintentional disconnection between social
   and cultural claims on the one hand and political claims on the other
   hand, which in turn isolates political dissidents from other types of
   dissenters (for instance in the cultural sphere), thus preventing a more
   unified contentious movement from emerging.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},

Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {127-147},
Abstract = {This article deals with the importance of collective power and value
   consensus among elites for medieval polity formation by analyzing
   electoral monarchies. State formation theory focuses on the monopoly of
   legitimate armed force and has pushed notions of consensus and
   collective power into the background. This article questions material
   and coercive theories of state formation and emphasizes polity formation
   through theories of power as collaboration and as the ability to act in
   concert. Royal elections had two major functions: (1) A transfer of
   authority that created trust and concord among elite groups and (2)
   constructing ideas of an abstract `realm' that political actors
   represented and to which they were accountable in an ideational and
   symbolic sense. The article focuses on the Holy Roman Empire and Sweden.},

Title = {Spanish Sociology and Anti-Semitism Between passed prejudice and key to
   civilization},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {817-839},
Abstract = {There is a significant lack of sociological research in Spain about
   anti-Semitism. At the same time there are alarming anti-Semitic
   tendencies and anti-Jewish stereotypes which are above the European
   average.
   This article aims to explain this lack of sociological research about
   anti-Semitism in Spain. Therefore two types of explications are offered:
   on the one hand side some structural problems will be shown which
   sociology in general had since its beginnings and which complicate the
   understanding of anti-Semitism. Furthermore explications regarding the
   specific social and historic situation in Spain and of Spanish sociology
   in particular will be exposed.
   It will be shown that for its rationalistic character and with the
   exception of very few authors -who are considered marginalized for
   practical research-sociology in general has had enormous problems in
   understanding anti-Semitism. The specific historic situation, Francoism,
   the dispute about the historic memory and the delayed
   institutionalisation of sociology could also explain the lack of
   sociological interest in the topic especially in Spain.
   The article shows that the study of anti-Semitism is not only relevant
   for struggling against this burden of society in many of its variants.
   Furthermore, thinking about anti-Semitism can help sociology to
   recognise its own epistemological problems. It can serve to criticise
   and improve instruments of sociological research by showing the
   limitations of the sociological approach and to uncover the importance
   of interdisciplinary research for understanding specific social
   phenomena. In that sense, anti-Semitism, far from being a marginal
   subject, can be considered a key topic in the process of civilisation
   and it can help us to decipher the contemporary Spanish society.},

Abstract = {On the basis of the comparative analysis of the protests that swept
   countries of the North Africa and the Middle East in 2011 and Ukraine in
   2013-2014, the authors conclude that these protest movements are fully
   consistent with the phenomenon referred to in the Arab political culture
   as ``fitna{''} (strife, rebellion). Having fixed a whole array of
   parameters (heterogeneity of social composition and political attitudes
   of protest participants, ambiguity of their demands, unresponsiveness to
   rational arguments etc.) that make unrest in the Arab world and in
   Ukraine similar to the traditional ``fitna{''}, L.Isaev and A.Shishkina
   also draw attention to the specific features of the modern ``fitna{''}
   associated with the development of internet technologies. According to
   their conclusion, the emergence of fundamentally new means of mass
   communication alters the format of political activity in the world to
   such an extent that authorities are often unable to adequately assess a
   threat posed by protesters and thus, commit fatal errors.},

Abstract = {A large literature in American politics argues that the procedural rules
   in Congress allow the majority party to block bills that are opposed by
   the majority of its members yet supported by the majority of the
   chamber. However, majority-party agenda-setting influence is rarely
   absolute. In this article, I use new data on the rules in the U.S. state
   legislative chambers to show that majoritarian rules (i.e., procedures
   that allow the chamber majority to circumvent majority-party
   gatekeeping) are not only common but also consequential for policy. That
   is, the presence of majoritarian rules significantly reduces the
   majority party's advantage in obtaining its preferred legislative
   outcomes, particularly as the preferences of the floor and
   majority-party medians diverge. These results demonstrate that the
   distribution of power in a legislature is a function of its full
   configuration of agenda-setting rules and thus provide an important
   qualification to theories of legislation organization.},

Abstract = {The number of first-time and new translations from Russian for the
   German book market declined slightly in 2013. Nonetheless, the balance
   is positive. Finds from the literature of the 19th century (Odoevskii,
   Goncharov) caused a stir. New translations of Bulgakov, Dobychin,
   Tarkovsky, and Akhmadulina, but also first-time translations of works by
   Maksim Amelin will stimulate discussion about innovative translation
   techniques. There were new editions of long-forgotten books by Jewish
   writers such as Zhabotinskii and Margolin, gripping memoirs on childhood
   and youth by Kochergin and Kisina, daring experiments in language from
   cult writers such as Pelevin and Erofeev.},

Abstract = {This compliance study models correct and timely implementation of
   policies in a multilevel system as a strategic game between a central
   monitoring agency and multiple implementers and evaluates statistically
   the empirical implications of this model. We test whether compliance is
   determined by the anticipated enforcement decision of the monitoring
   agency and whether this agency is responsive to the probability of
   enforcement success and the potential sanctioning costs produced by
   noncomplying implementers. Compared to other monitoring systems, the
   centralized monitoring system of the European Union (EU) is praised for
   exemplary effectiveness, but our findings reveal that the monitoring
   agency refrains from enforcing compliance when the probability of
   success is low, and the sanctioning costs are high. This results in a
   compliance deficit, even though the selective enforcement activities of
   the monitoring agency are almost always successful before court.},

Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},
Pages = {24-51},
Abstract = {This article explores different empirical sites where public debt
   techniques of quantification operate: entries in the accounts, scenarios
   of budgetary sustainability, and sovereign ratings. Embedded in the
   political game, these indicators have the potential to destabilize
   government policies, but also to perform sovereign debt crises. More
   than a passive mirror of reality, public debt measurement techniques
   shape the state's value, that is, its price but also what it is worth on
   the accounting, financial and economic level. They also prioritize the
   state's political objectives, for example sanctifying creditors'
   repayment at real value, and contribute to setting the agenda around an
   alarming diagnosis of the ``crisis{''} of public and social accounts.},

   with what resistance?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {107-126},
Abstract = {This article links Foucaultian power forms with its corresponding
   resistance. If resistance is a reaction to power, then the
   characteristics of the power strategy/relation affect the kinds of
   resistance that subsequently prevail. Accordingly, it becomes
   interesting to discuss what kinds of resistance emanate from what kinds
   of power. We discuss this relationship between power and resistance by
   drawing on Foucault's `triangle': (I) sovereign power; (II) disciplinary
   power; and (III) biopower. Thus, deviating from Foucaultian studies'
   preoccupation with `power', we utilise Foucault in order to focus on
   `resistance'. And by connecting to empirical examples from within the
   emerging field of resistance studies we argue that the peculiarities of
   power decide how resistance can be conducted.},

Abstract = {Although participative measures were introduced in 2001 to support
   dialogue on large carnivore presence and the aims and justifications of
   national predator policy, polarization has remained between pro-wolf
   groups promoting fauna diversity and the groups maintaining that rural
   Sweden is jeopardized by the reappearance of large carnivores. Through
   empirically investigating the participatory process itself, we address
   how the local environment of RPG members is situated in the deliberative
   setting of the groups. By taking account of the local community context,
   we emphasize that divergent perceptions of the local environment,
   together with the landscape as a context of relationships between those
   using its resources, form an informed basis for action. In sum, we
   examine how participatory voices can be supported and maintained given
   the existence of a contingent social situation in which particular
   interests, values, and norm systems meet.},

Abstract = {We propose that the European Union (EU) should be used in citizenship
   education as a possible vehicle for citizens' influence on issues
   outside the reach of the nation-state. Citizenship education thus ought
   to include the EU as an arena for political action and relevant ``EU
   knowledge'' ought to be part of the curriculum. Concepts from the German
   politische Bildung tradition are used to discuss what should be the
   content of an education aiming at educating young people to (become)
   democratic citizens and the level of competence required in order to
   function as a democratic citizen. The ``reflecting spectator'' is given
   special attention. Environmental issues are chosen, for three reasons,
   to show how EU education can be part of citizenship education: the
   transborder character of environmental problems, the multilevel
   responsibilities connected to them, and the fact that virtually all
   European environmental policy is made in, or in close association with,
   the EU.},

   strategies of visually reconstructing the past are at stake. While the
   so called ``practices of showing{''} are vital to examing the Austrian
   visual memory of the Nazi past, strategies of visually blotting out
   certain aspects of history are equally important. Using the example of a
   broschure edited by the OVP-FPO-government in 2005, this article aims at
   exploring which pictures are used in order to represent the 60th
   anniversary of the end of WWII, the 50th anniversary of the signing of
   the state treaty as well as the 20th anniversary of Austria joining the

Abstract = {In January 2014, the French tabloid Closerdid publish on the front page
   some pictures linked to a presumed love affair involving Francois
   Hollande and actress Julie Gayet. This article, based on the accounts of
   journalists and newspapers editors, aims to study the different moments
   of this small political crisis. How the scoop about Valerie
   Trierweiler's hospitalization was the main turning point of the media
   coverage. And how, from this moment, the presumed presidential adultery
   has been seen as a political event and not as a private one. At the end
   of the crisis, the presidential sexuality even became a legitimate topic
   of the political comments. Then the article examines on one hand some
   previous situations (for example the publication of rumors about
   Segolene Royal and Francois Hollande during the presidential campaign of
   2006-2007) and on the other hand the possible consequences of the
   politicization of the political leaders sexuality.},

Abstract = {Although still more common in medical studies and some other areas of
   social science such as psychology and behavioral economics, experimental
   work has become an increasingly important methodology in political
   science. Experimental work differs from other kinds of research because
   it systematically administers a specific treatment to part of a
   population while withholding that manipulation from the rest of a
   subject pool. The best studies strive to keep all other aspects of the
   experiment similar, so that any emergent difference between the
   treatment and control group that emerge provide unparalleled traction in
   determining causal inference. Many other valuable forms of social
   research use observation of the natural world, rather than depending on
   intervention to advance understanding. Because experimentalists can
   create the environment or process they want to study, this strategy of
   intervention and manipulation constitutes the main distinction between
   experimental work and other forms of social observation.},

Pages = {1282-1296},
Abstract = {The article argues that many of the issues that are causing trouble in
   the eurozone today had long been debated, but not solved, prior to the
   beginning of the so-called euro crisis. Three thematic examples are used
   to show this: the decade-long discussion surrounding economic
   convergence and the question of a transfer union; the dispute over the
   alleged use of financial mechanisms as a substitute for addressing
   structural economic weaknesses; and the development of European banking
   regulation and supervision before the creation of the single currency.
   Finally, the article argues that even though some of the features of
   today's crises - in particular the debt and deficit issues -were
   outlined at the time of the euro's introduction, some important recent
   developments such as the various new operations undertaken by the
   European Central Bank were not. This should command modesty and
   cautiousness in the analysis of the evolution of the euro crisis.},

Abstract = {Since the 1990s, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland have worked as NATO
   members or partners, participating in expeditionary operations and
   playing political leadership roles in the transatlantic security
   community. Today, however, the Nordic-Baltic security environment is
   changing rapidly, a trend only further accelerated by the Ukraine
   crisis. Magnus Nordenman argues that the emerging strategic environment
   will force the Nordic nations to focus on challenges closer to home, and
   that their current defence constructs will be challenged if they are not
   further refined and if co-operation is not extended.},

Abstract = {Russia has been trying to improve its image for years. To this end, its

   lacking. Despite partial successes, Moscow will not achieve much without
   political change and social modernization in Russia. A look at some of
   the players in state image policy in Germany shows this as well.},

Abstract = {Using as an empirical base the 2006-08 reform of the European Union
   Structural Funds financial execution, this paper explores control
   mechanisms of multi-level governance frameworks. The empirical evidence
   provides a representative case of initial metagovernance deficit and the
   subsequent, relatively successful, institutional response reinforcing
   metagovernance. The purpose is to clarify the conceptual dimensions of
   metagovernance, setting it in a categorical scheme that identifies forms
   of exercise of political power: government, governance and multi-level
   governance. Specifically, the paper argues for a conceptualization of
   metagovernance that highlights a sense of sovereignty by which
   governmental entities vested with legal legitimacy advance public
   interests.},

Pages = {147-176},
Abstract = {Contemporary sociology has recognized the important role of time in the
   analysis of the runaway world we live in. This growing interest is,
   however, ironic because the recognition of the sociological centrality
   of time goes with the denunciation of its disappearance or at least its
   radical disorganization and disfunctionality. As a consequence claimed
   time turns into missing time. This paper seeks to rebuild this
   paradoxical diagnosis in its three core variants: atemporality,
   presentism and spacelization. After analyzing its various sociological
   manifestations, these are subject to criticism and an alternative that
   does not fall into the detected errors is outlined.},

Abstract = {This article highlights the ways in which theoretical and empirical work
   on intersectionality, combined with relevant existing pedagogical
   literature, can inspire new ways to think about politics and for
   political science faculty to creatively enhance student learning. Much
   like in its research applications, an intersectionality-inspired
   pedagogy is shown to be appropriate not only in courses on the politics
   of race, ethnicity, gender, or sexuality but also in a wide range of
   political science courses. The article begins by providing a discussion
   of the treatment of identity, diversity, and inequality in political
   science pedagogy. Next, it provides an outline of the intersectional
   research paradigm. Four aspects of an intersectional political science
   pedagogy are then delineated: focusing on multiple identities,
   foregrounding of power and processes, transforming courses through
   inclusion, and employing a normative commitment to equality. The article
   closes with an examination of the barriers (and solutions) that might
   affect implementation of such a pedagogy in the discipline, informed by
   personal teaching experiences and the existing pedagogical literature.},

Abstract = {Chapter 4 provides an alternative narrative of Cyber Tory activity in
   that it shifts the spotlight from more elite figures in the party to
   those at the grassroots. The chapter is rooted in an analysis of the
   role of Facebook in the party's organizational culture from 2008 onward.
   It is argued that the culture of Facebook participation evolved
   naturally through a learning and copying behaviour. The chapter reveals
   the importance of leadership in this process and identifies specific
   individuals in the ranks of the younger cohorts of the party as
   significant influencers of change. The chapter argues that Cyber Tory
   Facebook participation was characterized by a technologically centred
   innovation culture that helped dissolve traditional geographical and
   hierarchical barriers to grassroots activity.},

Abstract = {Moral duties concerning climate change mitigation are - for good reasons
   - conventionally construed as duties of institutional agents, usually
   states. Yet, in both scholarly debate and political discourse, it has
   occasionally been argued that the moral duties lie not only with states
   and institutional agents, but also with individual citizens. This
   argument has been made with regard to mitigation efforts, especially
   those reducing greenhouse gases. This paper focuses on the question of
   whether individuals in industrialized countries have duties to reduce
   their individual carbon footprint. To this end it will examine three
   kinds of arguments that have been brought forward against individuals
   having such duties: the view that individual emissions cause no harm;
   the view that individual mitigation efforts would have no morally
   significant effect; and the view that lifestyle changes would be
   overly-demanding. The paper shows how all three arguments fail to
   convince. While collective endeavours may be most efficient and
   effective in bringing about significant changes, there are still good
   reasons to contribute individually to reducing emission. After all, for
   most people the choice is between reducing one's individual emissions
   and not doing anything. The author hopes this paper shows that one
   should not opt for the latter.},

Abstract = {The debate over multiculturalism in liberal societies has focussed on
   the relationship between cultural membership, individual identity, and
   individual rights and freedoms. But the discourse of cultural
   recognition, both indigenous and polyethnic, should also be examined for
   the ways in which it is deployed by states to further their domestic and
   foreign policy agendas. Analysis of the discourse around
   multiculturalism and biculturalism in Australia and New Zealand shows
   that diversity has been promoted to niche market national industries in
   a global market, and to reinforce neoliberal economic policies, through
   encouraging voluntary association, and the devolution of service
   provision from the state to civil society organizations. Cultural rights
   are promoted as alternatives to substantial economic redistribution, and
   to the transfer of ownership to indigenous groups of natural resources.
   Finally, traditional cultural values of community, belonging and
   solidarity supply values absent from neoliberal discourse.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},

Number = {2},
Pages = {43-56},
Abstract = {When facing the challenge of new global employment dynamics and the
   demand for the creation of economic growth and new jobs, joint
   cross-sectoral efforts to pool market and public sector resources
   promise to make the most of the complementary strengths, competencies
   and perspectives of different actors. The topic addressed here is the
   impact that management rationale-bureaucratic and entrepreneurial-has on
   cross-sectoral collaboration, and in particular how a mismatch in goals
   and norms between sectoral actors and the overall management rationale
   may affect joint efforts in terms of the capacity to recruit relevant
   actors and establish sustainable collaboration. The empirical findings,
   which are based on two cases of cross-sectoral co-operation-the EU
   programme EQUAL and the Swedish VINNVZXT programme-suggest that
   management rationale is an important factor in accounting for success of
   cross-sectoral initiatives and that a mismatch risks undermining smooth
   co-operation and thereby policy delivery.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to identify the most significant variations in
   current republican theories, and to underline both the differences and
   similarities in their theoretical positions. The broad heterogeneity of
   theories that find their base in republicanism offer the reader a rich
   palette with multiple shades in each color, where differences of degree
   combine with actual qualitative differences. In this scenario we can
   distinguish three main trends: liberal republicanism, radical
   republicanism and anti-modern republicanism. Within these three streams
   it is unsurprising to discover divergences among authors; however, there
   are certain core perspectives that allow us to define those that remain
   within one same line of thinking. This categorization also offers the
   greatest heuristic potential for classifying the multiple differences.},

Abstract = {In the last decade the concept of disaster diplomacy has drawn interest
   to the links between major natural disasters and international conflict.
   This paper reviews the disparate set of works covering this
   relationship. This body of work, which draws on multiple disciplinary
   traditions extending over three generations, holds vast potential for
   political scientists that seek to understand the intersection of
   ecological catastrophe and politics. The latest wave of publications has
   the greatest potential to yield valuable and generalizable insight into
   political phenomena as well as to produce practical knowledge for
   disaster-related organizations and agencies, policymakers, and citizens.
   This paper reviews the three generations of literature and then makes
   suggestions along three lines of argument: (1) refining definitions of
   variables, (2) refining the concept of `disaster diplomacy', and (3)
   using existing theories and concepts of interstate conflict.},

Pages = {383-399},
Abstract = {This conclusion links the various contributions in light of the
   introductory framework. In line with our framework, scepticism towards
   the EU has increased since 2004 across most of the EU regions (old and
   new) and state-centric approaches (regional influence mediated through
   the central executives) have become the dominant strategy for regional
   mobilization. Unmediated access through direct regional representation
   in Brussels remains an important side-strategy though, especially for
   sub-state nations and regions with the highest level of regional
   authority, as theoretically expected. Regional authority-more so than
   the difference between competitive versus cooperative multi-level
   designs-is an important predictor against centralization pressures
   resulting from European integration. Overall, changes in the `New
   Europe' have intensified but not transformed the dominant patterns of
   regional mobilization, while system-level and regional variables mediate
   impacts of Europeanization.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to explore the political preferences of indigenous

   and that they also bear a low adherence level to their own ethnicity. In
   light of the results of 2950 polls in presidential and parliamentary
   elections in La Araucania we argue that there is no significant
   correlation between Mapuche and right-wing voting. In contrast, there is
   a positive and significant correlation between Indigenous votes and

Abstract = {In analyses of the sources of social trust, it has been found that
   voluntary organizations have no effect upon it. Such analyses have
   overlooked the role of civil society organizations as intermediary
   structures between the citizen and the state. This article explores how
   organizations, linked together in corporatist networks, help generate
   trust. Two mechanisms for this are pointed out. First, in societies with
   strong corporatist networks conflicts between employers and employees
   are perceived as less strong than in societies with weak corporatist
   networks. Second, as societies with strong corporatist networks also are
   more egalitarian, conflicts between rich and poor are also perceived as
   less pronounced than in societies with weak corporatist networks. This
   analysis provides definite indications that the perception of conflicts
   between workers and managers, and the perception of conflicts between
   rich and poor are intermediary variables between corporatism and social
   trust, and thus supports the hypothesis that voluntary organizations,
   through corporatist networks of negotiation and coordination, contribute
   to the growth of social trust.},

Volume = {36},

Pages = {366-386},
Abstract = {In the past few decades, states across several disparate geographical
   contexts have adopted policies and initiatives aimed at
   institutionalizing their relationship with groups constituted as
   ``their{''} diasporas. These practices, which range from creating new
   ministries for diaspora affairs and reserving seats in the national
   legislature to granting dual citizenship and allowing members of the
   diaspora to participate in domestic elections, seem to have a very
   specific purpose. They are aimed at integrating diasporas as part of a
   larger ``global{''} nation that is connected to, and has claims on the
   institutional structure of the home state. This article argues that the
   best way to understand this phenomenon, conceptualized here as the
   ``domestic abroad{''}, is to see it as the product of two simultaneous,
   ongoing processes: the diasporic imagining of the nation, and the
   neoliberal restructuring of the state. Furthermore, to make sense of the
   nature and relationship of these processes, we need to focus on the
   development of capitalist social relations on both global and national
   scales. This, it is contended, can be best done through the development
   of a theoretical framework based on the historical materialist concept
   of hegemony.},

Title = {UKRAINE IN THE POLITICAL CRISIS: THE IMAGE OF RUSSIA AS CATALYST OF
   CONTRADICTIONS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2014},
Number = {5},
Pages = {50-67},
Abstract = {This paper deals with the period that is prior to Ukraine's crises of
   2013-14. The image of Russia shaped by political discourses, TV news and
   school textbook on history and geography is analyzed. The authors
   examine in what way the political doctrines which were in use exerted
   influence upon public opinion and resulted in direct and indirect
   consequences. They argue that the ``European prospect{''}, which is
   serving as a guide line for social and institutional modernization all
   around Central and Eastern Europe, including Russia, has been
   transformed in Ukraine into an ideology for identity and state-building.
   The European aspiration was legitimized by an idea that ``Ukraine is not
   Russia{''}. This concept kept its importance during the Post-Soviet
   period regardless of changes in political elites and has been
   transmitted through the mass-media and school education. The politics of
   the Ukrainian media was one-sided in spite of declared pluralism of
   opinions and freedom of speech. The TV news has not reflected the
   current events so much as a ``war of discourses{''} promoted by
   protagonists and antagonists of the Ukrainian government. The observed
   plurality of Ukrainian media did not become a plurality of meanings and
   approaches. Analyses of the political discourses and mass media are
   balanced by review of school textbooks on history and geography. The
   authors discovered that all of the textbooks assumed a similar initial
   hypothesis despite the change in textbooks' generations and political
   assessments. First, the history of the country and the history of the
   Ukrainian nation are considered as identical. Second, the approaches,
   which are well known as ``victimization{''} and ``occidentalisation{''}
   of national history, were applied to explain Ukrainian history. Third,
   history itself was considered as a predetermined process driven by the
   logic of history, not by people's decisions. Objectifying history, the
   school textbooks interpreted historical incidents from the perspective
   of the current political agenda. School students built up an image of
   Ukraine as a colony first of the Moscow state, then of the Russian
   Empire and the USSR. In conclusion the authors argue that the opposition
   of Russia and Ukraine, which has been widely used as a tool for the
   creation of a unified nation in Ukraine, has played a destructive rather
   than a constructive role for both Ukrainian society and the state.},

Abstract = {This article examines the variation of IO policy change. Policy change
   in IOs is not a matter of taking place or not but varies for instance
   with regard to triggers of change. Empirical evidence shows that similar
   organizations faced with similar pressures to change react differently.
   The argument put forward here is that the way in which change takes
   place in an IO depends on the practical logics that any type of
   organization, or `community of practice', develops throughout its
   existence. I develop the term organizational personality that captures
   those practical logics within an IO. The concept builds on recent
   studies in the TO literature that introduced `organizational culture' to
   account for IO behavior, yet develops it further in two respects. First,
   personality is less structural than culture which means that it can also
   account for change and not only for continuity. Secondly, personality is
   broader than culture as it goes beyond an understanding of TO culture as
   mainly determined by formal and informal rules based on specific
   professional norms. Instead, personality refers to those unreflected,
   everyday practices of organizational actors that in its interplay shape
   an IO's behavior as a whole.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the potential for evidence-informed policymaking
   in the field of mediation. It argues that one of the key barriers to
   evidence-informed policymaking in this area is the disjointed character
   of the existing literature and finds that methodological and theoretical
   tensions lie at the heart of policy debates around mediation. While
   differences in theoretical, epistemological and normative perspectives
   of the existing research have made it difficult for policymakers to draw
   clear conclusions from the available evidence, the article nevertheless
   identifies a degree of convergence around certain key themes such as the
   importance of legitimacy in determining conflict outcomes and the
   benefits of combining quantitative and qualitative methods. It concludes
   by highlighting the importance of policy experimentation, evaluation and
   building capacity for policy learning in mediation policymaking.},

Abstract = {For more than 20 years, Somalia has experienced state failure. Today,
   radical political Islam and groups such as al-Shabab with links to
   al-Qaida are gaining ground. The current federal government is failing
   to provide public goods, such as security, education, and health, to the
   population it claims to represent. To date, more than a dozen peace
   negotiations to end this conflict have failed. The objective of this
   article is to shed light on why past peace processes have failed. The
   study of the Mbagathi peace process that preceded the United Nations-led
   Djibouti peace process can help to better understand the current
   political stalemate and conflict in Somalia. Moreover, some of the
   challenges of state formation in Somalia will be discussed, including
   the claim that hidden and vested interests threaten a viable and
   politically stable state.},

Title = {Ties That Bind? Effects of Inter-level Mobility on MP Attitude to Local
   Government in Two Scandinavian Countries},
Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to examine to what degree the movement of
   elected representatives from local to central level affects the outlook
   of the ones who move upwards'. Two Scandinavian countries - Sweden and
   Norway - serve as comparative cases. In both countries a high share of
   members of parliament (MPs) has served as local councillors before being
   elected to parliament. According to conventional wisdom, this high share
   of inter-level mobility would strengthen ties between government tiers.
   Hence, parliamentarians with local political background are assumed to
   have greater confidence in the capacities of local government. It turns
   out that Sweden corresponds to this assumption, while the Norwegian
   results to some extent contradict the same hypothesis. In the Norwegian
   case, MPs who previously held office as local councillors are actually
   more sceptical towards local government than MPs with no experience from
   local politics. In the last section of the article a number of
   explanations for the disparate findings are being discussed. For one, it
   appears to be a higher level of controversy related to local government
   in Norway than in Sweden. In turn, this accounts for some of the
   scepticism being expressed by the very MPs who themselves have held
   local office. Second, greater financial dependency in the Norwegian case
   creates incentives for strategic action which, in turn, might undermine
   confidence between levels of government. These are strategies that are
   harder to conceal vis-a-visMPs who have themselves gained experience
   from local politics.},

   networks use the claim of food sovereignty and how they use the
   boomerang mechanism at different spatial levels. It further attempts to
   identify how food sovereignty is linked to other gender claims, such as
   combating gender violence, to become a tool of emancipation and
   empowerment of rural women in Latin America. It will consider how
   transnational networking operates to empower them.},

Abstract = {This study analyzed public opinion data for the 45 societies from the
   latest World Values Survey and found that Internet use promotes
   democratic support in democratic countries but not in authoritarian
   countries. In advanced democracies, democratic ideas and thoughts are
   freely produced and disseminated in cyberspace, and Internet users tend
   to absorb them. On the other hand, this online content is highly
   controlled by authoritarian governments in non-democratic settings, and
   Internet users are likely to be exposed to pro-government messages and
   entertainment, thereby nullifying the democratic utility of Internet
   use. These different social learning processes result in a global
   reinforcement effect of Internet use on democratic support. The results
   confirm that the Internet is a neutral technology and its effect depends
   on the political environment where it is used.},

Abstract = {After the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party
   (RSDLP), which took place in mid-1903, a dispute between Vladimir Lenin
   and Rosa Luxemburg on the conformation to be adopted by the Party
   developed. Fifty years later, the above controversy is revived within
   the Socialism or Barbarism group by Cornelius Castoriadis and Claude
   Lefort. Castoriadis, echoing the position of Lenin; Lefort, being more
   close to Luxembourg. We aim to reconstruct both debates with a dual
   purpose. First, approach the first of them to determine their center
   points. Then look at how the proposals of Cornelius Castoriadis and
   Claude Lefort can be recognized in the positions of Vladimir Lenin and
   Rosa Luxemburg. Finally, we tested a short conclusion.},

Abstract = {There is a renewed scholarly interest in peacekeeping with quantitative,
   systematic empirical studies figuring prominently. Arguably, this recent
   work has gone some way to address two puzzles that have consistently
   surrounded debates on peacekeeping. The first puzzle is that reporting
   on peacekeeping and public opinion tend to be critical. Regardless,
   peacekeeping has become an important element of efforts by the
   international community to resolve conflict. The second puzzle of
   peacekeeping is the contrast between quantitative, comparative studies
   and case studies in their assessment of the effectiveness of
   peacekeeping. This survey shows that recent research provides general
   evidence supporting the importance of peacekeeping, but some serious
   concerns remain.},

Abstract = {The Great Recession forced many people around to cut back on consumption
   and is one reason that drives the rise of right-wing forces. One
   response to the downturn has been a call for a return to high-level
   growth and consumption of goods. By contrast, this paper argues in favor
   of an alternative conception of the good life. To defend this thesis, it
   first surveys the social science literature regarding the relationship
   between income and happiness, noting that the growth of the former does
   not necessarily translate to improvements in the latter. Next, it
   provides a number of explanations of why greater income and consumption
   often do not yield greater happiness. The paper then goes on to discuss
   historical and theoretical alternatives to consumerism-driven life and
   society. Finally, it discusses how happiness can best be found in
   socializing with others, participating in the community, and engaging in
   spiritual and intellectual pursuits. The paper, thus, concludes that
   human contentment and flourishing is perhaps best found outside of the
   high-growth, high-consumption paradigm. Moreover, it finds that such a
   new normal is not only protective of the environment, but also enhances
   social justice.},

Abstract = {Consumer confidence and perceived political confidence are known to play
   independently a crucial role in the economic growth of a country. Using
   French monthly economic and political data, we analyse the relationships
   between the president, the prime minister and consumer confidence during
   cohabitation and non-cohabitation periods, based on a SUR (seemingly
   unrelated regression) model. During cohabitation periods, whenever the
   president's confidence index increased the prime minister index
   decreased. Further, confidence in the prime minister was useful for
   predicting consumer confidence. During non-cohabitation periods,
   consumer confidence helps to forecast both the president's confidence
   and the prime minister's confidence.},

Abstract = {Our contribution analyses the influence of campaign advertisements on
   vote choice in the 2011 elections to the Swiss National Council.
   Concretely, we ask whether and to what extent the relative exposure to
   party ads of a preferred party exerts a reinforcing effect on an
   individual's party choice. We make use of the two-wave panel structure
   contained in the RCS survey data of the Selects 2011 and combine it with
   data on advertisements in 20 important national and regional newspapers.
   We find that increasing exposure to the campaign of one's preferred
   party may reinforce individuals with strong party attachment in their
   initial vote choice. Yet this effect only materializes with substantial
   campaign duration and exposure. Additional and exploratory analyses
   revealed that particularly the two recently emerged parties, the GLP and
   BDP, might have made a slight difference by potentially persuading
   defecting voters with the help of their campaign.},

Abstract = {According to the logic of standard veto bargaining models with complete
   information, bargaining in the European Union should never reach the
   second reading of the ordinary legislative procedure (co-decision). Even
   so, non-agreement at the first reading occurs frequently in European
   Union decision making. How can this be explained? Drawing upon game
   theory on bargaining with incomplete information, two specific
   predictions with regard to the occurrence of first-reading
   non-agreements can be generated. First-reading agreements are less
   likely to occur (1) the greater the distance between the ideal point of
   the Council and the ideal point of the European Parliament and (2) the
   greater the salience attached to the proposal. This article combines
   positional and proposal-specific data and finds robust support for both
   hypotheses in two different empirical tests.},

Abstract = {What effect does the financial cost of running for office have on
   candidate entry decisions, and does it differ depending on a candidate's
   motivations for running? We use a regression discontinuity design and
   panel data analysis to estimate the causal effect of campaign costs on
   candidate entry in Japan, where the amount of money required as a
   deposit for ballot access increased periodically to become one of the
   highest in the world, and a considerable part of campaign costs. We find
   that candidates from the major office-seeking parties were likely to be
   replaced after losing the deposit, and that these parties nominated
   fewer candidates following increases in the deposit amount. However, we
   find no such deterrent effect for fringe candidates. This finding calls
   into question the effectiveness of the deposit at fulfilling its
   supposed purpose, and sheds light on the differences between the
   financial and strategic coordination incentives that influence the
   nomination decisions of parties. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {37-56},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Based on the presumption that the public attitude towards security
   issues can be measured by analyzing certain public opinion survey
   variables, we have tested selected variables from the Slovenian Public
   Opinion Surveys on National and International Security (from 1990 to
   2012) against the basic postulates of the Political Realist, Liberal,
   Constructivist and Critical Security theoretical paradigms. The public
   attitude towards security related issues (i.e. threats, values, security
   concepts and policies, national and international security mechanisms
   and instruments) has proven to be peace oriented over the past decades.
   Hence we assumed that it can be best explained by Critical Security
   theories and Constructivism. We have developed a model in which the
   general theoretical concepts (expressed through attitudes towards
   threats, values, security concepts/policies, and security
   mechanisms/instruments) are complemented with variables from the public
   opinion surveys in order to analyze the general public's propensity
   towards these various theoretical paradigms. Our analysis reveals that
   the attitude of the Slovenian public to the selected security issues can
   be best explained by Critical Security theories, and also to a lesser
   extent by Liberal and Constructivist theories; by contrast, traditional
   Political Realism offers little explanatory potential.},

Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Pages = {817-846},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Although the Supreme Court is a countermajoritarian institution by
   design, many scholars have contended that without concrete powers, the
   Court relies on public support for legitimacy. Accordingly, it is
   important to understand the relationship between people's ideological
   proximity to the Court and their support for it. Existing empirical
   research suggests a correspondence between public opinion and the
   Court's positions, but these studies do not directly compare masses and
   elites in a common space. To address these issues, we conducted an
   original survey asking respondents about their positions on ten recently
   decided Supreme Court cases. This allows us to estimate the positions of
   citizens and justices on the same ideological scale. Further, while some
   existing theories of perceptions of judicial legitimacy suggest similar
   relationships between ideological distance and various types of support
   for the Court, we propose a theory of heterogeneous responsiveness which
   posits that citizens' ideological distance from the Court should be
   negatively related to their approval of and trust in the institution,
   but positively related to their support for its countermajoritarian
   function. Our empirical approach finds support for the theory.},

Abstract = {The present study is a comparative examination of the impact of diverse
   levels of administrative and fiscal decentralization has on the outlook
   of local political elites in East-Central Europe, namely: (a) the local
   elites' degree of isolation; (2) their attitudes towards increased
   decentralization, and (3) their level of satisfaction as inhabitants of
   the towns they govern. After establishing a conceptual framework, which
   includes taxonomies of decentralization and of the local administrative
   organization, the present study concentrates upon three case-studies,
   meant to illustrate a range of hypotheses about the manner in which the
   dynamics of decentralization produce significant changes in the outlook
   (i.e. from contacts and interactions to attitudes regarding
   decentralization proper) of the local political elites.},

Abstract = {Two important elections held in close succession-the December 2013
   Assembly elections and the May 2014 Lok Sabha elections-in the state of
   Madhya Pradesh emphatically underline the consolidation achieved by the
   BJP. Overriding anti-incumbency, the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led BJP
   government in the state returned to power and rode on the crest of the
   popularity of the state chief minister and the BJP prime ministerial
   candidate Narendra Modi to put up a creditable performance in the Lok
   Sabha elections. The BJP was helped by strong anti-incumbency against
   the UPA, on the one hand, and the organizational ineffectiveness of the
   Congress party at the state level, on the other. This article attempts
   an analysis of the factors and forces that contributed to the BJP
   consolidating its position in the state in the recent years.},

Abstract = {The literature on post-communist party politics frequently suggests that
   membership organizations are not important for political parties in the
   region, as elections can be won with expensive media-based campaigns.
   The article tests this argument using the parliamentary elections in
   Lithuania in the 2000s held under a mixed electoral system. The results
   suggest that both party membership organization and campaign spending
   have roughly equal effects on the electoral persistence of political
   parties. New parties also benefit from both strong membership
   organizations and high campaign spending.},

Abstract = {Most scholarship on the moral dimensions of Tocqueville's analysis of
   democracy focuses on the doctrine of enlightened self-interest.
   Surprisingly little has been written about his account of the underlying
   moral shift that makes this doctrine necessary. Drawing principally on
   Volume II of DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA, but also on Tocqueville's letters and
   notes, I unearth his fascinating and compelling account of why modern
   democratic man loses his admiration for devotion and embraces
   self-interest. That account begins from individualism, but also includes
   democratic man's intellectual and aesthetic tastes, his low estimation
   of his moral capacities, and weakening religious belief. After examining
   what Tocqueville saw as the causes of the new moral outlook, I consider
   what he saw as its most profound implications. Departing from recent
   trends in Tocqueville scholarship, I argue that is in Tocqueville's
   account of the modern democratic condition as such that he has the most
   to offer us today.},

Abstract = {In the year 2008, the German Federal Constitutional Court ruled that the
   formerly applicable Electoral Law was unconstitutional due to the effect
   of the so-called `negative voting weight'. After a five-year debate, the
   new Electoral Law was passed in spring 2013, according to which the
   following parliamentary elections were conducted in autumn. This new law
   mainly fulfils the regulations laid down by the Constitutional Court,
   although not to their full extent. Through the introduction of
   adjustment mandates for overhang mandates, the proportional
   representation between the parties represented in the German Parliament
   Bundestag was guaranteed for the first time. At the same time, however,
   an abundance of new problems such as a procedural return which is hard
   to reason, and the risk of a severely inflated Bundestag, are created.},

Abstract = {Newspapers in developed economies are experiencing declining advertising
   and circulation revenues, closures and cutbacks. Investigative
   journalism's normative role has been described as scrutinising
   concentrated power sources in liberal democracies. This article examines
   investigative reporting by the Australian print media that has exposed
   corporate wrong-doing from affluent times to the current era of
   newspapers' financial hardship. Applying two content analyses, the
   article examines business investigative journalism from selected
   newspapers and specific categories of the peer-reviewed Walkley Awards.
   The socialist tradition identifies corporate power above other groups in
   society, and this article finds in accordance with political-economic
   theories that mainstream newspapers have become conspicuously absent in
   their investigative role in detecting and exposing corporate
   transgressions. I conclude that this failure was most notable prior to
   and during the Global Financial Crisis, and this has implications for
   the exercise, and scrutiny, of corporate power in Australia.},

Abstract = {Authoritarian states restrain online activism not only through
   repression and censorship, but also by indirectly weakening the ability
   of netizens to self-govern and constructively engage the state. I
   demonstrate this argument by comparing I-Paid-A-Bribe (IPAB) a
   crowd-sourcing platform that collects anonymous reports of petty bribery
   in India and China. Whereas IPAB originated and has thrived in India, a
   copycat effort in China fizzled out within months. Contrary to those who
   attribute China's failed outcome only to repression, I find that even
   before authorities shut down IPAB, the sites were already plagued by
   internal organizational problems that were comparatively absent in
   India. The study tempers expectations about the revolutionary effects of
   new media in mobilizing contention and checking corruption in the
   absence of a strong civil society.},

Abstract = {List and endorsement experiments are becoming increasingly popular among
   social scientists as indirect survey techniques for sensitive questions.
   When studying issues such as racial prejudice and support for militant
   groups, these survey methodologies may improve the validity of
   measurements by reducing nonresponse and social desirability biases. We
   develop a statistical test and multivariate regression models for
   comparing and combining the results from list and endorsement
   experiments. We demonstrate that when carefully designed and analyzed,
   the two survey experiments can produce substantively similar empirical
   findings. Such agreement is shown to be possible even when these
   experiments are applied to one of the most challenging research
   environments: contemporary Afghanistan. We find that both experiments
   uncover similar patterns of support for the International Security
   Assistance Force (ISAF) among Pashtun respondents. Our findings suggest
   that multiple measurement strategies can enhance the credibility of
   empirical conclusions. Open-source software is available for
   implementing the proposed methods.},

Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Number = {19},
Pages = {3-17},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article studies the application of a well-known notion of
   international humanitarian law, civilian direct participation in
   hostilities, to cyber warfare.
   According to the principle of distinction, civilians and combatants must
   be distinguished in times of armed conflict. The shift of hostilities
   from the real world into cyberspace affects neither the definition of
   combatants nor the negative definition of civilians. However, beyond the
   classical approach of the principle of distinction, the changing
   character of warfare also concerns cyber warfare. Indeed, the
   distinction between battlefields and civilian areas is increasingly less
   clear and a rising number of non-combatants directly participate in
   hostilities in various ways. Cyber means, and the development of cyber
   warfare, offer numerous new possibilities for non-combatants who want to
   take part in hostilities. It has never been this easy for civilians to
   get involved in hostilities and most civilians are ignorant of the
   consequences of their actions.
   Recently, two groups of experts have released documents partly related
   to this topic with divergent conclusions: the first one is the
   Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in
   Hostilities under International Humanitarian Law adopted by the ICRC in
   2009. The second one is the Tallinn Manual on the International Law
   Applicable to Cyber Warfare written at the behest of NATO's Cooperative
   Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence. As these documents differ in their
   approach to reading of the topic, part of this article will analyze
   their divergences.},

Abstract = {Political science is falling behind a broad movement in the United
   States that seeks to reform the teaching of scientific literacy in
   undergraduate education. Indeed, political science is far behind that
   movement because the discipline does not have a collective commitment to
   science education at the undergraduate level. This article discusses
   prominent efforts in this reform movement and assesses the state of
   science education in our discipline. The authors propose an agenda for
   action on this issue in political science as well as fundamental

Abstract = {Using China's Great Leap Famine as example, this article shows how
   political career incentives can produce disastrous outcomes under the
   well-intended policies of a dictator. By exploiting a regression
   discontinuity design, the study identifies the causal effect of
   membership status in the Chinese Communist Party's Central
   Committee-full (FM) Versus alternate members (AM)-on grain procurement.
   It finds that the difference in grain procurement between AMs and FMs
   who ranked near the discontinuity threshold is three times that between
   all AMs and all FMs on average. This may explain why Mao exceptionally
   promoted some lower-ranked but radical FMs shortly before the Leap: to
   create a demonstration effect in order to spur other weakly motivated
   FMs into action.},

Abstract = {Does nonviolent repression prompt subject groups to obey or rebel? By
   what mechanism does it do so? To address these questions, we exploit a
   natural experiment based on a 2009 policy toward the easement of
   checkpointsnonviolent impediments to movementin the West Bank. We sample
   populations across 17 villages (n = 599), beside one checkpoint slated
   for easement (treatment) and one that will undergo no change (control),
   before and after the intervention. We then pursue
   difference-in-difference estimation. This design is experimental, as
   easement was orthogonal to Palestinian attitudes; for robustness, we
   test our findings against an independent panel (n = 1,200). We find that
   easement makes subject populations less likely to support violence; we
   suggest humiliation as the mechanism bridging nonviolent repression with
   militancy. This warrants rethinking Israeli security policy, as
   short-term concerns over Palestinian mobility may be compromising
   Israel's long-term interests. By extension, checkpoint easement may
   positively affect peace negotiations.},

Abstract = {Collection and especially analysis of open-ended survey responses are
   relatively rare in the discipline and when conducted are almost
   exclusively done through human coding. We present an alternative,
   semiautomated approach, the structural topic model (STM) (Roberts,
   Stewart, and Airoldi 2013; Roberts et al. 2013), that draws on recent
   developments in machine learning based analysis of textual data. A
   crucial contribution of the method is that it incorporates information
   about the document, such as the author's gender, political affiliation,
   and treatment assignment (if an experimental study). This article
   focuses on how the STM is helpful for survey researchers and
   experimentalists. The STM makes analyzing open-ended responses easier,
   more revealing, and capable of being used to estimate treatment effects.
   We illustrate these innovations with analysis of text from surveys and
   experiments.},

Abstract = {Several key sectors including higher education institutions have a
   skills shortage in South Africa. Combined with aging of its workforce,
   higher education institutions may find it increasingly difficult to
   maintain adequate numbers of skilled and experienced employees to
   fulfill their core functions. This study assesses the impact of
   mandatory retirement age on the workforce of a higher education
   institution in South Africa. The data were obtained from the Human
   Resources of the higher education institution and using an estimation
   model. The results indicate that a mandatory retirement age of 60 years
   has a negative impact on the future size of permanent academic staff in
   the short-to-medium term. However, a mandatory retirement age of 65
   years or even higher has positive impact on the number of permanent
   academic staff in the institution.},

   Kingdom of Jordan Analysis of the Environmental Protection Law No. 52

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive analysis of the
   legal framework of environment protection in the Hashemite Kingdom of
   Jordan, (referred to as Jordan). It sheds light on the adequacy and
   effectiveness of the Jordanian laws in protecting the environment by
   examining existing obstacles and challenges to enforce the law such as
   the overlap and contradictory provisions with respect to fines and
   penalties of the different Jordanian laws related to the environment.
   This makes it difficult for concerned judges to decide which law applies
   to the case, which results in delays in reviewing and ruling
   environmental cases by the courts. The paper sheds light on pollution
   and resources depletion which has become worrisome and pose a threat to
   the environment of the country. In addition, the paper reflects on the
   role of the civic society, government entities and their efforts in
   protecting the environment by addressing environmental problems and
   working towards sustainable development. Finally, the paper proposes a
   set of recommendations to enhance Jordan' environmental legal framework
   to ensure it protects and improves the environment in the country.},

Abstract = {Many U.S. states require redistricting authorities to follow traditional
   districting principles (TDPs) like the creation of compact districts and
   respecting the integrity of county and town boundaries. Reformers,
   academics, and other redistricting experts have long suggested that
   following such districting principles may enhance representation. Yet,
   very few academic studies have empirically examined these expectations.
   Using two measures of geographical compactness and a new measure of
   respect for political subdivisions (referred to as coterminosity)
   created with a geographic information system (GIS), the connection
   between district boundaries and representation is tested. The results
   show strong evidence that the use of geographic districting principles
   can enhance dyadic representation, as more compact and more coterminous
   districts are associated with more positive evaluations of legislative
   responsiveness and greater citizen-representative communication.
   Violating TDPs to advance other goals in redistricting like strict
   population equality between districts thus comes with a clear
   representational cost.},

Abstract = {Why do pro-democracy protests emerge in some countries at certain
   periods of time and not others? Pro-democracy protests, I argue, are
   more likely to arise when the economy is not performing well and people
   blame the autocratic nature of their regime for the economy, than when
   the economy is performing well, or when people do not blame the nature
   of their regime for the poor state of the economy. People are more
   likely to associate the economy with the nature of their regime, I
   further argue, in election periods, particularly when people are unable
   to remove the incumbent government from power through elections. My
   argument is supported by a statistical analysis of pro-democracy
   protests in 158 countries between 2006 and 2011, showing that not only
   is the economy an important factor explaining the emergence of
   pro-democracy protests, but that other factors commonly thought to
   affect these protests, including technologies like cell phones and the
   Internet, are not.},

Abstract = {The article explores the emergence of a post-corporatist negotiation
   democracy based on a diversity of informal public consultation platforms
   that have been established by governments. Roundtables, expert and
   ethics commissions, councils, dialog forums and national summits evolved
   into a wide-ranging system of preliminary political decision-making.
   Here, experts and representatives of civil society groups have a say in
   deciding on key issues of politics. This development has occurred in
   many places and in fields like social policy, energy policy, migration
   policy, or social integration policy. It seems inappropriate to consider
   such extra-parliamentary consensus building a `post-democratic' symptom
   of decline. Compared to corporatist bargaining with major producer
   associations over distributive issues, the consultative structures
   discussed here are featured by broader participation, post-materialist
   reform agendas as well as greater transparency and public scrutiny.},

Abstract = {Since the independence of Armenia in 1991, the question of whether and
   how to include the Armenian Genocide on the state's foreign policy
   agenda has become the most important issue of controversy between the
   republic and the global Armenian diaspora. International recognition of
   the genocide and demands for reparations have been central to diaspora
   activism and have defined what experts conceptualize as ``identity
   politics.{''} The Armenian state, however, has been reluctant to include
   the issue on its political agenda. Eager to establish diplomatic
   relations with Turkey and open their shared border-closed since 1993-for
   trade and economic development, Yerevan has insisted on ``relations
   without preconditions{''} with Ankara. There is, therefore, a clear gap
   between the state reasoning and diaspora activism. This paper looks at
   identity politics and state reasoning through the lenses of
   international relations theory to examine the divide between the two
   parties and how it might be bridged. It employs Yossi Shain's framework
   of diaspora politics to study the relationship between the Armenian
   diaspora and state concerning the question of the genocide. It argues
   that an area of convergence followed the failure of the Armenian-Turkish
   agreement of 2009, which is evidence of an ongoing social construction
   of identity geopolitics toward a bridging of the gap.},

Abstract = {In this article, we discuss the role of the Netherlands with respect to
   the Darfur crisis during 20032005. From the moment the crisis broke out,
   the Netherlands was active as a major donor and tried to facilitate
   political solutions. During the period January 2004-July 2005, it
   functioned as the (acting) presidency of the Council of the European
   Union and was therefore involved in creating a common EU position. We
   discuss how policy was made while observing internal (domestic) and
   external (international) influences. We conclude that the Netherlands
   was partially successful in establishing a more active EU position
   regarding Darfur. However, we also find evidence that, eventually, the
   EU has lagged behind the response of the UN Security Council, despite
   being a major donor to emergency relief and the African Union mission in
   Sudan.},

Abstract = {In 1936, while Sweden gave birth to one of the most peaceful solutions
   to class conflict (i.e., the neo-corporatist welfare state), Spain gave
   birth to one of the most violent outcomes of class conflict: the Spanish
   Civil War. Why did the political and socio-economic elites choose
   collaboration in Sweden and violent confrontation in Spain? This article
   underlines an overlooked intervening factor: the organization of the
   bureaucracy. In the late 19th century, semi-authoritarian Sweden created
   a meritocratic autonomous bureaucracy. In contrast, Spain-where
   executive and administrative positions were frequently accountable to
   parliamentary dynamics-built a patronage-based administration. The
   result was that the ruling Swedish Left could not offer public offices
   to core supporters and had to restrict its policies to satisfy the (more
   collaborationist) demands of its ``policy-seekers,{''} while the ruling
   Spanish Left, thanks to the ample margin of maneuver it enjoyed to
   appoint and promote state officials, could satisfy the (more
   confrontational) demands of its ``office-seekers.{''}},

Abstract = {We surveyed 2,221 rural residents in twenty towns across ten provinces
   in China. Structural equation models (SEM) found the quality of
   government, impartiality of institutions, and authoritarian values among
   citizens are the three main sources of citizens' trust in local
   government. Among various types of recent institutional innovation and
   government reform, only a type that involves citizens in a formal
   electoral process, called `open nomination and direct election (ONDE)',
   significantly improved trust in township-level government. Our models
   reveal that the movement of power to select local leaders from the hands
   of upper-level government to local residents erodes the influence of the
   so-called `traditional authority orientation' among citizens, and
   enables them to assess trust level according to the competence of the
   government. Furthermore, elections reduce the trust-generating effect of
   institutional impartiality as citizens are enfranchised in the `input'
   process of government, therefore emphasizing `outputs' less.},

Title = {MP behavior in mixed-member electoral systems},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {35},
Pages = {78-87},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Previous research has argued that representatives in mixed-member
   electoral systems adjust their behavior to the mode of their election,
   the so-called mandate divide. MPs elected in single-member districts
   focus on their district, whereas those elected through closed party
   lists focus on their party. Yet this ignores that candidates in
   mixed-member systems can run in a district and on their party's list
   concurrently. This paper presents a model of how the prospects of
   re-election in the district and through the party list affect the
   relationship between voters, candidates, and parties. It is shown that
   the dual candidacy option results in candidates focusing on their party
   in most instances. The model is applied to a novel data set on the
   allocation of federal road construction projects in Germany. (C) 2014

Abstract = {While we know that emotional reactions are important influences on
   political behavior, we know far less about the sources of these
   emotions. This paper studies the causes of fear and anger in reaction to
   a negative stimulus: the financial crisis. Anger should have been
   experienced among individuals who believed a specific actor was to blame
   for the crisis. Moreover, individuals should have been particularly
   angry if they blamed an actor who should be accountable to them, for
   example the national government. I test these expectations using a panel
   survey run in Britain between 2005 and 2010. This data shows that
   British citizens experienced anger if they held an actor responsible for
   the crisis. Moreover, they felt particularly angry if they held the
   Labour government (and to a lesser extent the European Union)
   responsible. These findings underline the importance of studying the
   causes of emotional reactions and show how these may be linked to common
   institutional distinctions between political systems.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses political party influence over appointment of
   supreme justices in weakly institutionalized democracies.While the
   classic approach points out the effect of the presence of weak
   presidents leading to more judicial independence,we argue that in cases
   of weak presidents,it is the legislature that takes political control in
   the courts.Using original data regarding the Ecuadorian Supreme Court
   (1979- 2013) and historical narratives,we show that changes in the
   legislative coalitions usually imply changes in the composition of the
   Supreme Court.Only in cases of strong presidents,such as Rafael
   Correa,has the Executive been a determining actor in political control
   of Supreme Court judges.},

Abstract = {Focused on the International Labor Organization (ILO), this article
   historicizes the concept of `women in developing countries' by looking
   at its own development through use by women researchers and others
   within the ILO context. It traces the construction of `women in
   developing countries' as a distinct category of woman worker. In doing
   so, it advances the understanding of the very terms of policy that we
   take for granted, contextualizing a category that has managed to both
   justify first-world non-governmental organization (NGO) intervention and
   reflect the aspirations of women in the Global South for better lives.
   In capturing this tension, it suggests that we must complicate our
   analysis of global policymaking for, about, and by women. I begin to
   redirect attention from trends in the literature that either celebrate
   the generation who developed the Women in Development (WID) approach or
   critique their projects as hopelessly modernist. My goal is to
   underscore the institutional settings in which the contested terms of
   `women' and `development' became linked. What began as a definition of
   otherness, an objectification of a group defined by policymakers, turned
   into a subject position through which women activists within the ILO and
   on the ground in `ThirdWorld' nations demanded resources - and, as would
   become evident in conventions on home-based work, gained recognition as
   workers.},

Abstract = {Based on survey responses from a national random sample of nearly 4,000
   high school and college students, we uncover a dramatic gender gap in
   political ambition. This finding serves as striking evidence that the
   gap is present well before women and men enter the professions from
   which most candidates emerge. We then use political socialization-which
   we gauge through a myriad of socializing agents and early life
   experiences-as a lens through which to explain the individual-level
   differences we uncover. Our analysis reveals that parental
   encouragement, politicized educational and peer experiences,
   participation in competitive activities, and a sense of self-confidence
   propel young people's interest in running for office. But on each of
   these dimensions, women, particularly once they are in college, are at a
   disadvantage. By identifying when and why gender differences in interest
   in running for office materialize, we begin to uncover the origins of
   the gender gap in political ambition. Taken together, our results
   suggest that concerns about substantive and symbolic representation will
   likely persist.},

Abstract = {A century after release of the `Declaration of Sentiments,' a feminist
   statement countering laws that defined citizenship rights for women
   differently than those of men, representatives of the US Women's Bureau
   offered a new post-WWII testimonial, now before the United Nations
   General Assembly. It defended civic and political rights for women,
   including eligibility to hold public office and to serve as
   international delegates in the UN itself, asserting, `A modern nation
   cannot afford to waste half of its adult populations in a state of
   second-class citizenship.' The women who stood behind this and other
   propositions in the years that followed the war used the UN Economic and
   Social Council (ECOSOC) - the body producing the Universal Declaration
   of Human Rights - to press for global action with a gendered social
   purpose. From the basic premise of the right to representation they
   developed a discourse on a realm of additional rights: towards equal
   treatment, family welfare, justice for refugees and other migrants, and
   true social inclusion. This article focuses on the ways in which US
   women fought for representation and access within ECOSOC institutions in
   order to elicit policy change in the name of justice and international
   humanitarian reform.},

Title = {Did Floor-Crossing Alienate South African Voters? Evidence from
   Municipal Legislatures},

Abstract = {Floor-crossing, the practice of defecting from one political party to
   join another, is common in democracies. While empirical research has
   answered a number of questions about the determinants of party switching
   and the motivations of party switchers, little is known about the
   consequences of floor-crossing in electoral democracies, especially for
   the voters who watch their elected representatives `switch uniforms' in
   the middle of the game. From 2002 to 2008, floor-crossing was legal in
   South Africa and defections at all levels of government were numerous.
   Critics of the country's floor-crossing regime often speculated that
   rampant defections would drive voters away from the polls and undermine
   voters' trust and political engagement. This paper uses data cataloguing
   defections in municipal legislatures to assess the extent to which
   floor-crossing in South Africa may indeed have alienated voters. The
   paper finds strong evidence that floor-crossing may have suppressed
   voter turnout, at least in immediately subsequent elections, but only
   weak evidence to suggest that floor-crossing had any direct or lasting
   effect on voters' attitudes about government and the politicians who run
   it.},

Abstract = {For researchers and students of International Relations (IR), one date
   looms larger than all others: 1648. The end of the Thirty Years War,
   formalized by the signing of the Treaties of Osnabruck and Munster, led
   to a period known as the ``Peace of Westphalia.''Westphalia represented
   a fundamental change in the power balance of European politics: instead
   of the Holy Roman Empire holding supreme authority, power would now rest
   with states themselves, manifested in terms of sovereignty, territory
   and equality. One of the chief ways in which these `'Westphalian{''}
   states would cement this authority was through the use of maps. Before
   1648, there was little on a European map to indicate where one country
   ended and another one began. But after 1648, this all changes: these new
   Westphalian states are represented with bright colors and clearly marked
   boundaries, defining borders and becoming an important part in creating
   the state and justifying its sovereignty. The role which maps have
   played in the spread of the Westphalian state is only just beginning to
   be researched. Yet the limited efforts to date have all focussed on
   Europe. This is unfortunate, as today, while Europe has, according to
   some observers, moved into a stage in which Westphalia is no longer a
   useful model with which to understand the state and the ways in which it
   relates to sovereignty, government, power and the individual, the old
   Westphalian model of the state has more recently been exported all
   around the world. This paper presents the first part of a project which
   aims to look at this expansion. The European angle will be presented in
   this paper; future research will be carried out in China, Japan and
   Taiwan.},

   Grant in South Africa},
Journal = {POLITIKON},

Volume = {41},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Despite the attempt to transform the system of state child support in
   South Africa shortly after the transition to democracy, the initial
   changes resulting in the implementation of the Child Support Grant were
   only partial in nature. This paper explains why institutional stickiness
   in the shape of failed reform efforts occurred in certain areas, while
   radical change took place in others. This effort involves the sequential
   integration of insights from the historical and rational choice variants
   of neoinstitutionalism. The resulting analysis accounts for the
   formation of distinct reform preferences, the strategic interactions
   which shaped eventual outcomes, as well as the ultimate incompleteness
   of policy transformation in a process of institutional layering. The
   paper therefore represents a practical attempt at overcoming the
   divisions between these neoinstitutionalist approaches, while also
   producing an analysis of a policy arena that is undertheorised.},

Abstract = {Vladimir Putin remains central to regime stability in the Russian
   Federation. However, the role that Mr. Putin's personalist appealrooted
   in both charismatic and noncharismatic linkages-plays in maintaining
   regime support is undertheorized. I argue that personalism is a powerful
   political resource in electoral authoritarian regimes because it
   provides a positive logic for skeptical voters to support the leader.
   Personalist linkages obscure the role that electoral bias plays in
   shaping electoral outcomes, diminishing the impulse for mass
   postelection protest. When the effectiveness of personalism declines,
   discontented citizens are more likely to protest biased elections. This
   article shows that Mr. Putin's appeal as a sound steward of the economy
   declined by 2012 but that other sources of issue satisfaction continued
   to shape some respondents' trust in the president.},

   journalistic responsibility that social media has on news related to the
   armed conflict and the current peace process. In addition, it shows that
   in many cases the language used by the media intensifies the armed
   conflict due to the news' lack of context and manipulation. It
   emphasizes in the need of understanding communication as a public
   service and information as a public asset, that is, they don't belong to
   someone in particular and it's up to them to be more professional every
   day, leading to a communication for peace that helps to understand the
   reality of the facts and the public opinion.},

Pages = {43-65},
Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {Risk management has gained great importance as a transversal variable in
   the process of urban design, unfortunately the first decade of XXI has
   brought the occurrence of, at least, three major tsunamis (India and
   Indonesia, 2004; Chile, 2010; Japan, 2011) which had devastating effects
   on people and ecosystems of these countries. To delve into the various
   processes of tsunami mitigation and prevention Japan, USA and India were
   chosen as countries that have recently suffered the effects of a
   tsunami, and historically have developed policies to prevent and
   mitigate the phenomenon. Nicaragua and Chile were selected too as a
   study cases with regard to Latin American, because they have also been
   historically impacted by tsunamis and therefore have experience in the
   fight against such events. Having analyzed these five cases, for the
   purposes of this article, shall be considered as references to
   understand the processes of mitigation and prevention conducted, and
   propose preventive measures (PRE) and mitigation (MIT) as in the case of
   PREMIT to guide and implement urban design projects.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the results of a press analysis exercise about

   the paper shows arguments about the Colombian State weaknesses to
   counteract climate change and the lack of citizen conscience and
   mobilization. The methodology was based on documentary research, review
   and interpretation of written press: El Tiempo, El Pais and El
   Espectador. The information of 1440 cases was organized in a structured
   database divided into categories and built by the Press Observatory of
   the Centro Interdisciplinario de Estudios de la Region Pacifico
   Colombiana (Interdisciplinary Study Center of the Colombian Pacific
   Region). Results indicate the following hypothesis: The Colombian State
   is institutionally changeable and as creator of social and political
   order evidences lack of recognized cohesion, thus, the State cannot
   present itself as a legitimate reference to organize the Colombian
   society.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Item response theory models for roll-call voting data provide political
   scientists with parsimonious descriptions of political actors' relative
   preferences. However, models using only voting data tend to obscure
   variation in preferences across different issues due to identification
   and labeling problems that arise in multidimensional scaling models. We
   propose a new approach to using sources of metadata about votes to
   estimate the degree to which those votes are about common issues. We
   demonstrate our approach with votes and opinion texts from the U. S.
   Supreme Court, using latent Dirichlet allocation to discover the extent
   to which different issues were at stake in different cases and
   estimating justice preferences within each of those issues. This
   approach can be applied using a variety of unsupervised and supervised
   topic models for text, community detection models for networks, or any
   other tool capable of generating discrete or mixture categorization of
   subject matter from relevant vote-specific metadata.},

Abstract = {Chronic communal conflicts embody prisoner's dilemmas. Both communities
   prefer peace to war. But neither trusts the other, viewing the other's
   gain as its loss, so potentially shared interests often go unrealized.
   Achieving positive-sum outcomes from apparently zero-sum struggles
   requires a particular kind of risk-embracing leadership. To succeed
   leaders must: a) see power relations as potentially positive-sum; b)
   strengthen negotiating adversaries when tempted to weaken them; and c)
   demonstrate hope for a positive future and take great personal risks to
   achieve it. Such leadership is exemplified by Nelson Mandela and F. W.
   de Klerk in the South African democratic transition. To illuminate the
   strategic dilemmas Mandela and de Klerk faced, we examine the work of
   Robert Axelrod, Thomas Schelling, and Josep Colomer, who highlight
   important dimensions of the problem but underplay the role of
   risk-embracing leadership. Finally we discuss leadership successes and
   failures in the Northern Ireland settlement and the Israeli-Palestinian
   conflict.},

Abstract = {In this article, we analyse the impact of intra-party procedures of
   candidate selection for national elections on the representativeness of
   parties towards their voters. With regard to candidate selection we
   distinguish between two dimensions: inclusion and centralization. While
   the first identifies the type of selectorate for candidate nominations
   (members, delegates or committees), the second captures the territorial
   unit in which the nomination is decided (local, regional or national).
   Based on data for 53 parties in 9 Western European countries for the
   period 1970 to 1990, the analysis points to the relevance of the
   inclusion dimension. Parties in which party elites decide the nomination
   of candidates show slightly higher degrees of representation than
   parties with more inclusive selectorates. We conduct our analysis
   separately for two frequently used but theoretically different concepts
   of representation: cross-sectional representation (at one point in time)
   and dynamic representation (over time). Our analysis shows that
   candidate-selection procedures only matter for the first concept. The
   empirically inconsistent results between the two concepts are due to
   deficiencies in the way dynamic representation is currently
   operationalized.},

   anthropological and ontological aspects and place people in the system

   the theory of self-referential systems with respect to the
   anthropological inclusion, we propose the idea of ``reflective
   autopoiesis{''} and its use in the observations on the observation of

Abstract = {We investigate how the employment relationship may lead employers to
   control the voting behavior and to induce the electoral registration of
   their workers. Forced registration and the control of votes become
   feasible when voting behavior is observable, as in open ballot
   elections. Workers whose vote is controlled are more likely to be
   registered as compared to other eligible voters, increasing their impact
   on electoral outcomes. Increasing the secrecy of the vote (for instance
   with the adoption of a secret ballot) significantly reduces the control
   of votes. Electoral registration, however, remains biased as long as the
   probability of voting behavior disclosure induces less ideologically
   motivated voters to comply with the political preference of the
   employer. We provide empirical support for the predictions of the model
   examining the effects of the introduction of the secret ballot in Chile
   in 1958. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper explores preferences and attitudes related to fiscal
   federalism held by the ASEAN people in the context of environmental
   issues. Fiscal federalism would predict that local environmental
   problems will be handled more efficiently by local governments, while
   national environmental problems will be solved more efficiently by the
   national government. But it is not obvious whether citizens consider in
   the same way as economics theory predicts. To unveil this point, I
   address questions of whether those who have higher consciousness toward
   environmental issues at the neighbor or local level prefer local
   governments to decide environment policies, whether those who have more
   consciousness about environmental issues at the national level prefer
   the national government to decide the policies, and whether those who
   have higher consciousness toward environmental problems at global level
   prefer higher levels government such as the United Nations to decide the
   policies. By fitting multi-level probit regressions to cross-national
   survey data collected in ASEAN countries, I found the results supporting
   the hypotheses. The country analyses show the results which support the
   hypotheses in Brunei, Indonesia, and the Philippines.},

Abstract = {This article explores links between the issues of sexuality and gendered
   control over agricultural land. It discusses gendered land rights in
   several settings, concentrating particularly on agrarian and land
   reforms. I argue that land redistribution in the ``household{''} model,
   discussed for Chile and Nicaragua, tends to entrench male household and
   agricultural control. In contrast, more collective forms, discussed for
   Vietnam, have displayed economic weaknesses but had potential to
   undercut such control by socialising women's labour. Fears about and
   visions of female sexuality have much to do with backlashes against
   inclusion of women, either through allowing them membership of
   cooperatives and collectives or through granting rights such as joint
   titling to land. In sub-Saharan Africa, there currently exists much
   discussion of improving women's control over agriculture and its
   products. These continue to meet opposition, despite female predominance
   in agriculture in the region. Thus, even though women work on the land
   in many societies, this does not give them any automatic ``closeness{''}
   to nature or say within households. Control over women's, especially
   wives', labour within peasant households, is linked to the manner that
   their persons and their labour are bound up in this socio-economic form.
   The article also examines two feminist attempts to configure alternative
   agricultural forms: the case of a lesbian agricultural collective in the
   west of the USA and an Indian model of new female-centred households for
   single women. Heterosexuality as an institution and gender subordination
   more broadly, as the examples here indicate, have to do not only with
   sexual practices or identity but extend also to issues of labour and
   access to crucial resources.},

Abstract = {China has experienced remarkable economic growth since the
   transformation of its economy in the late 1980s, but its wage growth is
   comparatively slower. China's income inequality has simultaneously
   intensified, which can be observed on many dimensions. Such uneven
   distribution between urban and rural residents and among individuals in
   general has a negative impact on consumer demand, which influences
   China's trade patterns and economic growth. This article argues that
   China's economic growth could be sustained along with growing consumer
   demand through a narrowing of its income gap and the establishment of a
   social security network.},

Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {66},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {It is undoubtedly true that social media such as Facebook and Twitter
   are influencing the ways in which politicians engage the public, no
   longer hostage to the gatekeeping proclivities of traditional media, but
   now able to broadcast their messages to anyone who wants to hear them.
   On the public's side, we can now follow politicians who are on Twitter
   or have a Facebook fan page, comment on their tweets and posts, and send
   them messages directly. So far, so democratic. But how many of us
   actually do more than just read posts and tweets and how many
   politicians do more than just inform us about their activities?
   Crucially, do politicians use social media in ways that enhance
   opportunities for dialogue between them and us? To explore these
   questions further in relation to politicians' Facebook behaviours, we
   interviewed New Zealand Members of Parliament about their motivations
   for using social media and their attitudes on such media's effectiveness
   as a political communication tool in the context of a general election
   campaign. Our findings suggest that despite their talk of citizen
   engagement, most politicians use social media as means of distributing
   information (one-way flow) and to make themselves both visible and hip'
   to the public. While cautiously optimistic about the role of social
   media in the lives of citizens, Members of Parliament also suggest that
   social media must be complementary to, and thus incorporated in, a
   broad-based communications strategy, rather than be seen as a
   replacement for traditional campaign activities.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In country after country, economic voting analysts have found that
   voters react sociotropically rather than egotropically. However, in a
   series of papers Nannestad and Paldam have found the exact opposite
   result for Danish voters - a result which challenges the scope
   conditions of economic voting. Changing only a few minor aspects of
   Nannestad and Paldam's design, including the introduction of a standard
   sociotropic item in their models, though, reproduces the standard
   result: strong sociotropic and weak egotropic effects. The challenging
   results thus seem to be methodological artefacts; a finding that
   strengthens confidence in the generalizability of the basic mechanism of
   economic voting. Voters are not necessarily altruists, however.
   Sociotropic voting may be driven by both egoistic and altruistic
   considerations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The outcome of the assembly elections held in November 2013 in Madhya
   Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Delhi could possibly be summarized
   in one sentence: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) retained Madhya Pradesh
   and Chhattisgarh, and the incumbent Indian National Congress (INC) lost
   power in Rajasthan and Delhi. It was a 4-0 defeat for the Congress. What
   explains the Congress' rout in these four states? Moreover, why did the
   BJP do well? And how did a new political outfit-Aam Aadmi Party
   (AAP)-manage a stunning debut in Delhi within a year of its formation?
   Using data from the pre-poll and post-poll surveys from the above
   mentioned states, we find that there was a visible dissatisfaction with
   the Congress-led UPA government at the centre and that led to the
   party's debacle during the elections. We suggest that the interaction of
   two variables-temporal proximity of state assembly elections to Lok
   Sabha elections and nature of party competition in the state-determines
   when national-level factors would play important role in influencing
   electoral outcomes in state elections.},

   its degeneration into an oligarchic ruling regime. Also the management
   of the collective imagination for social control and how the lack of
   democratic mechanisms to achieve a framework of peaceful coexistence is
   exposed, creating an atmosphere of lawlessness and social conflict. We
   conclude with factors that may reverse these phenomena, which must be

Volume = {37},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {How does a sudden electoral upset affect the dynamics in the spatial
   distribution of votes? This article approaches the question in the
   context of Finnish parliamentary elections in 2007 and 2011 by exploring
   whether the exceptional success of a nationalist-populist True Finns
   Party (PS) in 2011 changed some of the fundamentals in the traditional
   stronghold areas of other parties. A totally new stronghold area did not
   emerge as the electoral support of PS was geographically extremely
   evenly distributed. The findings contradict with the conventional wisdom
   that nationalist-populist parties have a potential clientele on
   restricted geographic areas. It was tested whether the True Finns
   dominated areas were characterised by such social structural macro-level
   characteristics that have typically explained the popularity of radical
   right populist parties elsewhere in Western Europe. These factors, such
   as unemployment and a high number of immigrants, did not match the case
   of True Finns at aggregate level, although the success of PS has been
   furthered by the same phenomena that have fostered radical right
   populist parties elsewhere. This article illuminates how PS managed to
   penetrate into geographically and social structurally in very different
   kinds of areas. PS had an appeal on the political left, centre and
   right, which are successful in different kinds of political
   environments. The big bang victory' of True Finns was not an earthquake
   emerging in a certain political landscape, but a political protest
   throughout Finland. The article shows just how important the national
   context is in ecological analyses of party support.},

Abstract = {Individual-level studies of partisan and ideological change find that
   individuals generally adjust their ideological preferences to match
   their partisan affiliation. In examining this process among the state
   electorates, we find that contrary to these studies, states have
   adjusted their partisanship to match their ideology. In addition, we use
   a measure of state elite ideology to show that state parties have a role
   in the character of the partisan sort of the states. These results are
   consistent with political explanations of party strategy and rational
   mass responses for the character of macro-political change in the states
   over the last half century.},

Abstract = {In Scotland, as in the rest of the UK, there is growing recognition that
   prior qualifications may not provide an adequate indication of the
   `potential' of applicants from educationally-disadvantaged backgrounds
   to succeed at university. Universities are being encouraged to use
   contextual data on neighbourhood characteristics and school performance
   to identify disadvantaged applicants in the admissions process.
   Contextualised admissions have been pioneered at the University of
   Edinburgh since 2004, and this article reports findings on the prior
   qualifications, retention and degree outcomes of a sample of students
   who entered the University in 2004-2006. The article describes the
   distribution of contextual data and discusses the limitations of
   indicators based on geographical area and school characteristics.
   Differences in average prior qualifications, retention and degree
   outcomes associated with indicators of widening participation are small.
   Statistical models suggest that after taking account of prior
   qualifications WP-indicated students were as likely to complete an HE
   qualification and achieve an Honours degree as non-WP students, but
   theyhad a lower probability of achieving a higher classification of
   degree. The findings raise questions for the University about possible
   causes for lower achievement by disadvantaged students.},

Title = {Party members as an electoral linking mechanism: An election forecasting
   model for political parties in Belgium, 1981-2010},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {368-380},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {While party membership figures are clearly in decline in several Western
   countries, different interpretations have been offered on the likely
   consequences of this trend. Some authors stress that members have lost
   most of their importance for political parties that increasingly rely on
   professionalized campaign techniques. Other scholars have expressed
   concern about the decline of party membership. They emphasize the fact
   that party members continue to function as an important linkage
   mechanism providing a structural alignment between the party and society
   (and thus also to potential voters). By means of an election forecasting
   model for Belgium, we test whether party membership figures can still be
   related to election results. Results show that party membership has a
   strong effect on election results and, furthermore, that this relation
   does not weaken during the period under investigation (1981-2010). The
   analysis also demonstrates that forecasting models can also be used in a
   complex multiparty system like that of Belgium.},

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles, also known as drones, have become a central
   feature of American foreign policy, with over 400 strikes in Pakistan,
   Somalia, and Yemen in the last decade. Despite criticisms that have
   arisen about ethics and legality of this policy, polls have registered
   high levels of public support for drone strikes. This article shows that
   the standard formulation of poll questions takes as a given the
   government's controversial claims about combatant status and source of
   legal authorization. I conduct a survey experiment that evaluates how
   varying the terms of the debate -in particular whether the strikes are
   compatible with international humanitarian law (IHL) and have legal
   authorization - affects public support for the drone policy. Treatments
   that incorporated contested assumptions about IHL meaningfully decreased
   public support while the public was less moved by questions about
   domestic or international legal authorization.},

Abstract = {Institutional innovations in conflict management have received
   considerable academic attention in the past decades. Yet few studies
   have considered the design of referendums in peace processes and the
   role of popular mandates in catalysing negotiated settlements. Drawing
   evidence from divided societies, particularly the contrasting cases of
   South Africa and Cyprus, the article points to the importance of
   ratification sequence and early mandate referendums. Specifically, it
   demonstrates how mandate referendums focusing initially on domestic
   constituencies enable leaders to pre-empt ethnic outbidding challenges
   while concluding a peace agreement. An early ratification process could
   safeguard the peace process from unavoidable reversals in public
   opinion, increase flexibility as to the timing of critical decisions and
   maximise the credibility of leaders aiming for a negotiated settlement.
   The study of mandate referendums has important implications for broader
   research on international mediations since it suggests mechanisms by
   which political actors could ensure the ratification of significant
   treaties in global or regional politics.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the links between migrant illegalization and
   precarious status migrants' temporal orientations. I begin by evaluating
   research on three research orientations in this area: (1) research that
   focuses on temporal contingency versus temporal teleology; (2) research
   about immigration status, illegalization, and time; and (3) research on
   the link between precarious immigration status and precarious work. I
   then draw on interviews with 13 Mexican migrants with precarious
   immigration status to discuss how immigration status affects migrants'
   ability to make plans, secure decent work, and experience a sense of
   belonging in the context of reception (Toronto, Canada). I conclude by
   arguing for a framework of temporal contingency when analyzing
   precarious status migrants' narratives of temporal orientations.},

Title = {Reconciling Family Roles with Political Ambition: The New Normal for

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {76},
Number = {2},
Pages = {398-414},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Based on data from the 2011 Citizen Political Ambition Study-a national
   survey of nearly 4,000 ``potential candidates{''} for all levels of
   office-we provide the first thorough analysis of the manner in which
   traditional family arrangements affect the initial decision to run for
   office. Our findings reveal that traditional family dynamics do not
   account for the gender gap in political ambition. Neither marital and
   parental status, nor the division of labor pertaining to household tasks
   and child care, predicts potential candidates' political ambition. This
   is not to downplay the fact that the gender gap in political ambition
   remains substantial and static or that traditional family roles affect
   whether women make it into the candidate eligibility pool in the first
   place. But it is to suggest that family arrangements are not a primary
   factor explaining why female potential candidates exhibit lower levels
   of political ambition than do men. Because women remain less likely than
   men to exhibit political ambition even in the face of stringent
   controls, the lack of explanatory power conferred by family arrangements
   highlights that other barriers to women's emergence as candidates
   clearly merit continued investigation.},

Abstract = {This article highlights the contribution of randomized, quantitative
   sampling techniques to answering qualitative questions posed by the
   study. In short it asks: what qualitative insights do we derive from
   quantitative sampling processes? Rather than simply being a means to an
   end, I argue the sampling process itself generated data. More
   specifically, seeking out more than 220 geographically dispersed
   individuals, selected though a randomized cluster sample, resulted in
   the identification of relationship patterns, highlighted extant
   resistance-era hierarchies and patronage networks, as well as
   necessitated deeper, critical engagement with the sampling framework.
   While this discussion is focused on the study of former resistance
   members in Timor-Leste, these methodological insights are broadly
   relevant to researchers using mixed methods to study former combatants
   or other networked social movements.},

Abstract = {Presidential candidates in the United States do not intentionally
   advertise in states without rigorous competition for electoral votes.
   However, in some areas of noncompetitive states, media markets overlap
   with battleground states, exposing these regions to political ads. These
   spillover advertisements allow us to examine the relationship between
   advertisements and individual campaign contributions, with data from the
   Wisconsin Advertising Project and the Federal Elections Commission.
   Using propensity-score matching within uncontested states, we find that
   2008 aggregate giving in zip codes exposed to political ads was
   approximately \$6,100 (28.1\% of mean contributions) more than in
   similar zip codes without advertisements.},

Abstract = {There have been two periods in American political development where
   governors and their particular brand of politics have held sway in the
   White House. The first period, occurring during the Progressive Era, was
   marked by presidents like Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, who
   brought their state-honed reform agendas with them to the presidency.
   Three-quarters of a century later, their push for greater federal
   authority over big business, machine politics, and ineffective direction
   of public policy at the local level, was met by fierce resistance from a
   different breed of governor-presidents. Hailing from the Sunbelt, these
   governors sought to overturn the ``Hudson{''} progressive model. The
   conservative (and at times moderate) presidential politics of Ronald
   Reagan, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush exemplified a brand of outsider
   governance dedicated to ending ``big government.{''} Among their
   accomplishments was the confirmation of the American governorship as a
   distinctly powerful institution for shaping presidential behavior. This
   article examines this latter cohort of governor-presidents and the
   meaning they brought to ``outsider{''} politics.},

Abstract = {State aid rules of the European Union regulate member states' subsidies
   to industry and grant the European Commission extensive powers to
   monitor compliance with these rules. Until the 1980s, the Commission was
   reluctant to use these powers and state aid control in the Community
   remained weak. Since then, its control over member state aid has
   increased gradually, resulting in more extensive investigative powers,
   and on average, lower levels of state aid in the EU. In this article, I
   argue that the European Commission's strategic framing of the state aid
   issue played a significant role in the transformation of the policy in
   the late 1980s and the 1990s. As a policy entrepreneur, the Commission
   framed the issue of state aids in relation to market integration in the
   1980s and the Economic and Monetary Union in the 1990s, and thus helped
   shape the interests of the member states and economic actors and paved
   the way for the gradual tightening of state aid control.},

Abstract = {This article deals with analyzing the arguments which have been used in
   the debates in Iceland about municipal amalgamations for a period of
   seventy years. Both the arguments of the pre-side and the against-side
   are analysed. The frame for analysis used are definitions on efficiency,
   capacity and democracy in connection with the question of municipal
   size, done by the Danish political scientists Ulrik Kjar and Poul Erik
   Mouritzen. The main results of the analysis is that a) efficiency, b)
   administrative capacity, c) functional-and developmental capacity, d)
   implementation capacity and e) the ability to adapt to socio-economic
   changes, are the main arguments used by the pre-side, especially the
   ones about efficiency and administrative capacity. The most significant
   arguments from those against amalgations have been arguments on
   democracy, a) negative consequences for democracy by territory and by
   functions and b) negative consequences for democracy due to the loss of
   important elements of participation and closeness in the small context.},

Abstract = {Chechen, Abkhazian, and Circassian peoples, including those who had to
   immigrate to the Ottoman Empire, still remember the difficult and
   painful times faced in the Northern Caucasus under Czarist Russian rule.
   In particular, those communities that immigrated to Ottoman lands have
   impacted Russia-Turkey relations following the Cold War. The 2014 Sochi
   Olympic Games in Russia was an opportunity for these historical events
   to be brought to the attention of the world. This article provides an
   overview of the history of the Northern Caucasian peoples' resistance
   against Russian rulers, and analyzes the role of Circassian, Chechen,
   Abkhazian, and Georgian diaspora groups in Turkey's foreign policy
   decision-making toward Russia. The author argues that the role of the
   Circassian diaspora in contemporary Turkish foreign policy has been
   diminishing as Turkey's relations with Georgia and Russia have
   strengthened.},

Abstract = {Are female candidates disproportionately punished for relying on
   negative campaign ads? While scholars agree that sponsoring negativity
   works against traditional gender stereotypes, it is less clear how
   relying on negativity affects voter evaluations of female candidates. In
   this manuscript we reconsider the relationship between candidate gender
   and negativity. Relying on theories of conditional stereotype use, we
   argue that negative ads translate to significantly poorer evaluations
   for the female candidate when two conditions are met: (1) the female
   candidate is perceived as the instigator of negativity and (2) she is of
   a different party than the voter. We test our predictions using an
   experiment and show that female candidates only face a disproportionate
   punishment for relying on negativity under our two specific conditions.
   In contrast, voters are much more forgiving when they believe that a
   female candidate simply followed her opponent's lead in using negative
   ads or when negativity is used to promote the voter's party. While our
   research suggests that-compared to their male counterparts-female
   candidates do face some added constraints, our findings have broader
   implications. Not only are voters more or less likely to use gender
   stereotypes under certain conditions, but these conditions are highly
   dependent on the campaign context.},

Abstract = {The paper analyzes developments on the Croatian television market during
   the last decade, focusing specially on the changes that have been taking
   place since 2009 and their effect on the diversity and pluralism of the
   current television programs. The study presents the data on the
   structural diversity of the Croatian television market which reached its
   peak in the second decade of the 21st century, as the processes of
   privatization and commercialization had been completed. The research
   includes data and the analysis of the television audience distribution
   during last several years, showing the major change regarding the
   position of the public service broadcaster which occurred during that
   time. Content pluralism and diversity of the television programs were
   analyzed using the data on the genres structure of the main national
   broadcasters, one public and two commercial, with the emphasis on the
   news and current affairs genres as well as the other high social value
   programs regarded as the content in the public interest. The genres
   structures and distribution in the overall national television program
   output were put in the relation to the genres audience ratings, showing
   the gap between the ``supply{''} of the programs offering content in the
   public interest and the audience ``demand{''} expressed by their total
   audience share, which could be considered as the guideline for the media
   policy and regulation.
   In the conclusion, the potential of the television pluralism and
   diversity as the possible tool to enhance the democratic functions of
   the media in Croatia are pointed out, as well as the need for further
   audience research which would explore complex relation between genres
   and audience expectations, needs and choices.},

Abstract = {The collapse of sclerotic and dysfunctional one-party regimes in central
   and eastern Europe, associated with the end of the USSR, and in parts of
   the Balkans, with the death of President Tito of Yugoslavia in 1980, was
   followed by violence and war, which brought the region to the world's
   attention. These events, and inevitably the historical causes, were and
   still are interpreted to an international audience, largely through a
   global media, over which Balkan countries have limited influence.
   Todorova (Slavic Review 53(2): 453-452, 1994, 2009, 1997) identified a
   trend or convention in these interpretations which was largely negative,
   which she called `Balkanism', and which was at least partly constructed
   `from the outside' (1994, p. 445). She argued that our knowledge of the
   Balkans is mediated through a distorting lens: we see it as a dark
   `other'. By contrast, national museums funded by national governments
   would seem to offer a channel through which the states in the region
   might be able to tell their own stories, in their own way. This survey
   of national museums attempts to map these stories against specific
   aspects of Balkanism. Are they complicit in its construction, or do they
   run counter to or align with it? It is argued that the key elements of
   these displays counter some aspects of Balkanism but align with it or
   reinforce it in other ways.},

Abstract = {Demographic changes and the stakes for both democracy and immigrants
   themselves make the political incorporation of immigrants a key
   political issue in the USA today. Two structural features of American
   politics help with political incorporation by providing multiple
   opportunities for political activity: federalism with its enormous
   number of state and local government elections and offices, and the
   permeable character of political parties. Naturalization, voter
   registration, and political participation are central to the political
   incorporation of immigrants, and we argue that historically and still
   today, political parties are the key institutions charged with political
   incorporation in the USA. Parties' goal in the political incorporation
   of immigrants should be to create long-term partisans, not just to
   naturalize immigrants and create voters in the next election.
   Partisanship has noninstrumental significance as well. As political
   identity and practice, partisanship has a good claim to earning
   immigrants' recognition as citizens, and a distinctive claim to
   achieving incorporation in a moral register. We conclude that
   partisanship stands out from movement and protest politics, advocacy,
   and even voting per se as a form of political incorporation.},
