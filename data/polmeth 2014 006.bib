Abstract = {Using supervised learning techniques to code newspaper articles on the
   Minerals Resource Rent Tax (originally known as the Resources Super
   Profits Tax), this article analyses sources of partiality and emphasis
   in media coverage of the issue. It shows that opponents were more
   successful in airing their views in the opening stages of the debate,
   but the government's re-branding led to more favourable media coverage.
   There was a regional bias, however, with newspapers in states dominated
   by mining interests more critical than newspapers from other states. The
   only truly national newspaper (the Australian) was notable for having
   fewer `neutral' articles, with a relatively high number of both negative
   and positive articles. The Australian Financial Review, meanwhile, had a
   greater number of neutral articles. Framing remained homogenous over
   time though variable across publications.},

Abstract = {We investigate the problem of motivating terrorist operatives for
   suicide missions and conventional terrorist attacks when operatives have
   either self-interested or social preferences that are not observable by
   the terrorist organization. We characterize the screening mechanism for
   selecting operatives according to their social preferences and determine
   under what conditions a terrorist group will prefer to utilize suicide
   versus conventional tactics. For example, when operatives are
   intrinsically motivated and likely to be represented in the pool of
   potential recruits, a terrorist organization will be more likely to
   employ suicide attacks as its sole tactic of choice.},

Title = {Calibrating Our ``Inner Compass{''}: Arendt on Thinking and the Dangers
   of Disorientation},
Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {42},
Number = {5},
Pages = {519-542},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In this article, I argue that Heidegger's political failures haunt
   Arendt's complex phenomenology of thinking, and, in the words of Richard
   Bernstein, Arendt's most novel and striking thesisthat there is an
   intrinsic connection between our ability or inability to think and
   evildepends on discriminating the thinking that may prevent catastrophes
   from the thinking that does not. The key to doing so, I suggest, is to
   attend more closely to Arendt's persistent use of the language of
   stabilization, orientation, and navigation: in other words, how we take
   our bearings in a world of perpetual change and motion. The ability (or
   inability) to locate oneself in relation to the world is a recurrent
   theme in Arendt's writings, and the metaphors of (dis)orientation appear
   frequently in her attempts to understand totalitarianism and Heidegger's
   turn to National Socialism. Whereas most theorists collapse the idea of
   taking our bearings into judging, I argue that the activity of
   orientation should be theorized in its own right. As such, I explore the
   disorientation experienced during the traversal between thinking and
   acting via a close reading of Heidegger's Conversation on a Country Path
   About Thinking. My reading illustrates how certain elements of the
   world, crucial to maintaining our bearings, fade from view while one is
   thinking. I conclude by discussing representative thinking as an
   explicitly political mode of thought that escapes some of the
   difficulties inherent in pure thinkingshowing how it shores up those
   elements of the world that enable us to take our bearings.},

Title = {Welfare migration? Free movement of EU citizens and access to social
   benefits},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {1},
Number = {3},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the political impact of the European Court of
   Justice's (ECJ) case law concerning the free movement of EU citizens and
   their cross-border access to social benefits. Public debates about
   `welfare migration' or `social tourism' often fluctuate between populist
   hysteria and outright denial, but they obscure the real political and
   legal issues at stake: that ECJ jurisprudence incrementally broadens EU
   citizens' opportunities to claim social benefits abroad while narrowing
   member states' scope to regulate and restrict access to national welfare
   systems. We argue that legal uncertainty challenges national
   administrations in terms of workload and rule-of-law standards, while
   domestic legislative reforms increasingly shift the burden of legal
   uncertainty to EU migrants by raising evidentiary requirements and
   threatening economically inactive EU citizens with expulsion. We
   illustrate this argument first with a brief overview of the EU's legal
   framework, highlighting the ambiguity of core concepts from the Court's
   case law, and then with empirical evidence from the UK, Germany and
   Austria, analyzing similar domestic responses to the ECJ's
   jurisprudence. We conclude that EU citizenship law, while promising to
   build the union from below on the basis of equal legal entitlements,
   may, in fact, risk rousing further nationalism and decrease solidarity
   across the union.},

Abstract = {A generalized distrust in Mexican local elections raises the question of
   whether electoral corruption has vanished or remains a prevalent
   practice in the country. To answer this question, I analyze the 2010
   gubernatorial elections, exploiting a feature of the country's electoral
   system: within each electoral precinct, voters are assigned to polling
   stations according to their childhood surname. Consequently, the only
   difference between voters in contiguous polling stations should be their
   last names. Given that political preferences are seldom correlated with
   voters' names, I use suspicious differences in turnout levels across
   contiguous polling stations to identify fraudulent practices. The
   findings of this article indicate that nondemocratic enclaves that
   actively obstruct the completion of Mexico's democratic transition still
   remain today.},

Abstract = {Despite what many Americans believe, there is little evidence that
   increased campaign negativity has contributed to the loss of public
   trust in government in recent decades. In this article, we consider the
   relationship between negative campaigning and trust in a different
   light. The ``figure-ground hypothesis{''} suggests that negative
   information is more likely than positive information to shape people's
   attitudes and behavior, in part because negativity ``stands out{''} in a
   world where most of us have positive expectations of others.
   Accordingly, we posit that negative campaign ads are most effective
   among those who possess a high level of trust in their political
   leaders. The catch is that high trust is uncommon in U.S. politics
   today, in which case negative appeals may play to a smaller audience
   than in the past. Our data indicate, however, that a well-conceived
   negative campaign ad can influence voter choice regardless of one's
   feelings about government.},

Abstract = {Children are more likely to adopt their family's political views when
   politics is important to their parents, and the children of politically
   engaged parents tend to become politically engaged adults. When these
   transmission dynamics are considered together, an important hypothesis
   follows: the children who are most likely to initially acquire the
   political views of their parents are also most likely to later abandon
   them as a result of their own engagement with the political world. Data
   from the Political Socialisation Panel Study provide support for this
   hypothesis, illuminate its observational implications and shed light on
   the mechanisms, pointing to the role of new social contexts, political
   issues and salient political events. Replications using different data
   from the US and the UK confirm that this dynamic is generalizable to
   different cohorts and political periods.},

Abstract = {Many citizens abstain from the political process, and the reasons for
   this abstention are of great interest and importance. Most scholars and
   pundits assume that greater electoral competition and the increased
   chance of pivotality will motivate citizens to participate. We test this
   hypothesis through a large-scale field experiment that exploits the rare
   opportunity of a tied election for major political office. Informing
   citizens that an upcoming election will be close has little mobilizing
   effect. Any effect that we do detect is concentrated among a small set
   of frequent voters. The evidence suggests that increased pivotality is
   not a solution to low turnout and the predominant models of turnout
   focusing on pivotality are of little practical use.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Volume = {76},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {How durable are politicians' policymaking reputations with the
   electorate? A theory of reputation depreciation is advanced to explain
   why the electorate's capacity to hold former officeholders accountable
   for prior economic stewardship is weakening not only in the time elapsed
   between prior elective office and seeking subsequent elective office,
   but also diminishing at a greater rate as the evaluative window for
   making retrospective economic assessments widens. Aggregate electoral
   data on ex-governors in the American states suggests that while prior
   economic stewardship evaluated over entire tenure in office for
   ex-governors offer the strongest initial retrospective economic
   attributions, it also yields the greatest rate of reputation
   depreciation for ex-governors seeking future elective office.
   Reputational slippage transpires with the passage of time between prior
   elective office and returning to the electoral arena, whereby voters
   experience increasing difficulty when it comes to rewarding competent
   experienced politicians, as well as sanctioning their incompetent
   counterparts.},

Abstract = {The last decade has witnessed renewed interest in the concept of
   political generations and the role of generations in foreign and
   domestic politics. The purpose of this article is to discuss a number of
   patterns and insights concerning political generations in American
   politics that derive from my own research in international relations. In
   pursuit of this goal, I summarize a theory of political generations and
   explain how it was applied empirically. In the second half of the essay,
   I discuss what generational analysis might tell us about the study of
   political change and stability, the presidency, voters, social
   movements, parties, and bureaucracies. Finally, I briefly engage the
   methodological problems that can arise from the fact that political
   generations are in important respects socially constructed through
   public discourses, in the context of the work on the ``Millennial
   Generation{''} conducted by the Pew Research Center. While this article
   can only suggest patterns and initial ideas for further development and
   research, the hope is that it will help to push forward research on
   political generations across disciplinary sub-fields.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {1},

Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {How does regionalization affect national social policies? Although there
   is an extensive literature on the effects of globalization on social
   protection, the literature on the impact of regional integration is much
   less developed. I argue that the distinctive nature of regionalization
   processes calls for rigorous empirical testing of the domestic policy
   effects of regional integration. To this end, using an innovative
   dataset that measures the degree to which countries are integrated into
   regional economic and political organizations, this article uses
   statistical analysis to consider the influence of regional integration
   on government social spending. The results are surprising:
   regionalization has a significant and positive relationship with
   government social spending, controlling for other factors, even when the
   European Union countries are excluded from the analysis. In fact, in the
   EU countries increasing regionalization is associated with lower social
   spending levels. These results suggest that regional economic and
   political integration does not necessarily lead to a ``race to the
   bottom{''} of social spending. Instead, regionalization appears to
   accommodate wide divergence in national social policy commitments.},

Journal = {INTEREST GROUPS \& ADVOCACY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3},
Pages = {293-314},

Abstract = {Political scientists have long tried to explain how interest group
   lobbying and political action committee campaign donations affect
   election outcomes and public policy debates. Unfortunately, they are
   often met with null or conflicting results. Consequently, scholars have
   tested the influence of campaign donations on Congressional outcomes in
   different parts of the policy-making process, such as roll call votes
   and committee hearings. Building on these findings, I use the adoption
   of a Marcellus Shale impact fee in Pennsylvania to test whether campaign
   contributions have a different effect on bill amendment roll call votes
   than final floor votes. Given the differing political contexts of these
   two votes, it stands to reason that there is variation in the
   relationship between campaign donations and member voting behavior.
   Specifically, I expect that legislators have more flexibility in voting
   on amendments than on final bills, and thus factors other than party,
   including campaign funding, are also relevant. I find that while party,
   ideology and tenure are the only significant factors associated with
   roll call votes on final bills, campaign contributions and local-level
   salience are positively associated with voting on amendments. This shows
   that while moneyed interests may not be successful in stopping
   undesirable legislation, they can achieve legislative victory by shaping
   the bill as it travels through the legislature.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {1},
Number = {3},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {The enactment and implementation of European Union Directives on
   antidiscrimination have received substantial scholarly attention.
   However, there is little knowledge about whether and how
   antidiscrimination measures influence citizens' experiences and
   perceptions of discrimination. This study investigates the relationship
   between antidiscrimination policies, citizens' knowledge in this policy
   area, and their handling of discrimination. Using data from a
   standardized policy indicator and repeated cross-sectional survey waves
   of EU countries, I first examine the relationship between
   antidiscrimination policy and societal levels of knowledge about
   victims' rights. Subsequently, multilevel models test how differences in
   policy and knowledge levels predict individuals' reported levels of
   experienced and perceived discrimination. The results show that people
   who live in countries with effective antidiscrimination laws know more
   about their rights to equal treatment than those from countries with
   less effective policies. For the most part, policy differences across
   countries are unsystematically related to discrimination-related
   outcomes. However, an increase in knowledge levels over time is
   associated with higher reports about witnessed discrimination, lower
   sociotropic perceptions of discrimination, and less individual
   self-identification with a discriminated group. The findings suggest
   that, to the extent that antidiscrimination policies foster knowledge of
   the law, they contribute to citizens' awareness and empowerment against
   discrimination.},

Abstract = {Securing executive attention for new policy demands is notoriously
   difficult as governmental agendas are crowded by established or `core'
   policy issues. This article investigates whether it is harder for new
   and costly policy issues to reach the government agenda when the economy
   is performing badly. It examines whether, and the extent to which,
   costly gender equality issues regarding women's access to the labour
   market, equal treatment at work and care activities, are more likely to
   achieve executive attention when the economy is performing well. Using
   the Comparative Policy Agendas database, a systematic, quantitative
   analysis is conducted of when and why policies promoting sex equality in
   the division of labour reach executive agendas. The findings confirm
   that advocacy for costly gender equality measures is easier to make in
   times of economic growth. It is also found that female representation in
   parliament strengthens advocacy for executive attention and reduces
   friction on policy agenda change.},

   the many attempts to negotiate a ``federal solution'' have failed. Our
   argument is that dyadic federations have inherent flaws that make them
   difficult to operate successfully, and even if the two communities could
   somehow be persuaded to form such a union, it would not be viable as a

Abstract = {European Commission expert groups provide powerful platforms from which
   interest organisations can steer the EU consultation process and weigh
   in on policy outcomes. Commission decision-makers and bureaucrats rely
   heavily on expert groups to provide expert policy advice on highly
   technical issues in the early stages of the policymaking process.
   Interest organisations provide this advice in order to have their voices
   heard at the EU level. But whose interests are being represented in
   these expert groups? Which types of interest organisations, in other
   words, get a seat at the table and why? This article, using data on over
   800 expert groups and nearly 3,000 interest organisations, argues that
   expert group membership is largely a function of superior resources,
   EU-level interests and existing institutionalised ties to
   decision-makers. Far from simply addressing the Commission's need for
   expertise, expert group membership is more a story of capital and
   capture.},

Title = {The impact of candidate name order on election outcomes in North Dakota},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {35},
Pages = {115-122},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A number of studies have explored the possibility that the ordering of
   candidates' names on the ballot might influence how those candidates
   perform on election day. Strong evidence of an order effect comes from
   investigations of election returns in states that implemented
   quasi-random assignment of candidate name orders to voters. Although
   most such studies have identified benefits for earlier-listed
   candidates, much of the evidence comes from a limited set of elections
   in only a handful of states. This paper expands our understanding of
   order effects to 31 general elections held in North Dakota between 2000
   and 2006; these include all state-wide races involving 2 candidates. A
   primacy effect appeared in 80\% of the contests. The first ballot
   position reaped the largest benefits in nonpartisan contests and in
   presidential election years. These findings are consistent with earlier
   studies from other states and provide evidence in line with proposals
   that a lack of information and ambivalence underlie candidate name order
   effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We surveyed Iowa caucus goers and other Republicans to assess how
   representative the 2012 caucuses were of Republicans in Iowa. We find
   that demographically and ideologically, people reporting they would
   attend the caucus were quite similar to self-identified Iowa Republicans
   who said they would not caucus. We then model outcomes in Iowa and New
   Hampshire as a function of mass media expectations and find the model
   predicts Mitt Romney's Iowa vote share well but underpredicts Rick
   Santorum's Iowa result substantially. As in previous elections, we find
   national media attention shifted to a candidate (Santorum) who the media
   overlooked prior to Iowa and that this likely made Santorum's eventual
   second-place finish possible. Romney strengthened his front-runner share
   of media attention by meeting expectations in Iowa and then winning New
   Hampshire. This study confirms research documenting the important
   influence that early states have in the nomination process.},

Abstract = {This article engages Germano's film and essay. The author lauds the
   fundamental thrust of the essay towards achieving scholarly recognition
   for film projects based on scholarly research. At the same time, the
   author questions Germano's sharp opposition between analytic and
   documentary films. He appraises The Other Side of Immigration very
   favorably, while pointing out that the aesthetic choices and the power
   of the testimonies do not fall neatly within the categories established
   by Germano. The author then discusses his own experiences in conjoining
   historical research and documentary filmmaking.},

Abstract = {At every stage of the conflict in Ukraine, from the Euromaidan to the
   crisis triggered by Russia's annexation of the Crimea and to the war in
   the Donbas, the parties to the conflict have resorted to history and
   concepts of history. Some speak of Cossack traditions of freedom, others
   of the ``defensive struggle against fascism{''} or of Novorossiia. This
   is supposed to mobilize support, to legitimize political and military
   action, and to create identity. These assertions do not stand up to
   scrutiny. But those who seek to distinguish historical facts from
   manipulation and propaganda need in-depth knowledge. East European
   history as a discipline has a lot of catching up to do in researching
   and teaching of Ukrainian history.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to describe and analyze people's confidence in
   political institutions in the so-called BRICS countries, that is,
   Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. I argue that the quality
   of macroeconomic indicators cannot explain the variation in political
   confidence between the five most dynamic new emerging economies, and
   that there is no substantial difference among the young, middle-aged,
   and senior-aged groups. By combing data from the Asia Barometer Survey
   and the World Value Survey, I provide two complementary approaches, one
   sociocultural and the other micropolitical, to reveal the factors that
   influence people's confidence in four major political institutions. The
   explanatory effects of these two approaches are mixed. Political
   identity and values, inmost cases, have a significant impact on
   political confidence. On the other hand, high levels of interpersonal
   social trust, individual happiness, and satisfaction with living
   standards also show positive influences.},

Abstract = {This paper offers a comparative analysis of the theories concerning the
   Islamic State as elaborated by al-Nahda and Hizb al-Tahrir, the two
   largest Islamist parties in post-revolutionary Tunisia. Through the
   reconstruction of the political philosophy that represents the backdrop
   to the respective state models, this essay inscribes the ongoing debate
   upon the Islamic state, that sparkled in Tunisia after the fall of the
   former regime, within the wider academic debate on post-Islamism,
   starting from its definition provided by Oliver Roy. The theoretical
   analysis is also supported by the analysis of the empirical behavior
   held by the two parties at different stages of democratic transition.
   Connecting theory and praxis, this essay defines if and how both Hizb
   al-Tahrir and al-Nahda are willing to change their theoretical
   elaborations, moderating their own agendas for gaining electoral
   support.},

   voters are for the country's westward course. Russian policy contributed
   to this consolidation of Ukrainian society in that it largely
   discredited the pro-Russia orientation in Ukraine by annexing the Crimea

Abstract = {Examining an original dataset of more than 8,500 antislavery petitions
   sent to Congress (18331845), we argue that American women's petition
   canvassing conferred skills and contacts that empowered their later
   activism. We find that women canvassers gathered 50\% or more signatures
   (absolute and per capita) than men while circulating the same petition
   requests in the same locales. Supplementary evidence (mainly
   qualitative) points to women's persuasive capacity and network building
   as the most plausible mechanisms for this increased efficacy. We then
   present evidence that leaders in the women's rights and reform campaigns
   of the nineteenth century were previously active in antislavery
   canvassing. Pivotal signers of the Seneca Falls Declaration were
   antislavery petition canvassers, and in an independent sample of
   post-Civil War activists, women were four times more likely than men to
   have served as identifiable antislavery canvassers. For American women,
   petition canvassing-with its patterns of persuasion and
   networking-shaped legacies in political argument, network formation, and
   organizing.},

   of sex and sexuality, and the universal sex / gender dichotomy as

   the process of politicization of anatomy, in response to its
   characterization as a phenomenon ``merely natural{''}. Also, review the
   contributions from the so-called gender poststructuralist epistemology
   (Sabsay, 2011). We'll finally introduce the so-called criticism from
   feminists of color in its attempts to understand that the subject of
   feminism is not merely woman even remotely universal.},

Abstract = {Coalition theories have produced arguments about the importance of party
   positions for participation in government coalitions, but have not
   connected the existing government institutions (in particular agenda
   setting) with the coalition government that will be formed. This article
   presents a veto players' approach to coalition formation, which pushes
   the logic of non-cooperative game-theoretic models one step further: we
   argue that policy positions play a significant role in coalition
   formation because governments in parliamentary systems control the
   agenda of the policymaking process. As a result, the institutions that
   regulate this policymaking process affect coalition formation. In
   particular, positional advantages that a government may have (central
   policy position of formateur, fewer parties, and small policy distances
   among coalition partners) will become more necessary as a government has
   fewer institutional agenda setting advantages at its disposal. The
   empirical tests presented in this paper corroborate these expectations
   by explicitly accounting for the conditional effects of policy positions
   and institutional agenda setting rules on one another in a set of
   multilevel logit models.},

Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},

Abstract = {This article examines the political process leading to the creation of
   the controversial `Foundation Flight, Expulsion and Reconciliation' in
   Germany. The foundation aims to establish a permanent exhibition by 2016
   showcasing the flight and expulsion of up to fifteen million Germans
   from the East following the Second World War. The foundation was the
   result of lobbying by the Federation of Expellees (BdV); it caused
   frictions in Germany's relations with its eastern neighbours and
   jeopardised Germany's reconciliation process with these states. The
   process reveals that the structure of Germany's polity, paired with
   astute alliance building and its members' rhetoric, aided the BdV's
   cause. Thus, non-state actors can utilise favourable domestic structures
   for the lack of material resources in order to maximise their lobbying
   `power'. This contributes to the growing literature on reconciliation in
   international relations which neglects domestic structures as a variable
   determining reconciliation processes in favour of more normative policy
   instruments.},

Abstract = {This article extends a recent line of research arguing that the power
   and capacity of political actors (including states) is not just the
   product of particular fixed attributes but is also the outcome of
   political relations between key interlocutors, including ideational
   relations. State elites, especially government leaders, have persisted
   with a mindset that still values the economic centrality of a large and
   complex banking sector. This way of thinking has conditioned the
   relationship between, on the one hand, the US and UK governments and, on
   the other, Wall Street and the City of London and has led to a form of
   `dysfunctional embeddedness'. Government leaders may have been able to
   win high-profile policy victories over the banking sector in the
   post-crisis period, but in accepting a large, complex and constantly
   evolving financial system with high levels of systemic risk, they have
   unwittingly placed themselves at a continuing disadvantage in the
   regulatory arena.},

   flagship journal during a 100-year span. Although it is not surprising
   that a typical political science article is difficult to read, it is
   accessible to intelligent lay readers. We found little difference in

Abstract = {This article analyzes, from a decolonial feminist perspective, some
   limits and possibilities identified in the proposal of gender
   decolonization in the Plurinational State of Bolivia from 2006 until
   2014. It also problematizes three aspects that challenge the existing
   continuum of forms of violence, colonialism, discrimination and
   subordination: i) denaturation of inferiority and servility, ii) the
   ``civilizing{''} idea demarcated by western knowledge and iii) the
   permanence of the hegemonic structures of power to appoint and regulate.
   This is done from a feminist qualitative methodology, by conducting
   interviews to key informants, this is, Aymara and Quechua indigenous
   women who held positions of power in the State, and also through
   documentary review of various publications related to the subject. The
   paper questions existing tensions and contradictions between the
   proposal made from the Andean worldview, which shows remaining
   patriarchal practices inside and outside of indigenous social
   organizations and the State.},

Abstract = {Recent studies have questioned the familiar characterization of Congress
   as unidimensional. We argue that agenda control, orchestrated through
   the House Rules Committee and other techniques, can make
   multidimensional congresses appear more unidimensional. We evaluate this
   argument by examining the relationship between measures of
   unidimensionality and various measures of party control for the House of
   Representatives from 1875 to 1997, at both the roll-call level and
   congress level. Our findings contribute to an expanding literature
   explaining why a single dimension could explain most of the variance in
   voting data, even if latent ideology is multidimensional.},

Abstract = {Proper management of government budgets ensures sustained economic

   determine the degree of financial efficiency of the public
   administration of the states that make up the Western region of Mexico.
   The main results shows that the analyzed states continue to maintain a
   strong dependence of federal resources, the most autonomous state
   followed by Queretaro Aguascalientes. Regarding the investment capacity
   to Aguascalientes and Colima is seen as the best states weighted in this
   area; Michoacan is the state with more bureaucratic cost (44.76\%)
   followed by Guanajuato (34.83\%) and Jalisco (33.32\%); while states
   that exceed 100 from the sum of these two indicators are on or are
   spending Michoacan first followed by Nayarit, Jalisco, Guanajuato and
   Zacatecas.},

Journal = {POLITICAL QUARTERLY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {85},
Number = {3},
Pages = {267-276},

Abstract = {It is often forgotten that, regardless of time or place, periods of high
   immigration are almost always periods of high anti-immigration
   sentiment. When ethnic change is rapid, driven by immigration or
   differences in ethnic natural increase, the ethnic majority often
   responds with a politics of immigration. This was true, for instance, in
   Britain in the 1960s, in the US during 1890-1925 and in interwar
   Scotland. I show that White British people in locales experiencing rapid
   ethnic change are more likely to call for lower immigration and to vote
   BNP. On the other hand, where there is already a high level of ethnic
   minorities, white opinion is less hostile to immigration: UKIP does
   poorly among whites in diverse areas. Habituation to change, typically
   within a decade, and assimilationespecially of Europeansover a
   generation reduces hostility to immigration. If the rate of ethnic
   change slows, we should therefore expect a reduction in the salience of
   immigration. Ironically, because the children of European migrants are
   more readily accepted into the ethnic majority than is the case for
   non-Europeans, a shift from EU free movement to non-European skilled
   migrants, as is advocated by UKIP, could run counter to the wishes of
   its own supporters.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Pages = {321-340},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Hume's writings, taken as a whole, address a dazzlingly broad range of
   topics. I argue that they do so as part of a coherent and interesting
   philosophical programme. While Hume's doctrine of the general point of
   view provides an attractive way of understanding the process of moral
   judgement, it raises the threat of parochialism - that is, it
   potentially makes us prey to the limitations and prejudices of our
   society. I show that Hume endorses what I call ``engaged
   cosmopolitanism'', which provides the resources to explain how we can,
   under certain circumstances, escape such parochialism. Engaged
   cosmopolitanism is the product of a particular sort of society - one
   that is open and commercial, and that governed by a system of equitable
   laws. Like Mandeville, Hume rejects the suspicion of commerce and
   ``luxury'' that was prevalent during his time. But he provides
   supporters of commercial society with a justification that does not, in
   contrast to Mandeville's writings, abandon notions of morality
   altogether. On the contrary, he makes commerce a precondition to a
   society's moral development. And he further links this development to a
   certain type of liberal political institutions, thus giving such
   institutions a moral basis.},

   Decisions},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Pages = {620-636},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The public perceives the Supreme Court to be a legal institution. This
   perception enables the Court's legitimacy-conferring function, which
   serves to increase public acceptance of its decisions. Yet, the public
   acknowledges a political aspect to the Court as well. To evaluate how
   the public responds to the different images of the Supreme Court, we
   investigate whether and how depictions of specifically partisan (e. g.,
   Republican) Court rulings shape public acceptance of its decisions while
   varying institutional, legal, and issue characteristics. Using survey
   experiments, we find that party cues and partisanship, more so than the
   imprimatur of the Court, affect public acceptance. We also find that
   polarization diminishes the effect of party cues. Attributing a decision
   to the Court does little to increase baseline acceptance or attenuate
   partisan cue effects. The Court's uniqueness, at least in terms of its
   legitimacy-conferring function, is perhaps overstated.},

Abstract = {Wilsonian idealism is one of the most influential and relevant guiding
   phylosophies of the American Foreign Policy. Its importance stays in the
   Discourse and Doctrines of the United States and other actors of the
   International Scene. This article analyze the historical evolution of
   Wilsonian idealism; showing that the actual version that
   ``Interventionist Liberals{''} and ``Third Generation
   Neoconservatives{''} have claimed as own, has deep differences with the
   original version created by President Wilson and the alternative version
   of post-Second World War. The article also exposes the resistance
   adopted by alternative ideological groups such as the ``realists{''} and
   the critics motivated by the results of that policy. Any case, the
   Wilsonian Idealism, given the actual sources of Legitimacy and the
   offical discourse of the West, will mantain its enormous influence in

Abstract = {How would you recognize a mode of participation if you see one? Owing to
   the rapid expansion of political activities in the last decades this
   question has become increasingly difficult to answer. Neither the
   development of all-embracing nominal definitions, nor deductive analyses
   of existing modes of participation seem to be helpful. In addition, the
   spread of expressive modes of participation makes it hard to avoid
   purely subjective definitions. The aim of this discussion paper is to
   develop an operational definition of political participation, which
   allows us to cover distinct conceptualizations systematically,
   efficiently and consistently. This goal can only be arrived at if the
   conventional approach of presenting nominal definitions to solve
   conceptual problems is left behind. Instead, available definitions are
   included in a set of decision rules to distinguish three main variants
   of political participation. A fourth variant is distinguished for
   non-political activities used for political purposes. Together, the four
   variants of political participation cover the whole range of political
   participation systematically without excluding any mode of political
   participation unknown yet. At the same time, the endless expansion of
   the modes of political participation in modern democracies does not
   result in an endless conceptual expansion. Implications for research and
   various examples are discussed.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {604-616},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Parties tend to be wary of candidate-centred electoral systems, which is
   one factor why the use of the Single Transferable Vote (STV) is limited
   to a few cases. One source of this wariness is that STV is thought to
   favour non-party candidates, or independents, a claim based primarily on
   the experience of Ireland. The relative absence of independents in
   Australia and Malta, the other two countries using STV for national
   elections, challenges the merits of this reasoning. This study
   re-examines the nature of this causal link using constituency-level data
   from the Irish and Australian cases. The results indicate that there is
   not a great deal of evidence to support the hypothesis that STV favours
   independents, in particular because electoral system detail can affect a
   system's ability to realize expected consequences. While constituency
   size, ballot access and ballot design affect support for independents,
   it is not always in the expected manner. This suggests that the
   non-party phenomenon is more than just a by-product of electoral system
   effects.},

Title = {Who's favored by evaluative voting? An experiment conducted during the

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {Under evaluative voting, the voter freely grades each candidate on a
   numerical scale, with the winning candidate being determined by the sum
   of the grades they receive. This paper compares evaluative voting with
   the two-round system, reporting on an experiment, conducted during the
   2012 French presidential election, which attracted 2340 participants.
   Here we show that the two-round system favors ``exclusive{''}
   candidates, that is candidates who elicit strong feelings, while
   evaluative rules favor ``inclusive{''} candidates, that is candidates
   who attract the support of a large span of the electorate. These
   differences are explained by two complementary reasons: the opportunity
   for the voter to support several candidates under evaluative voting
   rules, and the specific pattern of strategic voting under the two-round
   voting rule. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   and Queer Politics in Poland{''}},

Abstract = {While the growth of visibility of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender
   and queer (LGBTQ) political struggles in Poland, and illiberal
   neo-populist reactions to the queer presence in public space and the
   public sphere since 2004 has spawned much academic debate, there has
   been less critical discussion of LGBTQ politics in relation to class and
   neoliberalism. This article seeks to make two key contributions to
   understandings of the relationships between gender, sexuality and
   political economy. The first is recognition of the tensions and
   contradictions inherent within practices of neoliberalisation. It is
   suggested that neoliberalism can be both generative and hostile towards
   LGBTQ politics. Processes of neoliberalisation produce queer winners and
   losers, and it is suggested that if sexually progressive alternatives to
   neoliberalism are to be developed, they need to recognise the tensions
   and contradictions inherent within processes of neoliberalism. In so
   doing, the class dimensions of neoliberal sexualities need to be made
   visible and examined critically. Secondly, it is argued that discussions
   of classed sexualities are often framed within specific national
   contexts, and thereby fail to recognise the transnational dimensions of
   classed sexualities. Discussions of the sexual politics of neoliberalism
   are often grounded in Anglo-American contexts and sometimes fail to
   recognise how neoliberal sexualities are framed outside of the West.
   These two key objectives are addressed by an examination of the economic
   and class dimensions of contemporary LGBTQ political struggles in
   Poland-specifically the organisation of marches for equality and
   tolerance within Polish cities since 2001.},

Abstract = {European Union research has made great strides in understanding the
   dynamics of the European Union decision-making process. In contrast to
   this progress, the dynamics unfolding after the enactment of a European
   Union secondary legislative act has largely been ignored. Some of these
   acts remain in force in their original form for several years while
   others are revised soon after their enactment. What factors account for
   this variation? We empirically analyze the proposition that in the
   presence of legislative drift,' i.e. the intertemporal variation of
   decision-makers' preferences, major revisions of European Union
   legislative acts are more likely to occur. Based on an analysis of the
   revision histories of 158 major European Union acts in the time period
   between 1958 and 2003, we find significant support for this hypothesis.},

Abstract = {This article considers feminist politics in the context of global
   capitalist restructuring. The incorporation of liberal feminist ideas
   into the contemporary neo-liberal capitalist order of the global north
   is analyzed through an intersectional lens and in relation to the
   successful employers' assault on the working class which set the stage
   for the defeat of the radical equality demands of feminists, anti-racist
   activists, indigenous peoples and others which had flourished in the
   1960s and 1970s. In the 21st century, it is argued, in response to
   structural adjustment policies enforced by neo-liberal capitalism in
   both the global north and global south, women of the working classes
   have entered the political stage through a broad array of movements. The
   article explores how these movements are creatively developing socialist
   feminist politics. The article concludes that this socialist-feminist
   politics has much to offer the left as it gropes toward new
   organizational forms and organizing strategies.},

Abstract = {While many find cause for optimism about the use of law and rights for
   progressive ends, the academic literature has long been skeptical that
   courts favor the poor. We show that, with the move toward a robust ``new
   constitutionalism{''} of social and economic rights, the assumptions
   underlying the skepticism do not always hold. Our theories must account
   for variation in the elite bias of law and litigation. In particular, we
   need to pay closer attention to the broad, collective effects of legal
   mobilization, rather than focusing narrowly on the litigants and the
   direct benefits they receive. We support the claim by showing that
   litigation pursued in legal contexts that create the expectation of
   collective effects is more likely to avoid the potential anti-poor bias
   of courts. On the other hand, policy areas dominated by individual
   litigation and individualized effects are more likely to experience
   regressive outcomes. Using data on social and economic rights cases in
   four countries, we estimate the potential pro-poor impact of litigation
   by examining whether the poor are over or under-represented among the
   beneficiaries of litigation. We find that the impact of courts is
   positive and very much pro-poor in India and South Africa, and slightly
   negative in Indonesia and Brazil. Overall, we challenge the tendency in
   the literature to focus on the direct effects of litigation, find that
   the results of litigation are more positive for the poor than the
   conventional wisdom would lead us to expect, and offer an explanation
   that accounts for part of the variation while raising a number of
   questions for future research.},

Abstract = {The current peace process regarding Turkey's Kurdish question could pave
   the way for the normalization of politics and democratization in Turkey
   if the existing opportunities are not missed. The major actors that
   represent the Kurdish left in Turkey, the PKK and the HDP (formerly
   BDP), are all equally significant parts of the peace process. The HDP in
   particular has the potential to turn into a constructive actor for
   Turkey's democratization in the near future. This article argues that
   the Kurdish left of the democratic, parliamentary stage, lately the HDP,
   could contribute to Turkey's democratization if it can fulfill the
   libertarian left policy space in Turkish politics, which has long been
   abandoned by all existing political parties.},

Abstract = {This article examines strategic elements of voter behaviour in
   parliamentary elections where the voting method is a scoring rule other
   than plurality: the Borda Count, which is used for the election of
   ethnic minorities in Slovenia, and the Dowdall rule, which is used in
   the Pacific island state of Nauru in multi-seat districts. After first
   examining the general properties of scoring rules, and generating
   theoretical differences between the two rules, we look at empirical
   evidence from Nauru and Slovenia. This casts a doubt on predictions
   based simply on a voting rule's mathematical properties and on the
   accuracy of assumptions of sincere rank ordering.},

Abstract = {This article investigates why Francois Hollande, the new French
   President, has become so quickly unpopular after his electoral victory
   in May 2012. We ask whether this has to do with a lack of effective
   policy change compared with the 10 preceding years of conservative
   government and the context of economic crisis. We assess the impact of
   political alternation and the crisis on policy change and then look at
   the consequences for popularity ratings. The main results show that
   Hollande does not seem to be greatly different from previous presidents
   as the great recession has apparently not dramatically changed the
   dynamics of French politics. The crucial changes seem to occur before,
   in the 1990s.},

Abstract = {Scholars have produced a substantial body of literature on the lives of
   female sex workers in the commercial sex industry in developed and
   developing countries around the world. This literature on heterosexual
   relations has focused overwhelmingly on the experiences of female sex
   workers, neglecting to examine the significance of male clients (Chapkis
   1997; Prasad Sociological Perspectives 42(2): 181-213, 1999; Weitzer
   Annual Review of Sociology, 35(1), 213-234, 2009). The limited studies
   that do address male clients focus exclusively onWestern men who
   participate in romance or sex tours. No study has examined sex work as a
   site for the performance and production of specific masculinities for
   the increasing number of local, non-Western, business elites in the new
   global economy. Drawing on 15 months of ethnographic research conducted
   between 2009 and 2010 and informal interviews with 25 clients, 25 sex
   workers, and three madams in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, I illustrate how
   local Vietnamese and Asian businessmen enact their masculinity in
   relation to other men through the medium of hard cash. Local elites'
   participation in local hostess bars allows them to capitalise on
   Vietnam's rapid economic restructuring in the context of the 2008 global
   economic crisis in order to assert their place as major players in the
   world order. In doing so, wealthy local Vietnamese and Asian businessmen
   deconstruct dominant Western ideals to assert their place in the global
   order.},

Abstract = {Academic research and popular writing on nonmonogamy and polyamory has
   so far paid insufficient attention to class divisions and questions of
   political economy. This is striking since research indicates the
   significance of class and race privilege within many polyamorous
   communities. This structure of privilege is mirrored in the exclusivist
   construction of these communities. The article aims to fill the gap
   created by the silence on class by suggesting a research agenda which is
   attentive to class and socioeconomic inequality. The paper addresses
   relevant research questions in the areas of intimacy and care, household
   formation, and spaces and institutions and advances an intersectional
   perspective which incorporates class as nondispensable core category.
   The author suggests that critical research in the field can stimulate
   critical self-reflexive practice on the level of community relations and
   activism. He further points to the critical relevance of Marxist and
   Postmarxist theories as important resources for the study of polyamory
   and calls for the study of the contradictions within poly culture from a
   materialist point of view.},

Abstract = {This study traces the development of party law from its first appearance
   in the early 20th century to its reappearance in post-transitional Latin
   America and demonstrates how legislators frequently use party law to
   legally validate the participation of political parties in the electoral
   process. Through an analysis of instances of cartelising party laws and
   party deregulation, this article shows that the cartelising use of party
   law is often followed by a backlash when society and new elites contest
   parties' monopolisation of representation. The legal validation of
   political parties is hence not sufficient for the legitimisation of the
   political status quo in terms of party. Instead, this article shows that
   elites that build their power merely on formal rules risk diminishing
   the political legitimacy of the system that these rules seek to uphold.},

Abstract = {New Zealand is valuable as an extreme case in agricultural trade
   liberalisation and in market-oriented national biosecurity policy, for
   exploring the causes-of-effects of economic interests on national
   biosecurity policy. The article argues that the state is the best
   advocate of agro-economic interests and that international negotiations
   on trade liberalisation played a decisive role in the protectionist and
   economic orientation of New Zealand's biosecurity policies. The study
   contributes to improving theoretical work on the relationship between
   international cooperation and domestic reform politics. It suggests a
   historical-institutionalist and dynamic perspective which incorporates
   the role of institutionalised vested interests and effect of timing and
   sequencing. This perspective helps to explain why states' policy
   preferences originate from economic interests and why patterns of
   interaction between international and national processes have such a
   strong effect.},

Abstract = {It is often assumed that civil society's influence on governance can
   only be complementary to the state and that it must be exercised through
   conciliatory approaches. But contrary to that assumption, a study of
   civil society organizations in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh shows that
   the civil society may attempt to influence governance process through
   multiple strategies. These include conciliatory approaches, adversarial
   approaches and a combination of both, depending on the issue or policy
   on which the influence is sought to be exercised. This article
   illustrates this by taking the examples of two intermediary NGOs: one
   from Karnataka and the other from Andhra Pradesh. The question this
   article raises is: in the context of globalization and the supposedly
   prominent role of civil society, how effective are they? This article
   argues that they still happen to be subsidiary partners in the paradigm
   of `governance-through-networks'. By and large, public policy still
   happens to be influenced by, first the state, and second, multilateral
   donor organizations as well as multinational companies, although civil
   society activism itself should be welcome and need not be viewed with
   scepticism.},

Abstract = {In the tradition of democratic theory, elections are recognized as
   important mechanisms of accountability. However, the migration of public
   decision-making responsibility away from elected representatives and the
   emergence of new governance actors necessitate a fuller
   conceptualization of accountability relationships. As governments pursue
   partnerships with societal actors and disperse authority across multiple
   levels, questions of public input and accountability within the
   democratic governance process arise. In this paper, cases of authority
   migration in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and
   Nova Scotia between the years of 1946 and 2005 are used to examine the
   accountability relationships between new governance actors and both
   government and society. The existence and relative strength of
   accountability relationships are evaluated using the rules stipulated in
   the provincial legislation. Political ideology of governing parties,
   geographic scale of new jurisdictions and period in time are evaluated
   as predictors of the strength of the accountability relationship
   overall.},

Abstract = {The island states of the Pacific region are at the bottom of the
   international league table for the representation of women in
   parliament. Despite considerable efforts by international agencies and
   donor governments and by women of the region, progress on increasing
   representation is extraordinarily slow. Three major explanations for
   these low levels of representation can be identified. The most common
   explanation relates to cultural beliefs, while a second account locates
   the problem in women's socio-economic status. The third explanation
   argues that there are obstacles for women in the electoral and
   parliamentary institutions that warrant the introduction of legislated
   minimum representation of women. Each of these explanations contributes
   value to our understanding but each also has significant deficiencies,
   which are identified in the article.},

Journal = {POLITICA \& SOCIETA},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {265-292},
Month = {MAY-AUG},
Abstract = {There has been some recent interest in robot ethics and machine
   responsibility, as well as the legal frameworks for judging the agency
   of robots and machines in questions of legal responsibility and
   liability(2). In no small measure this interest has revived some of the
   central questions of philosophy of the past few centuries. Among them:
   the nature of determinism and the deterministic nature of algorithms,
   the question of free will and its relation to morality, and the relation
   of punishment to free will and algorithmic decision-making. While these
   questions have not garnered much attention in recent decades, the
   increasing interest in machine ethics, and moral machines(3) has raised
   the questions anew(4). Among the central questions here are: If machines
   are algorithmic, and thus deterministic, how can they be responsible,
   moral agents? What does it mean to punish an algorithmically, and
   presumably deterministic, machine? And is simple non-determinism, of the
   probabilistic sort, a sufficient basis for asserting agency or ascribing
   moral responsibility? These questions excite interest in this new field,
   much as they do among students in their first philosophy class. It is
   important, however, to realize that philosophers did not simply throw-up
   their hands and give up on these questions. While such questions are
   rarely completely resolved or definitively answered, great intellectual
   progress was made through their consideration. And while these insights
   were made in somewhat remote areas of philosophy, it warrants a fresh
   look to see how those insights might be brought to bear on a
   contemporary quandary, such as the moral status of machines and robots,
   in light of our best scientific and philosophical understanding of
   determinism and morality. That is the aim of this paper - to shed light
   on a contemporary problem by drawing upon some insights from the
   philosophy of science and moral philosophy of the past century. The
   first section of the paper will review some of the leading approaches to
   thinking about physical determinism, especially those that grew out of
   thinking about physics in the early 20th century. This is particularly
   interesting in regard to its relation to our understanding of
   information theory, and bears quite directly upon our understanding of
   computation and algorithms. In the second part of the paper, I will move
   from this understanding of determinism in computation to how it relates
   to our notions of free will in moral responsibility, and its relation to
   ascriptions of moral praise and blame. In light of these discussions, I
   will conclude with a consideration of how we might understand punishment
   in algorithmic systems, such as machine learning systems and the moral
   agency of robots, and how this might bear on legal liability and
   responsibility.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {149-167},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Political theorists generally defend the moral importance of health care
   by appealing to its purported importance in promoting good health and
   saving lives. Recent research on the social determinants of health
   demonstrates, however, that health care actually does relatively little
   to promote good health or save lives in comparison with other social and
   environmental factors. This article assesses the implications of the
   social determinants of health literature for existing theories of health
   care justice, and outlines a new approach that can justify publicly
   subsidized comprehensive health care despite its limited contribution to
   good health. Even if health care plays a relatively limited role in
   promoting good health, it remains morally important because of the care
   it provides to individuals. As such, it can be justified in terms of
   care ethics. When health care is justified primarily in terms of care
   rather than health, however, the goals of a just health-care system
   shift. The measure of a just health-care system is no longer strictly
   its ability to generate good health outcomes but also its ability to
   provide individuals with accessible, good quality daily care. This
   different focus has important consequences for the way we think about
   the institutions of a just health-care system as well as for the
   delivery and allocation of medical goods and services.},

Abstract = {Extant research suggests that democracy fosters capital account
   liberalization in developing countries. Yet the data reveal that there
   exists substantial variation in the extent of capital account openness
   across democracies in the developing world. When do democratic
   governments in developing states liberalize their capital account
   policies? We hypothesize that the market concentration of domestic
   private banks has a positive effect on capital account liberalization,
   but only when the degree of electoral particularism in these states is
   sufficiently high. Specifically, we claim that highly
   market-concentrated private banks have interests and the capacity to
   lobby elected politicians to liberalize capital account transactions. We
   then argue that politicians in particularistic democracies will respond
   to such lobbying pressure by dismantling capital controls as they have
   political incentives to cater to the interests of powerful bankers.
   Statistical results from a comprehensive data set provide robust support
   for our main hypothesis.},

   fields of knowledge, the current development of gender studies within
   diverse disciplines (cultural studies, film studies, anthropology,
   psychology, philosophy, as well as political, economical and legal
   studies) affects issues which are fundamental to the history of
   political thought and call for a confrontation - both inside and outside
   the Italian borders - with their impact on the paths and forms of the
   research on the political concepts of the past and on cultural,
   socio-political and symbolic dynamics of the present. The impact of the
   engendered approach to the historical analysis of political ideas is a
   interweaving of voices, which is crossed by a double critical stance, on
   the one hand, to re-read (and rewrite) the dominant philosophical canon;
   on the other, to rethink the method of the scientific and academic
   research, turning the feminist critique into a methodological
   perspective.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the degree to which diffusion of Portugal's
   semi-presidential constitution occurred within lusophone countries
   following their move to multipartism in the 1990s. To do so, we first
   identify the main characteristics of the 1976 Portuguese constitution.
   Next, the constitutional choices made in Angola, Cape Verde,
   Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Sao Tome and Principe, and East Timor are
   mapped. Using existing typologies, we classify these regimes and
   contrast them with their European and francophone African counterparts.
   Finally, we investigate the effective dynamics of lusophone
   semi-presidential systems by focusing on how heads of state deal with
   heads of government and parliamentary majorities. We claim there is a
   ``family resemblance{''} among lusophone semi-presidential regimes. This
   finding is important because it accounts for constitutional choices in a
   group of recent democratizing countries, and shows how external
   influences interact with local factors to produce major political
   outcomes.},

   Appointments to Executive Cabinets},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {58},

Abstract = {Under what conditions do women participate in executive power in
   multiethnic societies? Previous research has examined how political
   institutions, socioeconomic factors, and cultural norms affect the
   appointment of women as cabinet ministers. However, no study has
   assessed the extent to which the politicization of ethnicity-a cleavage
   that shapes political life in many countries-affects women's cabinet
   appointments. Focusing on sub-Saharan Africa, we argue that women are
   less likely to become cabinet ministers where incumbents use such
   appointments to build patronage-based alliances with politicians who act
   as advocates for ethnic constituencies. Using an original dataset on the
   composition of cabinets in 34 African countries from 1980 to 2005, we
   show that women's share of cabinet appointments is significantly lower
   in countries where leaders must accommodate a larger number of
   politicized ethnic groups, but it rises with higher levels of democracy
   and greater representation of women in parliament.},

Abstract = {In May 2012, China, Japan, and South Korea (CJK) signed a trilateral
   investment agreement-their first legal agreement on trilateral economic
   cooperation. This article argues that the diffusion of liberal
   investment rules in the trilateral agreement was circumscribed by
   China's market power. It examines the evolution of CJK policies on
   investment agreements and how these policies clashed in the negotiation
   of the trilateral deal. During the last decade, Japan and Korea have
   secured agreements with Southeast Asian nations that liberalize rules
   governing investment but they were unable to push China toward
   preestablishment liberalization in the trilateral agreement. As a
   result, there is a bifurcation of investment rules in East Asia with
   more liberal rules among Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia than any that
   the three share with China.},

Title = {Designing Historical Social Scientific Inquiry: How Parameter
   Heterogeneity Can Bridge the Methodological Divide between Quantitative
   and Qualitative Approaches},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {58},
Number = {2},
Pages = {526-546},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Seeking to advance historical studies of political institutions and
   behavior, we argue for an expansion of the standard methodological
   toolkit with a set of innovative approaches that privilege parameter
   heterogeneity to capture nuances missed by more commonly used
   approaches. We address critiques by prominent historians and
   historically oriented political scientists who have underscored the
   shortcomings of mainstream quantitative approaches for studying the
   past. They are concerned that the statistical models ordinarily employed
   by political scientists are inadequate for addressing temporality,
   periodicity, specificity, and context-issues that are central to good
   historical analysis. The innovations that we advocate are particularly
   well suited for incorporating these issues in empirical models, which we
   demonstrate with replications of extant research that focuses on
   locating structural breaks relating to realignments and split-party
   Senate delegations and on the temporal evolution in congressional
   roll-call behavior connected to labor policy during the New Deal and
   Fair Deal.},

Abstract = {Unpacking corruption has advantages over using aggregate measures of
   corruption when theory generates different predictions about the effects
   of political institutions on different kinds of corruption. We take
   advantage of the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance surveys
   conducted in 1999, 2002, and 2005 to investigate the effect of veto
   players on state capture and bureaucratic corruption in the
   postcommunist countries. According to our results, a greater number of
   veto players is associated with less state capture. By contrast, the
   number of veto players does not have a significant impact on
   bureaucratic corruption.},

Abstract = {This article considers the theory of presidential representation by
   examining its development from 1800 to 1864. In particular, it returns
   to the critics of Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln
   and presents new evidence that the concept of presidential
   representation not only remained contested throughout this period but
   also grew more entangled with rival claims of representation and
   alternative arguments for executive power. By exploring the early
   development of the theory of presidential representation, the article
   contributes to the ongoing scholarly task of classifying arguments about
   the foundations of executive power and attempts to link literatures
   regarding the constitutional and political sources of presidential
   power.},

Abstract = {Grassroots party contacts with voters have again become an important
   feature of presidential campaigns. In a bygone era, mobilization efforts
   were the work of local party organizations - the product of their
   various capabilities and needs and, consequently, less systematically
   patterned across the country. With the demise of these organizations,
   grassroots contacts declined, reaching only 18 percent of the electorate
   by 1992, before rebounding to over 40 percent by 2008. Using respondent
   reports of party contacts from the American National Election Studies,
   this article documents how the recent surge in mobilization is tied to
   the strategic priorities of the national parties and presidential
   campaigns. They concentrate their efforts on the most likely voters in
   the most competitive battleground' states, resulting in both positive
   and negative consequences for American democracy. In ramping up party
   contacts, who is contacted has changed, becoming more readily
   predictable, and the American electoral process has been transformed.},

Abstract = {Although voter ID laws have become a hot topic of political debate,
   existing scholarship has failed to produce conclusive evidence
   concerning the existence or frequency of electoral fraud, especially the
   type of fraud that would be prevented by photo identification laws and
   signature verification protocols for voting by mail. We propose a new
   method of measuring election fraud, especially identity fraud, that is
   superior to previous measurement efforts because it measures actual
   instances of fraud rather than waiting for conclusive proof of fraud
   produced in a criminal prosecution. We test our method in multiple
   jurisdictions, including two known cases of electoral fraud, and we find
   no additional cases of fraud. We speculate that public access to voting
   and registration records play an important role in preventing this type
   of election fraud, suggesting that these practices are perhaps more
   important than voter ID laws in preventing election fraud.},

Abstract = {I examine the role of US land policy in strategically controlling and
   moving populations around the continent with the goal of expanding
   borders and securing and incorporating new territory on the frontier.
   The government effectively used land policies and population control to
   enable an otherwise constrained American state to assert authority over
   the direction of expansion, to engineer settlement patterns in a manner
   to secure the territory without a large military, and to maintain an
   official fidelity to constitutional principles while engineering a
   dominant racial vision. I examine both the success and failures of these
   policies over the nineteenth century, with material drawn from
   government documents and primary sources. I discuss the consequences of
   this land policy for how we understand the American state in the context
   of comparative state and racial formation.},

Abstract = {Jurists, scholars, and popular writers routinely assert that the men who
   framed and ratified the First Amendment were influenced by James
   Madison's Memorial and Remonstrance ( 1785) and Thomas Jefferson's
   Statute for Religious Liberty (1786). In this essay I demonstrate that
   there is little evidence to support these claims. Because these
   documents represent only one approach to church-state relations in the
   era, jurists and others who believe that the religion clauses should be
   interpreted in light of the founders' views need to look well beyond
   these texts if they want to understand the First Amendment's
   ``generating history.{''}},

Abstract = {The notion of a Chinese popularity function may seem surprising, given
   its authoritarian nature. However, exploring the possibility of indirect
   popularity functions in nondemocratic systems, we articulate a model of
   national government support in China. The model argues that
   sociodemographics, political attitudes, and performance issues mold
   central government satisfaction. Drawing on a countrywide 2008 public
   opinion survey, we conclude that regional differences, national trust,
   and local policy success are of special importance in shaping national
   government support. The findings, which exhibit theoretical and
   statistical appeal, lay the groundwork for further investigation of
   popularity functions in China.},

Title = {Transformation of the Official Memory of Conflict: A Tentative Model and
   the Israeli Memory of the 1948 Palestinian Exodus},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICS CULTURE AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-91},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Collective memory of an intractable conflict is an important determinant
   of the psychological and the behavioral dynamics of the parties
   involved. Typically biased, it delegitimizes the rival and glorifies the
   in-group, thereby inhibiting peaceful resolution of the conflict and
   reconciliation of the parties. Therefore, the transformation of this
   memory into a less biased one is of great importance in advancing peace
   and reconciliation. This article introduces for the first time a
   tentative model of that transformation, describing the seven phases of
   the transformation process and the five categories of factors that
   influence it. Methodologically, this is done using a case study
   approach, based on the empirical findings regarding the Israeli official
   memory from 1949 to 2004 surrounding the causes of the 1948 Palestinian
   exodus. This memory is represented by all of the publications produced
   during the 56-year research period of the Israeli army (IDF),
   theNational Information Center, and the Ministry of Education. While
   until 1999 this inclusive memory was largely Zionist (i.e., all the
   Palestinian refugees left willingly in 1948), since 2000, it has become
   partially critical because theMinistry of Education has begun adopting
   the critical narrative (i.e., some left willingly while others were
   expelled).},

Abstract = {In the modern American city, who determines environmental policy? Cities
   have undergone fundamental change in both their economies and
   populations. In terms of political forces, our expectation is that
   across a range of cities, where nonprofit environmental groups have been
   included or incorporated into the local policymaking process, there is
   greater commitment to environmental protection, and more extensive
   adoption and implementation of local policies and programs designed to
   protect the environment. To test this idea, we draw on our own research
   that combines two original data sets. First, we have collected
   information on what programs and policies are in place in America's
   large cities. Second, for 50 large American cities, we have also
   surveyed top city administrators. We find that inclusion of
   environmental groups in city policymaking is strongly linked to city
   administrators' perceptions of city commitment to environmental
   protection. The number of local environmental protection policies and
   programs also demonstrates a strong relationship to inclusion of
   environmental groups in city policymaking.},

Abstract = {On two occasions (1980 and 1995), Quebeckers rejected the Quebec
   government's sovereignty proposal. Many lessons can be drawn from the
   Quebec referendum experience. The purpose of this article is to shed
   light on the origins and motivations of the independence movement. It
   focuses more specifically on the 1980 and 1995 referendums, examining in
   both cases the political context, the judicial-institutional framework
   within which these public consultations were held and the arguments
   raised during the referendum campaigns. Furthermore, it analyses the
   results as well as the political, constitutional and juridical
   consequences of the federalist victories. The article concludes that
   attempts by Quebec sovereignists to question the Canadian political
   system have invariably resulted in a stronger and more consolidated
   central state while significantly weakening the Quebec state's ability
   to determine its own political future.},

Abstract = {We hypothesize that decisions to constrain government revenue may
   constitute an attractive strategy, especially to right-wing governments,
   when pursuing a preference for welfare state retrenchment. Whereas
   programmatic retrenchment in social policy programs imposes concentrated
   losses in return for diffuse gains, the distributive profile of systemic
   retrenchment via tax cuts might entail concentrated benefits for
   specified groups financed by diffuse losses for larger groups in a
   distant future. Consequently, the electorate may accept or even desire
   tax cuts and associated initiatives to curb government income relative
   to retrenchment measures of services and benefits. Our empirical
   analysis supports such theoretical propositions. In an extensive
   comparative analysis of all tax laws adopted by four Danish governments,
   we find clear partisan differences. In an in-depth study of the tax
   policy of the latest right-wing government, we moreover empirically
   support the causality of the argument as the government did in fact try
   to curb specific taxes in order to constrain the spending side of the
   welfare state in an indirect manner.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to account for varieties of organizational
   change. In particular, we contend that in order to explain change in
   international organizations (IOs) we cannot simply dichotomize between
   change and the lack thereof. Rather, change is best conceptualized as
   made up of two dimensions: speed and scope. The combination of the two
   dimensions leads to a taxonomy with four distinct types of policy
   change. The paper evaluates the emergence of different types of change
   by focusing on the relationship between IOs and their fields.
   Specifically, the position of the organization in the field helps to
   account for the speed of change (slow vs. rapid), whereas the openness
   of the organization to the inputs coming from the field helps to explain
   the scope of change (incremental vs. radical). We illustrate our
   argument by comparing the changes in the International Monetary Fund's
   policies in the areas of financial sector surveillance and poverty
   reduction.},

Abstract = {Growing institutional cooperation between the Republic of Ireland and
   the UK, initially directed explicitly at resolution of the Northern
   Ireland conflict, has taken the form of three parallel institutional
   structures. First, an Anglo-Irish (later, British-Irish)
   Intergovernmental Conference has dealt with matters relating to the
   government of Northern Ireland in areas to which power is not devolved,
   and with certain other `sovereign' matters. Second, a British-Irish
   Council links not just the two sovereign governments but also the
   devolved institutions in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and the
   crown dependencies of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. Third, a
   matching British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly provides common ground for
   representatives of the legislative bodies of the same jurisdictions. The
   paper tracks the evolution of these structures, and assesses the
   significance of the new institutions for the British-Irish relationship.},

Journal = {POLITIKON},

Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-22},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Global interest in the `green economy' has heightened since 2008, and
   this article contributes to these discussions by elaborating on (a) four
   alternative, and sometimes competing, discourses of the green economy,
   and (b) the particular politics of the green economy in South Africa.
   Most research on the green economy tends to focus on European and North
   American countries, however in the context of a changing global economy
   and the `rise of the South' the politics of the green economy in
   countries like South Africa is of increasing importance. South Africa
   faces many challenges in pursuing a transition to a more sustainable
   development path, yet has been cited as a global green economy leader.
   This article argues that this is related to the particular discourse of
   `green growth' which is dominant in South Africa, and proposes two
   significant lines of critique of this discourse. The first cautions that
   commitment to the green economy may not be particularly deep-rooted,
   sustained or coherent; and the second highlights some of the more
   troubling political implications of the type of green growth advocated,
   even if it were to be pursued with more determination. With this in
   mind, it is important to consider whether transitions to a green economy
   might produce new power relations of inequality and injustice, just as
   the industrial revolution helped produce today's deeply unequal world.},

Abstract = {While effective state capacity can reasonably be considered a necessary
   condition for democratization, strong states do not automatically
   produce democratic regimes, nor do they guarantee their survival. Far
   from being sufficient conditions for democracy, strong or capable states
   are also thought to be indispensable for the maintenance of autocratic
   rule. The present article puts to the test the hypothesis that a certain
   level of state capacity is needed to engage in effective electoral
   malpractice, using general and more specific indicators of electoral
   fraud. This article proposes two opposing mechanisms through which state
   capacity can influence the quality of elections: through infrastructural
   state capacity and coercive state capacity. The article demonstrates
   that electoral fraud is more likely in countries where infrastructural
   state capacity is weak and that coercive state capacity plays a more
   ambiguous role than previously thought. The analyses also reveal that
   different factors are at work when looking at precise types of electoral
   malpractice rather than general measures: voter and candidate
   intimidation, fraudulent tabulation of votes, unfair media coverage of
   campaigns and vote buying seem to engage different sets of facilitating
   structures.},

Abstract = {As a political theorist who has been profoundly shaped by the feminist
   movement and feminist theorizing that arose from it, my work is
   interdisciplinary at its core. It is difficult, if not impossible, to
   engage in the work of political theorizing without taking into account
   the multiple dimensions of human experience, and multiple methodologies
   by which to explore them. Those of us who teach in liberal arts colleges
   are particularly fortunate/privileged in this regard: to the extent that
   we see our mission as preparing our students to be critically engaged
   citizens (rather than preparing them to be political scientists), we are
   free to draw on multiple apfiroaches. Furthermore, because most of us
   have to teach across sub fields, we are enabled, encouraged, perhaps
   even forced, to integrate multiple perspectives into our teaching. That,
   in turn, may well affect our research and writing. I argue that these
   sorts of ``boundary crossings{''} are valuable both for our students and
   for us.},

Volume = {4},

Pages = {331-342},
Abstract = {This article argues that rapid social change inherent in a capitalist
   mode of production deprives the mass of people of a harmony of habitus,
   culture formation and meaningful sociation. Such rapid social change,
   coupled with elite management of relative deprivation on the
   macro-level, produces confusion in vocabularies of motive on a
   micro-level, fracturing consciousness and thereby inhibiting collective
   action. In order to ensure meaningful collective action that leads to
   structural change, we need to develop a common language of the
   oppressed, an alternative to the globalized language that represents
   bourgeoisie hegemony and its situational interpretations. Such a
   language will involve a congruence of vocabularies of motive (linked to
   similar societal situations), unveiling the similarity of the social
   situation of the oppressed on a global level. The development of such a
   language is the task of critical sociologists.},

Abstract = {Since Lipset and Rokkan (1967) published their seminal work on the
   importance of social cleavages for the freezing' of party systems more
   than forty years ago, much has been written on the field demonstrating
   or discrediting the original hypothesis. In the current article, I
   examine how cleavage formation and development have influenced the
   different levels of institutionalization in four new post-communist
   party systems (i.e. Visegrad). Analysing distinct hypotheses, I arrive
   at the conclusion that neither the number nor the type nor the strength
   of a cleavage is associated with the degree of party system
   institutionalization in East Central Europe. On the contrary, the main
   conclusion is that party system institutionalization in these
   democracies has been determined by the way cleavages are structured. In
   particular, the process of party system institutionalization is found to
   be hindered when cleavages cross-cut, while fostered in cases where they
   cumulate (i.e. coincide).},

Abstract = {How does segregation shape intergroup violence in contested urban
   spaces? Should nominal rivals be kept separate or instead more closely
   integrated? We develop an empirically grounded agent-based model to
   understand the sources and patterns of violence in urban areas,
   employing Jerusalem as a demonstration case and seeding our model with
   microlevel, geocoded data on settlement patterns. An optimal set of
   parameters is selected to best fit the observed spatial distribution of
   violence in the city, with the calibrated model used to assess how
   different levels of segregation, reflecting various proposed virtual
   futures for Jerusalem, would shape violence. Our results suggest that
   besides spatial proximity, social distance is key to explaining conflict
   over urban areas: arrangements conducive to reducing the extent of
   intergroup interactionsincluding localized segregation, limits on
   mobility and migration, partition, and differentiation of political
   authoritycan be expected to dampen violence, although their effect
   depends decisively on social distance.},

Abstract = {``Subjectivity{''} is taken to mean a collective form of consciousness
   or collaborative project or social movement, characterised by specific
   forms of organisation and representation. ``Radical{''} subjectivity
   refers to those projects that fundamentally challenge the dominant
   social formation. The paper traces the succession of forms of radical
   subjectivity from the first emergence of the modern proletariat as an
   independent political agent, as for example in the secret societies that
   prepared for insurrection in Chartist England, up to the present period
   where we see phenomena such as the Occupy movement. Each form resolves
   problems inherent in the preceding form, and while pushing it into the
   background, so to speak, does not terminate that form, but sublates and
   includes it. Thus the process is seen in Hegelian terms as outlined in
   Book Two of the Logic, ``Essence.{''}},

Title = {Clash of Perceptions: Quebec Viewed by Albertan Media (2003-2012)},
Journal = {CANADIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {34-58},
Abstract = {This study examines the evolution of the perception of Quebec in Alberta
   through the analysis of four events: the 2003 Quebec provincial election
   of Jean Charest and the Liberal party, the Harper government's 2006
   motion recognizing Quebec as a nation, the 2008 parliamentary
   prorogation and coalition attempt and, lastly, the 2012 Quebec
   provincial election of Pauline Marois and the Parti Quebecois. In our
   qualitative analysis of 202 articles in Alberta's two principal dailies
   (the Edmonton Journal and the Calgary Herald), we demonstrate the
   evolution of the representations of Quebec political life in the Alberta
   media. We bring to light the ways in which depictions of Quebec became
   more critical after the 2003 Charest victory. Notably, we reveal that
   many commentators developed a ``hostage thesis{''} of Quebec; in other
   words, they affirmed that Quebec behaves as an abductor, holding Canada
   captive and extorting money from the federal government (and thus from
   Alberta) to finance its generous social services. We equally demonstrate
   that the majority of articles concerning Quebec are simply informative
   or indifferent news stories and that some authors defend or praise
   Quebec.},

Abstract = {National security cyber activities harm human rights and democracy
   activists. With increasing state cyber capabilities comes heightened
   pressure on civil society and democracy activists. We often think of the

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {37},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {1244-1263},
Abstract = {This paper explores Germany's centrality to the outcome of the eurozone
   crisis. It argues that the eurozone crisis has led Germany's
   ordo-liberal principles to trump its other longstanding commitment -
   i.e. to European integration. These two principles are explored in order
   then to shed light on how they have played out during the crisis. German
   centrality has created high expectations for it to provide leadership.
   Exploring hegemony conceptually and in practice, it is argued that
   international legitimacy and increasing domestic constraints have
   limited a leadership role. Indeed, it is argued that it is the domestic
   political situation that explains why ordo-liberalism has trumped
   pro-Europeanism. Ordo-liberal emphasis on stability culture has provided
   a valuable strategic resource for securing German objectives within the
   eurozone while satisfying the requirements of domestic politics.},

Abstract = {As a result of the fulfillment of the gender quota for nominations to
   Congress in the 2012 Mexican federal elections, there is the highest
   number of elected women in the history of the country. The article
   analyzes political and institutional factors that explain this result,
   such as the pressure made by organized women from different parties and
   the decisive intervention of the Electoral Tribunal of the Judiciary.
   Nevertheless, parties nominated women in a disproportionate manner in
   their lost districts showing that party leaderships responded more to
   the threat of sanction than to a change in values. Research is based
   upon journal sources and a database that relates female nominations with
   the types of districts.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the policy uncertainty generated by elections
   encourages private actors to delay investments that entail high costs of
   reversal, creating pre-election declines in the associated sectors.
   Moreover, this incentive depends on the competitiveness of the race and
   the policy differences between the major parties/candidates. These
   arguments are tested using new survey and housing market data from the
   United States. The survey analysis assesses whether respondents'
   perceptions of presidential candidates' policy differences increased the
   likelihood that they would delay certain purchases and actions. The
   housing market analysis examines whether elections are associated with a
   pre-election decline in economic activity, and whether any such decline
   depends on electoral competitiveness. The results support the
   predictions and cannot be explained by existing theories.},

Abstract = {The term precarity has been circulating Europe since the late 1980s and
   is currently used by social movements to contentiously challenge
   classical notions of production, reproduction, and citizenship. This
   paper follows the development of the term among several activist
   networks in Europe (mainly in Spain) through their engagements with
   crises of the welfare state, new contractual and working arrangements,
   migrant labor and mobility, and gender. These social movements' specific
   conceptual production confronts increasing fragmentation and complexity
   around the workspace, rearticulating a series of identities,
   imaginaries, and militant practices in an open-ended process of
   resignification. This paper shows how precarity evolves as a political
   toolbox stretching beyond the workplace and national borders, enabling a
   Deleuzian politics of unfixed alliances.},

   Revolution},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Pages = {590-606},
Abstract = {For-profit colleges have become a major force in higher education. They
   claim to offer a career-oriented practical education that is an
   alternative to community and fouryear colleges. Often they fail to
   provide what they promise. Rather than being a new alternative,
   for-profits are the new basement floor of education, offering
   substandard educations at inflated prices. The primacy of profit motives
   and especially financialization means that for-profits are more like a
   financial instrument of neoliberal policies than educational
   institutions. Fueled by the reliance on federal student loans for
   operations expenses, educational aims are secondary to advertising and
   recruitment of a continuing supply of students without much regard for
   graduation rates. They appeal to firstgeneration students and recent
   immigrants with little information about higher education or the job
   market.},

   analysing EU behaviour within an actorness framework, we demonstrate how
   the external opportunity structure and the EU's internal environment has
   impacted on its ability to exert and maximize its presence in order to
   meet its goals and aims in these two very different sub-sectors of
   global communications in terms of evolution and development. Such a
   comparison of EU actorness, we argue, is revealing in terms of
   uncovering the underlying factors and conditions that allow the EU to
   influence two important and dynamic communications sub-sectors.},

   two books foregrounding the turning point of the 18(th) century by
   which, moving from the experience of the revolution, the structure of
   the constitution and configuration of government were deeply rethought.
   The two works, respectively about David Hume and Jeremy Bentham,
   contribute significantly to illuminate the way by which obedience has
   been reconsidered when society and opinion became the sources of
   political legitimation. This dialogue at distance clearly shows the
   presence of a plurality of constitutional registers which were necessary
   for the affirmation of the centrality of government in the era of the
   rising popular sovereignty.},

Pages = {123+},
Abstract = {This article studies philanthropy as a way to decipher the
   transformations of an economic ethos in Africa for the past two decades.
   It shows how new patterns of civic giving are related to the formation
   of private sector elites - professionals, managers and businessmen as a
   distinct, self-identified social group, aware of its own interests and
   organized to defend them, especially against politicians, whose
   clientelist practices are increasingly criticized. It eventually
   demonstrates how these elites tend to promote, as proofs of
   respectability and self-worthiness rather than as a political strategy,
   new standards of governance, inspired by private sector practices, which
   are both unquestionable and unaccountable. This advocates for studying
   African states not only as a set of institutions and policies, but also
   as the work of a certain type of men, with their own peculiar ethos and
   political imagination.},

Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {105-126},
Abstract = {This article explains why contemporary African regimes choose different
   counter-insurgency strategies and why they tend not to be
   population-centric. We argue that strategies correspond to the ways in
   which incumbent regimes in Africa deal with different segments of
   political society through patronage. Incumbents seek varying levels of
   accommodation with rebel leaders, or try to eliminate them, according to
   rebels' historical position within the state. This variation reflects
   differences in perceived political threats posed to incumbents. We
   classify these threats as high, moderate or low, which are associated
   with counter-insurgency strategies of group control, insurgent control
   and insurgent elimination, respectively.},

Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},

Volume = {2},

Pages = {1-16},
Abstract = {In 2009, the 18-year-old South African runner Caster Semenya was accused
   of being male and forced to undergo gender testing. After much
   obfuscation and misreporting, Semenya was cleared to compete as a woman.
   Semenya's experience exposes the problematic ways in which masculinity
   and femininity are harnessed to the categories of male and female as
   well as the ways in which they are embodied by men and women. This paper
   contemplates how binaries are mobilized and boundaries maintained - as
   is contemporarily evident in responses to Semenya's gender troubles. It
   reads Pierre Bourdieu's theory of symbolic power against an example of
   British Imperialism and illustrates how gender (and its uneasy mapping
   on to bodies) is implicated and imbricated in colonial historiography
   and knowledge practices. The paper concludes with Lois McNay's
   suggestion that gender is a lived relation, which requires coming to
   terms with the relationship between agency and experience, and
   recognizes that gendered people are the subjects of social analysis. At
   stake in this examination of symbolic power, gender, and lived
   experience is the recognition of the consistency and resilience in
   binary manifestations of symbolic meaning and the insidious ways in
   which gender is mobilized, enacted, and layered onto other dualisms.},

   in Estonia},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {The phenomenon of statelessness is most often studied as an issue of
   international and human-rights law. In contrast, this paper examines
   narratives of citizenship choice among initially stateless
   Russian-speaking residents of Estonia in order to explore the practical
   meanings of (non) citizenship in a context where the available options
   include both national citizenship and statelessness. While legal aspects
   of citizenship do explain many of the perceived benefits and
   disadvantages of various citizenship options, we find that deliberations
   about citizenship choice also reflect extra-legal normative and
   affective dimensions of civic belonging. The resulting multidimensional
   model of citizenship helps account for courses of action that would
   appear anomalous if citizenship choice were merely an instrumental
   matter of weighing the costs and benefits of different options. It also
   points to a growing disjuncture among citizenship as a source of legal
   rights and obligations, as a normative framework, and as a site of
   attachment and identification.},

Abstract = {This article intervenes in recent debates surrounding Adorno's
   contribution to critical social theory. Where it is something of a
   commonplace to argue that Adorno pessimistically withdraws from
   political concerns, the article argues for a more productive set of
   normative contributions - based within his utopian gestures towards a
   `difference without fear'. At stake is not only a more sensitive
   approach to Adorno's texts, but the broader normative question of
   difference and its political meaning.},

Abstract = {During the last years, authors have paid increasing attention to the
   study of contextual factors that shape the use of research into a
   country's public polices. The concept of Knowledge Regimes, developed by
   Campbell and Pedersen (and focused on the supply side of policy relevant
   research), is one of the most significant recent contributions to this
   literature. This article is a critique of this concept based on the
   study of three key policy change events during Vazquez administration in
   Uruguay. In order to explain the political dynamic of knowledge is
   necessary to understand the supply-side's main features. But it is also
   necessary to study demand-side ones. This criticism leads to the
   construction of a new concept.},

Abstract = {Set in 1978, the year Edward Said published Orientalism, Salman
   Rushdie's Midnight's Children depicts ``magic children{''} born in the
   first hour of August 15, 1947, ``within the frontiers of the infant
   sovereign state of India{''} (1981, 226, 224). Through some ``freak of
   biology{''} or ``preternatural power,{''} the children receive
   ``miraculous{''} abilities, including such superhero staples as flight,
   time-travel, and ``a boy who could increase or reduce his size at
   will{''} (224, 227, 228). For his mind-reading narrator, Rushdie evokes
   the Shadow's 1930s radio slogan: ``the ability to look into the hearts
   and minds of men{''} (229). The American Shadow, like so many of his
   descendants and predecessors, gained his powers from the mythical
   Orient, but the fantastical abilities that Rushdie awards the first
   citizens born in independent India mark the end of colonial exploitation
   and the transfer of real-world political power from colonizers to the
   formerly colonized.},

   Latin America},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {58},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Anti-vote-buying campaigns led by NGOs and political elites denounce the
   practice as a crass economic transaction detrimental to democracy. Do
   potential clients stigmatize vote buying to the same degree, or does the
   mass public have a more conditional view of the acceptability of vote
   buying? We theorize that normative evaluations of vote buying vary based
   on individuals' understanding of the transaction itself and abstract
   societal costs associated with the practice. We assess this perspective
   using survey experiments conducted in several Latin American countries
   that present hypothetical vote-buying situations for evaluation by
   respondents, varying the socioeconomic status of the hypothetical client
   and the client's political predispositions. We find that the disapproval
   of vote buying is highly conditional on the attributes of the
   hypothetical client and that evaluations of vote buying depend on
   conceptions of the concrete benefits and abstract costs of vote buying
   as a part of electoral politics.},

Abstract = {In the early Sixties Georg Lukacs started a research in order to recover
   and develop the social ontological dimension of Marx's works, with the
   intent of renovating Marxist reflection after the inhibitory effect of
   Stalinism. The aim of this paper is to describe and analyze Lukacs's
   conception of ``ideology{''} as ``social function{''}, linking it with
   the ``social complexity{''} system described in Lukacs's last work, the
   Ontology of social being. Taking in high consideration the goethean idea
   of ``original phenomena{''} associated by Lukacs with the one of
   ``labour{''}, I propose a new regard on the Reflection theory proposed
   in the Ontology. In particular, I will show the role ideology must
   logically assume in a society whose main task is the production of the
   future.},

   strong foreign policy orientation of the Czechoslovakia towards the Arab
   countries. In the era of the Slovak independence, such orientation of
   the foreign policy is completely absent. However, we can consider the
   events of the Arab Spring, which opened up the possibility of greater
   participation in the events in this part of the world, to be a turning
   point. In our article we would like to analyse the development of modern

Abstract = {The aim of the paper is to describe the situation for legal recognition
   of Indigenous Peoples' rights by the state among the different countries
   of Southeast Asia. In order to do this, an index called IREDLI and based
   on Van Cott's multicultural model has been built and then applied to
   different territorial units of Southeast Asia. This new index analyzes
   three sets of rights: right to land, cultural rights and political
   rights. Through analyzing constitutions, secondary legislation and
   ratifications of international agreements, it has been possible to
   identify different patterns of recognition of Indigenous Peoples' rights
   in Southeast Asia distinct from those found in Latin America and to
   distinguish between sets of countries that do and do not recognize
   Indigenous Peoples' rights. Moreover, the IRELDI index has proven to be
   a useful methodological tool to compare different realities at the macro
   level while establishing finer gradations between different types of
   rights.},

Abstract = {The Judiciary Council has been ineffective in its constitutional
   mission: helping to sustain the judges' independence against the other -
   dignified or efficient - Powers' pressures. The way its members are
   appointed and how they in turn elect the holders of the main judicial
   positions has shown their dependency on the political parties. But the
   2013 reform does not resolve this problems, does not fulfil the
   constitutional provisions on pluralism in its composition and
   collegiality, creates some new ones as a consequence of the
   reinforcement of its president's powers and transfers a substantial part
   of its former competences to the Executive power. It is a deliberate
   setback to the pre-constitutional way of governing the judiciary: a
   genuine Counter-Reform.},

Title = {An operational code of terrorism: the political psychology of Ayman
   al-Zawahiri},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-40},
Abstract = {The study of terrorism requires not only the study of specific acts of
   terrorism but also the study of the context in which such acts are made.
   Researchers must consequently be familiar with the general psychological
   principles of terrorism (of its causes and effects) as well as the
   psychological background of individual terrorists, especially terrorist
   leaders such as Ayman al-Zawahiri. This study creates a broad,
   context-rich profile of Ayman al-Zawahiri's political psychology using
   the analytical framework known as operational code. Content analysis of
   al-Zawahiri's written and spoken statements allows the researcher to
   analyze the important belief systems that motivate al-Zawahiri's
   actions. These belief systems are crucial in understanding al-Zawahiri's
   political and terrorist actions, as al-Zawahiri experiences very few
   institutional barriers altering the otherwise robust relationship
   between belief and action. This study finds not only that al-Zawahiri
   perceives the political world through a purely religious view, but also
   that his implementation of political action depends only on the will,
   capabilities, and nature of the jihadist movement itself. As a result,
   al-Zawahiri shows little to no cognitive complexity and interacts with
   the political world solely based on his judgment of the capabilities of
   the jihadist movement.},

Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {22},

Pages = {181-205},
Abstract = {Timor-Leste has had three rounds of major elections, all of which have
   been widely regarded as meeting international criteria for being free
   and fair. There has also been one change of government on the basis of
   these elections. On these grounds, some observers have suggested that
   Timor-Leste has met the benchmark for having consolidated its democracy.
   Timor-Leste can be said to meet the criteria for an expanded minimalist
   definition of democracy, holding regular, free and fair elections within
   an open competitive political environment, with relatively little
   violence and intimidation and general freedom of expression. This
   political process has, as defined by the literature, also consolidated.
   However, Timor-Leste continues to face future economic challenges. The
   literature indicates that states with high levels of poverty,
   unemployment and with food shortages are more prone to political
   instability. Given that Timor-Leste's political party system relies
   heavily on charismatic individuals and, apart from Fretilin, has poor
   party structures, loss of current political leaders will add a further
   destabilising effect. Expected economic problems are likely to manifest
   around the same time that the current generation of political leaders
   are no longer active. The question will be, in this increasingly
   challenging environment, whether Timor-Leste can sustain its democracy.},

Abstract = {The notion that the ``Founding Fathers{''} generation of West German
   Political Science included irreproachable persons, who did not burden
   themselves with guilt during National Socialist times, has most recently
   been questioned by the example of Theodor Eschenburg. Based on extensive
   sources, the present investigation analyses the role that Michael Freund
   played between 1933-1945 before he was appointed a professorship for the
   ``Science and History of Politics{''} in Kiel in 1951. His example also
   suggests that the image of the founding generation should be
   differentiated. Simple categorical attributions, such as ``burdened{''}
   or ``involved{''}, are only sufficient enough to enable limited
   clarification because they do not appropriately reflect the
   inconsistency of action during the ``Third Reich{''}.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of violent
   extremist propaganda. Frame analysis and network text analysis (NTA) are
   used to advance our understanding of how diagnostic frames function
   within violent extremist propaganda. Neo-Nazi and violent jihadi
   demagogues use diagnostic frames to identify grievances in order to
   leverage individual and collective attitudes. More specifically,
   diagnostic frames assist in attitude formation through manufacturing
   subcultural identities and social boundaries that resonate within a
   target population. A comparative research design is used because of the
   differences and similarities that exist between neo-Nazi and violent
   jihadi propaganda. Analysis is based on the NTA, which generates
   neo-Nazi and violent jihadi ego networks. Results suggest that the
   process of generating subcultural identities and social boundaries is
   not unique among ideologies or groups despite differences in language,
   culture, history, and geography. Importantly, ego networks illustrate
   how demagogues frame societal problems from a subcultural perspective in
   order to mobilize target audiences.},

Title = {``Consumecracy{''}. Political Consumerism as a way of citizen
   participation},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {51},
Number = {1},
Pages = {121-146},
Abstract = {Political consumerism is a form of participation in which citizens use
   the market to express their political concerns. Making the purchase of a
   product (buycot) or not (boycott) is a justified personal decision based
   on ethical values, environmental or political concerning the procedures
   performed by companies or governments. New technologies and different
   information media affect the scope of this type of political
   mobilization given the growing importance of transnational social
   networks and online communities, which contribute to the formation of
   the public opinion and to the participation in a new ``sub-political{''}
   space. So we are interested in: a) critical or conscious consumers
   transforming their purchase habit in political habit, and b) the context
   through which they obtain the information, and the different actors,
   activists and social movements with which they participate, transforming
   the market into a public arena and a subject of claims for the practice
   of democracy. This article therefore aims to: conceptualize consumer
   involvement from the perspective of sociological theories of modernity,
   present some of the methodologies used to measure and evaluate the
   influence of political consumers, and see to what extent their
   empowerment trough the market might approach a ``consumecracy''.},

   the article published in this issue (for the first part, see Politeia,

   and politicians, their status as the ``fourth power{''}, as well as
   their role in managing perceptions of legitimacy of power structures.
   Having pointed out the growing influence of journalists as creators of
   the meanings, ``correctors{''} of the picture of what is going on,
   creators of virtual reality (as well as their decreasing role as
   intermediaries between events and society), the author also demonstrates
   that to date the impact of domestic journalists and journalism on
   politics remains mostly fragmentary, unsystematic, and sporadic.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2014},

Pages = {142-156},
Abstract = {Several decades after political independence, Nigeria is still faced
   with the problem of the right model of governance that will achieve its
   noble objectives. Following the collapse of the First Republic, Nigeria
   jettisoned the Westminster parliamentary system and adopted the
   presidential system. Neither has the parliamentary nor the presidential
   model of governance been able to guarantee the political stability that
   is much needed for development and the relationship between the
   executive and legislature being the single most problematic issue. With
   heavy reliance on empirical and secondary data, this paper examines the
   nature of legislature-executive relations at the state level of
   Nigeria's presidential system and found that these two political
   institutions have been relating with each other under an atmosphere of
   mutual suspicion, acrimony and political rivalry orchestrated largely by
   local godfathers in alliance with the presidency. It therefore argues
   that, while legislative-executive conflict may be inevitable in the
   presidential democratic government, mechanism for harmonious
   relationship between the legislature and executive is imperative for
   good governance in Nigeria.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to explain the contemporary international political
   order in light of three authors of the international relations theory:
   Henry Kissinger, Samuel Huntington and Joseph Nye. Following the
   aforementioned authors' viewpoints, it is concluded that even if the
   national state is no longer the only actor with real possibilities to
   negotiate ground rules and exercise power in the configuration of the
   current global political order; it is undoubtedly the most relevant
   actor given its regulatory and administrative capacities. Thus, no other
   force can dispute with equal legitimacy or success in spite of the
   existence of illegal and non-state powers, such as international
   terrorism, that can create unexpected capacity of institutional
   destruction and instability.},

Abstract = {Throughout the world, religiously-oriented conservative political
   movements are well known for their defence of `traditional models' in
   terms of both family conception and gender roles. Therefore, one should
   expect to find a limited social and political mobilization of women
   within them as well as in right-wing religiously conservative parties.
   However, many significant movements have built strong female branches in
   which militants usually perform roles apparently contradicting the
   religious conservative ideologies the movements support. This paper will
   show these dynamics in three case studies: the US Christian Right in the
   USA, the Hindu national religious movement (sangh parivar) in India, and
   the Islamist movement in Turkey. Its final section will compare the
   three cases, trying to find common patterns and to understand the
   reasons behind this apparent paradox.},

   Effect on Student Decision Making},

Pages = {302-314},
Abstract = {Simulations are often employed as content-teaching tools in political
   science, but their effect on students' reasoning skills is rarely
   assessed. This article explores what effect the Statecraft simulation
   might have on undergraduate students' perceptions of their decision
   making. Decisions are often evaluated on the basis of whether their
   outcomes are good or bad, not whether a sound reasoning process was used
   to reach them. A survey was administered at multiple points in an
   international relations course to gauge students' satisfaction with the
   decision-making processes and outcomes in their respective teams during
   the Statecraft simulation. Students also engaged in exercises in which
   their teams' tentative plans were evaluated as if the plans had
   generated unfavorable outcomes after implementation. An analysis of
   students' reactions to the Statecraft simulation, their performance in
   the simulation, and other data showed no obvious association between
   Statecraft and changes in student perceptions of their decision making.},

   run-up to General Election 2010, the party seemed to lose some active
   engagement potential from its online membership because the party was
   ill-equipped to convert weaker forms of online membership in to stronger
   forms offace-to-face participation. The chapter provides the narrative
   of an ethnographer journeying from an online political neophyte to a

Abstract = {This research uses data from a national survey of political science
   department chairs to explore when tenure protects incompetent faculty.
   The characteristics of the responding institutions and the procedures
   and standards they use when evaluating tenure applications were analyzed
   to determine how they related to the protection of the incompetent. The
   results reveal that tenure is most likely to shield incompetent faculty
   when collegiality plays a role in tenure decisions and when departments
   focus on the quantity of articles an applicant publishes. The findings
   also show that when departments demand that candidates publish in
   prestigious journals and when higher authorities at the institution have
   reversed positive departmental tenure recommendations, the probability
   that the incompetent are protected declines.},

   not meant to deny political difference and hawk false unity. Instead we
   want to challenge the luxury of mutual dismissal with the actually
   existing benefits ofmovement dynamism. By dynamismwe mean contributions
   arising from different activist wings and productively interacting to
   increase overall movement power. Our ultimate claim is that the North
   American Left will yield greater success by becoming more self-conscious
   about the concrete benefits of movement dynamism.},

   Neo-republican freedom from domination is a sufficient condition for the

   argue for the advantages of the neo-republican account over the social

Title = {Racing and gendering immigration politics: analyzing contemporary
   immigration enforcement using intersectional analysis},
Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Pages = {202-221},
Abstract = {This article examines racialization and gendering processes at work in
   the proliferation of large-scale immigration raids and military-style
   roundups that affected disproportionately Latina/o immigrants during the
   height of the war on terror. These raids which took place in sensitive
   federal facilities, commercial employment sites, and residences resulted
   in widespread fear and rapid increases in the apprehension, detention,
   and deportations of immigrants. Utilizing an intersectional analysis the
   study dissects three distinct manifestations of race and gender in the
   raids, each of which highlights a different aspect of recent enforcement
   practices, while pointing to different applications of race and gender
   in immigration studies and Political Science: (1) the proliferation of
   Latina immigrants apprehended and placed in detention; (2) the passage
   of gendered legislation facilitating the raids; and (3) the invocation
   of race and gendered discourse within the federal government to justify
   and defend the raids. Ultimately, employing an intersectional approach
   provides a more thorough accounting of the multiple constraints at work
   in immigration politics that is significant to both our understanding of
   the past and efforts to construct reforms for the future.},

Title = {Resisting the Exploitation of Contingent Faculty Labor in the Neoliberal
   University: The Challenge of Building Solidarity between Tenured and
   Non-Tenured Faculty},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Pages = {504-522},
Abstract = {This article explores why tenured faculty, particularly at major public
   and private research universities, often have failed to engage in
   collective resistance to the rise of the neoliberal university and the
   exploitation of ``casualized{''} academic labor. Thirty years of steady
   federal and state cuts in the funding of higher education have led to
   the quasi-privatization of public higher education, with both public and
   private universities viewing themselves as corporate entities that must
   maximize student tuition and corporate and philanthropic revenues while
   minimizing costs. This has led to a massive increase in the number of
   exploited contingent faculty whose precarious working conditions are
   akin to those of low-wage, temporary workers in the rest of the economy.
   This article explores various reasons behind the failure of most tenured
   faculty-particularly the eighty percent not in faculty unions-to engage
   in overt, sustained protest at the radical expansion in casualized
   faculty labor. The article also examines the rise of professional
   administrators as the new governing class of neoliberal universities
   which compete for ``student customers{''} on the basis of amenities and
   ``student life{''} rather than on the basis of educational quality.
   These administrators' drive for ``measurable metrics{''} has contributed
   to an increase in self-interested behavior on the part of a tenured
   faculty who are increasingly rewarded on the basis of ``research
   productivity.{''} While in the short run such a retreat from public life
   by tenured faculty may be rational, in the long run such behavior
   threatens the future existence of tenure, except in the most prestigious
   and well-endowed of private and public institutions. Thus those
   remaining tenured faculty committed to higher education providing a
   quality intellectual experience for all students must work politically
   to ensure that all faculty have humane and secure working conditions and
   manageable teaching loads. In short, tenured faculty committed to a
   future for democratic public education must take up the challenge of
   building solidarity across faculty rank and status.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a research study of Scots living and working in a
   non-English-speaking country, namely the Netherlands, and discusses the
   question of whether the group may be said to constitute a `diaspora'. It
   describes the Scottish community within the Netherlands, which is
   essentially made up of first-generation migrants. Using interview data,
   the paper explores issues of identity and describes the diaspora
   organisations, which have been established, and concludes that the
   Scottish diaspora in the Netherlands (and possibly elsewhere in Europe)
   is mostly of recent origin and has a strong sense of national identity.
   It may not function as a diaspora in the traditionally accepted sense.},

Abstract = {Increasing voter knowledge about government performance has been shown
   to be a key condition for making elections work as an effective
   accountability mechanism in developing countries. Yet, we know little on
   how information on government performance can be transmitted effectively
   to voters in rural areas with underdeveloped media. To shed light on
   this question, we examine how information about local government
   decisions is transmitted to voters in a case study of two municipal
   participatory governance forums. Our results show that a participatory
   governance forum can function as an effective information provision
   mechanism and thus contribute to local government responsiveness. They
   also indicate however that information is not transmitted effectively
   through a participatory governance forum when village representatives
   are unfamiliar with the procedural rules of participatory governance,
   when they lack support by civil society organizations and when the cost
   of attending meetings is high.},

Number = {1},
Pages = {99-118},
Abstract = {Populism is a frequently used yet problematic concept; the term is often
   ill-defined and randomly applied. While these problems have been widely
   acknowledged, this article argues that there are still issues with the
   way populism tends to be used, even if a sound definition is provided.
   This relates to the fact that it is often not clear whether populism is
   used to refer to an ideological feature of an exclusive category of
   political parties or whether populism is seen as a type of discourse
   which can be expressed by any political actor. In order to illustrate
   the difficulties with regard to the application of the term populism,
   several `hard' cases of populism across Europe are discussed. The
   article argues that in order to stimulate a more accurate use of the
   term, observers should be explicit not only about the meaning of
   populism, but also about the form in which it manifests itself.},

Abstract = {Although conflict incidence is likely to be characterized by spatial
   dependence, the scientific literature on conflicts often neglects the
   issue thus, implicitly, assuming independence among observations. We
   argue that such assumption could lead to biased and inconsistent results
   and we provide an exemplary application to the case of the Mano River
   Region (MRR) in West Africa. Once we detected the existence of spatial
   dependence within the distribution of conflict incidence, we introduce
   spatial econometrics techniques in order to explore diffusion paths of
   violence within the region. We firstly project on a spatially
   disaggregated map, built as a regular grid, the conflict occurrence and
   several georeferenced determinants of civil conflicts. Then, we model
   spatial dependence through the introduction of spatial autoregressive
   terms on both dependent and independent variables (SAR and SD Models).
   Across several models, civil conflict is found steadily clustered in
   space with significant spill-over effects on contiguous locations. Among
   other determinants, natural resources - namely diamonds and gold - are
   confirmed as relevant drivers of conflict diffusion and show
   neighbouring effects since their location and proximity may affect
   conflict dynamics.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the impact of good governance in elections compared
   to the role of the economy. The latter is considered the key factor in
   electoral survival, while governance issues are rarely included in
   politicians' discourse or campaigning strategies. Using the ParlGov data
   and the ICRG indicators for 160 elections, the analysis shows that good
   governance matters, but mainly for developing countries. Economic growth
   is an important electoral topic in most of the elections, but its effect
   varies systematically across contexts. The impact of each good
   governance and the economy get weaker as the other worsens, and these
   conditional effects are moderated by the level of economic development.

Abstract = {To what extent do social policy preferences explain party choice? This
   question has received little attention over the past years, because the
   bulk of the literature has argued that electoral choice is increasingly
   shaped by identity-based attitudes, rather than by preferences for
   economic-distributive social policies. We argue that in the wake of this
   debate, the significance of social policy preferences for electoral
   choice has been underestimated, because most contributions neglect
   social policy debates that are specific to post-industrial societies. In
   particular, they merely focus on income redistribution, while neglecting
   distributive conflicts around social investment. The Selects 2011 data
   allows investigating this crucial distinction for Switzerland. Our
   empirical analyses confirm that it is pivotal to take the
   pluridimensionality of distributive conflicts seriously: when looking at
   preferences for social investment rather than income redistribution, we
   find that social policy preferences are significant explanatory factors
   for the choice of the five major Swiss political parties.},

Abstract = {The central hypothesis of the research here presented, regarding cooper
   ation initiatives with developing countries - in particular with African
   Countries of Portuguese Official Language (Palops), implies the
   recognition that although its origin cor responds to a previous process,
   it is since the Labor Party (PT) electoral rise in Brazil that such
   initiatives acquire a new intensity, whose dimension allows conceiving
   them as a rupture. The purpose of understanding Brazilian foreign policy
   changes as a paradigm change, thus, configures an approach to understand
   the approximation movement towards developing countries that does not
   become a hostage to the pragmatism versus ideology dichotomy. In order
   to underpin that thesis, this article is divided in three sections. At
   first we develop some reflections on modernization, development and
   national interest, relating these ideas to the constitution of Brazilian
   foreign policy traditions throughout the 20th century. In the second
   section, in turn, we deal with the concept of International Development
   Cooperation (IDC), approaching its historical genesis and main
   implications. We will then analyze the Brazilian case, addressing
   cooperation and partnership initiatives aiming to establish closer
   relations with Global South countries. To this extent, having the
   political changes occurred in South America during the early 21st as
   backdrop, we will present the notions of Solidarity Diplomacy and
   Responsible Pragmatism as guidelines that structure a new Brazilian
   Foreign Policy approach. Finally, as an offshoot of this new
   perspective, some results of the partnership dynamic established between
   Brazil and Portuguesespeaking countries of the Global South will be
   presented in the last section.},

Abstract = {This article locates the genesis of the recent initiative to create
   minimal levels of social protection worldwide much earlier than
   conventional wisdom. Rather than seeing this initiative as a relatively
   new one, the author argues that it is resurrecting and building upon
   core ideas from the foundation of the postwar international economic
   order in the early 1940s. This argument rests on a major
   reinterpretation of the origins of the 1944 Bretton Woods agreements.
   Drawing on extensive archival work, the author shows that the Bretton
   Woods negotiations were informed by new commitments to provide `social
   security' and `freedom from want' worldwide in ways that echo the
   aspirations of contemporary proponents of the Social Protection Floor
   Initiative. These goals found widespread support not just among leading
   US and British policymakers at the time but also among many officials
   from other countries involved in the Bretton Woods negotiations,
   including those from poor countries. Although this aspect of the Bretton
   Woods vision was de-emphasized after the war, this neglected history
   helps to identify some deep intellectual and political roots of
   contemporary debates.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to address the configuration of the dominant
   identity categories in a Latin American feminine network that has
   historically claimed a lack of public recognition: the Latin American
   and Caribbean Confederation of Household Workers. Working from the
   perspective of political discourse theory presented in the first
   section, we briefly analyze the discourses of emergence and development
   of the Confederation, focusing on women's struggles to be recognized as
   ``household workers.{''} Special attention is given to their (dis)
   articulations, particularly with feminists and Catholic lay sectors, as
   discourses or meaning configurations that conditioned their development
   as a collective subject. From our perspective, these processes of (dis)
   articulation established specific meanings for household workers'
   practices, instituting their limits in relation to other political
   projects available, including those held by feminists. The dominant
   meanings of identity categories have not only enabled specific ways to
   be identified ``as a household worker{''} but also imprinted the limits
   and possibilities of their political practice.},

Abstract = {With the election of an African American as President, many would think
   that the question of affirmative action and equal opportunity has been
   finally laid to rest in the United States. This perception may be true
   for the proponents of affirmative action, whom over the years believe
   that the struggle for civil rights and equal opportunity can only be
   seen to fruition if an African American emerges as President. However,
   the struggle to eliminate racial discrimination and social inequality
   cannot be achieved in one swift. It requires consistent policy
   directions aimed at achieving a balance in the distribution of income.
   This paper looks back into the origin of affirmative action; from the
   executive orders of President Kennedy through the decisions of the
   Supreme Court, and finds that matters of affirmative action have always
   been controversial on whether racial preferences or class distinction
   should be the guiding principle. The argument however, is whether the
   election of Barack Obama as President has reduced the agitation on
   racial preferences, and placed more emphasis on class distinction, as
   his economic and social agenda for broadening the middleclass
   stipulates.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a comparative analysis of the Personalized
   Proportional Representation (PPR) electoral system in the German Lander.
   The analysis examines in how far PPR as a mixed electoral system is able
   to simultaneously ensure both the proportional representation of the
   electorate's interests in parliament as well as a high level of party
   system concentration. With regard to these goals, the empirical analysis
   of all state elections after World War II demonstrates that PPR hardly
   differs from a pure PR system, at least in Germany. Furthermore, the
   analysis shows that the party system would rarely be substantially
   affected by overhang seats. Overall, there is little evidence in the
   German Lander for the superiority of PPR in terms of combining the
   ``best of both worlds{''} as a mixed electoral system.},

Abstract = {In spite of substantial public controversy, very little reliable data
   exists concerning the frequency with which non-citizen immigrants
   participate in United States elections. Although such participation is a
   violation of election laws in most parts of the United States,
   enforcement depends principally on disclosure of citizenship status at
   the time of voter registration. This study examines participation rates
   by non-citizens using a nationally representative sample that includes
   non-citizen immigrants. We find that some non-citizens participate in
   U.S. elections, and that this participation has been large enough to
   change meaningful election outcomes including Electoral College votes,
   and Congressional elections. Non-citizen votes likely gave Senate
   Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order
   to pass health care reform and other Obama administration priorities in
   the 111th Congress. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Extant theoretical work on the political resource curse implies that
   dependence on resource revenues should decrease autocracies' likelihood
   of democratizing but not necessarily affect democracies' chances of
   survival. Yet most previous empirical studies estimate models that are
   ill-suited to address this claim. We improve upon previous studies,
   estimating a dynamic logit model using data from 166 countries, covering
   the period from 1816 to 2006. We find that an increase in resource
   dependence decreases an autocracy's likelihood of being democratic over
   both the short term and long term but has no appreciable effect on
   democracies' likelihood of persisting.},

Title = {Converging on euroscepticism: Online polity contestation during European
   Parliament elections},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {53},
Number = {4},
Pages = {766-783},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Does the increasing politicisation of Europe signify a step towards the
   legitimation of the Union? This could be the case if the increased
   public intensity of debate and polarisation of opinion brought about by
   politicisation do not fragment the audience and if arguments presented
   in public are sufficiently clear about the desired nature of the polity.
   To answer this question, the focus of this article is on dynamic
   contestation in the public sphere using original data of news platforms
   and political blogs in 12 EU Member States and transnational websites
   during the European Parliament election campaign of 2009. The results
   are, first, that diffuse eurosceptic evaluations dominate public debates
   despite large variation in the intensity of debate across Member States.
   Second, a majority of evaluations made, particularly those by citizens
   leaving comments online, are negative in all countries included in this
   study. A gap between elites and citizens persists, but it appears less
   pronounced than often proclaimed in the literature. And third, democracy
   is a primary concern in EU polity contestation, especially for those
   evaluating the EU negatively. Although little evidence is found of a
   fragmentation of audiences, the prominence of diffuse euroscepticism
   poses a major challenge to legitimation of the Union.},

Abstract = {Although the policy diffusion literature comprises a large number of
   methodologically sophisticated papers, very little is known about basic
   issues such as how often states actually look at others' policies, whose
   policies they look at, and when they look. We study policy research
   briefs prepared for legislators to focus on policy knowledge diffusion.
   We find that policy researchers frequently reported on others' policies.
   We also find that factors such as innovativeness and proximity affect
   how often a state's policies are studied. More generally, we find
   evidence of fairly sophisticated learning as policy makers looked at
   others' policies in nuanced and varied ways. Our findings suggests that
   information about policies diffuses through systematic and targeted
   research during the policy-making process. This policy research
   disproportionately focuses on neighbors and states likely to have good
   policies, but it also uncovers ideas from less obvious states.},

Abstract = {The importance of documentary filmmaking as a living medium and its
   historic contribution to recording and preserving Scotland's culture and
   international viewpoint cannot be overstated. But before the digital
   age, where was all this film material stored and what has survived? The
   current debate on film restoration and public access is ongoing and is
   illustrated through this article with my personal introduction to
   veteran BBC film producer James (Jim) Wilson whose enterprising career
   has documented so much of the twentieth century. Reflecting on this
   unique creative achievement, the historical context and value of his
   films, and those of others to society, deserve closer scrutiny.
   Questions need to be raised regarding government policy on film
   preservation and how Lottery funding can further support film
   restoration. Clarification is required, in this case, of possible
   relaxation to certain BBC licensing agreements to stimulate cooperation.
   Discussions are in progress which highlight the growing demand for more
   democratisation and further public access to these celluloid assets
   which can be quickly forgotten or destroyed. It is therefore encouraging
   that new partnerships are being forged to identify and restore the vast
   film collections. Building on the very significant activities of
   Scottish Screen Archive/National Library of Scotland. They deliver
   services on several levels including online film archive
   research/restoration facilities and exhibitions. But there is still a
   great deal of work to be done in this field. The Wilson film legacy is
   one such area and a meeting with BBC has been arranged to discuss the
   future potential of celebrating this special film collection.},

Abstract = {Shape-shifting representation is common in practice but largely shunned
   in theoretical and empirical analysis. This article resurrects, defines,
   and explores shape-shifting and closely linked concepts and practices
   such as shape-retaining. It generates new concepts of representative
   positioning and patterning in order to aid our understanding, and makes
   the case for placing this critical phenomenon front and center in the
   analysis of political representation. It examines crucial empirical and
   normative implications for our understanding of representation,
   including the argument that shape-shifting representation is not
   intrinsically undesirable. Developing the theory of shape-shifting
   representation can prompt a new level of analytical purchase on the
   challenge of explaining and evaluating representation's vitality and
   complexity.},

Abstract = {This study investigates priming effects during the global financial
   crisis that erupted in September 2008. Using two longitudinal data
   sources on public opinion dynamics in Sweden between 2007 and 2010, we
   find no evidence of a basic priming hypothesis. Drawing upon the
   distinction between accessibility and applicability mechanisms, however,
   additional analysis indicates that priming of economic considerations
   was moderated by citizens' attributions of responsibility for current
   economic developments. These results support the notion of priming as a
   two-step process, whereby heavy news coverage of the financial crisis
   increases the accessibility of economic considerations among the
   audience, but whether these considerations are used in government
   approval assessments depends on their perceived applicability as well.},

Abstract = {This article examines the complex matrix of public, political and policy
   debates that were brought to bear on Australia's decision to withdraw
   from Iraq. In analysing the `politics of withdrawal' in Australia, this
   article identifies four dominant frames that served to polarise the
   issue along party-political lines and reduce the complexities of
   Australia's withdrawal to a set of simple polarities (such as `stay the
   course' versus `responsible withdrawal'). Specifically, these frames
   obfuscated an assessment of the myriad challenges facing post-Saddam
   Iraq and the prospects for peace, security and development beyond
   Australia's withdrawal. Understanding the ways in which Australia framed

Abstract = {Classical liberals and libertarians assign fundamental importance to
   economic liberties and champion bottom-up approaches to social welfare.
   They point to the significance, even superiority, of philanthropy in
   providing for society's most disadvantaged citizens, and they defend
   rights of inheritance and intergenerational transmission of wealth. So
   one might think that John Tomasi's ``market democracy{''} would defend
   gift giving and philanthropy. But market democracy leaves far less room
   than might be thought for an enthusiastic defense of gift giving and
   philanthropy, and this distances market democracy more than we might
   expect from the territory of classical liberalism and libertarianism.},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of the polarization that has taken hold in Congress,
   some have pointed to the changing social connectedness of Congressional
   members as a possible cause, effect, or both. In this article, we take
   an initial look at this element of the story by analyzing one aspect of
   change over time in what are known as CODELs. We outline our data
   collection of these foreign trips taken by House members in two distinct
   periods and show how the use, users, and locations of these trips have
   changed. Among other changes, we find that more members are traveling
   than in the past, but that these trips are on average much shorter in
   duration. As a result, members of Congress are spending less time
   together during foreign travel, potentially reducing the opportunities
   for building relationships among them.},

Abstract = {A large body of scholarship has asserted that inequalities in the
   distribution of fixed assets act as a barrier to democratic transitions.
   This article proposes a theoretical and empirical amendment of this
   finding, by arguing that employment conditions in the countryside,
   rather than inequalities in the distribution of fixed assets affected
   electoral outcomes in societies characterized by high levels of rural
   inequality. Using empirical evidence from the Prussian districts of
   Imperial Germany during the period between 1871 and 1912, we show that
   relative labor market shortages of agricultural workers affected
   electoral outcomes under conditions of an imperfect protection of
   electoral secrecy. Shortages of agricultural workers reduced the
   electoral strength of conservative politicians and increased the
   willingness of rural voters to take electoral risks and vote for the
   opposition Social Democratic Party. Labor shortages also affect
   preferences of individual legislators over the reform of electoral
   institutions. We find that politicians in districts experiencing high
   levels of labor shortage, and thus, higher costs of electoral
   intimidation are more willing to support changes in electoral rules that
   increase the protection of electoral secrecy. In theoretical terms, our
   findings contribute to the literature linking rural inequality and
   democratization, by demonstrating the importance of labor scarcity as a
   source of political cleavages over electoral reforms.},

Abstract = {As street-level bureaucrats, poll workers bear the primary
   responsibility for implementing voter identification requirements. Voter
   identification requirements are not implemented equally across groups of
   voters, and poll workers exercise substantial discretion in how they
   apply election law. In states with minimal and varying identification
   requirements, poll workers appear to treat especially minority voters
   differently, requesting more stringent voter identification. We explain
   why poll workers are different from other street-level bureaucrats and
   how traditional mechanisms of control have little impact on limiting
   poll-worker discretion. We test why many poll workers appear not to
   follow the law using a post-election survey of New Mexico poll workers.
   We find little evidence that race, training, or partisanship matters.
   Instead, poll worker attitudes toward photo-identification policies and
   their educational attainment influences implementation of
   voter-identification laws.},

Abstract = {Development of Sustainable Entrepreneurship and Support of Local
   Handicrafts in Rural Azerbaijan' is a joint effort between the Turku
   University of Applied Sciences Ltd. and Sustainable Future in Finland
   and Ekoloji Tarazliq NGO as a local partner, with the aim of creating
   rural businesses and services in order to attract tourists to the three
   project areas. Thus far, most of the tourists in Azerbaijan have been
   business travellers staying in the capital, Baku. The project
   (implemented in 2012-2014) has introduced PPP or public-private
   partnership approaches in the promotion of sustainable tourism through
   the involvement of various stakeholders from small-scale entrepreneurs
   to national level authorities. The most important stakeholder groups are
   the local communities, entrepreneurs, handicraft masters, and owners of
   households providing accommodation services to travelers.
   Several challenges and areas of development in rural tourism have been
   identified: insufficient infrastructure in rural areas, varying quality
   of services, and unclear brands of different regions. Rural tourism has
   great potential in Azerbaijan, but it needs promotion and support,
   especially in organized structures for service design and marketing
   channels, which require strong cooperation on the national and local
   level.
   The project envisages eco-cultural tourism as a concept which emphasizes
   unique environmental conditions and traditional cultural values in order
   to create favorable conditions for tourists; meanwhile it presents
   marginal livelihoods a novel source of income. Sustainability and
   participation are crucial for the long-term future of eco-cultural
   tourism, which could, with strong multilevel cooperation and
   comprehensive service design structures, promote economic development
   and support especially women's participation and role in the tourism
   market of the rural areas.},

Abstract = {Several political theorists argue that states have rights to
   self-determination and these rights justify immigration restrictions.
   Call this: the self-determination argument for immigration restrictions.
   In this article, I develop an objection to the self-determination
   argument. I argue that if it is morally permissible for states to
   restrict immigration because they have rights to self-determination,
   then it can also be morally permissible for states to deport and
   denationalize their own citizens. We can either accept that it is
   permissible for states to deport and denationalize their own citizens or
   reject the self-determination argument. To avoid this implication, we
   should reject the self-determination argument. That is, we should also
   reject the conclusion that rights to self-determination can justify any
   significant immigration restrictions.},

   THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC},
Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2014},
Number = {9},
Pages = {30-48},

Abstract = {This paper examines the employment of religious differences in
   escalating political crises in the Central African Republic (CAR) with
   threats of separatism in the country based on this. When Michel Am
   Nondroko Djotodia seized power through the Seleka rebellion in March
   2013 and then abdicated the `hot potato,' the crises during and after
   his abdication became intensely religious and on a scale unknown in the
   history of the country. From then on, there have been repeated threats
   of separation of Muslims from the predominantly Christian population.
   The Seleka rebels and fighters who also have some non-Muslims have been
   associated with Islam, and the anti-balaka is constituted of mainly
   Christian and non-Christian militias. The tussle for leadership and
   control of the CAR between the Seleka and anti-balaka rival movements
   has been motivated by religion. This has contributed in making the CAR a
   failed state with recurrent scenes of violence, killings, and
   displacements. Through a content analysis of the literature on the
   religious dimension of the crisis, we will examine the reasons for and
   threats of a split in a country with xenophobic religious differences
   and political volatility.},

Abstract = {Why did public sector unionization rise so dramatically and then plateau
   at the same time as private sector unionization underwent a precipitous
   decline? The exclusion of public sector employees from the centerpiece
   of private sector labor law-the 1935 Wagner Act-divided U.S. labor law
   and relegated public sector demand-making to the states. Consequently,
   public sector employees' collective bargaining rights were slow to
   develop and remain geographically concentrated, unequal and vulnerable.
   Further, divided labor law put the two movements out of alignment;
   private sector union density peaked nearly a decade before the first
   major statutes granting public sector collective bargaining rights
   passed. As a result of this incongruent timing and sequencing, the
   United States has never had a strong union movement comprised of both
   sectors at the height of their membership and influence.},

Abstract = {Some competent political actors, primarily young people and the
   cognitively impaired, are excluded from political participation by
   modern liberal democratic states. This exclusion occurs because the
   means utilized by states to distinguish between competent citizens (who
   must be included) and incompetent ones (who may be excluded) are
   imperfect. They include age restrictions on enfranchisement and,
   commonly, legal restrictions on enfranchisement for those with cognitive
   disabilities. Capacity-testing provides a means to improve on these
   existing mechanisms for exclusion. It is not, however, often suggested,
   nor seen as viable. Here, I argue that we should utilize
   capacity-testing to more effectively include capable citizens in our
   democratic practice. I defend a particular scope and kind of
   capacity-testing against common objections.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In spite of widespread interest in the effects of electoral
   institutions, research has largely missed, or misspecified, the
   `theoretical link' tying legislators' behaviour to the rules' formal
   properties. District magnitude, in particular, can operate through the
   number of candidates running under the same party label and the number
   of votes required to win (re)election. Using data from the PARTIREP
   cross-national legislator survey in 15 European democracies, the article
   demonstrates that district magnitude is a proxy of different processes
   in closed-list and open-list systems. The findings contribute to a
   better understanding of how the mechanical effects of electoral
   institutions translate into incentives on the part of legislators to
   cultivate a personal reputation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The 113th Congress has a record number of racial and ethnic minorities
   serving on Capitol Hill. Using the 2008 Cooperative Congressional
   Election Study (CCES), we examine what this increased descriptive
   representation of racial minorities means for legislative responsiveness
   and citizen representative communication in the U.S. House. We argue
   that descriptive representation will improve the constituent legislator
   relationship across racial groups, but that shared race should matter
   more for blacks and Latinos as racial minorities unaccustomed to
   legislative responsiveness. Our findings follow these expectations and
   suggest that the presence or lack of descriptive representation is an
   integral part of how citizens experience representation in the U.S.

Abstract = {Does candidate sex matter to general election outcomes? And if so, under
   what conditions does sex exert an effect? Research conducted over the
   past 40 years has asserted an absence of a sex effect, consistently
   finding that women fare as well as men when they run. Nevertheless, this
   scholarship neglects sex-based differences in candidate valence, or
   non-policy characteristics such as competence and integrity that voters
   intrinsically value in their elected officials. If women candidates hold
   greater valence than men, and if women's electoral success stems from
   this valence advantage, then women candidates would be penalized if they
   lacked the upper hand on valence. Recent research at the macro-level
   reports a 3 \% vote disadvantage for women candidates when valence is
   held constant (Fulton, Political Res Q 65(2):303-314, 2012), but is
   based on only one general election year. The present study replicates
   Fulton's (Political Res Q 65(2):303-314, 2012) research using new data
   from a more recent general election and finds a consistent 3 \% vote
   deficit for women candidates. In addition, this paper extends these
   findings theoretically and empirically to the micro-level: examining who
   responds to variations in candidate sex and valence. Male independent
   voters, who often swing general elections, are equally supportive of
   women candidates when they have a valence advantage. Absent a relative
   abundance of valence, male independents are significantly less likely to
   endorse female candidates. If correct, the gender affinity effect is
   asymmetrical: male independent voters are more likely to support men
   candidates, and less likely to support women, but female independents
   fail to similarly discriminate.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the pioneering work of Anthony Downs, political scientists
   have tended to characterize American politics as a game among
   undifferentiated competitors, played out largely through elections, with
   outcomes reflecting how formal rules translate election results into
   legislative votes. In this perspective, voters, campaigns, elections,
   and the ideological distribution of legislators merit extensive
   scrutiny. Other features of the political environment-most notably, the
   policies these legislators help create and the interest groups that
   struggle over these policies-are deemed largely peripheral. However,
   contemporary politics often looks very different than the world
   described by Downs. Instead, it more closely resembles the world
   depicted by E. E. Schattschneider-a world in which policy and groups
   loom large, the influence of voters is highly conditional, and the key
   struggle is not over gaining office but over reshaping governance. Over
   the last twenty years, a growing body of scholarship has emerged that
   advances this corrective vision-an approach we call ``policy-focused
   political science.{''} In this framework, politics is centrally about
   the exercise of government authority for particular substantive
   purposes. Such exercises of authority create the ``terrain{''} for
   political struggle, profoundly shaping both individual and group
   political behavior. More important, because policies can be so
   consequential, they also serve as the ``prize{''} for many of the most
   enduring political players, especially organized interest groups. The
   payoffs of a policy-focused perspective include a more accurate
   portrayal of the institutional environment of modern politics, an
   appreciation for the fundamental importance of organized groups, a
   better understanding of the dynamics of policy change, and a more
   accurate mapping of interests, strategies, and influence. These benefits
   are illustrated through brief examinations of two of the biggest changes
   in American politics over the last generation: asymmetric partisan
   polarization and the growing concentration of income at the top.},

Abstract = {Since the annexation of the Crimea in March 2014, the Crimean Tatars
   have been under fire. Moscow may have initially used the carrot in order
   to break their nonviolent resistance to the annexation of the Tartar
   homeland to Russia. But soon thereafter, the new authorities in
   Simferopol, under the nationalist Segel Aksenov, turned to repression.
   Leading Crimean Tatar politicians are denied entry to the Crimea; others
   are defamed as Islamist extremists. House searches serve to intimidate;
   Crimean media outlets have been closed. Crimean Tatar autonomy is at
   risk of being dissolved, while the founding of a parallel muftiate
   engineered by Moscow serves to promote religious schism.},

   public opinion data from Roy Morgan. The article asks: is policy
   congruent with public opinion in Australia? In addressing this question,
   we examine to what extent policy accords with the preferences of the
   public. This in turn provides us with some answers about how
   representative Australian democracy is, as well as contributing to an
   international debate about the responsiveness of policy to public
   opinion.},

Title = {Comparison of the recruitment process when appointing officials in
   Iceland before and after the economic collapse},
Journal = {ICELANDIC REVIEW OF POLITICS \& ADMINISTRATION},

Abstract = {This research examines the recruitment process prior to appointment of
   officials during the period of 2004 to 2012. This research investigates
   wheather a change has occurred in the recruiting process following the
   economic collapse in the fall of 2008. It is intended to provide insight
   into the official recruiting process. In all there were 68 appointments
   during the research period, 40 before the economic collapse and 28 after
   the collapse, which met the criteria of 13th paragraph in 22nd article
   of employment laws, no. 70/1996. Content analysis, which is a
   combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods, was used
   for processing and analyzing the data. The study investigates whether
   the job advertisements fulfill the criteria about job advertisments like
   they appear in regulations no. 464/1996 about job advertisements.
   Whether job advertisements for vacant jobs were published in
   Logbirtingabladid (Iceland's Legal Publication Journal), whether the
   application deadline were according to 7th article og the employment
   laws, whether special recruiting committees were used for professional
   support and finally the length of the recruitment process. The main
   results of this research indicate that there has been improvement in the
   recruiting process during the chosen research period. Following the
   economic collapse the execution of job advertisements have improved as
   the publication of job advertisements in Logbirtingabladid was in most
   cases complied with laws and regulations. The application deadline was
   more often correctly indicated after the collapse, and special
   recruiting committees were more often used than the law stipulated. The
   recruitment process has however become longer after the economic
   collapse.},

Abstract = {This article aims to depict how the EU policymaking process affects the
   knowledge-broker role of EU think tanks. To this end, I examine the
   organisational and output strategies of 22 EU think tanks-think tanks
   sharing a EU-transnational origin, an interest in EU subjects, and the
   intention to contribute to EU policymaking. I argue that certain aspects
   of EU policymaking, (a) the emphasis on participative processes that
   foster linkage and exchange activities, (b) concern with stakeholder
   representatives, (c) development frameworks for knowledge management for
   particular policy actors, and (d) lack of an overarching European public
   sphere, affect the knowledge-broker role of EU think tanks. As a result,
   EU think tanks concentrate on customised knowledge management and
   platform development and dissemination among target publics in order to
   appeal to partners, members and sponsors and thereby secure funding and
   reputation.},

Abstract = {This article examines the asymmetry in local government responses to
   economic-cycle-based changes of state aid in a framework that
   distinguishes current outlay from noncurrent expenses and discretionary
   savings. Employing a panel dataset of Massachusetts municipalities for
   two economic cycles, we obtain three findings. First, we do not find
   evidence of property-tax relief during economic booms. Second,
   discretionary savings may be used to cover noncurrent outlays during
   booms and to offset spending cuts during recessions. Finally, we find a
   large (asymmetric) fiscal inducement that may emerge during recessions
   when state aid cuts coincide with property-tax shortfalls. While these
   context-specific results may not be easily generalizable, they
   necessitate further research into the role of local discretionary
   savings and cash reserves in intergovernmental fiscal relations.},

Abstract = {The article discusses the history of life, before and after the coup of
   1973, four students from the Technical State University (1947-1981) who
   shared membership in the Communist Youth political practices. Through
   the development of semi-structured interviews, the research includes the
   testimonies, paths and common experiences of a militant base, who in
   1973 was president of the Federation of Students of the UTE (FEUT) in
   Santiago and Concepcien, and a young communist when military
   intervention was serving with the military Service in Antofagasta,
   having to do work as custodian of his fellow prisoners in the former
   university of Chacabuco saltpeter. This last story is the backbone of
   other life experiences. From their statements, the impact that they had
   the hit and its determinant role of actions taken after three of them
   free to leave the camps where they were held and the fourth was `
   discharged' analyzes of his military service.},

   This effect is weakened by minority group size. We then examine whether
   the adoption of voter ID regulations affects turnout across racial
   groups. Our analysis, using state-level data and the Current Population
   Survey (CPS) November Supplement File (NSF) for 1980 to 2010, offers

Abstract = {The Euro-Atlantic security situation is more complicated than it has
   been since the end of the Cold War. There are major security challenges
   pressing in on Alliance territory across an arc from east to south, and
   those challenges risk spreading into NATO countries themselves.
   Particularly due to events in Ukraine, NATO is faced with its most
   difficult relationship with Russia since the end of the Cold War. NATO
   does not seek confrontation and poses no threat to Russia. NATO's
   objective remains to encourage Russia to choose a path of cooperation
   and responsible behavior, to be a country that works within the
   international community to solve common problems. The situation to
   NATO's south and southeast is no less dramatic. NATO's core purpose is
   to defend Alliance territory and populations; NATO is reinforcing its
   defenses, stepping up cooperation with partners, and reaching out
   politically to meet these new challenges and carry out that mission.},

Abstract = {What are the dynamics of distributive politics in a setting of
   multiparty competition? Existing studies on the allocation of resources
   across multiple electoral districts focus primarily on a setting of
   two-party competition and consider only the core versus swing district
   hypotheses. This framework does not correspond to the actual electoral
   setting in many countries and ignores valuable information furnished by
   a context of multiparty competition. Compared with two-party elections,
   multiparty elections provide more information about the underlying
   distribution of the ideological preferences of voters in a district;
   this information could be utilized by the incumbent party to maximize
   electoral returns. In this article, I argue that a setting of multiparty
   competition presents incentives to the incumbent party to channel
   disproportionately more resources to districts with an ideologically
   close challenger. Systematic evidence from the Conditional Cash Transfer
   program spending in 878 districts of Turkey from 2005 to 2008 supports
   this hypothesis.},

   some in the US a `no' vote would be greeted with relief given these

   escaping England's imperium, a narrative clearly echoing America's own
   founding story. This article explores commentary in the US press and
   media as well as reporting evidence from on-going interviews with the

Abstract = {Networks famously epitomize the shift from `government' to `governance'
   as governing structures for exercising control and coordination besides
   hierarchies and markets. Their distinctive features are their
   horizontality, the interdependence among member actors and an
   interactive decision-making style. Networks are expected to increase the
   problem-solving capacity of political systems in a context of growing
   social complexity, where political authority is increasingly fragmented
   across territorial and functional levels. However, very little attention
   has been given so far to another crucial implication of network
   governance - that is, the effects of networks on their members. To
   explore this important question, this article examines the effects of
   membership in European regulatory networks on two crucial attributes of
   member agencies, which are in charge of regulating finance, energy,
   telecommunications and competition: organisational growth and their
   regulatory powers. Panel analysis applied to data on 118 agencies during
   a ten-year period and semi-structured interviews provide mixed support
   regarding the expectation of organisational growth while strongly
   confirming the positive effect of networks on the increase of the
   regulatory powers attributed to member agencies.},

Title = {Post-Cabinet Careers of Regional Ministers in Germany, 1990-2011},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {157-173},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {The study of ministerial careers in Germany is rather new. So far it has
   been mainly restricted to the federal level and to the career pathways
   up until cabinet exit. This article, by contrast, concentrates on the
   post-cabinet careers of regional ministers. Drawing from the scarce
   literature we first sketch out career patterns of regional ministers
   prior to and during their time in the regional cabinet. The main focus,
   though, is on the post-cabinet biographies of all regional ministers in
   the sixteen German Lander since unification. Our empirical analysis
   reveals the regional cabinet as the career apex for most ministers.
   Looking at those ministers who do move up the political ladder after
   leaving the cabinet shows a clear preference for the national over the
   European level and the executive office over the legislative mandate.
   Variation in post-cabinet careers seems not only to be influenced by
   party, Land and ministerial office (Prime Minister vs normal minister)
   but also by the causes and circumstances of exit from the cabinet (exit
   type). These empirical results represent a first step into a new
   research field - lying waste since Blondel's early attempt in 1991 - and
   will hopefully provide a starting point for more comprehensive and
   comparative analysis.},

Abstract = {Among Russia's ``New Left{''}, a school is emerging whose members
   describe themselves as post-Soviet Marxists. They represent different
   views on the failure of Soviet socialism. They largely agree that
   worldwide protest movements will force a future communist society
   liberated from all constraints. They already see this in the ``people's
   republics{''} of the Donbass. However, they are unable to offer a
   political system that prevents the seizure of power by new dictators or
   an economic model for this future socialism. While they attract interest
   in Russia's academic circles, which are nostalgic for the Soviet era,
   their influence in the West is marginal. There, the theses of Michael
   Hardt and Antonio Negri for a future harmonious world community stir
   more attention.},

Abstract = {Did religion promote or discourage participation in protest against
   authoritarian regimes during the Arab Spring? Using unique data
   collected in Tunisia and Egypt soon after the fall of their respective
   regimes, we examine how various dimensions of religiosity were
   associated with higher or lower levels of protest during these important
   events. Using these original new data, we reach a novel conclusion:
   Qur'an reading, not mosque attendance, is robustly associated with a
   considerable increase in the likelihood of participating in protest.
   Furthermore, this relationship is not simply a function of support for
   political Islam. Evidence suggests that motivation mechanisms rather
   than political resources are the reason behind this result. Qur'an
   readers are more sensitive to inequities and more supportive of
   democracy than are nonreaders. These findings suggest a powerful new set
   of mechanisms by which religion may, in fact, help to structure
   political protest more generally.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to offer an overview of the relevant
   literature devoted to the constitutional implications of the European
   Union (EU) crisis. My analysis explores the main scholarly views on the
   mutations of the constitutional structure of the Union produced by the
   crisis. To this purpose I do not conceive ``constitutional mutation{''}
   as a complete rupture from the past and in fact in this piece I shall
   try to stress both continuities and discontinuities with the traditional
   understanding of the EU constitutionalization process.},

Abstract = {Hostility towards the process of European integration is generally
   considered to constitute one of the hallmarks of the far right `family'
   in Europe. This article acknowledges such opposition but it also
   recognises that the rhetoric is often at odds with actual policy
   activities and aspirations. Not only have far right parties long
   advocated greater European inter-party co-operation but they are now
   actively pursuing engagement with the European Union, especially the
   European Parliament, as a means of advancing their own strategic
   interests and boosting their finances. This article focuses on one far
   right party, namely the British National Party (BNP) and examines the
   party's approach towards the EU, its activities within the EP and its
   efforts to boost pan European cooperation through the new Alliance of
   European National Movements (AENM). It argues that the party's
   engagement with the European Union may have allowed the BNP to take
   advantage of new political opportunity structures but in turn, opened it
   up to Europeanization and made it increasingly dependent on the EU.},

Abstract = {This article examines financial innovation as a source of structural
   power of finance originally identified by Susan Strange. I build a
   synthesis based on complex network theory and the field of evolutionary
   finance which yields a conception of finance as a complex ecological
   habitat. On the one hand, the interaction between various entities
   inhabiting the financial system endows this complex habitat with a
   tangible degree of autonomy vis-a-vis politics, society and economy. On
   the other hand, the evolutionary process guiding this financial ecology
   is built on complexity and innovation and hence is fragile. The
   structural power of finance today, therefore, is necessarily twofold: it
   manifests the effects of the endeavours (intentional and otherwise) of
   financial agents; crucially, it also rests on the seemingly boundless
   ability of the financial system to adapt, change and evolve.},

Abstract = {Comparing bank rescue schemes in France and Germany during the banking
   crisis of 2008-9, this article argues that collective inaction is a
   little-studied aspect in the exercise of power in business-government
   relations. Contrary to studies that focus on lobbying, structural power
   or the influence of beliefs, the comparison highlights that governments
   depend on contributions from the financial industry during crisis
   management. In the negotiations to design bank support schemes, some
   countries, such as France, succeeded in engaging their financial sector
   collectively. Such public-private burden-sharing arrangements alleviate
   the public budget and increase mutual surveillance between banks during
   government support. In other countries, such as Germany, a collectively
   organized industry response failed, which forced the government to
   design an entirely public support scheme. The German government reacted
   to this perceived imbalance by imposing tighter banking regulation to
   avoid a repetition of the impotence it experienced in 2008.},

Abstract = {The interest group concept is defined in many different ways in the
   existing literature and a range of different classification schemes are
   employed. This complicates comparisons between different studies and
   their findings. One of the important tasks faced by interest group
   scholars engaged in large-N studies is therefore to define the concept
   of an interest group and to determine which classification scheme to use
   for different group types. After reviewing the existing literature, this
   article sets out to compare different approaches to defining and
   classifying interest groups with a sample of lobbying actors coded
   according to different coding schemes. We systematically assess the
   performance of different schemes by comparing how actor types in the
   different schemes differ with respect to a number of background
   characteristics. This is done in a two-stage approach where we first
   cluster actors according to a number of key background characteristics
   and second assess how the categories of the different interest group
   typologies relate to these clusters. We demonstrate that background
   characteristics do align to a certain extent with certain interest group
   types but also find important differences in the organizational
   attributes of specific interest group types. As expected, our comparison
   of coding schemes reveals a closer link between group attributes and
   group type in narrower classification schemes based on group
   organizational characteristics than those based on a behavioral
   definition of lobbying.},

Abstract = {The fiscal rules of the Stability and Growth Pact on deficit and debt
   have become the focus of many scholarly works in the past 15 years. The
   study of domestic fiscal rules, however, has remained a neglected part
   of research. The new Treaty on the EMU's Stability, Cooperation and
   Governance (TSCG) makes the analysis of domestic fiscal rules highly
   relevant since the Treaty requires member states to adopt a balanced
   budget rule. By analysing domestic fiscal rules in EU member states on
   the one hand and the fiscal compact on the other hand, the paper intends
   to show that without a strong political commitment and national
   ownership, no fiscal rule can be effective enough. Therefore, the new
   TSCG should be strengthened in this particular aspect.},

Title = {The world upside down: Delegitimising political finance regulation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {355-375},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Political finance regulation is often praised in terms of its ability to
   introduce equality among political parties, to create more transparent
   political parties and to lower the influence of affluent donors on the
   political decision-making process. Little examination exists, however,
   of the effectiveness of this type of regulation. This article aims to
   fill this gap by addressing whether and to what extent different types
   of public funding regulation have improved the legitimacy of political
   parties by improving their image in terms of corruption. Towards this
   end, and focusing on both European and Latin American democracies, this
   article investigates whether a relationship indeed exists between the
   perceived corruption of political parties and the regulation of
   political finance. It finds such a relationship does exist, although not
   in the direction commonly stipulated by the advocates of party finance
   regulation.},

Abstract = {In recent years, judicial nominations to lower federal courts have been
   blocked privately by negative blue slips returned by home state
   senators. We examine the conditions under which senators return negative
   blue slips and discover two results. First, consistent with existing
   work, ideology plays a strong role in blue slipping. Second, and more
   important, we find that nominee qualifications mitigate ideological
   extremism-but only for district court nominees. That is, in the past,
   presidents could use legal credentials to prop up district court and
   circuit court nominees who shared his views. Today, in a Senate marked
   by high polarization and few moderates, the president cannot.},

Title = {Methodological Background of Post-Soviet Regionalism: The Case of
   Ukraine},
Journal = {BALTIC JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {20-33},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The transformational 1990s significantly differentiated the regional
   model of Ukraine, which eventually began to resemble a system of
   uncontrolled chronic economic decline, as the existing planning and
   regulatory methods had become redundant, the market-based approaches
   being not actualized. The methodological vacuum in which Ukraine found
   itself did not allow regions to solve the existing problems by means of
   European economic convergence instruments. Despite the fact that more
   and more theories and concepts appeared in the leading developed
   countries (regional competitiveness, city-region, beautiful places,
   creative city, localization, etc.), national science used outdated ideas
   of planned regulation, inappropriate in market economy. The effect of
   government policies resembled core measures of the neoliberal model,
   while maintaining a high degree of administrative centralization.
   FDI inflow fundamentally altered the regional landscape. The leading
   position in accumulating the FDI stock belonged to Kyiv, which also
   produced the largest per capita GDP. In the last five years a revival of
   innovation activity took place in the Ukrainian regions. Eventually it
   obtained an undulating character, moving basically along two axes:
   Lviv-Kyiv and Kyiv-Kharkiv. However, low FDI level in the worst
   performing regions could create an erroneous impression about the
   positive impact of FDI on regional economy.
   A region's development trajectory might also be affected by the
   mentality of its inhabitants, as well as the media, whose impact can
   convey either a cohesive or disintegrating character. This was evidenced
   by the recent events in Ukraine, as well as the ``East versus West{''}
   confrontation, which resulted in frustration, whereas the lack of
   tolerance among the population of certain regions provoked the
   bloodshed. Thus, identification of methodological background of
   post-Soviet regionalism on the example of Ukraine is an important
   scientific task, which may explain the essence of regional asymmetries
   in the post-Soviet states.},

Title = {All quiet on election day? International election observation and
   incentives for pre-election violence in African elections},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {34},
Pages = {232-243},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article argues that the increasing international interest in
   elections as exemplified by the rise of international election
   monitoring induces temporal shifts in the use of violent intimidation by
   political actors. The presence of international electoral missions
   lowers the potential for election-day violence relative to the
   pre-election period because domestic actors likely refrain from
   intimidating opposition candidates or voters before the eyes of
   international observers, but creates incentives for political actors to
   engage in violent manipulation in parts of the electoral process
   receiving considerably less international attention, such as the
   pre-election period. The article expects that international election
   observation increases the incidence of violent manipulation during
   electoral campaigns. An empirical analysis of election-related violence
   for African elections in the 1990-2009 period shows that the presence of
   election observers increases the incidence of pre-election violence, but
   has no effect on election-day violence. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

   action from the American foreign policy toolkit. Indeed, Obama has opted
   not to use any sort of military action or assistance on multiple
   occasions. In this article, Jeffrey lays out a specific agenda Obama
   could implement for a stronger American foreign policy: a continued
   focus on diplomacy, with careful consideration of military options.},

Abstract = {This study explores the relationship between electoral participation and
   income redistribution by way of social transfers, using data from the
   European Social Survey, the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, and
   the Luxembourg Income Study. It extends previous research by measuring
   the income skew of turnout rather than using average turnout as a proxy
   for its income bias. We find that, controlling for a number of other
   variables, the income skew of turnout is negatively related to transfer
   redistribution and that electoral participation by those in poverty is
   positively associated with redistribution in their favor.},

Abstract = {Native peoples in North America, Australia and New Zealand have
   (sometimes successfully) demanded compensation for seizures of their
   ancestral lands. This article sets out the arguments against restitution
   in these and other cases. It then offers up a defense of ``in kind{''}
   restitution, that is, the return of lands or other property
   misappropriated. As a pertinent case study this article narrates the
   story of the Sioux tribes of the mid-western United States. They have
   sought to recover lands in and around the Black Hills of South Dakota.
   Offering a view of the historical and contemporary collective cultural
   and spiritual significance of the Black Hills and the history of
   dispossession therefrom, this article traces the Sioux's individual and
   tribal efforts both through the legal system and the courts and into the
   US federal government where a bill was unsuccessfully put forward in an
   effort to resolve their claims.},

Abstract = {Polarized parties, politics, and policies at the federal and state
   levels of government continue to affect the nature of federalism and
   intergovernmental relations in the United States. Although polarization
   and fragmentation are prevalent, there are important instances of
   cooperation and collaboration. But bottom-up state activism has yielded
   polarized policies across the states in important issue areas such as
   same-sex marriage and marijuana policy. And even as states collaborate
   on implementation of the Common Core standards for K-12 education, the
   rhetoric remains politicized. The effects of polarization have also been
   significant for fiscal policies and budgeting. We conclude that, even as
   states push forward their agendas in light of a gridlocked national
   government, federalism faces continued challenges, remaining fragmented
   in both theory and practice.},

Abstract = {Though elite-based campaign mobilization was thought to be dead just a
   few election cycles ago, it has come roaring back in recent years. The
   vast majority of this direct voter outreach is coordinated through
   campaign field offices. Despite the increasing importance of such
   activities, little is known about where campaigns choose to locate these
   field offices and what effect campaign offices have on election
   outcomes. We develop a theoretical argument about where candidates will
   locate these offices, and test our argument using data from recent
   elections. We also show that these field offices increase county-level
   vote share by approximately 1\%, netting Obama approximately 275,000
   additional votes in the 2008 election. We conclude by discussing the
   normative implications of increased campaign investment in field
   operations.},

Volume = {53},

Abstract = {Are electorally vulnerable politicians really less likely to support
   controversial legislation, such as pension reforms? While the literature
   on welfare state retrenchment has increasingly pointed to the role of
   electoral factors in the dynamics of social policy cutbacks, there are
   few studies that actually measure the magnitude of electoral pressure
   and its consequent impact on the politics of reform. To this end, the
   authors have developed a quantitative measure of the electoral
   vulnerability of politicians and tested its impact on pension reform
   outcomes using an original dataset comprising 16 Western European
   countries from 1980 to 2003. In line with expectations, the results show
   that the impact of electoral vulnerability on reform depends upon the
   system of interest intermediation. In corporatist systems, electoral
   vulnerability indeed impedes reform. But in pluralist systems, increased
   electoral vulnerability is associated with higher levels of reform. This
   is because unions in corporatist (but not in pluralist) systems can
   exploit electoral vulnerability in pre-legislative bargaining, and thus
   pressure politicians. Consequently, this study has broader implications
   for the differential responsiveness of democracies to redistributive
   issues more generally.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of
   Europeanisation studies when used to study periods of crisis. The
   conceptual consensus surrounding the definition of `Europeanisation',
   understood as the impact of European integration at the domestic level
   (the so-called `top-down approach'), is put under pressure in a crisis
   situation, where the salience of an issue increases and leads to high
   politicisation and resistances at the domestic level. These resistances
   trigger the political adjustments at the European Union (EU) level. The
   article will illustrate these difficulties in analysing the impact of
   the EU's new economic governance instruments: the implementation of
   these instruments has led to opposition at the domestic level, which
   then immediately influences policy frames at the EU level. Based on the
   concepts of `timing' and `politicisation', this article will develop a
   model that enlarges the top-down Europeanisation concept in order to
   account for crucial feedback loops that occur in situations of crisis.},

Abstract = {Collective memory research examines how the process of individual memory
   formation is a social and collective experience, rather than one that is
   wholly psychological and individual. The stories that societies tell
   about themselves are an important part of this process, as they seek to
   socialize new members into the national community. But sometimes that
   national history is very difficult to deal with. Most collective memory
   research is based on a single case study approach. What is lacking in
   collective memory research, although not absent, are broader comparative
   studies.
   This article develops a general model for the process of collective
   memory formation, which I can then use in my ongoing empirical research
   into how several different authoritarian and democratic societies with
   Eastern and Western cultural traditions have dealt with their violent
   histories. The cases include Germany (East and West), Japan, Turkey,
   Yugoslavia and Spain. In this article, I develop a general model of
   collective memory formation while drawing upon these five cases to
   illustrate different points. While democratic societies have a greater
   potential for dealing more fully with their difficult histories, it is
   far from guaranteed that they will do so.},

Abstract = {Every year thousands of Mexicans travel to Canada to work in Canadian
   fields and greenhouses under the Mexico-Canada Seasonal Agricultural
   Worker Program. While the programme is often praised, it has also been
   the subject of persistent criticism about its failure to meet certain
   human rights standards. In this article, we examine the legal strategies
   civil society advocates of migrant workers have adopted to promote
   migrant workers' rights in Canada. Specifically, we examine legal
   struggles undertaken by the United Food and Commercial Workers union to
   challenge Ontario government legislation that does not permit collective
   bargaining by farmworkers in the province. We argue that this case
   demonstrates that despite the fact that many of the workers involved are
   transnationalized, appeals to international bodies or to international
   human rights standards have been of limited utility in promoting their
   rights. Despite frequent arguments about the increased relevance of
   international human rights and citizenship norms and transnational human
   rights advocacy, in this case the national and sub-national scales
   remain predominant. The result, we argue, is a form of domestic
   transnationalism', in which domestic political actors engage in advocacy
   within domestic legal institutions to promote the rights of a
   transnational mobile labour force.},

Abstract = {Republicans hold that freedom is non-domination rather than
   non-interference. This entails that any instance of interference that
   does not involve domination is not freedom-lessening. The case for
   thinking of freedom as non-domination proceeds mostly by way of a
   handful of highly compelling cases in which it seems intuitive to say of
   some person that he or she is unfree despite being in fact free from
   interference. In this essay, I call attention to a kind of case which
   directs attention to what seems to me to be a highly counterintuitive
   element of the republican conception of freedom.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on a particular aspect dear to theories of
   democracy in general and theories of representation in particular: the
   tension between responsiveness and responsibility affecting political
   parties in modern, liberal democracies. In doing so, it engages with
   Peter Mair's intellectual passion for this topic, which he developed
   over the years and intensively worked on until his premature death in
   2011. He argued that this tension became ever more apparent, putting the
   very functioning and legitimacy of democratic government under great
   pressure. This contribution goes back in time, to the very beginning of
   the modern state, and argues that already the nascent parties and party
   systems were affected by the tension between responsiveness and
   responsibility. It then offers a synopsis, organised in a series of
   pictures' or frames' of the historical parcours along which this tension
   has impacted on the development of political parties. The article also
   presents and summarises the collective effort undertaken by a number of
   scholars, coming together to honour Peter Mair's work, to shed further
   theoretical and empirical light on this fundamental tension.},

Abstract = {This article explores the tensions Peter Mair identified between
   responsible and responsive government in relation to the constraints and
   opportunities of an internationally integrated and instituted economy.
   Drawing on the example of the short period of democratic stability and
   its subsequent breakdown in the Weimar Republic, the article argues that
   in Weimar Germany's golden twenties', governments could bridge the gap
   between responsibility - defined as a commitment to deep international
   integration - and responsiveness to its citizens mainly through the
   availability of cheap credits. With the onset of the Great Depression,
   responsible government became tantamount to increasingly drastic
   austerity policies. These policies were not only an economic failure,
   they also made the gap between responsible and responsive government
   unbridgeable. The article also shows how a similar cycle of good and bad
   times, with similar consequences with regard to the tensions between
   responsible and responsive government seem to have occurred in the
   crisis that has been affecting the Eurozone since 2009.},

Abstract = {Most explanations of party system stability focus on the strength of
   mass-elite linkages. We highlight the role of institutions, focusing on
   how electoral rules and elected institutions, especially the presidency,
   impact elites' incentives to coordinate on a stable set of parties or to
   form new parties, thus affecting electoral volatility. Using Central and
   Eastern European elections data, we find that directly elected
   presidents increase volatility and that presidential power magnifies
   this effect. Absent a directly elected president, high district
   magnitude is associated with increased volatility, but district
   magnitude dampens the impact of an elected president on volatility;
   hence, our findings underscore the interactive impact of institutions on
   party systems. We also find evidence that bicameralism and concurrence
   of presidential and parliamentary elections decrease electoral
   volatility. Our model not only explains persistently high electoral
   volatility in Eastern Europe, but the extreme stability of Western
   European party systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Social movement scholars have struggled with the question how abstract
   political opportunities affect activists without much knowledge of
   politics. We argue that the relationship between institutional
   opportunities and mobilization may take the form of trickle-down
   politics. In this view, activists are affected by political
   opportunities indirectly through the changes that political developments
   bring about in the immediate setting of protest. The political climate
   determines the distance between general public opinion and activists'
   view on society. The smaller this distance, the more likely it becomes
   that activists receive positive feedback, which results in further
   mobilization. We investigate how activists are influenced by bystander
   responses that are evoked by the wider political context. Statistical
   models indeed indicate that spatiotemporal fluctuations in political
   opportunities and public sentiments are translated into mobilization
   after activists receive feedback from bystanders. This suggests that
   bystander responses play a crucial role in linking political
   opportunities to mobilization.},

Abstract = {This article concerns whether and how political candidates adopt social
   media in their election campaigns. For campaigns, the openness and
   interactivity of social media tools bring about risks in terms of losing
   control over the message. Departing from a cost-benefit perspective,
   this study addresses the question as to whether certain groups of
   candidates - differing in incumbency status, party type, gender,
   generation and urbanization level of the constituency - are more prone
   to adopt and utilize new social media tools and practices. In order to
   study how candidates approach social media in an early stage when the
   benefits are uncertain and the risks are apparent, candidate blogging in
   the 2007 Finnish national elections is examined. The findings show that
   the candidates generally were not ready to pursue the full potential of
   blogs and thereby to accept the risks associated with this open,
   interactive and personalized way of campaigning. Rather, the candidates
   took a cautious approach by not engaging extensively in the social media
   features and practices. However, female candidates and candidates not
   representing major parties were more likely to utilize a broader range
   of social media features and practices. The study adds support to the
   claim that campaigns do not simply adopt and utilize novel social media
   tools with the purpose of being innovative; they assess risks, costs and
   benefits. Social media do not alter the basic need of campaigns to
   control the message and to avoid stress in the campaign organization.},

Abstract = {Policy consultants are external analysts who provide paid policy-related
   advice to governments on a contractual basis. Previous research on
   policy work has examined the work done within governments and by policy
   consultants separately but has not systematically compared and
   contrasted the two. A key question regarding the nature of policy
   advisory practices and policy advice systems in general, however, is
   whether consultants are duplicating the work of government officials in
   order to help ``triangulate{''} internal advice or whether there is more
   of a complementary approach in which consultants supplement the work of
   internal analysts. This article explores the differences among the two
   groups using data collected over the past five years in two sets of
   surveys into internal and external policy work in Canada. The analysis
   finds a ``complementary{''} relationship to exist, contrary to the
   conventional wisdom that outside or external advice is sought mainly in
   order to avoid biases in internal advice.},

Abstract = {During most of the 20th century Icelandic educational policy aimed at
   developing public schools as fundamental institutions in a democratic
   society. However, it was not until 1974 that democracy was explicitly
   mentioned in the law pertaining to public schools. Earlier law is
   characterized by obvious democratic ideas, such as that schools should
   be open to everyone, that the school system should form a unified whole
   and that access to education should be equal. I will focus on public
   policy in education and consider when, whether and to what extent
   Icelandic educational policy was democratic. In this discussion, the law
   from 1974 has a special status, not only because of the ideals described
   in the law itself but also because of the extensive developmental work
   that was carried out in relation to the setting of the new law. I will
   argue that at that time there really was democratic educational policy
   in Iceland but that it was given up in the eighties and further
   abandoned in the nineties.},

Abstract = {Almost seventy years ago German philosophers Max Horkheimer and Theodor
   Adorno predicted the immense influence of capitalism and
   commercialization on media systems and media content. Today
   commodification and the hunger for fun, spectacle, shock and emotions
   have become an intrinsic part of media offer and consumption. The
   central place belongs to television and the transformation of the news
   industry into packages of high-emotional stories, very often in sequels.
   Spectacle, strong emotional bond and empathetic members of audience are
   important elements of what media expert Brian A. Monahan calls public
   drama - a new hybrid form of television news. The American mainstream
   media transformed the terrorist attack on the USA on the 11th of
   September 2001 into ``9/11{''} - a series of dramatic and emotional
   stories which imposed certain frames of understanding of what happened -
   and which were built into the cultural memory. In the first few hours
   after the attack the core of the 9/11 narrative was born: moral shock, a
   strong emotional bond with the victims of the attacks, transformation of
   rescuers into heroes, a feeling of love and togetherness among
   Americans, along with worldwide compassion. Emphasis was put on
   emotions, fear and a sort of spectacle of crisis, with little discussion
   about responsibility and critical evaluation of the reasons behind the
   attacks. Focus on human tragedies, fear and panic are immersed in a
   wider story about terrorist attacks which is a big threat to America.
   The power of television and its pictures to form and impose frames of
   understanding events is huge, along with the long-term consequences this
   can have on the audience, but politics as well.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Greece was the first European Monetary Union (EMU) country to sign a
   Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) with the European
   Commission (EC) and the European Central Bank (ECB) in order to secure
   financial assistance and prevent a total collapse of its economy
   following the severe international economic crisis. The MEFP (2010) and
   the more detailed Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic
   Policy Conditionality (SEPC) (2010) offered elaborate steps of
   structural reforms that have affected all public services in Greece. The
   lack of major results and the stickiness of the `Greek problem' have
   made Greece a unique case study for evaluating both the recipe of the
   international lenders and the domestic capacity for reform. A historical
   institutionalist approach and the concept of `policy paradigm' are
   combined here in order to evaluate what the conditions for a major
   administrative reform in time of crisis are. The article focuses on the
   specific attempt to reform public administration during the Papandreou
   government in order to analyse the importance of both time and type of
   change in the success of a major reform programme.},

   inclusion-also has the potential to render our political institutions
   dangerously unjust. Through an engagement with the work of Plato and
   Jean-Jacques Rousseau, I argue that we must be wary of a democracy's
   susceptibility to the emergence of unbridled or tyrannical liberty when
   expanding the criteria of freedom and agency to accommodate animals, or
   the animalistic, in the political sphere.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {This article takes as its starting point Sara Ruddick's discussion of
   ``vulnerability{''} in her 1989 groundbreaking book Maternal Thinking:
   Toward a Politics of Peace. It examines the kind of thinking about
   vulnerability that Ruddick describes as developed through maternal
   practice and uses it as a heuristic device for rethinking the
   conceptions of and responses to vulnerability that permeate national and
   international security discourses. It explores the specific forms of
   practice and reason that are implicated by these different stances
   toward vulnerability and shows that the (often unexamined) assumptions
   underlying these stances are profoundly consequential for both policy
   and practice. Specifically, it takes both nuclear weapons and the
   so-called Global War on Terror as particular forms of response to
   perceived vulnerability and scrutinizes the practices associated with
   each in light of the forms of rationality arising from maternal
   practice. It also explores the assumptions underlying the concept of
   ``vulnerable groups{''} commonly employed in international policy
   institutions, teasing out their implications for politics, policy, and
   action. Overall, it argues that Ruddick's articulation of maternal
   thinking provides a valuable resource for reimagining transformed and
   transformative security practices.},

   during the First World War. But this ostensibly marginal region is

   represented a turning point. The First World War, the Revolution, and
   the Civil War were so tightly interwoven that contemporaries saw these
   periods as one continuum. Practices from the World War were transferred
   to the Civil War, military force turned into paramilitary violence, and
   veterans returning from the front waged various overlapping conflicts.},

Abstract = {This article provides the first and most comprehensive analysis of
   Public Accounts Committees (PACs) from Eastern and Southern Africa
   building on the work of McGee, Jacobs, Stapenhurst, and Staddon. By
   analyzing an original set of data, this article shows that PACs in these
   two regions are bigger, have more staff members, and are more likely to
   be chaired by opposition Members of Parliament than they have in other
   countries and regions. Furthermore, the data show that Eastern and
   Southern African PACs are more active than their counterparts elsewhere.
   However, lack of political will and limits to the range of powers that
   they enjoy as well as the dearth of quality technical support from
   parliamentary staff significantly undermines the effectiveness of these
   committees and their ability to play a greater role in curbing
   corruption.},

Abstract = {In the Russian Empire and the Habsburg Empire, religion and politics
   were closely linked. The Russian Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church
   were state churches. They bestowed sacred orders on the worldly rulers.
   In the First World War, they worked within the military by delivering
   war sermons and providing spiritual guidance. However, confessional
   wartime rhetoric was directed against segments of the empire's own
   population and led to a decline in the church's authority. Within the
   Habsburg Empire, military clergy were not celebrated as heroes. The
   Catholic Church also refrained from formulating political-religious war
   aims. For the Catholic Church, equating of political associations and
   religious associations was in the First World War no longer a plausible
   option, while the Russian Orthodox Church followed precisely this
   understanding.},

Abstract = {Despite clear evidence of a link between religion and welfare state
   development, research on public support for redistributive social
   policies has been slow to incorporate religion into models of public
   preferences. Does religious belief influence support for redistribution?
   If so, does religion necessarily increase hostility to redistribution as
   suggested by existing research? Or, do the Catholic and Protestant
   traditions generate different patterns of preferences consistent with
   Weber's notion of a Protestant work ethic? This research explores these
   questions by comparing public support for redistribution across 13
   European states. The data reveal a powerful and complex effect of
   religious belief on support for redistribution that works on both the
   individual and cultural levels. The evidence challenges existing
   research by demonstrating that the impact of religion is not uniform,
   but varies across different religious traditions, with Catholicism
   producing significantly greater support for redistribution than
   Protestantism.},

Abstract = {This essay focuses on the idea and practice of sovereignty, in
   particular state sovereignty. It deals with the ways sovereignty has
   featured in British policy since the 1960s in connection with the EU,
   Ireland and Northern Ireland, and within Great Britain. It argues that,
   despite continuing attachment to the old language of sovereignty, the UK
   has adapted how it `does' sovereignty in connection with the EU and
   Ireland/Northern Ireland. In addition, while the supremacy of parliament
   is restated in the UK devolution settlements, it is unlikely that the
   `process' of devolution of power away from the centre can be reversed.
   But, it is argued, such changes have taken place in piecemeal fashion
   and without much of a new language of sovereignty.},

Abstract = {The article links the literatures on citizenship studies and electronic
   democracy by analyzing the extent to which theories and practices of
   citizenship are being transformed in the age of the Internet.
   Distinguishing between the different citizenship traditions of
   liberal-individualism and civic-republicanism, we analyze the interplay
   between generic technological tools and the divergent historical
   legacies of citizenship in Turkey and Britain. Based on our analysis of
   governmental portals, main e-government applications, and censorship and
   surveillance practices, we argue that new information and communication
   technologies (ICTs) serve the states' interests by enabling increased
   surveillance capabilities, more efficient bureaucracy, better border
   controls and criminal investigations. In both countries, citizens
   benefit from electronic service-delivery applications primarily as
   consumers of public services, while their role as citizens are not
   particularly enhanced. Parallel to these convergence tendencies, we
   observe striking differences in the way electronic citizenship is
   practiced in these two countries, stemming from different traditions of
   citizenship as well as different levels of democracy consolidation.
   Despite some of the transformative power of the ICTs, their use is
   largely shaped by the existing understandings of citizenship in both
   countries.},

Abstract = {In recent years, local and foreign analysts have made tremendous efforts
   in trying to come to grips with the Boko Haram insurgency that has
   undermined northern Nigeria in both human and material terms. While some
   commentators trace the source of violent insecurity in the region to the
   zero-sum ethnoregional struggle over political power and public goods in
   the Nigerian federation, especially the alleged opposition to the
   Goodluck Jonathan presidency, a great number of people blame the
   insurgency on the jihadist onslaught against open society and secular
   ideology. Besides pointing out the shortcomings of these mainstream
   analytical perspectives, this article demonstrates how the inability of
   the state to effectively discharge many of its statutory obligations
   fuels disenchantment and engenders anti-state violence from below.
   Juxtaposing the current Boko Haram insurgency and the Maitatsine revolt
   of the 1980s, which share commonalities in both ideological and
   operational terms, the article shows that violent insecurity in much of
   northern Nigeria is not a ``new war{''} between ethnoreligious groups
   per se but more of an outcome of governance and development deficits
   that have trapped the masses in affliction while a handful of governing
   elite live in affluence.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Pages = {129-150},
Abstract = {What are the patterns of legislator responsiveness to constituents in
   multi-level democracies, and what explains them? Previously, comparative
   research has been hampered by a lack of theory and a lack of data. The
   article first theorizes how constituency service may be explained by
   conventional arguments, such as electoral motivations and role
   orientations. It then considers how regionalization specifically might
   affect service responsiveness. Using data from the PARTIREP survey of
   legislators in eight multi-level democracies and six unitary
   democracies, the article demonstrates that national legislators devote
   less time to constituency service in multi-level than in unitary
   democracies; and that regional legislators devote more time than
   national legislators in multi-level democracies. While conventional
   arguments are important, the specific effects of regionalization are
   also significant in determining service responsiveness, establishing an
   agenda for future research of constituency service as a significant area
   in the study of multi-level democracy.},

Abstract = {This article describes the events that brought about the dismissal of
   the Berlusconi government in November 2011 and the appointment of a

   analysis of how popular perceptions of the economic and political
   situation have evolved since that time. Relying on an ITANES five- wave
   interelectoral panel study, the article shows the EU's growing
   importance as a divisive political issue. Blaming the EU or the former
   Berlusconi government as a source of the economic crisis exerted a
   significant impact on party choice in the 2013 election, while
   retrospective sociotropic economic evaluations were conditional in their
   impact on the structure of blame attribution for the economic crisis.},

Abstract = {This essay engages with several critiques of my project a
   `cosmopolitanism without illusions.' Who is the subject of rights? What
   are the objects of rights? Is there a distinction between human and
   moral rights? Furthermore, what is prior in this cosmopolitan account:
   democracy or human rights? Do democratic iterations exhaust the meaning
   of principles of rights? Finally, does the `scarf affair' really signify
   the return of `political theology' or have not such disputes always
   accompanied secularization and modernity? I argue that moral rights
   comprise more than human rights and that non-human beings such as
   animals can have moral rights claims against us. Democratic iterations
   and rights complement one another; neither is prior and that although
   debates about religion and secularization have been endemic to
   modernity, the return of references to Carl Schmitt's `political
   theology' is rather new.},

Journal = {POLITY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Pages = {107-114},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article addresses the question of how political theory within the
   liberal arts differs from political theory done elsewhere. It frames the
   discussion in terms of both the existential crisis of political theory
   within the political science discipline and the financial and identity
   crises of liberal arts education within the broader higher education
   environment The article then identifies two major factors-the small size
   and the prevalence of liberal arts norms-that contribute to convergence
   in the way political theory is taught and researched in the liberal
   arts. These observations notwithstanding, this article's central
   contention is that there is a great diversity of ways to ``do{''}
   political theory in the liberal arts, and that variation among colleges
   and among political theorists tends to be far more definitive of the
   political theory experience than the commonalities derived from the
   liberal arts setting. The essay concludes by describing sources of
   divergence that complicate efforts to decipher a coherent and shared
   understanding of what political theory in the liberal arts means.},

Abstract = {This article returns to Marxist commentaries during a previous period
   characterized by profound contradictions and conflict-especially the
   writings of Nicos Poulantzas and Stuart Hall on authoritarian
   statism/populism from the late 1970s to the 1980s in order to make sense
   of the present era. The article argues that we are witnessing the rise
   of authoritarian neoliberalism, which is rooted in the reconfiguring of
   the state into a less democratic entity through constitutional and legal
   changes that seek to insulate it from social and political conflict. The
   apparent strengthening of the state simultaneously entails its growing
   fragility, for it is becoming an increasingly direct target of a range
   of popular struggles, demands, and discontent by way of the pressures
   emanating from this strengthening. A primary reference point for the
   article is a notable casualty of the post-2007 crisis, European social
   democracy, but the implications for radical politics more broadly are
   also considered.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses in practice how educational and occupational choices
   procedures attempt to let pupils make autonomous decisions. Said
   otherwise, it studies to which extent the autonomous choice principle is
   implemented on the field. The institution defines school career
   decisions as a cooperative procedure (dialogue with the families and
   individual treatments of pupils' orientation during school board
   meetings). Yet this theoretical framework is bypassed by some pupils and
   their family who contest the general principle that their opinion is on
   equal footing with the one of school professionals when it comes to
   educational career decisions. We also show that teachers can be torn
   between their selective role (sorting out whether pupils should go to
   the general high school or to vocational schools) and the fact that they
   also want to act as the pupils' spokespersons. Eventually it appears
   that the imperative to conduct the school counselling procedure as
   planned is more important to institutional actors than to guarantee a
   real autonomy in the elaboration of the pupil's project.},

Abstract = {This essay analyses the cultural process, that leads to the
   justification of the colonisation of the Slaves and of their territory
   from the Nineteenth to the Twentieth Centuries. In particular the author
   describes the different interpretations of the ``conflict{''} of the
   German and the Slav civilisations in the German philosophical and
   historiographical literature, from Herder to the Ostforschung. The
   discontinuities and continuities in the discourses about the Slavs are
   studied and two kind of representations of the Slavs are specifically
   analysed: the first one, diffused from the Eighteenth to the Nineteenth
   Century and the second one, elaborated from the historiographical
   literature during the Weimar Republic and National Socialism
   (Ostforschung). The first kind of discourse creates a cultural
   hierarchy, in which the Slaves are seen as an inferior and alien
   culture. The following one is based on economic and apparent
   ``objective{''} considerations, that point out the economical reasons
   for the colonisation of Eastern European territories: the Slaves are
   seen as economically and politically unable to rule a nation. The essay
   suggests that this kind of argumentation used in order to demostrate the
   inferiority of a popolation does not disappear after the end of National
   Socialism: some examples of it can be detected also today.},

Abstract = {Knowledge and organizational learning may be said to move in and through

   forms of organizational knowing and knowledge, learning and

   of reality are artificially accentuated for analytical reasons, the
   implications of two major relatively recent crises will be examined: the
   collapse of the USSR and the global financial crisis. Very different
   lessons flow from understanding these crises. After presenting brief
   histories of the present, I shall turn to discussion of the relations
   between social and system integration and the new social media, before
   drawing some conclusions with implications for thinking about circuits

Abstract = {England's rulers, merchants, and organized labor in the early modern
   period (from the 16th to the 18th centuries) were all actively using
   what today we would call propaganda. Each group appreciated the need to
   get popular opinion on its side, or at the least to convince other
   groups it was in the public interest to act in a particular way. This
   study focuses on the use of xenophobic narratives by these actors in
   order to further their political, economic, or cultural objectives. The
   targets were economic rivals including the Dutch, but most particularly
   ethnic and religious outgroups, including Roman Catholics, Muslims, and
   Jews. Although there were public relations win-wins for anyone who was
   able successfully to demonize foreigners, racist and xenophobic
   propaganda was often more pernicious than the tellers realized, in many
   cases extending its influence over several generations. In addition, it
   is clear that many narratives failed to engage with public opinion, for
   reasons that were not always clear to the groups responsible for them.},

   Afghanistan},
Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {251-286},
Abstract = {The United States' democratic allies with troops deployed in Iraq and
   Afghanistan have faced intense conflicting pressures in recent years. On
   the one hand, long and costly deployments have led to increased public
   pressure for withdrawal. On the other hand, pressure from the United
   States and the state's own national interest often favor remaining
   deployed. This article seeks to explain why US allies sometimes announce
   withdrawal decisions prior to the United States, whereas they sometimes
   remain deployed. The article focuses on three allies that have made
   relatively large military contributions to US-led wars in Afghanistan
   and Iraq: Australia, Italy, and the Netherlands. The article offers
   three core findings. First, when the opposition in an allied government
   joins the public in favoring withdrawal, withdrawal is very likely.
   Second, allies are likely to remain deployed when the government and
   opposition share a consensus on the value of their alliance with the
   United States and agree that the target of intervention is a threat to
   their national interest. Third, allied government/opposition consensus
   falters when policymakers believe there will be minimal alliance fallout
   from a withdrawal decision, when they do not believe the target to be a
   threat, or when they believe that the US-led intervention is unlikely to
   succeed.},

Abstract = {International organizations are confronted with an increasingly
   heterogeneous audience vis-a-vis which they have to legitimate
   themselves if they want to gain and maintain acceptance for their
   activities. By examining the IAEA, the UNHCR, the IUCN and OAU and its
   successor, the AU, we show how the legitimating constituency of the
   respective organization has widened, in how far this has led to a
   diversification of the demands on the respective organization and how
   the organizations have reacted to that. We find a general trend towards
   a more diversified audience-tailored form of communication. In contrast,
   each organization adopts its own content-specific reaction to the new
   demands.},

   food technologies},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {51},

Pages = {95-120},
Abstract = {In recent decades, new food technologies have been developed, resulting
   in several innovations, for instance: genetically modified foods,
   functional foods, conservation technologies ( by irradiation, high
   pressure, pulsed electric field, etc...) and new applications based on
   nanotechnology. A large part of consumers don't have more than a vague
   idea of the characteristics of food technologies, but they often show
   rejection behaviors. The development of new processes and techniques
   incorporating benefits to food products is not easily perceived and
   valued by consumers, in a context where negative perceptions towards the
   industrialization of food production exists. Nevertheless, specific
   knowledge about new food technologies should be considered a key factor
   in attitudes shaping. In consequence, how these perceptions and
   attitudes vary when knowledge changes must be examined. We have analyzed
   this process in a set of consumers who have been transferred accurate
   information about two groups of food technologies: biotechnology and
   conservation technologies. Previously, have been investigated
   preexisting perceptions, knowledge and attitudes. Subsequently, written
   and audiovisual information have been distributed and discussed. As a
   result, the perception of change of prior knowledge, the reliability
   attributed to sources and integration of new information into existing
   knowledge and beliefs have been deeply investigated.},

Abstract = {This article holds that Hobbes' concept of right shows its own
   paradoxical nature. This means that realization of right is overlapped
   with its denial. Thus, the paradox has two faces: on one hand, we find
   the paradox of Natural Right, and on the other, the one of Sovereign
   Right. Through liberty concept and its political stress, Hobbes builds
   the idea of a natural self-conservation right. This right is unlimited,
   complete, unconditional and absolute; those features seem to be the
   evidence of its paradox. So that, Hobbes' analytical strategy is to
   support the philosophical, juridical and political idea of a Contract as
   the only way to solve the subsisting paradox of the state of nature.
   Nevertheless, this Contract and its result -the political or civil
   society- do not solve the paradox. It is, on the contrary, a new
   modality of its concretion, not in the state of nature but in the State,
   that is, in the very heart of Sovereign right definition. In
   consequence, through hobbesian statements we must look at the
   implications, repercussions and inferences that appear within
   paradoxical concept of right as the immanent structure of law and
   State's authority exercise.},

Abstract = {This article examines the feminist appropriation of the legal principle
   of due diligence to politicize acts of violence at the hands of private
   actors within the private sphere. This move expanded traditional notions
   of state responsibility for violence against women under international
   human rights law. Using frame analysis, we focus on the
   institutionalization of this feminist understanding of due diligence
   through its discursive incorporation in international human rights
   policy documents and its mobilization in cases of domestic violence
   litigated within the UN and the Inter-American and European human rights
   systems. Through this discursive framing work and its
   institutionalization, feminists have challenged the gendered politics of
   the public/private divide to change the terms on which differently
   positioned women can engage with the state and global governance
   institutions. We argue that this change can potentially reconfigure
   women's state-bounded and transnational citizenship. The implications of
   due diligence as a political and sociological concept require more
   careful consideration by citizenship and human rights scholars.},

Abstract = {Military rule as a form of autocratic governance can mean either rule by
   a military strongman unconstrained by other officers or rule by a group
   of high-ranking officers who can limit the dictator's discretion. We
   label the latter form a military regime. Both military strongmen and
   military regimes are more likely to commit human rights abuses and
   become embroiled in civil wars than are civilian dictatorships. The
   behavior of strongmen diverges from that of more constrained military
   rulers in other areas, however. Military strongmen start more
   international wars than either military regimes or civilian dictators,
   perhaps because they have more reason to fear postouster exile, prison,
   or assassination. Fear of the future may also motivate their resistance
   to transition. Military strongmen are more often ousted by insurgency,
   popular uprising, or invasion than are military regimes or civilian
   dictators. Their tenures rarely end in democratization, whereas the
   opposite is true of military regimes.},

Abstract = {Is the state still the basic unit of political authority in OECD
   countries? International relations scholars discuss whether
   international institutions undermine or buttress state authority.
   Students of comparative political economy argue about the extent to
   which political authority has migrated to private market actors. We
   inventory and compare the main arguments in both debates. Our findings
   suggest a different pattern of state transformation than most
   participants in the debates implicitly assume. The key feature is not a
   zero-sum shift of political authority to nonstate actors but an
   unbundling and reconfiguration of authority. The segmental
   differentiation into largely self-contained national states is overlaid
   by a functionally differentiated order in which different dimensions of
   authority are exercised by different state and nonstate actors. The
   state remains focal, but its role changes from virtual monopolist to
   manager of political authority.},

Abstract = {Some Autonomous Communities have raised recently the possibility of
   returning to the State some of their competencies. The doctrinal stance
   is opposed to this idea arguing that the Communities can not make this
   decision on their own accord. Every reform of the statute would require
   a bilateral process between the Autonomous Community and the State. This
   paper offers a different approach to this issue interpreting the 8th
   Title of the Constitution in a final way, which would justify the
   existence of an implied limitation of the National Parliament's roll in
   this case.},

Title = {Intra-party conflicts over gubernatorial campaigns in Japan: Delegation
   or franchise?},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {78-88},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Why and when does party headquarters grant autonomy to its local
   branches, and what trade-offs ensue when providing such discretion? This
   article tackles these broader questions by focusing on a largely
   under-investigated area: the impact of directly elected governors and
   mayors on intra-party dynamics. To facilitate analysis, the article
   borrows from the delegation' and franchise' models, which seek to
   explain how party organizations adapt to multi-level electoral
   environments. Sources of intra-party conflict over gubernatorial
   campaigns derive from theories of party behaviour under presidential
   systems. Empirical evidence is provided by examining how Japan's two
   major parties have dealt with gubernatorial campaigns in recent years.
   Select cases and data demonstrate how local units are driven by
   differing incentives from the national leadership, the consequent
   intra-party conflicts and the limited success of party headquarters in
   steering its local units. The article discusses the extent to which the
   franchise' or delegation' models successfully capture the way in which
   the two Japanese parties have engaged in gubernatorial campaigns. To
   illustrate generalizability beyond Japan, the article ends with a brief
   comparative counterpoint: intra-party conflict over the selection of the
   Greater London Authority's mayoral candidate in 2000 and 2004.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {This article investigates how the positions, strategies and modes of
   interaction of the German Lander have changed over time in response to
   the process of Europeanization. By applying the method of process
   tracing within a theoretical framework of rational choice
   institutionalism, the article concentrates on the Lander's responses to
   (1) the transfer of policy competences to the European level and (2) the
   enlargement of the European polity. Thereby, the article sheds new light
   on the Europeanization of the German federal system. It is shown that
   the transfer of policy competences to the European level have had the
   greatest impact on the Lander, which have reacted increasingly
   strategically by successfully demanding more power in the national
   coordination mechanism. However, the European Union enlargements have
   also had an effect as together with the transfer of policy competences
   they have resulted in a more sceptical attitude of the Lander towards
   (the perceived ever expanding) European Union.},

Abstract = {The book ``The End of History and the Last Man{''} (1992) by Francis
   Fukuyama became a world bestseller soon after its publishment; it has
   provoked contradictory feelings not only among professionals, but also
   among non-professionals. Politicians often acted upon the ideas of the
   book, in spite of the fact that social scientists were mostly condemning
   and criticizing it. Although, in general terms, the thesis the `End of
   History' can be taken as an `idea about the future', it has been
   labelled differently as theory, paradigm, scenario or myth. Certainly,
   the thesis the `End of History' deserves the clarification of its
   identity within the discipline of IR. In my paper I attempt to reveal
   reasons for the `mysterious' success or long-lasting popularity of the
   book although it suffers many methodological - theoretical flaws which
   are examined in more detailes through the paper. The constitutional
   character of Fukuyamas' ideas is stressed. At the same time the thesis
   serves as prove of Kuhns's doubts of the Popper criteria of the
   falsification.},

Abstract = {The 2012 Constituency Commission report has recommended a reduction in
   the number of Dail deputies from 166 to 158 and the number of general
   election constituencies from 43 to 40, while bringing about changes -
   some very fundamental in scope - to the majority of the existing Dail
   constituencies. These changes are detailed in this article, while being
   placed in the context of previous electoral boundary amendments
   throughout the history of the Irish state and the processes employed in
   other states, such as the United Kingdom. The oft quoted contention that
   the 2012 boundary revisions are the most considerable in scope since
   those of 1980 is tested and proven with reference to the use of the
   Kavanagh index of constituency change (KICC scores), with these KICC
   scores also employed to highlight the regions and constituencies that
   have been most prone to boundary amendments over the past three decades.},

Abstract = {The present essay review propones a new model to understand the nature
   of risk. The authors hereby argue that risks help the society to
   function. Not only the sum-zero risk society is impossible, but also
   would affect seriously the economy of capitalist society. Therefore,
   insurances and risk are inexorably intertwined. The authors have
   explored three valid indicators toward the construction of a
   general-index of risk, which not only can be homologable to other
   nations, but also comparable among cultures. Communities may be studied
   by their way of perceiving risks. Beyond the debate on if terrorism is
   or not a risk, the goals of this review is twofold. Firstly, it is
   important to explore the economic nature of terrorism to discern their
   causes. Secondly, it is necessary to build a valid index that reflects
   how a society feels.},

Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {55},

Abstract = {This article points out that dynamics of private authority over time and
   de-privatization processes are analytically and practically crucial, but
   so far under-researched aspects of private authority and privatization.
   It argues that more scholarly attention should be paid to these
   phenomena and advocates a state-focused, but dynamic theoretical
   approach which takes seriously the empirical possibility that states may
   play an asymmetric role in the authorization (i. e. privatization) and
   dis-empowerment (i. e. de-privatization) of private governance actors.
   For that purpose, it proposes a fruitful and constructive combination
   (rather than rivalry) of theoretical literatures such as principal-agent
   theory, political economy research on private authority and historical
   institutionalism.},

Abstract = {Ever since the Supreme Court instituted the one person, one vote
   principle in congressional election s based on its decision in Wesberry
   v. Sanders (1964), intrastate deviations from equal district populations
   have become smaller and smaller after each decennial reapportionment.
   Relying on equal total population as the standard to meet the Court's
   principle, though, has raised some constitutional and practical
   questions stemming from, most basically, not every person has the right
   to vote. Specifically, there is considerable deviation between the
   current redistricting practices and a literal interpretation of this
   constitutional principle. This study systematically analyzes the
   differences between districts' total populations and their voting age
   populations (VAPs). Further, we consider how congressional
   reapportionments since 1972 would change if, instead of states' total
   populations, the standard for reapportioning seats were based on the VAP
   or the voting eligible population (VEP). Overall, the results indicate
   that the debate surrounding the appropriate apportionment and
   redistricting standard is not jus t normative, it also has notable
   practical consequences.},

Abstract = {Assuming that regarding young adults ``being autonomous{''} means, in
   most cases, that they be financially independent, this article intends
   to analyse the terms and limitations of this financial autonomy by
   focusing on the relationship between the youth and banks. From an
   interview survey and observation, we show that banks offer autonomy in
   exchange for a new kind of heteronomy. The way young people are
   socialized to banks' practices is marked by a constitutive ambiguity.
   The second part of the article, based on interviews with ``young
   qualified urbans{''}, explores how they adapt to the standards imposed
   by banks and the high costs of possible resistance.},

Abstract = {Considered in the article are resources of influence of states and
   non-state transnational actors in world politics. As is demonstrated in
   the article, crushing of resources, as well as of ways and methods of
   their use, is taking place in the contemporary world. Sociopolitical and
   humanitarian resource now becomes especially important. States use it in
   particular though the development of transgovernmental processes and
   structural power. Actors of world politics tend, on the one hand, to
   ``fix{''} on a particular resource, and, on the other - to diversify
   resources. Knowledge of how resources are used and by whom, as well as
   understanding the current trends in this field will provide the
   opportunity to assess the influence in the world politics.},

Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {4},
Pages = {624-642},
Abstract = {This paper demonstrates the substantive and methodological flaws of a
   zero-sum, oppositional approach to conceptualizing multiple identities
   and suggests that each identity should be measured separately. Using
   original survey data from secondary school students in the
   Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia (N = 4417), the paper demonstrates that
   the oppositional approach is only appropriate where individuals perceive
   the identities to be incongruent. However, I argue that even where this
   commonly used oppositional approach fits the macrolevel context, it is a
   normatively tainted measure of identity. Moreover, it can only gauge the
   relative importance of the two identities, and does not shed light on
   the absolute strength of either identity. By comparing the performance
   of each measurement approach as predictors of out-group antipathy, the
   paper demonstrates how the zero-sum approach clouds important
   relationships between each form of identification and other variables of
   interest.},

Title = {Academic Governance and Democratic Processes: The Entrepreneurial Model
   and Its Discontents},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Pages = {474-488},
Abstract = {Institutional power over the decision-making process in post-secondary
   institutions has traditionally been concentrated in the academy itself
   and, to a lesser extent, in state regulatory offices. Recently, however,
   this type of governance has been challenged and, in many places,
   replaced by a new, entrepreneurial model emphasizing more control by
   college administrations, increased involvement by outside
   ``stakeholders,{''} and the use of competition among and within schools
   for students and resources as the main criterion for determining
   investment and curricular priorities. This article describes the
   entrepreneurial model of academic governance, then shows it in action
   through a detailed examination of the presidential succession crisis at
   the University of Virginia. This case study reveals many aspects of the
   discourse of entrepreneurial governance and illustrates the utilitarian
   nature of the model. The article proceeds to consider the reasons why
   such a discourse developed, tying the entrepreneurial model to the
   promulgation of neoliberal ideologies that are remaking social
   institutions more generally. The effects on the role of education in
   democratic politics in the United States are then analyzed. The
   conclusion of the article speaks to the difficulties of addressing these
   effects and recommends ways of analyzing responses to the model by the
   institutions and individuals involved.},

Abstract = {Employing feminist institutionalism as an analytic framework, this
   article considers the First Offender Prostitution Program in San
   Francisco. The program allows men arrested for their first prostitution
   offense to pay a fine and to attend a day of classes about the
   consequences of participation in prostitution, in lieu of prosecution.
   Other jurisdictions in the United States and internationally have
   replicated First Offender, and supporters (particularly feminists)
   praise it for promoting gender equality. However, the findings in this
   article suggest that First Offender both replicates and contests
   competing and often contradictory gender ideologies and patterns of
   power. Specifically, the program's enrollment practices and most of its
   content imply that men who purchase sexual services are rational sexual
   agents, while women who sell these services are (mainly) victims.
   Presentations by former sex workers complicate the program's lessons
   about gender by demonstrating women's capacity to exercise agency in sex
   work. The program thus illustrates the contested and contradictory
   ideological dynamics of gender-sensitive institutional reforms.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to quantitatively analyse interstate conflicts
   over resources from the water-rich areas in the Asian region. We do not
   concentrate solely on conflicts over water, because the cause of such
   conflicts could cover for example a clash over fish resources or
   offshore fossil fuels. Several studies analysed quantitatively
   interstate and intrastate conflicts in general. Researchers thoroughly
   analysed conflicts about natural resources and water wars, too.
   Nevertheless, to our knowledge, no quantitative study tried to explore
   interstate conflicts about resources from water-rich areas so far. We
   will attempt to fill in this gap. The influence of the rate of natural
   increase, GDP per capita, arms imports and exports, arms costs and oil
   exports to conflicts concerning resources from water-rich areas are
   investigated. The examined period covers years 1945-2013. We conclude
   that the more arms trade the more conflicts over resources from
   water-rich areas in Asian region there are.},

Abstract = {On the basis of the detailed analysis of the process of elaboration and
   adoption of 1977 Constitution of the USSR, A.Medushevsky reveals special
   features of the Soviet pseudo-constitutionalism. Having thoroughly
   considered debates around the most important provisions of the new Basic
   Law that were designed to answer the key challenges facing the country
   as a result of the internal transformations as well as changes occurring
   in the global arena, and their reflection in the content of the final
   document, he convincingly demonstrates that the formula for the leading
   role of the Communist Party was the only norm in the Soviet Constitution
   that actually worked (corresponded to political reality). According to
   his conclusion, the failure of the political system of the late USSR to
   implement fully-fledged and timely constitutional modernization is a
   lesson and a warning for the post-Soviet political elite.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {37},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {1336-1353},
Abstract = {Europe has been hit hard by the financial and economic crisis, and there
   is no fast solution in view. The problem facing the EU is a problem of
   governance both technically and politically. Most actors, with the
   possible exception of the ECB, are in disarray because they are caught
   between the necessity to act and the political reluctance to acknowledge
   fully the consequences of a multi-level governance system, notably
   democratic legitimacy and accountability. The discrepancy between
   political rhetoric and actual practices during the crisis appears as a
   new form of government by stealth. There is not yet an obvious way out
   of this morass. The first one seems the easiest as it would be nothing
   more than `muddling through' as usual, whereas the second option, a
   two-speed Europe, though more politically attractive, is technically
   very difficult to implement institutionally. The third possible solution
   is paradoxically the one that surreptitiously persists at present: a
   `federalism of executives' that is both unmanageable in the long run and
   unacceptable from a democratic point of view.},

   situation with the politics of memory in the country. According to the
   author's assessment, if the present trend in Russia continues, what is

   civil society not just on an anti-liberal, but ignorant nationalist

Abstract = {Rosa Luxemburg's theory of capital accumulation can be regarded as
   having initiated the systematic study by Marxists of underdeveloped
   regions. From the standpoint of these regions, however, her analysis of
   the capitalist and non-capitalist realms has certain deficiencies. For
   example, it does not reflect the logical necessity of unequal exchange
   between capitalist and non-capitalist areas, and discussion of
   non-capitalist social initiatives remains absent. Luxemburg's views have
   some similarities with Dependency Theory and World-System Theory. But
   the latter differ from her analyses in terms of their background,

Abstract = {m In many European countries, whistle-blowers are perceived in a
   negative light. However, whistle-blowers have increasingly played a
   critical role in the recent disclosure of covert governmental
   programmes, private sector economic criminal offenses and redesigned
   risk management strategies. Real change requires effective legal
   shielding for whistle-blowers. Most legal frameworks in Europe fall
   short of providing genuine legal protection due to reluctant public
   authorities and private sector actors. The exception proves the rule, as
   currently illustrated in The Netherlands. A group of MPs is creating a
   House for wandering Dutch whistle-blowers, but runs the risk of `design
   failures' by not actively seeking valuable `construction advice'.},

Abstract = {The paper presents partial results of research on the social
   determinants of the fourth generation nuclear technology implementation
   (High Temperature Reactors) in Poland. The results of in-depth
   interviews (IDI) are presented during which three classes of questions
   were asked: attitudes towards technology, knowledge and attitudes
   towards nuclear technologies and social communication in nuclear
   technologies implementation. It is assumed that the relationship between
   society and technology plays an increasingly important role in the
   introduction of new technologies, the modernization of existing ones or
   the expansion of technological applications.},

Abstract = {During the years of the Franco dictatorship, information policy was one
   of the areas most sensitive to changing international circumstances, to
   conflicts within the regime and its eventual delegitimization by
   increasingly broad sectors of Spanish society and world public opinion.
   This provides an advantageous viewpoint from which to study the Franco
   regime from a constructivist perspective. The article draws on new
   documentation to discuss the tensions that arose with the regime's
   efforts to modernize, aimed as it was at modelling public opinion within
   the system and using counter-information strategies as a means to fight
   against the opposition.},

Pages = {91-109},
Abstract = {The Boko Haram terrorist group's philosophy and activities have been
   subjected to different interpretations among the Nigerian populace. Such
   interpretations follow traditional lines of ethnic, regional, cultural,
   and religious cleavages in Nigeria. Some perceive it as war by Muslims
   against Christians, some as a sponsored conspiracy against the Muslim
   North, and others interpret it as the Northern war against the emergence
   of President Jonathan from the south-south geopolitical zone. A few
   regard it as a generic name for criminal gangs in Northern Nigeria.
   While overwhelming opinions in the south tilt toward a scorched-earth
   policy to counter Boko Haram, much of the north favors dialogue. One of
   the implications of these responses is the widening of already existing
   cleavages in Nigerian society, thereby further undermining efforts at
   building unity and coexistence among Nigeria's varying nationalities.},

Abstract = {Violence has not been effectively addressed in El Salvador since, at
   least, the 1992 Peace Accords. The annual rate of violence has steadily
   increased, and repressive policies to date have not worked. In 2013, the
   presidential electoral campaign has framed the topic of violence as the
   backdrop for a truce between gangs. In this article, we offer a
   description of key events such as the presidential elections and the
   gang truce, and suggest that political parties are missing an
   opportunity to grapple with the issue of violence. Instead, other
   organizations are leading this process.},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2014},

Abstract = {Written media mould how civil society perceives acts of terrorism. In
   employing different framing techniques, news articles develop a unique
   narrative that influences how readers comprehend an attack. Past studies
   of the relationship between the media and terrorism ignore how media
   portrayals of terrorist attacks vary based on the attacks' geographic
   location. By comparing two similar terrorist attacks, one that occurred
   in the West - Madrid, Spain - and the other in the East - Baghdad, Iraq
   - the paper seeks to explore how media coverage of terrorist attacks
   that occur in different geographic locations varies. Employing news
   frame analysis reveals how coverage of the 11 March 2004 commuter train
   bombings in Madrid differs from the 25 October 2009 double suicide
   bombings in Baghdad. Coverage of an attack on a Western nation compared
   to one on an Eastern nation contributes to Islamophobia and exacerbates
   an us-them mentality. Simply accepting information published in news
   articles at face value inhibits forming rational conclusions about the
   nature of terrorism.},

Abstract = {Based on an original dataset of merged electoral and census data, this
   article is a study of electoral support for the Islamist Party in
   Morocco in the 2002 and 2007 elections. It differentiates between the
   clientelistic, grievance and horizontal network type of supporters. We
   disentangle these profiles empirically on the basis of the role of
   education, wealth and exclusion for Islamist votes. We find no evidence
   of the clientelistic profile, but a shift from grievance in 2002 to a
   horizontal network profile in 2007. World Values Survey individual level
   data are used as a robustness check, yielding similar results.
   Qualitative evidence on a changing mobilization pattern of the party
   between 2002 and 2007 supports our conclusions.},

Journal = {TEORIA Y REALIDAD CONSTITUCIONAL},

Volume = {34},
Pages = {319-332},
Abstract = {The possibility for individuals to have a ``direct action{''} to
   challenge the norms of the legal system before the judge of the
   constitutionality is not a necessary element of the constitutional Rule
   of law. The institution. ``fundamental rights{''} does not require, as
   such, that the judge of the constitutionality of the parliamentary
   statutes should grant their protection. What allows distinguishing the
   different models is the degree of the concentration and distribution of
   these basic tasks: protection of the fundamental rights, constitutional
   judicial review. This depends upon various factors: how exhaust the
   constitutional judicial review should be, what kind of constitutional
   supervision may be (preventive or corrective), the number of the organs
   charged with this task, and the number of its components. The question
   of the limitation of the Rule of Law is risen, because the more
   exhaustive its implementation is intended, the less intense, generating
   a paradoxal weakness of the fundamental right and the completeness
   principie. A phenomenon appears: the mutation of the
   ``monomicrodicastic{''} principie and the completeness of the
   constitutional judicial review.},

Abstract = {Political participation is deemed to be a fundamental component of
   democratic regimes. The literature on political participation has shown
   that some social groups of citizens tend to be less involved in politics
   than other social groups, and the consequence is that the interests of
   these specific groups of less involved citizens are underrepresented in
   the political process. Given the increasing popularity of non-violent
   protest in contemporary democracies, it is important to understand
   whether political inequalities are present in this form of political
   engagement. In this article, we argue that non-violent protest may
   present inequalities, that examining the consequences of public social
   spending can help in understanding the cross-national differences in the
   levels of non-violent political protest, and that political inequalities
   in non-violent protest may vary according to public social spending. We
   test our argument using sources that include the European Values Study
   (1980-2009), multilevel models, and contextual data provided by the
   Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.},

Abstract = {Active learning, including in-class debates, is used in social science
   classrooms as a means of improving meaning and increasing understanding
   of complex materials. However, in-class debates do not fully satisfy all
   aspects of experiential learning because students do not get to
   experience the results of multifaceted concepts, such as strategic
   voting. In this article, I explore the use of an experimental voting
   game to teach the differences in electoral systems. Using defined
   payouts as policy outcomes, the results show that students who are
   exposed to known payoffs gained a better understanding of voting
   strategies under majoritarian and proportional voting schemes.
   Additionally, measured student outcomes in the form of a final exam
   showed a statistically significant difference in knowledge of voting
   behavior. In this way, I provide evidence that in-class experimentation
   can serve to complement other forms of active learning.},

   Conservative Group context in Surrey. The chapter features an analysis
   of the role of internet technologies in a local council by-election
   campaign in 2009 from the candidate's perspective. It is argued that
   there was both an age and digital divide observable amid cohorts in the
   Surrey Conservatives and that trust and rapport building were central to
   dissolving cyber-based barriers to deeper engagement within local
   Conservative associations. It is found that the internet facilitated new
   network interactions that made association and campaign organization a
   looser and more fluid experience, which ultimately led to richer and
   more diverse campaign-based and social interactions in the offline
   world.},

Abstract = {Obama's 2008 win has been heralded as the final victory for Black civil
   rights. Narrowing this achievement to fit a mainstream civil rights
   narrative seems both to sell it short in terms of cross-racial and
   global impacts, and to expect too much from it in terms of
   postraciality. This framing has two significant limitations: a
   reinscription of the myth of meritocracy, which is often configured as
   American exceptionalism; and an allegiance to the Black-white binary. I
   analyze what we learn from this victory about the ways meritocracy,
   American exceptionalism, and the Black-white binary, enable the
   biopolitical construction and regulation of citizenship. In order to
   move beyond the strictures of blood logics, I build on the idea of Obama
   as ``local{''}-an identity specific to Hawai'i.},

Abstract = {This chapter uses the increased interest in Hawari, resulting from the
   Obama presidency to explore what the colonization of Hawari teaches us
   about the production of (proper) US citizenship. Bringing the
   colonization of Hawari to the fore destabilizes Hawar'i's assumed
   Americanness and native Hawaiians' US citizenship. I note the ways a
   discourse of racial harmony is tied in with Hawar'i's ``Fantasy
   Island{''} characterization and has been mobilized to obscure
   colonization. I draw on indigenous studies scholarship to ask that we
   (re)consider the authority and permanence of the US nation-state, and to
   demonstrate the ways in which colonialism has always been a biopolitical
   project.},

Pages = {259-270},
Abstract = {The article examines the sustainability and adaptability of European
   security institutions, structures and organizations in the context of
   the fundamental and qualitative change of the post-Helsinki European
   security order. Suggestions are presented for managing the Ukraine
   crisis by military and political restraint, the observance of the
   Helsinki Decalogue of principles and by upgrading executive mechanisms
   of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). In a
   new European security order, the core political components would be
   constituted by the inviolability of frontiers and the incontestability
   of internal political order. In broader international change, the
   relative decrease of the role of old powers has to be accommodated with
   the growing clout of emerging powers. Since most of the conflicts take
   place within the States and not between them the risks and new threats
   have to be dealt with by transformed and upgraded security institutions
   adapted to the new security environment. At the same time, there is a
   manifested lack of interests by the great powers to rely on multilateral
   security institutions unless they are used as instruments in pursuing
   their own strategies. The new common security arrangement for the West
   and Russia has to reconcile the adversary national security interests
   within the Euro-Atlantic Security Forum.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that the 2008 financial crisis accelerated a set of
   long-term dynamics which in turn have undermined two dominant models of
   state-society relations. On the one hand, the paper examines how the
   concept of social citizenship is based on a vision of state-society
   relations, which in recent years has been oriented by a philosophy of
   marketization of the state and of the relation between citizens and the
   state. On the other hand, it discusses an emerging emphasis on the role
   of organised civil society as a different and competing approach to
   state-society relations. Discussion will centre on how the interactions
   between these two ideologies and the related practices have impacted on
   conceptions of the modern state. Among the factors that affect this
   interaction are the impact of migration, the erosion of welfare states,
   and the redefined character of social vulnerability which now affect new
   groups of individuals. The paper considers all these changes as
   background phenomena which impact on relations between state and society
   in several ways, but particularly in terms of the meaning of social
   citizenship.},

Abstract = {What is the source of the Partido dos Trabalhadores' (PT) success? And
   is the PT likely to thrive into the future as a key player in Brazil's
   party system? In this paper we weigh in on an emerging debate about
   Lula's role in the PT's rise to power. Without Lula's ability to win
   more votes than his party, we might not be discussing lulismo at all,
   much less its difference from petismo. Yet despite Lula's fame, fortune,
   and extraordinary political capabilities, lulismo is a comparatively
   weak psychological phenomenon relative to and independently of petismo.
   Lulismo mainly reflects positive retrospective evaluations of Lula's
   performance in office. To the extent that it indicates anything more, it
   constitutes an embryonic form of petismo. The ideas that constitute
   lulismo are similar to the ideas that constitute petismo in voters'
   minds, and they have been so since the party's founding - a
   nonrevolutionary quest to make Brazilian democracy more equitable and
   more participatory. Both lulismo and petismo are key sources of the PT's
   strength, but petismo is likely to endure long after Lula has departed
   the political scene.},

Abstract = {Throughout their research, and most explicitly with their work on the
   concept of affect, J. K. Gibson-Graham think about our capacities and
   potentialities-the ``visceral intensities{''} that accompany
   politics-without falling into a moralistic or purist critique of
   limiting powers. They refuse to dismiss as trivial or marginal those
   everyday economic ventures that cannot be measured against the yardstick
   of capitalism but that nonetheless extend capacities in unpredictable
   ways. Through interviews conducted with both Katherine Gibson and Julie
   Graham, this paper examines the immanence of potentiality in
   Gibson-Graham's theoretical arguments and research practices. It also
   examines a less recognized, though crucial, dimension of their work: the
   place of impotentiality in thinking and practice. Impotentiality is
   poorly understood as a merely negative incapacity. An analysis of both
   thinkers' reflections on their own research practices demonstrates that
   our impotentiality enables us to live and think in ways that are more
   than reactive.},

Abstract = {The article describes the transformation of the political parties,
   associated with changes in modern politics and political communication
   in the digital age. Analyzed are the impact of personalization,
   interactivity and direct participation on traditional political parties,
   which have been put before the challenges of reducing the party
   membership, the ineffectiveness of traditional organizational
   mobilization, critics of the political elites and representation. Using
   websites and access parties to social networking determines the trend of
   turning them into media-communication parties with the formation of the
   extended party networks. Together with the transformation of the
   traditional political parties on the political scene there are new
   cyber-parties that for a decade have become one of the prominent
   political forces. Analyzed are the main features of the cyber-parties
   and demonstrates the level of their political influence. Proved is the
   idea of the network's nature of cyber-parties, revealed are their
   populist character and diversity of ideological aspirations.},

Volume = {49},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The article investigates the Europeanization of party politics by
   examining the accession of national parties to Europarties as a process
   of European regional integration. The advanced theoretical framework
   combines International Relations and Comparative Politics approaches and
   analyzes the dialectic relationship between the European People's Party
   (EPP) and Ukrainian domestic parties based on a systemic analysis of
   party manifestos and official documents, as well as discourse analysis.
   The study argues that the EPP has a direct, though weak, influence on
   aspiring Ukrainian members because of the low incentives, low degree of
   clarity of membership requirements and context-specific factors. In
   these circumstances, Konrad Adenauer Stiftung represents an informal
   channel for the Europeanization of Ukrainian center-right parties. A
   main finding is that despite the low size of material incentives and the
   lack of EU membership, both Ukrainian parties and the EPP engage in
   transnational cooperation following political incentives and ideational
   arguments.},

Abstract = {The article summarizes the works of foreign scholars on the analysis of
   the institutional rules of the electoral system, which are considered as
   a key tool to influence the essential elements of modern political
   systems. The author dwells on the analysis of factors that stimulate or
   reduce political competition in the electoral system. In particular, in
   this paper, such factors as rules of access to the vote, the right to
   nominate candidates, dependence on public funding of political parties,
   the influence of the number of seats allocated within the constituency
   of the nature of imbalances, the system of distribution of seats within
   parties, internal party selection of candidates, the votes in the
   conversion system mandates. The Appendix contains a table, which in
   visual form summarizes information about how the analyzed factors can
   exert influence on the level of political competition in general, as
   well as on the party political system, the electoral behavior of voters
   and the risks of illegal practices in particular.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE PEACE \& SECURITY},

Volume = {26},

Pages = {281-297},
Abstract = {Scholars are divided over the role of transitional justice trials.
   Hannah Arendt has argued that any attempt to add a didactic role to the
   court process risks politicization. In contrast, Judith Shklar has
   argued that it is a legal fable to argue that politics can be kept from
   the courtroom. This article reevaluates the legacy and collective memory
   of the Nuremberg, Frankfurt Auschwitz, and Majdanek trials in West
   Germany as a tool of public education. While these trials certainly
   affected the external legal culture, through radio, television, theater
   plays, films, and other forms of popular culture, the lessons Germans
   learned were not always the ones that prosecutors had hoped for.},

Abstract = {The tension arising from the activities of the radical Islamist groups
   has remained in the North Caucasus for already two decades. Constant
   reproduction of the criminal underground is to a large extent due to the
   active use by extremist groups of modern means of communication, which
   facilitates solving the task of creating and maintaining a layer of
   sympathizers who serve as a base for recruiting new militants. On the
   basis of analyzing the content of Internet websites linked to the
   organization ``Caucasus Emirate{''}, E.Zhirukhina traces the impact of
   the specificity of extremists' influence upon the potential audience
   revealing a series of narratives aimed at forming a culture of violence
   that they start to perceive as the only way to solve the problems facing
   the region.},

Abstract = {This article addresses and observes the crisis of Western democracy
   through the lens of the weakness of parties and party government,
   especially at the European Union (EU) level. Social stratification
   changes, global trends and ultimately the sustained economic crisis have
   placed political parties at the national and the EU level under enormous
   strain. Moreover, demands posed by the crisis on national governments by
   the EU have generated conflicting interests of different member states.
   The resulting development of Horizontal Euroscepticism has made
   intergovernmental decision making, which has represented the backbone of
   the EU legitimacy up to now, extremely problematic and has posed the
   need for rethinking democracy in multi-level Europe, ultimately by
   strengthening supranational democracy through the creation of a form of
   party government at the EU level as well.},

Abstract = {A superordinate identity reduces bias and facilitates intergroup
   cooperation. This suggests that getting European Union (EU) citizens to
   identify with Europe will decrease outgroup hostility. Is European
   identity thus a superordinate identity? Using Eurobarometer data, I
   determine which level of identification is the most inclusive for
   individuals' immigration attitudes. Those who feel European hold more
   favorable views toward immigrantsan effect that is amplified under
   conditions of cross-cutting cleavages and where country length of
   European Union membership is greatest. In contrast, strong national
   identity is associated with more negative immigration attitudes;
   regional identity has no effect. A subsequent test confirms that the
   benefits of identifying with Europe extend most strongly to immigrants
   of European Union origin, although positive effects are observed toward
   non-European Union migrants as well.},

Abstract = {In this short article, I want to summarize my argument (Deacon, 2013)
   that changes in global social policy at the level of international
   organizations (IOs) can only be completely accounted for if we
   centre-ground the role of individual policy entrepreneurs working within
   those agencies. The Social Protection Floor (SPF) is the case study. One
   of the key drivers of the SPF policy, then working in United Nations
   Children's Fund (UNICEF) has since October 2013 taken over the
   Directorship of the renamed Social Protection Department of the
   International Labour Organization (ILO) responsible for its delivery. In
   the second part of this piece, I examine briefly new initiatives
   instigated by her team and suggest the challenges she faces within and
   outside the ILO if this breakthrough policy is to continue to have
   influence and impact within the United Nation's (UN) system and in

Abstract = {The transformation of criminal intelligence in the province of Buenos
   Aires, Argentina, was carried out during the two stages of the
   provincial police and security reform (1998-1999; 2004-2007). After
   reviewing current approaches in this field, this article summarizes the
   reform policies, and the authoritarian legacies. Dissolution and
   rearrangement of police intelligence in 1998 is framed in normative,
   doctrinal innovations and training. On the strategy of hierarchization
   of intelligence implemented in 2004, preceded by a period of
   counter-reform, it is highlighted the creation by law of the unified
   databaseon organized crime. Substantive aspects of its practice are
   mentioned. The integration of information, analysis and technology was
   one of the paradigms of change.},

Abstract = {The campaign finance system has fragmented campaign activity in response
   to rules that are unworkable in a strong party system. The 2014
   congressional elections illustrate how party coalitions have adapted to
   practices that enable them to raise and spend money outside this formal
   regulatory framework. For several election cycles, partisan interest
   groups have used outside campaign organizations to circumvent rules that
   constrain candidate and party committees. The 2014 elections illustrate
   how party leaders in Congress and these candidates have now embraced the
   outside campaign strategy to wrest some control from other elements of
   the party. Recent changes to campaign finance rules may shift additional
   money toward traditional committees, but outside groups like Super PACs
   are now established features of US political campaigns.},

Abstract = {Democracy seems to be inextricably linked to crisis. This is true since
   the ancient writings of Plato and Aristotle. More recently, the debate
   over the crisis of democracy goes on under the heading of
   ``postdemocracy.{''} This article addresses the question of whether the
   crisis of democracy is an invention of theoretically complex but
   empirically ignorant theorists who adhere to an excessively normative
   ideal of democracy, on three levels: first, on the level of quality of
   democracy indices developed by experts; second, on the basis of the
   survey reports on the opinion of the demos; third, on a deeper analyses
   of crucial spheres of democracy. The results hint in different
   directions. According to expert indices and polls, the message is: there
   is no crisis of democracy. However, the partial analyses on
   participation, representation, and effective power to govern reveal
   unresolved democratic challenges, such as an increasing level of
   exclusion of the lower third of the demos from participation, an
   inferior representation of their interests, and a loss of democratic
   sovereignty in policy making.},

   Implications of Trifling with Custom},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {163-170},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This Article examines how the Supreme Court of Bangladesh relied on a
   theoretical model of Customary International Law (CIL) advanced by
   Professors Curtis A. Bradley and Mitu Gulati to withdraw from the rules
   of CIL. It explores how the Supreme Court applied the same reasons and
   relied on the same authorities as did the proponents of this model to
   effect a withdrawal. Although Bradley and Gulati advanced their model as
   an academic experiment, this did not deter the Supreme Court from
   applying the model to withdraw from the rules of CIL which define the
   jus cogens offence of crimes against humanity and to eventually sentence
   to death an opposition political leader on the basis of such withdrawal.
   Bradley and Gulati's model of CIL has been subject to a lot of scholarly
   criticism and the Bangladesh experience has to some extent justified
   these criticisms. This Article shows how countries which are prevented
   from achieving certain outcomes or realizing certain goals because of
   CIL may simply adopt Bradley and Gulati's model to withdraw from its
   rules.},

Abstract = {This article aims to explore the real potential of Turkey to become a
   regional natural gas hub by focusing on the current situation of gas
   producing countries around Turkey, and then moving to the future
   prospects of gas cooperation in the region. To this end, the article
   provides an assessment of both the current situation and future outlook
   of gas markets in Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Iraq, Iran, Israel, and
   Cyprus, subsequently providing a discussion of the future prospects of
   the Southern Gas Corridor and the potential Eastern Mediterranean Gas
   Corridor. This analysis demonstrates that Turkey will difficulty become
   a regional gas hub in the medium term (up to 2020-25), while it could
   have the potential to play an important role in the regional gas markets
   in the longer term (after 2025-30). This longer term potential can be
   realized if a number of infrastructural, commercial, and political
   barriers are overcome and if the EU gas demand recovers.},

Abstract = {A globalized world, some argue, needs a global democracy. But there is
   considerable disagreement about whether global democracy is an ideal
   worth pursuing. One of the main grounds for scepticism is captured by
   the slogan: ``No global demos, no global democracy.{''} The fact that a
   key precondition of democracy-a demos-is absent at the global level,
   some argue, speaks against the pursuit of global democracy. I discuss
   four interpretations of the skeptical slogan-each based on a specific
   account of the notion of ``the demos{''}-and conclude that none of them
   establishes that the global democratic ideal must be abandoned. In so
   doing, I systematize different types of objections against global
   democracy, thus bringing some clarity to an otherwise intricate debate,
   and offer a robust but qualified defense of the global democratic ideal.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the attitudes of German citizens toward the
   common currency. Drawing on data from 2011, the analysis shows that
   especially utilitarian considerations and group loyalties shape
   attitudes toward the Euro. In addition, people take foreign policy
   beliefs and elite cues into consideration when evaluating the single
   currency. Despite the high salience of Germany's Euro membership in the
   course of the sovereign debt crisis, only citizens with a medium level
   of political involvement take elite cues into account. The findings
   suggest that further public support for the common currency in Germany
   depends to a large extent on the development of the economic situation
   in the Eurozone and how political elites interpret these developments.},

Abstract = {This article examines why after 35 years of repeatedly rejecting the
   secret ballot, the British House of Commons enacted it with the Ballot
   Act of 1872. Drawing on roll-call votes, I show that parliamentary
   opposition to the secret ballot was invariant between 1832 and 1867. In
   1867, however, the Second Reform Act significantly extended the
   electoral franchise and substantially redistributed parliamentary seats;
   the House elected immediately following these changes to pass the Ballot
   Act of 1872. I show that a key reason for the change in the House's
   attitude on the ballot was that anti-ballot MPs whom the redistribution
   threatened to expose to electoral competition were disproportionately
   likely to retire prior to the 1868 election. These results imply that it
   was the anticompetitive effects inherent in the gross malapportionment
   of the older electoral system rather than the restricted nature of the
   franchise that insulated MPs from public pressure and kept parliamentary
   opinion on the secret ballot in stasis. This is a useful lesson because
   while almost all modern democracies operate on a universal adult
   suffrage, many continue to be marked by significant malapportionment.},

Title = {GLOBAL COLONIALITY AND THE CHALLENGES OF CREATING AFRICAN FUTURES},
Journal = {STRATEGIC REVIEW FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {181-202},

Abstract = {Can Africans create African futures within a modern world system
   structured by global coloniality? Global coloniality is a modern global
   power structure that has been in place since the dawn of Euro-North
   American-centric modernity. This modernity is genealogically and
   figuratively traceable to 1492 when Christopher Columbus claimed to have
   discovered a `New World'. It commenced with enslavement of black people
   and culminated in global coloniality. Today global coloniality operates
   as an invisible power matrix that is shaping and sustaining asymmetrical
   power relations between the Global North and the Global South. Even the
   current global power transformations which have enabled the re-emergence
   of a Sinocentric economic power and de-Westernisation processes
   including the rise of South-South power blocs such as BRICS, do not mean
   that the modern world system has now undergone genuine decolonisation
   and deimperialisation to the extent of being amenable to the creation of
   other futures. Global coloniality continues to frustrate decolonial
   initiatives aimed at creating postcolonial futures free from
   coloniality. The article posits that global coloniality remains one of
   the most important modern power structures that constrain and limit
   African agency. To support this proposition, the article delves deeper
   into an analysis of the architecture and configuration of current
   asymmetrical global power structures; unmasks imperial/colonial reason
   embedded in Euro-North American-centric epistemology as well as the
   problem of Eurocentrism; and unpacks the Cartesian notions of being and
   its relegation of African subjectivity to a perpetual state of becoming.
   Within this context, Africans have emerged as fighting subjects for a
   new world order that is decolonised, deimperialised, open to the
   emergence of new humanism and African futures.},

Abstract = {This article presents robust findings for the positive effect of
   corruption on the risk of ethnic civil war, using binary
   time-series-cross-section data that cover 87 to 121 countries (per year)
   between 1984 and 2007. Following a grievance-based explanation of
   violent intrastate conflict, we argue that corruption increases the risk
   of large-scale ethnic violence, as it creates distortions in the
   political decision-making process which lead to a deepening of political
   and economic inequalities between different ethnic groups. The positive
   effect of corruption on the risk of ethnic civil war is robust to
   various model specifications, including the interaction between
   corruption and natural resource wealth.},

Abstract = {The results of the 2009 Bundestag election and subsequent Land elections
   suggest that the German party system is changing fundamentally. A few
   facts suffice to corroborate this statement: Volatility has now reached
   levels that were last recorded in the 1950s; turnout in national
   elections has reached an all-time low; the two large parties have had
   unprecedentedly poor results in the Bundestag elections while all three
   smaller parties reached more than 10 percent. The article shows that
   German catch-all parties are about to lose their hold on the electorate
   and, as a result, can no longer rely on being the senior parties of
   government. The article analyses these changes systematically using a
   range of quantitative indicators covering the entire post-war period. It
   shows a seminal erosion of the forces which have stabilized the German
   party system in earlier decades and discusses the repercussions for the
   functioning of German party democracy.},

Abstract = {John Tomasi argues that a theory of justice should include economic
   liberty since it provides people with a way of living self-authored
   lives. However, as Aristotelians have pointed out, even seemingly
   neutral theories of justice rely on non-neutral conceptions of the good.
   In Tomasi's case, the ideal of self-authorship assumes that it is good
   to exert economic agency and in so doing, exercise one's economic
   liberty. Thus, Tomasi equates self-authorship with participation in
   market activities, tacitly universalizing what is, in fact, a narrow and
   objectionable conception of the good.},

Abstract = {The manner in which women appear, or disappear, within the Irish
   politics-media intersection is a question central to understanding the
   nature of contemporary politics for Irish women. This article explores
   the manner in which the 2011 General Election coverage broadcast on
   RTe's flagship current affairs series Prime Time was gendered. The
   representation of Irish women's engagement in politics was constituted
   through four dominant frames. Firstly, women are marginalised by being
   `framed out' of the political picture, secondly, they are framed through
   a visual gendering of politicians which presents women in a limited
   manner, thirdly, the source-frame is not applied equally to men and
   women on Prime Time and finally, women are framed as participants only
   in a limited set of topics for discussion.},

Abstract = {The use and efficacy of problem-based learning (PBL) exercises during
   single class periods, especially in political science courses, have
   largely been unstudied. This article explores the ability of a PBL
   exercise to provide better learning outcomes than a standard
   lecture-discussion presentation on a particular topic in an introductory
   political science course. The author finds that the PBL approach, as a
   one-time pedagogical exercise, is not more effective at producing
   learning. In exploring the data, however, the author finds that
   differences in course structure and methods of learning assessment can
   have a larger impact on learning outcomes than specific teaching
   techniques.},

Journal = {BALTIC JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN STUDIES},

Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {20-33},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The European Union has remained stable despite all its past and current
   challenges. This essay explores the reasons for that. We argue that the
   secret behind its stability lies in its system of negotiation. Against
   this backdrop, we analyse two recent challenges of the European Union.
   First, we show how domestically bound European governments were able to
   bring about a stable internationally negotiated solution for what became
   known as euro crisis. By means of game theory we boil down why the
   European Union remained stable even after havoc struck. Second, we
   analyze the dynamics behind the failed negotiations with Ukraine that
   have led to the current conflict. Thereby, the role of vested interest
   in negotiations for stability is emphasized. We prognosticate that due
   to the very same vested interests that led to the failure of the
   negotiations, Ukraine will remain united and return to stability in the
   mid-term. Finally, we conclude that, despite challenges like these, the
   European Union never experienced a crisis in terms of system theory
   since it never fell short to fulfil its purpose which is to allow for
   peaceful cooperative solutions.},

Volume = {58},
Number = {4},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Fixed statutes and regulations often have variable consequences over
   time. If left unattended, such drift can severely erode the performance
   of government as an institution of representation. To better understand
   the mechanics of policy-making in a changing world, we develop a
   positive theory that captures political drift in a dynamic
   separation-of-powers system. We show analytically that a distinctive
   combination of legislative supermajoritarianism and agency
   discretioninstitutional features that, in isolation, elicit widespread
   criticismcan effectively ameliorate policies' susceptibility to the
   vicissitudes of exogenous change. The critical mechanism for
   governmental accommodation of drift is delegation, which increases all
   decision makers' well-being by reducing fluctuations in outcomes.
   Although the complete smoothing of outcomes is attainable in a
   separation-of- powers system, we show that this is typically not
   achieved in equilibrium. The presence of drift provides an opportunity
   for self-interested legislators to extract a distributional benefit from
   their fellow legislators at the expense of overall policymaking
   efficiency.},

Abstract = {This article provides evidence for bias in the polling of American
   political candidates who are accused of personal or financial scandal,
   wherein the support of the accused candidate is understated. Evidence
   for this phenomenon is found in the analysis of a dataset of
   district-level polls of US House elections during the 2002-2012 election
   cycles. This bias helps to explain several unanticipated outcomes in
   recent American legislative elections, in which scandal-tarred
   incumbents unexpectedly were reelected or defeated by surprisingly
   narrow margins. The article also finds evidence of a smaller bias,
   previously observed by practitioners, wherein support is overstated for
   incumbents who are not accused of scandal.},

Volume = {6},

Abstract = {This article explores the impact of a widely publicized corruption
   scandal upon Indonesia's most prominent Islamic Party, the Prosperous
   Justice Party (PKS) in 2013, involving the exchange of money in return
   for beef-import licenses ({''}Beef-gate{''}). In the 2004 and
   200(elections PKS ran a populist campaign, drawing heavily upon
   anti-corruption rather than Islamic issues, and became renowned for its
   hard-line stance against graft. However, while PKS's reputation
   certainly deteriorated due to Beef-gate, it still performed better than
   anticipated in the nation's legislative election held in April 2014.
   This article proposes two possible reasons for this: the party's
   grassroots membership structure provided a solid basis from which to
   rebuild, and the senior leadership adeptly managed its image while the
   scandal was in the public eye. With this effective image management, the
   party was able to retain the support of many of its voters, while
   minimizing damage to its image more broadly.},

Abstract = {Over the last ten years, important progress has been made in the
   introduction of electronic administration in Spain. Legal reforms
   developed during this period have played an important role in this
   process. This article aims to analyse their scope, not only in terms of
   the initial approach, but also and above all, in terms of the demands
   made by today's social and technological context. Ultimately, our
   purpose is to determine to what degree the current regulatory framework
   is adequate and, where applicable, a change in the legal paradigm is
   required to meet this aim.},

Journal = {STATE POLITICS \& POLICY QUARTERLY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {277-296},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Legislative professionalism has played a prominent role in state
   politics research for decades. Despite the attention paid to its causes
   and consequences, recent research has largely set aside questions about
   professionalism's conceptualization and operationalization. Usually
   measuring it as an aggregate index, scholars theoretically and
   empirically treat professionalism as a unidimensional concept. In this
   article, we argue that exclusive use of aggregate indices can limit
   state politics research. Using a new dataset with almost 40 years of
   data on state legislative resources, salary, and session length, we
   reconsider the validity of using an index to study professionalism
   across the states. We evaluate the internal consistency of
   professionalism components over time, the relationship between
   components and the Squire Index, and the degree to which professionalism
   components are unidimensional using classical multidimensional scaling.
   We find enough commonality and enough variation between professionalism
   components to support a range of measurement strategies like the use of
   unidimensional indices (such as the Squire Index), disaggregating the
   components and analyzing their effects individually, or formulating
   multidimensional measures. Scholars should take care to choose the
   appropriate measure of the concept that best fits the causal
   relationships under examination.},

Title = {STATE-CORPORATE CRIME AND MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS: INTERROGATING AN
   ABSENCE},
Journal = {STATE CRIME},

Abstract = {The concept of state-corporate crime has been invoked and applied quite
   widely for more than 20 years now. We acknowledge the value of this
   concept but here address some of its conceptual limitations, especially
   in relation to crimes of large-scale investment and commercial banks,
   government-sponsored enterprises and international financial
   institutions. If the concept of state-corporate crime calls attention to
   the character and consequences of significant forms of crimes of the
   powerful, it tends to exclude attention to other forms of such crime.
   This article also addresses Steve Tombs' critique of state-corporate
   crime as it applies to what are here characterized as crimes of
   globalization. It considers the conundrum involved in a tension between
   achieving theoretical sophistication and in promoting effective
   responses to crimes of the powerful. It is a core premise of the
   analysis set forth here that in a rapidly changing, increasingly
   globalized twenty-first-century world, the forms of crime addressed here
   will necessarily attract more attention, especially relative to the
   traditional focus on conventional crime. A criminology that aspires to
   remain relevant in this environment must transform its understanding of
   crime.},

Abstract = {Decades of research have confirmed that debates increase viewer
   knowledge about the issue stands of the candidates. However, the
   conditions under which viewers learn are less well understood. In this
   article, we examine how differences in the context of information in
   presidential debates affect both who learns from such debates and what
   they learn. Consistent with previous literature, we report that watching
   the debates increased knowledge of campaign issues and related matters
   discussed in the debates. We also found that knowledge based on accurate
   information that was uncontested in the debate was gained at a greater
   rate than knowledge based on information that was presented by one
   candidate but contested by the other. And consistent with confirmation
   bias, learning based on information that was contested in the debate was
   influenced by viewers' candidate preferences more often than not.},

   Evidence from France},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {37},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1177-1185},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Insider-outsider theory argues that in dual labour markets there are two
   groups with opposing preferences regarding protection against dismissal:
   (i) insiders with permanent work contracts who defend employment
   protection, because it increases their rents, and (ii) outsiders
   (temporary workers and the unemployed) who see protection as barriers to
   mobility and demand deregulation. Although this argument is influential
   in the political economy literature, there is little empirical research
   on outsiders' preferences regarding employment protection. This article
   tests the argument using French data on support for a proposed reform of
   employment protection. The results show that permanent and temporary
   workers do not differ significantly in their support for employment
   protection, while some evidence indicates that the unemployed do show
   greater support for deregulation. The article concludes that
   insider-outsider theory overemphasises the relevance of employment
   protection for temporary workers and that care should be taken not to
   place these workers in a composite outsider group with the unemployed.},

Abstract = {In response to an alleged Communist coup in Indonesia on 1 October 1965,
   ambassadors Sir Keith Shann (Australia), Sir Andrew Gilchrist (United
   Kingdom), and Marshall Green (United States) initiated anti-Communist
   propaganda campaigns. In conjunction with the Indonesian army, these
   campaigns helped to underpin the rationale for widespread,
   army-coordinated anti-Communist repression throughout Indonesia. Through
   a careful re-examination of Australian archival materials regarding
   Indonesia between October 1965 and February 1966, this article provides
   a detailed, transnational chronology of propaganda efforts during the
   period of the massacres, highlighting the direct and indirect

Abstract = {Which policymakers are most likely to enact legislation drafted by
   organized business interests? Departing from the business power
   scholarship that emphasizes structural, electoral, or financial
   mechanisms for corporate influence, I argue that lawmakers are likely to
   rely on businesses' proposals when they lack the time and resources to
   develop legislation on their own, especially when they also hold an
   ideological affinity for business. Using two new datasets of ``model
   bills{''} developed by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC),
   a policy group that promotes pro-business legislation across the states,
   I find strong support for this theory. These results indicate that ALEC
   provides private policy capacity to state legislators who would
   otherwise lack such support, and relatedly, that low state policy
   capacity may favor certain organized interests over others-namely the
   business interests affiliated with ALEC. My findings have implications
   for the study of business influence in policymaking, as well as for
   state politics.},

Abstract = {We examine the effects of competitiveness and divisiveness in the 2010
   congressional election, as the emergence of the Tea Party resulted in
   many competitive Republican primaries and highlighted significant
   divisions within the party. We find that competitive Republican
   primaries and competitive Democratic primaries increased turnout in the
   general election. The presence of divisiveness in the Republican Party
   has no discernible effect on turnout on its own, but actually increases
   the vote share captured by the Republican Party in November.
   Additionally, we find that while either a competitive primary or the
   presence of a Tea Party candidate was advantageous to the Republican
   Party, the presence of both in the same election was no more beneficial
   than if there was either a competitive primary or a division in the
   party. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {This article analyses Ben Wellings' recent contribution to the debate
   over the English Question, English Nationalism and Euroscepticism:
   Losing the Peace, and places it within the context of the British
   Political Tradition (BPT). Wellings develops the case for an English
   nationalism characterised by an opposition to European integration.
   Although this article is broadly in agreement with his central
   proposition that Euroscepticism is the most coherent expression of
   English nationalism, it takes issue with his secondary argument that
   this nationalism is populist. Instead, this article reframes the case
   for Eurosceptic English nationalism in terms of a continued adherence to
   a BPT characterised by elitist ideas of responsibility and
   representation. Rather than being genuinely populist, the adoption of
   Eurosceptic attitudes by a growing section of the political class has
   been driven by a desire to perpetuate a political system that protects
   elite power and a culture of limited democratic participation. A study
   of Euroscepticism consequently offers evidence, not only of English
   nationalism, but also of the existence of a BPT that constrains and
   facilitates political action and development.},

Abstract = {The conflict between the West and Russia is also a crisis in European
   foreign and security policy. Disagreement and disinterest among the
   member states, turf wars within European Union institutions, and the
   long processes of coordination between Brussels and the national
   capitals have encouraged this crisis. To date, there has been no open,
   comprehensive assessment of the internal mistakes made over the past
   year. Such a study would be a prerequisite for a new European Ostpolitik
   that includes all of the countries in the neighbourhood as well as
   Russia.},

Abstract = {This article analyses Australian media portrayals of former Australian
   Prime Minister Julia Gillard's `sexism and misogyny' speech to
   parliament in October 2012. Our analysis reveals that coverage of the
   speech comprised three principal gendered framings: strategic attack,
   uncontrolled emotional outpouring and hypocrisy. We argue that these
   framings demonstrate the role the media plays as a gendered mediator,
   perpetuating the gender double bind that constrains female political
   leaders, as they negotiate the demand to demonstrate masculine
   leadership attributes without tarnishing the feminine qualities expected
   of them. In this instance, gendered media framings limited the saliency
   of Gillard's speech, curtailed calls for wider introspection on
   Australian political culture and further disassociated women from
   political leadership.},

Abstract = {A considerable debate precludes drawing conclusions about oil's effect
   on democracy. This article challenges this stalemate by significantly
   expanding the scope of the previous research and using meta-regression
   analysis to examine the integrated results of extant scholarship. While
   the results suggest a nontrivial negative association between oil and
   democracy across the globe, they also indicate a notable variation in
   this relationship across world regions and institutional contexts. A
   conditioning effect of institutions may lie more in a broader set of
   economic and political institutions, less so in previous political
   regime, but not in institutions associated with British colonial past.
   Finally, while oil does not seem to impede democracy by retarding two
   key channels of modernization-income and urbanization-it may have an
   indirect negative effect on democracy through its adverse impact on
   education.},

Abstract = {Political scientists have started to focus on `practice' as the smallest
   unit of analysis. Following a broader turn in the social sciences, the
   practice focus provides multiple advantages, including better
   conceptualizations of short-term social change, getting closer to the
   everyday activities of those speaking, writing and doing politics,
   appropriate conceptualization of agency-structure dynamics, or forms of
   analysis resonating with other communities than scholarly ones. This
   contribution asks what the methodological implications of the practice
   turn are. It is argued that the practice focus does not only imply a
   certain `theory' but also a certain methodology. I advance the term
   praxiography to speak about the forms of analysis produced by practice
   researchers. I discuss key guidelines of praxiographic research on two
   levels: first, general research strategies that provide empirical access
   points, second, guidelines for data collection in the frame of
   participant observation, expert interviews, and document analysis. I
   conclude in arguing that although praxiography is context driven, and
   hence requires to be tailored to the research problem, it is vital to
   reflect on the methodological repertoire of praxiographic research.},

Pages = {389-395},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Historically, there has been a lack of a clear French vision of the
   multinational nature of the United Kingdom. A gradual shift towards a
   clearer understanding has been demonstrated by a well-informed and
   even-handed presentation of the referendum debate in the French media.
   This article examines the presentation of that debate, as well as
   Scotland's increasing familiarity in France's cultural imagination. In
   politics there has been neither much enthusiasm nor overt hostility to
   the referendum, although a lingering suspicion of nationalist movements,
   wherever they might be, means that many French are surprised to discover
   the broadly social-democratic, pro-European and `civic' nature of
   Scotland's nationalism.},

Volume = {51},

Pages = {111-134},

Abstract = {In this article the traditional and modern elements of the identity of
   Serbs in Croatia are analysed. The author identifies the following key
   elements or markers of this identity: Christian Orthodox faith, use of
   Cyrillic alphabet, social and political preferences and values, concern
   for the status of their ethnic community, loyalty to specific
   organisations that represent their community, and memories of the Second
   World War, i.e. loyalty to Partisans. This article presents results of
   in-depth interviewing of a large number of ethnic Serbs from different
   regions of Croatia. The author concludes that following the
   disintegration of Yugoslavia, Serb identity in Croatia has been through
   an ambivalent process. On one hand, there is a process of
   re-traditionalisation and ``reviving of identity{''}, which had been
   neglected in the times of Yugoslavia. On the other hand, due to the war
   of the 1990s, Serb ethnic community in Croatia has been significantly
   reduced, and there are new fears - especially of the trend of
   assimilation. Many Serbs have left Croatia and will not return. Thus, it
   is possible that the Serb community is facing disappearance.},

Abstract = {Calls to extend the franchise to 16 and 17 year olds are gaining ground,
   with the 2014 Referendum on Scottish Independence potentially acting as
   a test ground for wider reforms. Debates on the relative merits of this
   decision aside, there is little practical experience of registering and
   engaging young people with major elections in the Scottish context. This
   article reports research on pilot Health Board Elections held in two
   areas of Scotland in 2010. 16 and 17 year olds were entitled to vote in
   these elections, and yet many were excluded by difficulties with
   registration, and turnout among those who did register was strikingly
   low. Drawing on focus groups in local schools, we draw out some key
   lessons for future efforts to engage young voters in Scotland.},

Abstract = {In a recent article in Political Theory (40, 5: 573-601), entitled Human
   Rights, Freedom, and Political Authority, Laura Valentini proposes a
   freedom-centered account of human rights. On this account, human rights
   are derived from the universal right to freedom, namely each person's
   innate right to a sphere of agency within which to pursue her ends and
   goals without being subject to the will of others (574). In spite of its
   prima facie appeal, I argue that Valentini's theory does not do a good
   job at explaining some of our settled convictions about the content of
   human rights and that she offers an implausibly restrictive view of our
   reasons for respecting human rights. I conclude by very briefly
   presenting the main elements of a broader perfectionist and dignitarian
   account of human rights, which seems more consistent with our settled
   convictions on these matters.},

Abstract = {If one believes polls, President Vladimir Putin enjoys tremendous
   approval ratings. His high standing, however, says more about the state
   of the political system - which steers public opinion with the help of
   television as well as mobilising, integrative symbols - than it does
   about society's attitudes. After all, society is cut off from the chance
   to influence politics. In a situation of political impoverishment where
   elective possibilities are missing and competition is nonexistent, the
   approval ratings of the Putin regime have a purely ceremonial, imitative
   character.},

Abstract = {Immigration is one of the most frequently covered issues in opinion
   surveysbut the volume and type of questions asked has actually obscured
   many of the key facts about our attitudes. This article summarises a
   year-long project to draw together as much of the published polling as
   possible in one place, in as neutral a way as possible. The overall
   picture is one of genuine concern about immigration among a large
   proportion of the populationbut more nuance on specific aspects, and a
   number of important gaps between perceptions and reality. Also
   highlighted are the increasingly polarised views on immigration between
   generations and different class and education groupings. The lower level
   of concern among younger generations and the growing graduate class
   suggests that immigration may be less of a concern in the futurebut that
   the electoral weight of the more concerned older generations means that
   restrictive rhetoric and policy on immigration will be a key feature of
   the 2015 general election.},

   findings indicate that GDELT should be used with caution for geo-spatial
   analyses at the subnational level: its overall correlation with
   hand-coded data is mediocre, and at the local level major issues of
   geographic bias exist in how events are reported. Overall, our findings
   suggest that due to these issues, researchers studying local conflict
   processes may want to wait for a more reliable geocoding method before
   relying too heavily on this set of machine-coded data.},

Abstract = {This article systematically assesses whether open political competition
   ends the coup trap. We use an original data set of coup reports,
   electoral competition, and socioeconomic data spanning the 20th century
   in 18 Latin American countries. Our models, which are robust to
   multiple-comparison tests, generate support for a central claim: While
   recent experience with military coups increases the risk of incumbents
   being overthrown, the establishment of open political competition ends
   cycles of political instability. The risk of being overthrown
   consequently declines with time for presidents in noncompetitive
   systems, but remains stable-and, on average, substantially lower-in
   competitive polities. Coups do not vary with levels of development or of
   inequality, economic growth rates, or the legislative powers of the
   presidency.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the notion of identity from various current
   approaches- such as poststructuralist and postcolonial theories within
   the area of philosophy as well as anthropology-and how identity, taking
   into account the plurality of contemporary social subjects such as
   religious communities, enables the expansion of the study of political
   dynamics. As a specific case study, a neopentecostal community in Buenos
   Aires, Centro Cristiano Nueva Vida (cnvc) is selected. The article
   analyzes how this church builds its socio-political identity in light of
   its religious specificity: theological discourses, symbolic processes,
   rituals, and institutional methods.},

Journal = {REVISTA ESPANOLA DE CIENCIA POLITICA-RECP},
Year = {2014},

Pages = {91-112},

Abstract = {The study of political representation is usually centred in the analysis
   of descriptive and substantive dimensions, leaving behind what is known
   as symbolic representation, mainly due to the difficulty in its
   theoretical and analytical treatment. The aim of this article is to
   approach a theoretical and methodological proposal to measure the
   symbolic dimension and show its practical application to the Spanish
   case by means of the discourse analysis of MPs during the 2000-2004
   legislative period. Hence, it is used the in-depth interview technique
   to know the perceptions that about the political representation have MPs
   of both sexes, covering the whole ideological spectrum and with
   representation in both Chambers. Moreover, the article offers a new
   theoretical framework for the qualitative study of political
   representation that takes into account not only the actors' attributes
   but also the context in which they are placed. In this sense, the main
   hypothesis verified is that the speeches that MPs have about symbolic
   representation would vary according to the actors attributes
   -{''}critical mass{''} and/or ``critical actors{''}-and to the
   institutional and legislative context -{''}critical contexts{''}-in
   which they are located.},

Abstract = {Federalism is considered to be conducive to democracy and incompatible
   with autocracy. In democracies, federalism is established to limit state
   power and to augment citizens' opportunities to participate.
   Authoritarian regimes allow neither. Our paper assumes that the
   relationship between these three structural components is more complex
   than commonly supposed. In both autocracies and democracies, federalism
   generates tension between institutions and actors which impacts on the
   functioning and the dynamics of the political systems. By taking into
   account structural dilemmas and dynamics in `multidimensional' systems,
   the interrelation between federalism on the one hand and democratic or
   authoritarian regimes on the other hand can be assessed more accurately.
   This article identifies formal and informal patterns that create (in-)
   compatibilities between democracy and federalism or that reinforce
   authoritarian tendencies. Subsequently, it elaborates the potential of
   federalism to enhance democracy in non-democratic countries. The article
   draws on the examples of Canadian and Russian federalism.},

Abstract = {This article outlines both the overall structure of the INTEREURO
   Project (Comparative Research on Interest Group Politics in Europe) and
   the theoretical foci, research activities and data sets generated by its
   several modules. We provide this description for two purposes. First, it
   provides a necessary backdrop for understanding the remaining essays in
   this special issue. Importantly, we do not believe that the
   methodological challenges we faced are unique to the INTEREURO Project.
   Rather, they characterize any large-N research project on interest
   representation. Thus, we hope that these articles based on the INTEREURO
   Project are useful to a broad range of scholars. Our second purpose is
   to describe for the wider community of interest organization scholars
   the INTEREURO Project and the data generated thereby.},

Abstract = {We investigate strategic voting in proportional representation (PR)
   systems where parties are organized in pre-electoral coalitions and
   subject to a vote threshold. We show that such political systems are
   likely to generate coordination problems among the supporters of a
   coalition, and we examine voter behavior in this setting using a
   laboratory experiment with repeated rounds of elections. Our findings
   suggest that in absence of electoral history, voters cannot coordinate
   their efforts successfully and are more likely to vote sincerely.
   However, as history becomes available, the vote threshold induces
   strategic coordination on parties that performed best in previous
   elections.},

Abstract = {The Carter Administration came to office intent on changing the
   traditional logic of US foreign policy, namely by promoting a foreign
   policy set in a framework based on human rights. The Administration
   sought to make human rights a central tenet of US foreign policy while
   simultaneously protecting American national interests abroad. However,
   since early on, critics have considered the Administration's policy to
   be inconsistent and indecisive due to its failure to grasp the
   complexity of balancing many inherently conflicting issues. This paper
   analyses the Carter Administration's human rights policy throughout its
   term in office. It demonstrates how the Administration acknowledged the
   difficulty in reconciling moral and material issues in the development
   of its foreign policy. In addition, the paper considers how US human
   rights policy has informed foreign policy in subsequent Administrations.
   It highlights the continuous dynamics contributing to the
   inconsistencies verified between foreign policy discourse and behaviour.},

Abstract = {In most modern parliamentary democracies, it is unlikely that single
   party governments will be formed, meaning that a voter's preferred party
   presumably has to share cabinet offices and negotiate policy compromises
   in a coalition government. This raises the question of how voters
   evaluate potential (coalition) governments, especially since recent
   studies have shown that coalition preferences influence voting
   behaviour. In this paper, we combine theories of voting behaviour,
   government formation and political learning to derive expectations
   regarding the factors that may impact voters' coalition preferences. We
   test our hypotheses by analysing survey data from the German federal and
   state levels. The results of a mixed logit regression analysis support
   our arguments: Voters' coalition preferences not only depend on the
   perceived policy distance between the positions of voters and the most
   distant party within combinations of parties, but also on predominant
   patterns of government formation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Giving speeches in parliament is a key element of elected
   representatives for signalling their policy agenda and their ideological
   positions to their party and their electorate. Taking a specific
   programmatic position might increase the chances of an MP to get
   re-nominated and to win again a seat in the legislature. In this paper,
   we build on approaches of responsive behaviour of political actors and
   on principal agent theories and ask which variables can explain the
   programmatic positions adopted by MPs in their speeches. To answer our
   research question, we collected all speeches related to economic policy
   issues given by members of the German Bundestag in the time period
   between 1998 and 2002. We estimated their individual policy positions
   with computerised methods of content analysis. We combine this data with
   information on the characteristics of MPs, their position in party,
   parliament and government and, in addition, with the socioeconomic
   structure and former election results within the MPs' constituency. The
   results show that German MPs take the characteristics and the economic
   problem pressure of their constituencies into account when speaking in
   parliament, so that there is empirical evidence for responsive and
   vote-seeking behaviour of German MPs. In addition, political and
   institutional factors like the membership in committees or in (former)
   cabinets and the way how an MP was elected - directly or by party list -
   play a role for the degree of MP's programmatic deviation from the party
   line.},

Abstract = {Policy congruence between parties and their voters is a prerequisite for
   the latter's representation. Related research typically focuses on the
   left-right dimension. We contribute to this literature by conceiving the
   alignment between citizens and political elites as congruence on issues
   that individual citizens consider important (salience-based congruence).
   Furthermore, we approach salience from the citizen's perspective and
   measure it at the individual level. Based on data from the Swiss
   Election Study (2007), we demonstrate that the assessment of party
   representation changes once we take salience into account. Policy
   congruence on salient issues is high and niche parties perform better
   than mainstream parties. Our arguments and findings about the role
   personal issue salience plays at the individual and party levels have
   important repercussions for contemporary debates on representation and
   policy congruence.},

Abstract = {The relationship between public social policies for poverty reduction
   and the requirements of international organizations on the issue may
   explain the similarities between public policies in countries with
   significant economic and cultural differences. The formulation of these
   policies may be linked to factors of the domestic political and economic
   situation and also to the institutional encouragement and international
   cultural standard, as discussed in the literature on the Theories of
   Policy Diffusion and Policy Transfer. This article presents the results
   of ongoing research that investigates Brazilian social policies for
   poverty reduction under the Cardoso, Lula, and Rousseff administrations.
   It suggests that so-called positive modeling predominated as national
   policies were linked to international policies focusing on the
   low-income population and that the international political community
   considered Brazilian conditional cash transfer policies as a model. In
   the second Lula and Rousseff administrations, there was negative
   modeling (i.e., contrary to international recommendations) between
   policies of economic growth and increasing or maintaining the values of
   social public spending; international financial institutions prescribe
   economic austerity and a reduction of social public policy. At the same
   time, there was positive modeling due to the centrality that the
   administrations have assigned to policies focusing on the low-income
   population. This centrality may bring a risk to the universalist
   perspective.},

Abstract = {The present paper aims to demonstrate in a holistic way the existent
   relationships between racism and society in the city of << El Ejido >>
   in Almeria, southern Spain. This existent relationship will be displayed
   from an anthropological perspective, based on the Cultural Materialism,
   Theory by Marvin Harris and the general, Theory of Conflicts by Johan
   Galtung, at the same time as looking for a nexus with the approaches of
   Francisco Jimenez, which leads cultural materialism towards an
   anthropology for peace. This investigation of scientific character, is
   based on diagnostics, prognostics and therapy of the pathologies derived
   from the new postmodern society. The fictionalization which subjugates
   the society, stemming from Biopolitics and Biopower or excessive use of
   symbolic, direct, or structural power, leads towards a shared nihilism,
   which presents a multi-pathological diagnosis which forms a diffuse and
   hostile social fabric, where racism reveals itself in a subtle way. In
   reference to this, what we propose as a possible solution of the
   multidimensional conflict of racism, within the scope of the general
   theory of conflicts and peace studies, is the eradication of the
   violence through the application of the Neutral Peace, Theory, which is
   developed and promoted by Francisco Jimenez, in the diverse contexts
   where the germ of discriminatory racism makes itself visible.},

Abstract = {This paper reconsiders whether federal and provincial parties are as
   independent and separate as the literature would suggest. Examining five
   different types of party personnel (party members, activists, riding
   presidents, candidates and legislators) this paper explores how federal
   parties and their counterparts in Ontario have responded to multi-level
   governance. Rather than embracing ``two political worlds,{''} party
   personnel have responded to the federal nature of Canadian politics by
   engaging with parties at multiple levels. Additionally, the paper
   examines two competing explanations of party integration and seeks to
   uncover whether differences organizational design or ideological
   consistency best explain divergent levels of party integration. The
   experience of the Conservatives demonstrates that vertical integration
   is not a result of a party's organizational design alone and that a
   coherent ideology can help to offset a truncated organizational
   structure.},

Abstract = {Immigrant-origin minorities are underrepresented in many democratic
   legislatures. This paper evaluates the direct effects of voter
   discrimination on the electoral performance of minority political
   candidates in Germany. Using evidence from both a survey experiment and
   actual election data, the paper tests two mechanisms of
   discrimination-negative attitudes toward minority groups and assumptions
   about candidate ideology-and shows that neither results in a substantial
   penalty for the small numbers of minority candidates who actually
   compete for office. Minority candidates in Germany typically run for
   political parties that discriminating voters would not have supported in
   any case.},

Title = {A partisan gap in the supply of female potential candidates in the
   United States},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A partisan disparity in women representatives in the US House emerged in
   the 1980s and has continued to grow in magnitude. We show that this
   pattern closely mirrors the emergence of a partisan disparity in the
   proportion of women in the US public with the typical characteristics of
   high-level officeholders. Our analysis indicates that the proportion of
   women in the Democratic pool of potential candidates is now two to three
   times larger than in the Republican pool of potential candidates. Given
   the current association of party identification with gender and other
   characteristics, this gap is more likely to increase than decrease over
   the coming decade, with potential consequences for the descriptive and
   substantive representation of women in American politics.},

Abstract = {A large literature examines the composition of cabinets in parliamentary
   systems, but very little attention has been paid to the size of those
   cabinets. Yet not only is the size of the cabinet related to the
   division of portfolios that may take place, cabinet size is also related
   to policy outcomes. In this article, a theory of party size is
   considered which examines how coalition bargaining considerations,
   intra-party politics and efficiency concerns affect the size of
   cabinets. Hypotheses derived from the theory are examined using an
   extensive cross-national dataset on coalition governments which allows
   us to track changes in cabinet size and membership both across and
   within cabinets.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new measure of party system nationalization
   based on a minimalist definition of the phenomenon. A perfectly
   nationalized party system is a party system with only national parties
   or, in other words, without sub-national parties. Instead of the
   homogeneity of parties' vote shares or the number of parties throughout
   the country, our measure captures the aspirations of parties to be
   national whose proxy is the proportion of districts (weighted by seats)
   that a party runs a candidate. The measure is compared with existing
   indicators through a longitudinal analysis of 256 elections in 18
   Western European countries from 1945 to 1998.},

Abstract = {The national identity argument holds that a shared national identity is
   necessary to motivate citizens in democratic societies to pursue a
   number of goals, especially social justice. We review the empirical
   evidence for and against this claim, looking particularly at how
   national identities have been measured. We distinguish between studies
   that aim to compare the relative strength of identities cross-nationally
   and those that look at individual differences within one nation. We
   separate four dimensions of national identity: national attachment,
   national pride, critical vs. uncritical patriotism, and civic vs.
   cultural conceptions of identity. These are only weakly correlated with
   each other, and impact differently on support for social justice and the
   welfare state. Using case studies from the United States, Canada, and
   the United Kingdom, we suggest that the relationship between national
   identity and social justice varies between societies, and that a key
   factor is finding an appropriate balance between the strength of such
   identities and their inclusiveness.},

Abstract = {Since the new millennium, scholars have acclaimed a vigorous global
   justice movement (GJM). Many accounts have stressed the tolerant
   identities of those involved in this movement, and/or the movement's
   horizontal decision-making structure. Consequently, formal organizations
   are often excluded from analysis, precluding the chance to assess
   systematically whether they are involved in social movement modes of
   coordination. The article uses deductive block modelling and inferential
   statistics on survey data of a broad sample of 208 western European
   global justice organizations to uncover their modes of coordination. I
   find that many organizations commonly considered integral to the GJM
   demonstrate organizational and coalitional modes of coordination, while
   formal organizations often engage in coalitional work. Organizations
   most densely networked, including some formal organizations, do have
   social movement modes of coordination: they identify with the GJM,
   display continuity in attendance at international protests/events, and
   have contentious relations with political institutions. In addition, I
   raise methodological considerations for future studies of social
   movement modes of coordination.},

Abstract = {Dealing with violent pasts in post-conflict societies is especially
   problematic in ethnically divided societies where ideas about historical
   events are inextricably bound up with ideas about identity, community,
   and nation. In such cases ``the past{''} often becomes a key issue on
   which to contest long-standing grievances and justify particularistic
   visions of the future. This article argues that, in conjunction with
   judicial procedures, post-conflict societies might best foster fragile
   settlement processes by fencing in or framing historical narratives
   about the past. This framing of the past involves a repositioning of
   historical events in relation to the present and involves not simply a
   rewriting of the historical record but its re-presentation through
   discursive tropes. While that process is intrinsic to ethnic
   mobilization, I argue that it can be counterproductive to cultivating
   peace and consolidating democracy. Alternatively, I argue (following
   Jacques Ranciere) that the recognition of framing processes in regard to
   dealing with the past is the beginning of ``politics{''} - as
   characterized by dissensus and debate - which is the opposite of the
   stultifying tendency to superimpose ethnically inflected received
   wisdoms. That recognition can give way to alternative frames that speak
   to broader concerns about peace-building through democratic
   consolidation.},

Abstract = {Some of the most perceptive observers of public life have emphasised its
   tragic dimensions, not so much out of sympathy for politicians, but
   because the lens of tragedy offers a unique insight into the realities
   of the world of politics. Here I attempt to synthesise this tragic
   perspective by employing the comments of those best positioned to
   identify the salient features of public life, its primary dramatis
   personae. Politics occasionally provides us with the kind of spectacular
   catastrophe that journalists like to construe as tragedy. But our
   purpose is to evoke a different, more personal, less visible kind of
   tragedy: the small but malignant tragedies of self-betrayal, of
   inflation of the ego and deflation of conscience, of helpless witness to
   injustice and misfortune, of status unaccompanied by power or efficacy,
   of the shrinking of aspiration to the scale of the practicable, of
   disillusion and, on occasion, of despair.},

   perceptions of candidates' ability to handle the most important issue.
   It provided accurate forecasts of the 2012 US presidential election. The
   results demonstrate the model's usefulness if one issue clearly
   dominates the campaign, such as the state of the economy in the 2012
   election. It is also particularly valuable if economic fundamentals
   disagree, a situation in which forecasts from traditional political
   economy models suggest high uncertainty. The model provides immediate
   feedback to political candidates and parties on the success of their
   campaign and can advise them on which issues to assign the highest

Abstract = {Among welfare programmes public pension schemes have been particularly
   subject to cost-containment. Various countries have been exposed to
   relatively similar pressures such as ageing populations or growing
   unemployment. The literature on comparative welfare states tends to
   highlight the significance of domestic factors in mediating the
   influence of these pressures. This article instead explores the policy
   impact of international financial institutions (IFIs) including the
   World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Union
   (EU) on the reform of old-age pension systems in Greece and Turkey. It
   suggests that in both countries, IFIs have helped to trigger the process
   of reforms and to spread the global pension orthodoxy. Although the
   pension schemes still diverge in institutional structure and benefit
   provision, in both cases adoption of the pension orthodoxy of
   individualisation of pension rights has followed the advice tendered by
   the IFIs.},

Abstract = {How are new forms of violence expertise organized and exploited? Most
   scholars view this as primarily a question of state-building; that is,
   violence experts use their skills in an attempt to regulate economic
   transactions or to extract and redistribute resources via protection
   rents either for themselves or at the behest of political elites. In an
   alternative view, this article demonstrates that historical gunfighters
   active in the late 19th-century American Southwest were actually market
   actors-the possessors of valuable skills cultivated through
   participation in the Civil War and diffused through gunfighting and
   reputation building in key market entrepots. Neither solely
   state-builders nor state-resisters, as they have traditionally been
   interpreted, gunfighters composed a professional class that emerged in
   the 1870s and 1880s and who moved frequently between wage-paying jobs,
   seizing economic opportunities on both sides of the law and often
   serving at the behest of powerful economic, rather than political,
   actors. I establish this claim by examining a dataset of over 250
   individuals active in the ``gunfighting system{''} of the post-bellum
   West, demonstrating that the social connections forged through fighting,
   and diffused through social networks, helped generate a form of
   organized violence that helped bring ``law and order{''} to the frontier
   but as a byproduct of market formation rather than as state-building.},

Abstract = {The efficiency of local public goods provision and the functioning of
   local democracy crucially depend on the size and number of local
   jurisdictions. This article empirically analyzes voluntary municipal
   mergers in Finland. Our main focus is on aspects that have been somewhat
   neglected in prior empirical work: whether local democracy
   considerations, representation and voter preferences are involved in
   shaping the resulting municipal structure. The main results imply that
   some municipalities are forced to merge due to fiscal pressure and have
   to trade off political power to be accepted by their partners. The study
   also finds that the median voter's distance from services matters, while
   population size does not. The latter, somewhat surprising, observation
   is possibly explained by existing municipal co-operation, which already
   exhausts potential economies of scale.},

Abstract = {This article is the introduction to a special issue of articles written
   in honour of Peter Mair. The general theme of the issue is party
   adaptation and change, which is traced here through an analysis of
   contributions by Peter Mair as an individual author or with co-authors.
   The result is an assessment of the current state of the art of what can
   be cumulatively considered Peter Mair's theory of party adaptation and
   of the debate it has generated up to and including the contributions
   included in the special issue itself.},

Journal = {STATE CRIME},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {3},

Pages = {4-28},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {The forced migrant(1) to Europe is hostage to a tight
   ``migration-security nexus{''}, 2 their conversion into a globally
   ubiquitous ``illegal{''} presence facilitated by the incorporation of
   the global security industry into the region's system of external border
   controls. The European Union(3) not only outsources its border control
   activities to private security concerns (as well as third-party states),
   but also consults them on the direction of its policies, adopting their
   discourse and practices. It is using their expertise to meld member
   states' border technology into an apparatus of detection and deterrence
   that stretches far beyond the region to intercept forced migrants long
   before they reach its borders. The agencies that patrol on Europe's
   behalf outside its geopolitical boundaries also operate outside national
   legal structures, without regard to international human rights or
   refugee rights. Under cover of the privatization and securitization(4)
   of its immigration and asylum regime, the European Union acts with
   impunity in a parallel world of extra-legal(5) practices.},

Abstract = {The Democratic and Republican Parties both make strong claims that their
   policies benefit racial and ethnic minorities. These claims have,
   however, received little systematic empirical assessment. This is an
   important omission, because democracy rests on the ability of the
   electorate to evaluate the responsiveness of those who govern. We assess
   Democrats' and Republicans' claims by compiling census data on annual
   changes in income, poverty, and unemployment over the last half century
   for each of America's racial and ethnic groups. Judged by the empirical
   record, it is clear which party truly benefits America's communities of
   color. When the nation is governed by Democrats, racial and ethnic
   minority well-being improves dramatically. By contrast, under Republican
   administrations, blacks, Latinos, and Asian Americans generally suffer
   losses.},

Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {189-213},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Despite the ubiquity of yard signs, little is known about how and why
   individuals display them. Using two original studies of the 2008
   presidential race, along with American National Election Study data, we
   address three points pertaining to this understudied form of political
   participation. First, what are the correlates of the individuals and
   households that display signs? Second, what motivates such displays, and
   to what extent do those motives reflect expressive and communicative
   desires? Finally, how do individuals obtain signs, and do
   individuals-rather than parties or candidates-play a role in spreading
   signs throughout neighborhoods? Our findings suggest that the
   dissemination of yard signs is not merely a top-down process driven by
   campaign professionals, but a genuine participatory act that is fueled
   by individual initiative and social networking.},

Abstract = {Hypothetically, in the open list PR system, all contestants,
   independently of their ballot position, have the same chance of winning
   a mandate. In practice, candidates placed at the top of the ballot enjoy
   a large surplus of votes. Their success can be explained by the primacy
   effect, in which the first ballot position acts as a focal point. The
   analysis of 6187 candidates running for the Polish Sejm in 2007 finds
   not only significant gains for top candidates, but that proximity to the
   upper end of the ballot likewise matters. It correspondingly discovers a
   weak benefit for candidates placed last on the list. Other sources of
   candidate advantage such as incumbency, capital city effect, age and
   gender are also investigated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Differences in political culture have been observed at the
   cross-national and subnational levels, and political culture corresponds
   with a wide array of important social and political phenomena. However,
   possible psychological correlates of political culture are less clear.
   Building on research in personality psychology and cross-cultural
   psychology, this study contemplates whether aggregate personality
   measures compiled in the American states correspond with patterns in
   political culture. Using measures of personality traits provided by more
   than 600,000 survey respondents, parallels with state-level measures of
   citizen ideology, political culture, and civic culture are examined.
   Possible mechanisms linking personality and political culture are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Since the financial crisis there has been a focus on responsibility or
   accountability in Icelandic society and people have asked if some
   individuals were responsible for the fall of the Icelandic banks. This
   article discusses individual responsibility and the role of institutions
   in relation to a case of the consultative group on financial stability
   and contingency planning established in 2006 as described in the Special
   Investigation Commission report. The first part of the article discusses
   the distinction between passive and active responsibility and the role
   of institutions in defining roles and responsibility. In the second
   part, I will offer a detailed discussion of the case of the consultative
   group on financial stability in relation to responsibility. In the third
   part the case will be analyzed from the criteria of active
   responsibility and well structured institutions. The conclusion is that
   the consultative group failed as a structure to meet its task and give
   their members opportunity to behave responsibly prior to the financial
   crisis.},

Abstract = {Studying interest groups in the European Union (EU) over time has proven
   difficult because of the lack of the critical data necessary for
   studying changes in interest group population dynamics and behaviour. In
   this article, I explain how data has been gathered, coded, and combined
   to create a data set worthy of population ecology studies vis-a-vis
   interest groups in the EU. I provide details of both the data-mining
   experience and some of the theoretical bases for coding decisions. In
   addition, I explain what new contributions this data set makes to the
   established data sets in the field and offer ways in which it enhances
   the potential for more valid research in the future while also
   discussing its shortcomings and possible methods of improvement.},

Abstract = {How is it possible to create more just forms of peace in our world? This
   article responds to calls for a feminist theory/peace studies
   collaboration by integrating work on feminist care ethics and conflict
   transformation. We propose that justpeace is possible by strengthening
   ways of knowing which sustainably weave together understandings of
   ``self{''} and ``other{''} to support relationships of care over
   dehumanization and violence. Building on Sara Ruddick's work, we argue
   that her ``maternal thinking{''} can be understood as a feminist
   ``weaving{''} epistemology or flexible way of knowing that promotes
   meaningful inclusion, symmetrical power relations, and positive peace
   through three major practices: (1) living with dissonance, (2)
   creatively overcoming disconnects between the interests of the self and
   the other, and (3) bridging practical goals for surviving the present
   with more idealistic goals for best practices in the future. As such, it
   provides an alternative to ``othering{''} practices at individual,
   national, and international levels which reinforce asymmetrical power
   relations, strengthen unjust social, economic and political structures,
   and support violent conflict. In conclusion, we illustrate how this
   weaving epistemology supports human rights practices promoting people
   over profit, equality over discrimination and violence, and restorative
   rather than retributive forms of conflict transformation.},

Abstract = {This paper develops a notion of `local capitalisms'. Starting from a
   particular, Marxist theorisation of capitalism and of the state, local
   capitalism is analysed as a nexus of production, reproduction of people,
   and the state within a locality. The latter construct, and are
   constructed by, specific relations of class, gender, ethnicity and age,
   themselves internally related. On this basis one can specify the
   `vertical difference' of local from national capitalisms. Combined and
   uneven development leads to both commonalities and differentiation
   between localities, enabling us to understand the nature and origins of
   `horizontal' differences between local capitalisms. Both capitalism and
   the state are understood as riven by contradictions, some centrally
   involving space, place and scale. Consequent disruptions to local
   capitalisms, and the bases for local struggle by the oppressed and
   exploited, are discussed. The paper concludes by reflecting on the
   differences between my theorisation and mainstream approaches to
   `comparative capitalisms'.},

Pages = {3-25},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Increasing interest in applying the theory and practice of deliberative
   democracy to new and varied political contexts leads us to ask whether
   or not deliberation is a universal political practice. While
   deliberation does manifest a universal competence, its character varies
   substantially across time and space, a variation partially explicable in
   cultural terms. We deploy an intersubjective conception of culture in
   order to explore these differences. Culture meets deliberation where
   publicly accessible meanings, symbols, and norms shape the way political
   actors engage one another in discourse. Fuller understanding of
   political deliberation requires comparative and historical studies of
   particular contexts. We look at one case from Egypt in some depth and
   provide shorter illustrations from Botswana, Europe, India, Japan,
   Madagascar, the United States, Yemen, and elsewhere. Cross-cultural
   learning can enrich the theory of deliberative democracy, and give
   democratic theory a more universal reach.},

Abstract = {In the former Soviet Union, films about the First World War mark the
   start of the century of images. The abundance of documentary and feature
   films in the interwar period refutes the thesis that the war was
   ignored. Next to literature, film was the most popular art form; it gave
   contour to the trauma endured and provided distraction. But film was
   also instrumentalized; it conveyed propaganda and criticism of
   capitalism. With the start of the ``Great Patriotic War{''}, the focus
   of attention shifted.},

   shift away from `federal blindness'},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Pages = {21-45},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) has been through many institutional
   transformations since the start of the integration project in the 1950s.
   While much of the literature has focussed on the more dramatic changes,
   less attention has been paid to instances of more limited institutional
   change. This article maps out and then accounts for the limitedness of
   the EU's departure from its original `federal blindness' vis-a-vis
   regional actors. Theories of institutional change would lead one to
   expect that, as integration and regionalization heightened, endogenous
   pressures for change would trigger greater reform than that observed.
   Using a novel formula to estimate the EU's aggregate regionalization
   levels over time, the article demonstrates that it peaked between 1986
   and 2003 but has since dropped to a level below that of the 1950s. Such
   a finding not only corrects a widespread assumption about
   regionalization levels in the European polity, but also provides an
   explanation for the pace and scope of the observed change as well as
   predictions about its future sources.},
