Abstract = {As China progresses, its Science and Technology (S\&T) system evolves as
   well, driven by new aspirations, changing needs and surging resources.
   With the rapid growth of research and development expenditure and a
   growing supply of talents, China has been reshaping the global research
   landscape. The quality of research however has been criticised as less
   impressive than the quantity. To become a global innovation powerhouse,
   China needs to reform its S\&T governance, funding and evaluation.},

Abstract = {This article examines the democratic roles performed by Ghanaian
   non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Drawing on a comparative case
   study approach, it explores how the organizational characteristics of
   five donor-sponsored NGOs relate to their ability to perform different
   democratic roles. Our analysis reveals that some of the democratic roles
   require contradicting organizational characteristics, which are
   therefore difficult to combine within one organization. Furthermore, it
   demonstrates that these NGOs do not contribute to democracy as predicted
   by theory. In particular, they are weak at providing channels of
   communication between state and society, and at directly representing,
   involving, and being accountable to ordinary citizens. We argue,
   nevertheless, that they perform these functions in a different way.},

Abstract = {The claim that oil wealth tends to block democratic transitions has
   recently been challenged by Haber and Menaldo, who use historical data
   going back to 1800 and conclude there is no ``resource curse.{''} We
   revisit their data and models, and show they might be correct for the
   period before the 1970s, but since about 1980, there has been a
   pronounced resource curse. We argue that oil wealth only became a
   hindrance to democratic transitions after the transformative events of
   the 1970s, which enabled developing country governments to capture the
   oil rents that were previously siphoned off by foreign-owned firms. We
   also explain why the Haber-Menaldo study failed to identify this: partly
   because the authors draw invalid inferences from their data and partly
   because they assume that the relationship between oil wealth and
   democracy has not changed for the past 200 years.},

Abstract = {Using data from U.S. presidential elections, we show how seemingly
   insignificant changes to what we call the ``architecture{''} of the
   Electoral College can cause different candidates to be elected
   President, even when no one changes how they vote. We consider varying
   the size of the House of Representatives, the method of apportionment,
   the number of ``Senate{''} electoral votes cast by each state, and the
   lower bound on the number of ``House{''} electoral votes cast by each
   state. We consider, in particular, elections with a ``referendum
   paradox{''}. In these elections, the electoral vote winner is not the
   popular vote winner. Our work extends Neubauer and Zeitlin (2003) who
   analyzed the case of the 2000 election. We give an explanation for the
   effects that we observe in the data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Little is known about the political repercussions of banking crises
   despite the extensive literature on the link between economic
   performance and political outcomes. We develop a theory of how clarity
   of responsibility affects incumbent party survival patterns in 89
   democracies between 1975 and 2005. Our results are robust to modeling
   strategies that include hazard models with shared frailties to account
   for country-specific factors that affect incumbent survival. We find
   that globalization weakens the accountability link between politicians
   and voters. Incumbents in countries with open capital accounts are much
   more likely to survive a banking crisis than incumbents in closed
   economies. We do not find conclusive evidence that divided governments
   or those with multiple veto players enjoy higher survival rates after
   banking crises; in fact, the opposite seems to be true. We conclude with
   a discussion of the paradoxical relationship that openness brings to
   incumbents: greater exposure to foreign shocks and reduced electoral
   punishment for banking crises.},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {The traditional cleavages like social class or religion are often
   reported to have lost explanatory power for the voting decision.
   Regarding the religious cleavage, the evidence is ambiguous depending on
   the choice of cases and indicators used. The present study tests the
   impact of religion for the preference to vote the Christian Democratic
   Party of Switzerland (CVP) using data from the 2007 and 2011 Swiss
   national elections. Additional to the inclusion of individual variables,
   a special focus lies on contextual effects. The estimated hierarchical
   linear models confirm a prevailing influence of the simple individual
   factors and the presence of a significant contextual effect. Statistical
   evidence is also presented for some of the supposed interaction effects
   between individual and contextual religious variables.},

Abstract = {This paper provides an analysis of the most recent changes in Russian
   foreign policy that became a matter of global concern in the aftermath
   of the Ukraine crisis. The author advocates for a discourse-based
   approach to comprehend the new shifts in Russia's international posture.
   First, Russia has launched its own normative policies that incorporate a
   set of conceptual arguments, such as portraying Ukraine and Russia as
   allegedly bound by civilizational ties. Second, Russia is not only
   unilaterally imposing its power; it is also exploiting the opportunities
   for raising its role, which are embedded in the structure of its
   relations with post-Soviet states. Third, Russia's policies are largely
   inconclusive and inconsistent, which is conducive to the dispersal of
   hegemonic discourse and its potential fragmentation.},

Abstract = {The current South American context, defined by the end of conventional
   conflicts, and by the increasing economic interdependence between
   countries, transformed the very foundation of border regions. Frontiers
   have become ``grey areas{''}, or more exactly, ``service areas{''},
   prone to the penetration of phenomena such as organized crime. Women
   trafficking, which takes place in the Triple Frontier shared by
   Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, constitutes a concrete example of the
   nexus that is established between the border community and organized
   crime, in an environment of disinterest as regards borderline
   territories, promoted by Southern Cone's different countries. Vivid
   information concerning the ties that transform the tri-border's
   population in both, victims and victimizers of women trafficking for
   sexual exploitation, in the wake of economic, social and political
   vulnerability, will be presented.},

Volume = {49},

Abstract = {The most recent national Census demonstrated that Australian Muslims
   continue to occupy a socioeconomically disadvantaged position. On key
   indicators of unemployment rate, income, type of occupation and home
   ownership, Muslims consistently under-perform the national average. This
   pattern is evident in the last three Census data (2001, 2006 and 2011).
   Limited access to resources and a sense of marginalisation challenge
   full engagement with society and the natural growth of emotional
   affiliation with Australia. Muslim active citizenship is hampered by
   socioeconomic barriers. At the same time, an increasingly proactive
   class of educated Muslim elite has emerged to claim a voice for Muslims
   in Australia and promote citizenship rights and responsibilities.},

   Afro-Colombian social movement and political perspectives in the context

   organizational forms than own up, emerged in the heat of the process of
   consultation with the State and illuminated by Act 70 of 1993, decrees,

   together to preserve and strengthen African cultural references roots,
   managing the performance of their social rights economic, territorial,

Abstract = {Do judicial dissents affect mass politics? The conventional wisdom is
   that unanimous rulings boost support for Supreme Court decisions, while
   division fuels popular opposition. However, empirical analysis of public
   reaction to unanimity and dissent is sparse, incomplete, and
   inconsistent. Through a series of survey experiments, I expand upon
   existing research on public opinion of judicial unity. I find that
   reaction to judicial consensus is dependent on the ideological salience
   of the issue involved and that, contrary to conventional wisdom and
   recent findings, dissent can foster acceptance of rulings among the
   Court's opponents by suggesting evidence of procedural justice.},

Abstract = {As it has sought to be recognized as a developed nation with equitable
   human rights, the government of Panama has been an active player in
   international discussion of indigenous rights. The indigenous people of
   Panama continue to face serious challenges. Our research examines the
   Ngabe Bugle because they are the largest and most politically active
   indigenous groups in Panama. Almost half of the indigenous people live
   on semiautonomous reservations (comarcas). Although some may hail
   Panama's creation of comarcas as a milestone for indigenous rights,
   norms are only partially effective in this case. The influence of key
   stakeholders can influence how norms are carried out. In Panama, the
   government alternates between attempting to constrain civil society and
   giving in to demands when the protests can no longer be ignored. The
   Panamanian government has shown little respect for indigenous rights in
   its battle over natural resources located on the comarcas; moreover, the
   indigenous do not enjoy the same rights and privileges as those
   Panamanians living outside of the comarcas.},

Title = {Two types of economic voting: How economic conditions jointly affect
   vote choice and turnout},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {34},
Pages = {39-53},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The economic voting literature mostly looks at vote choice, ignoring
   potential effects on turnout. Studies that do focus on the latter often
   ignore the former, and come to contradictory conclusions. I develop a
   model of economic voting that jointly incorporates vote choice and
   abstention due to alienation or indifference. Analyzing ten elections
   with validated turnout data and conducting empirically informed
   simulations, I make two contributions. First, I show that ``turnout
   switching{''} accounts for up to one third of total economic voting.
   This second type of economic voting is more common when the number of
   parties is low and responsibility is dispersed. Second, I show that a
   bad economy moves some people to abstain while having the opposite
   effect on others. The aggregate effect is ambiguous and related to
   macro-conditions in a non-linear way. This explains contradictory
   findings in the literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   legacy is largely maintained by the European welfare state in its
   various continental, liberal and Nordic forms. But how long can the
   welfare state maintain its progressive content outside the social
   democratic era? Through a selection of the contemporary literature on
   the rise and fall of social democracy and the welfare state, this review
   article will argue that social democracy and its welfare state heritage
   are primarily based on the relative strength of the labour movement.
   Without this fundamental constraint on capital the welfare state's
   social democratic content has and will continue to come under threat.
   Due to the centrality of power relations in this analysis of the rise
   and fall of social democracy and the welfare state, the article will
   critique the ways in which the literature has portrayed reform as the
   product of seemingly objective changes within the economy and society
   external to class relations.

Abstract = {In this article I argue that coalitions will tend to employ control
   mechanisms to facilitate the adoption of compromise policies only when
   the expected benefit of their use is high enough. When partners are
   already satisfied with log-rolling policies (compartmentalized by
   jurisdiction), or when compromise is already attainable
   self-enforcingly, there are few incentives to use them. Conversely, when
   partners are interested in compromise policies but are unable to reach
   that outcome in equilibrium, then control mechanisms are likely to be
   implemented. The empirical evidence offered tends to support the two
   main hypotheses of this work: control mechanisms are less necessary when
   the tangentiality of partners' preferences is high and when they foresee
   frequent mutual interactions. However, that seems to work better for the
   allocation of watchdog junior ministers rather than for the writing of
   comprehensive policy agreements.},

Abstract = {Although scholars have long speculated about how organised interests
   link the public to decision makers, there has actually been little
   empirical research on this important element of democratic theory. This
   important gap in the literature is addressed in this article by
   examining, in addition to other supply-side and demand-side factors,
   whether groups mobilise on issues in policy areas that are regarded as
   salient by the public. Based on an analysis of 4,501 contributions in
   142 European Commission online consultations, it is found that organised
   interests potentially can act as a transmission belt between the public
   and decision makers. Although the results vary to some degree by issues,
   higher rates of mobilisation are found on those issues that fall within
   policy areas that are regarded as salient by the general public and
   those with consequences for budgetary spending.},

Abstract = {Political parties seek information about public preferences to determine
   how much they need to change their policies as elections approach. We
   argue that opposition parties can use European parliamentary election
   results to inform themselves about public preferences. When opposition
   parties lose votes at the European level, they can use this information
   to infer that public opinion has shifted away from the party and change
   their national policy strategies. We also argue that not all European
   elections are the same and that parties should be more responsive to
   those European elections that are more informative about public
   preferences. Empirical results from 14 European Union (EU) member
   countries show that opposition parties use European election results and
   change their positions (a) when the turnout levels between national and
   European elections are similar and (b) when the European election is
   close in time to the upcoming national election.},

Abstract = {This article provides a novel answer to explain the persistence of party
   rallies in the mass and social media era. I argue that rallies
   contribute to the organizational structure of clientelistic parties by
   providing information to different members within and outside the
   machine. Rallies provide party leaders with information that enables
   them to monitor brokers' capacity to mobilize voters, party brokers with
   an opportunity to display their ability to turn out voters while
   monitoring voters' responses, and voters with an opportunity to display
   their gratitude or fear towards brokers. In addition, rallies provide
   the opposition with an opportunity to gather information about the
   electoral strength or weakness of the clientelistic party. Drawing on
   participant observations, over a 100 interviews, archival research in
   Argentina and Peru, and secondary literature for the cases of Mexico and
   Brazil, I explain why political parties conduct rallies and why rallies
   will continue in the future.},

Abstract = {Although coming of age under a totalitarian regime drastically reduces
   the chances of acquiring democratic values or supporting democracy,
   factors other than the formal nature of the political regime shape
   political values as well. The informal structure of the political
   regime, which consists of rules developed in political practice and
   economic and human development, may shape individual values and
   attitudes and produce different attitudes towards democracy in different
   totalitarian regimes. This article focuses on the effect of early
   socialization on the support for democracy among citizens who have been
   ruled under two different non-democratic regimes. We compare the
   dynamics in Spain and Romania during the post-totalitarian period with
   the aim of identifying how coming of age operated in these two different
   totalitarian regimes and how each type of non-democratic regime affected
   the legitimacy of the new democratic rule. Using survey data from
   various sources (Standard Eurobarometer, Central and Eastern
   Eurobarometer and Candidate Countries Eurobarometer) that allow both
   longitudinal and cross-sectional comparisons, we decompose the social
   change in support for democracy over the post-totalitarian period in
   both countries using cross-classified fixed effects models. The analyses
   demonstrate the different effects of socialization on support for
   democracy in these two different totalitarian contexts.},

Abstract = {About 330,000 of partial Jews and gentiles have moved to Israel after
   1990 under the Law of Return. The article is based on interviews with
   middle-aged gentile spouses of Jewish immigrants, aiming to capture
   their perspective on integration and citizenship in the new homeland
   where they are ethnic minority. Slavic wives of Jewish men manifested
   greater malleability and adopted new lifestyles more readily than did
   Slavic husbands of Jewish women, particularly in relation to Israeli
   holidays and domestic customs. Most women considered formal conversion
   as a way to symbolically join the Jewish people, while no men pondered
   over this path to full Israeli citizenship. Women's perceptions of the
   IDF and military service of their children were idealistic and
   patriotic, while men's perceptions were more critical and pragmatic. We
   conclude that women have a higher stake at joining the mainstream due to
   their family commitments and matrilineal transmission of Jewishness to
   children. Men's hegemony in the family and in the social hierarchy of
   citizenship attenuates their drive for cultural adaptation and enables
   rather critical stance toward Israeli society. Cultural politics of
   belonging, therefore, reflect the gendered norms of inclusion in the
   nation-state.},

Abstract = {Many countries recently have adopted formal democratic institutions and
   processes, such as the use of regular elections for national political
   offices. Many citizens, suftering from poverty and extreme social
   inequality, nonetheless feel politically excluded and dissatisfied. They
   sometimes turn to collective action and protest to help correct
   perceived injustices, yet protest often is rendered ineffective by the
   long-standing authoritarian habits of politicians, by clientalistic
   arrangements, and by citizens' inexperience with collective action. This
   article draws on Jane Mansbridge and Aldon Morris's differentiation of
   oppositional anger and oppositional consciousness to understand the
   limits to protest in new democracies. Anger, which is necessary for
   triggering collective action, by itself does not foster effective
   popular action. Often a full-fledged oppositional consciousness also is
   needed. This article examines three cases of protest in Argentina to
   illustrate the roles of oppositional anger, minimal oppositional
   consciousness, and full-fledged oppositional consciousness in popular
   politics. The study concludes that, thus far, most groups in Argentina
   that engage in collective action have not manifested a full-fledged
   oppositional consciousness. Protesters, to be effective, need to develop
   a more coherent understanding of the systematic oppression that they
   face, including the persistence of Peronism.},

Abstract = {The Lisbon Treaty grounds the European Union (EU) in the principles of
   political equality and representative democracy. It also acknowledges
   the role national parliaments play in realising these norms within the
   EU's system of governance-the first time they have been mentioned in the
   main body of the Treaty on European Union (TEU)-and introduced the Early
   Warning Mechanism (EWM) as a means for national parliaments (NPs) to be
   involved in EU policy-making. This article analyses the normative and
   empirical connections between political equality and representative
   democracy at the domestic level, and the ways they are embodied in
   parliamentary elections between competing parties. It then assesses how
   far these links continue to operate in the domestic debate of EU affairs
   before undertaking a first evaluation of the use NPs have made of the
   Early Warning Mechanism (EWM). We argue that in many respects they have
   been undermined by the integration process, which has reduced the
   capacity of national representative institutions to perform the tasks
   assigned to them by the Treaty.},

Abstract = {Securing the society is a central task of the state. In the present day,
   as well as in the future, knowledge and information are evermore closely
   tied to electronic data transfer. Finland's newly published Cyber
   Security Strategy depicts how the government safeguards electronic data
   transfer, that is, information security against different threat and
   risk scenarios. Cyberspace has a human element and a technological
   element. It is a way to influence and affect society. It may be used to
   influence minds or to attack the physical world, for example by
   disrupting traffic control. But cyberspace cannot exist without people.
   The cyberspace offers the platform so called strategic communication.
   Strategic communication is a concept that unites the efforts of
   governmental organisations to influence people in support of national
   interests. Formal organisations and institutions are often seen as being
   opposed or resistant to change. Social Media and the cyber domain can
   offer many opportunities but also unknown threats and risks. In this
   paper we argue that securing an organisation is a living and
   continuously changing process. Deleuze and Guattari (1983) present the
   concept of a rhizome, meaning a dynamic weed formation which, opposed to
   the arboreal and hierarchical structure of the tree, involves
   spontaneous, unpredictable and distant connections between heterogeneous
   elements (Linstead \& Thanem 2007, 1484) Strategic Communication is the
   focus of a heated discussion in the military field: How can militaries
   be credible and uphold the high standards of democracy within the
   asymmetric and complex battlefield? To be credible one must act
   according to what is said. The challenge is that the scene is global in
   the information age. The act, the actor, the scene, the purpose - all
   are exposed to a global audience through cyberspace on a very short
   notice. The most effective way of showing the scene and actors is an
   audiovisual product. Examples of this come from all conflict zones.
   Militaries are establishing Youtube channels and supplying material from
   intense fighting and frontline action. The solution for supporting the
   organisation's own arguments has been the Combat Camera capability, in
   other words media-trained soldiers who are where the main effort is
   happening. Within the spirit of strategic communication, the cyber
   strategy itself is one way to operationalise cyber security by
   announcing measures to be taken against cyber attacks. In this article
   the authors reflect on the Finnish Cyber Strategy and Strategic
   Communications from a phenomenological perspective.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the representation and main characteristics of
   comparative politics articles published in the journal Politicka misao.
   Starting from the assumption that the political and academic fields are
   engaged in a process of `reciprocal legitimation', we divided the period
   of analysis into two phases and research subsamples. The first
   encompasses articles published in the period 1964-1989, while the second
   covers articles published in the period 1990-2013. Content analysis
   reveals that during the first phase comparative politics articles were
   weakly represented in the journal. The few articles that belong to the
   field were mostly written from a Marxist perspective, and occasionally
   from the perspective of old normative institutionalism. Overall they
   were methodologically unreflective, descriptive and configurative. The
   most frequent topics were self-managing democracy, communist and
   revolutionary parties, anti-imperial movements and conflicts in Third
   World countries. The time period after 1990 is characterised by a
   strengthening of the field of comparative politics. First of all, there
   is a notable increase in the number of articles dedicated to elections,
   electoral systems, political parties and party systems, legislatures and
   governments, constitutionalism and the judiciary, political culture,
   nationalism, as well as European institutions and processes. Secondly,
   theoretical approaches are more diversified, ranging from new
   institutionalism, behavioralism and pluralism to rational choice theory
   and cultural theory. Though case studies and focused studies with a
   small-N are the most frequent empirical strategies, overall methodology
   remains the weakest element of domestic academic production in
   comparative politics, while explicitly methodological discussions remain
   extremely rare.},

Abstract = {Despite the wide range of studies focused on the causes of terrorism,
   most use the state as the unit of analysis. Doing so, however, overlooks
   important variation that occurs within the state. Our research seeks to
   determine the causes of domestic terrorism through a more refined unit
   of analysis. We do this by using the PRIO-GRID cell structure spatially
   merged with a geocoded version of the GTD dataset. We then perform a
   Getis-Ord Gi{*} hot spot analysis to uncover those local areas most
   prone to domestic terrorism. Our results indicate the following
   attributes increase the likelihood of terrorism: mountainous terrain,
   close proximity to a state capital, large population, high population
   density, and poor economic conditions. When testing between regime
   types, we find that factors such as population, economic conditions, and
   the number of ethnic groups are significant only in democracies, while
   distance to capital is significant only in autocracies.},

Abstract = {This article reflects on social protest, political activism, and state
   violence in twentieth-century Chile, using the well-known but
   little-studied massacre of Plaza Bulnes as a case study. Drawing on the
   concept of gender, I highlight the masculine ethos of protesting workers
   while bringing to light the hidden family networks that sustained social
   and political activism throughout the century. The research is based on
   the press and the previously unexamined Military Court case.},

Abstract = {This paper develops a design-based approach to identifying cohort
   effects in APC analyses. Cohort effects arise when one cohort is treated
   by a unique set of formative socialization experiences, which causes it
   to differ from other cohorts in relevant outcomes. APC analyses
   typically compare treated and untreated cohorts from a single
   population. Our approach introduces a second group-a control group, in
   which no unit is treated but that is otherwise similar to the first-and
   adapts difference-in-differences estimation to the APC framework. The
   approach yields two identification strategies, each based on transparent
   and testable assumptions. We illustrate how the method works and what is
   to be gained through three examples. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {The effects of campaign finance spending bans on electoral outcomes:
   Evidence from the states about the potential impact of Citizens
   United v. FEC},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {33},
Pages = {102-114},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper seeks to understand the effect of campaign finance laws on
   electoral outcomes. Spurred by the recent Supreme Court decision,
   Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010), which eliminated
   bans on corporate and union political spending, the study focuses on
   whether such bans generate electoral outcomes that are notably different
   from an electoral system that lacks such bans. We look to two key
   electoral dynamics that such bans might influence: the partisan balance
   of power and the success of incumbents. Using historical data on
   regulations in 49 American states between 1968 and 2009 we test
   alternative models for evaluating the impact of corporate spending bans
   put in place during this period. The results indicate that spending bans
   appear to have limited effects on election outcomes. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {This article is an attempt to elaborate on recent political and

   current stage of the ``Alevi issue{''} is composed mainly of four
   problem areas: difficulties encountered in the transmission of the

   prayer, debates revolving around compulsory courses on religion in
   secondary education, and discriminations that Alevis experience both in
   everyday life and in the workplace. Outlining the current state of
   public debates in these four problem areas, this article calls for an
   exploration of paths toward pluralistic secularism and democratization
   for all citizens, including the Alevi community.},

Title = {Decentralization as a multifaceted concept: a more encompassing index
   using bayesian statistics},
Journal = {REVISTA ESPANOLA DE CIENCIA POLITICA-RECP},
Year = {2014},
Number = {34},
Pages = {9-34},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Most measures of political decentralization seem to capture only
   specific facets of the concept. In particular, the excessive dependence
   on fiscal indicators has often been criticized since they seem unable to
   assess the degree of autonomy exerted by subnational governments. On the
   other hand, efforts directed at developing more encompassing indexes
   have had to rely on the aggregation of items developed by experts, a
   process that is prone to idiosyncratic errors. In this paper I propose
   the development of a measurement framework using a Bayesian factor
   analysis model for mixed ordinal and continuous outcomes. This model can
   efficiently combine multiple measures of decentralization regardless of
   their level of measurement, and in this way make use of both the rigour
   of fiscal indicators and the wider coverage of qualitative indicators.
   Applying this model to a set of 14 indicators I elaborate a more
   encompassing index of decentralization for 33 OECD countries. In order
   to illustrate the importance of using non-partial measures of
   decentralization, I use this index to replicate parts of De Mello and
   Barenstein (2001) exploratory analysis regarding the relationship
   between decentralization and corruption, showing that such relationship
   is practically non-existent.},

Abstract = {`Multi-disciplinary' field trips to Brussels to accompany undergraduate
   courses on European political and economic integration are of
   exceptional academic value. This article offers ideas on how to plan
   such trips - which people to meet, how to prepare for meetings,
   reflections on the instructor's role - and suggests how to measure study
   trip outcomes. The author argues that study trips are a resource that
   should be more commonly utilised as they are highly beneficial to
   student learning outcomes.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL THOUGHT},

Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {64-94},

Abstract = {The American Revolution did away with monarchical authority but
   preserved kingly pardoning power. Its chief federal architect, Alexander
   Hamilton, developed his thinking on the ``true character of the
   executive{''} in New York State, which more than any other both inspired
   and followed federal political thought on the place of executive
   clemency in a republican democracy. By focusing on a controversial 1847
   pardon, whereby the governor released 18 felons serving sentences for
   acts of anti-rent violence, this article examines the ambivalent embrace
   of kingly power in mid-nineteenth-century constitutional thought. The
   governor's decision conveyed the taint of politics. However, it also
   resonated with the tenor of debate in antebellum America over executive
   discretion's constitutionality. Despite growing criticism of the
   ``one-man{''} power to pardon, its capacity to deliver justice within
   the bounds of constitutionally authorized executive discretion staved
   off calls for administrative reform, lessons that resurface on the
   contemporary political landscape.},

Abstract = {How do mass citizens understand democracy? Are they capable of
   distinguishing it from its non-democratic alternatives? Does their
   understanding about democracy matter? To reveal the contours of cultural
   democratization in South Korea, this article addresses these questions
   largely overlooked in earlier survey-based studies. Analyses of the 2010
   Korea Barometer survey indicate that all segments of the Korean
   electorate, including the young and the college-educated, are neither
   accurately nor fully informed about what distinguishes a democratic
   regime from its non-democratic alternatives. Moreover, the study
   provides strong evidence of democratic learning in that an increase in
   democratic knowledge leads to committed support for democracy. The
   findings together imply an urgent need to improve the quality of civic
   education for the development of democratic political culture in Korea
   and new democracies.},

Abstract = {Russia was not ready for a great war. The war led to the rise of
   nationalism in the multi-ethnic empire. It put an end to autocracy's
   pragmatic nationalities policy and unleashed an orgy of violence on a
   grand scale. The war plunged the tsarist empire into chaos and anarchy,
   uprooted millions of people, and marked the dawn of ethnic cleansing.
   The refugee became the emissary of the new age. The Great War had begun
   in 1914. It came to an end only in 1924. Everything that had been
   painstakingly built over three centuries collapsed within a few years.
   Russia was the birthplace of the totalitarian temptation, which sought
   to impose order on anything that refused to be subjugated. To this
   extent, the Eastern Front was no peripheral theatre of operations in the
   great European war.},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {The 2011 Local Government elections in the Nelson Mandela Bay
   Municipality (NMBM) represented the beginning of a potentially
   significant shift in the political landscape of South Africa. The
   Democratic Alliance increased its vote total from the 2006 Local
   Government Elections by 14.8\% to 40.2\% and won 10 single member ward
   districts previously held by the African National Congress (ANC). The
   ANC held on to its majority position but gained only 51.9\% of the votes
   and 63 of the 120 councillor positions in the NMBM. Understanding the
   patterns of vote shift is crucial to understanding whether or not the
   2011 Local Government Elections portends the permanent decline of the
   ANC as a dominant electoral force in the NMBM. Additionally, to what
   extent the decline in an ANC-stronghold signals a possible decline
   nationally for the 2014 General Elections emerges as a crucial question
   for the future of South African electoral politics.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {161-184},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {A growing body of subnational comparative research on democracy has
   focused attention on subnational authoritarianism', in tandem with
   increasing interest in local politics across the developing world.
   Unsurprisingly, this evolving field of study has been characterized by a
   diversity - if not a dichotomy - of approaches, with quantitative and
   qualitative research proceeding along parallel and sometimes
   intersecting tracks. But scholars working in diverse contexts and with
   diverging approaches have begun to converge on a set of explanations for
   the patterns of variance observed in subnational authoritarianism within
   and across national settings. Drawing on studies of Russia, the United
   States, southern Italy, Argentina and West Africa, this article shows
   how scholarship has identified the underlying economic foundations of
   subnational authoritarianism. Combining the findings of recent
   qualitative and quantitative studies with the author's own research in
   the Philippines, this article spells out a set of hypotheses which may
   help to explain patterns of variance in subnational authoritarianism.
   Variance in subnational authoritarianism, it is suggested, stems from
   varying local economic conditions and possibilities for accumulation and
   maintenance of control over local economies. Further mapping' of
   subnational authoritarianism thus requires local fieldwork to complement
   the strengths - and overcome the limitations - of quantitative research.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1},
Pages = {40-53},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {This article argues that the standard model of political representation
   mischaracterises the structure of representation. After surveying the
   classical types of representation and their application to non-humans,
   the basic nature of representation is shown to have been unduly centred
   on interests, responsiveness and unidirectional protocols. It proposes a
   different structure by drawing inspiration from recent scholarship and
   developments in political philosophy, as well as the representation of
   non-human actors. It proposes an ontological grounding of representation
   in irreducible multiplicity', and a structural analysis based on the
   concepts of claim and relation. This abstract form of representation can
   take into account both human and non-human cases, and works to ground
   different typologies. The relational structure of representation creates
   interests and preferences, subjects and actors, power dynamics and
   seemingly immutable
   identities.????,???????????????????????????????????????????,????????,???

Abstract = {The article covers the specific features an main ideas of the
   constructivist attitude to international relations studies. The article
   consists of two parts. In the first part the ontology, epistemology and
   main principles of constructivism is explained. In the second part, the
   author's attention is directed towards the key concepts of the
   international relations theory (anarchical structure of the
   international system, power, national interest, identity, war and peace,
   etc.). The author's conclusion is the following: principally
   constructivism managed ``to build a ``bridge{''} between neorealism and
   liberal instututionalism. The latest versions of constructivism have a
   propensity either for neorealism (realist constructivism), or for
   liberalism (liberal constructivism).},

Title = {Between literature and political practice. An approach to the Venezuela
   of Romulo Gallegos},
Journal = {CIENCIA POLITICA},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {17},
Pages = {129-151},
Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {The trajectory of Romulo Gallegos, as reflected in his literary works as
   well as in his intellectual and political role, is a pertinent starting
   point for the analysis of the author's thought during the period of the
   consolidation of the modern Venezuelan Nation-State model. In relation
   to the general aim of this work, the main idea is to determine the
   interaction between Romulo Gallegos' literary production and the
   Nation-State building process, taking into account the social, cultural
   and political conditions of Venezuela and the latinoamerican context of
   the 20th century. In reference to the specific objectives, the idea is
   in the first place to identify the intellectual role of Gallegos and
   especially the impact of his work in the first half of the 20th century,
   and secondly to analyze the writer's political concerns and the ways in
   which these condition and contribute to the content of his literary
   narrative.
   Concerning the methodology, this research has been conducted in
   qualitative terms due to the character of the problem and the objectives
   put forward. The sources obtained as well as the general bibliography
   have been examined thoroughly, and have been gathered and organized
   according to the logic of the proposed objectives.
   The conclusions we draw after having examined the sources and the
   bibliography, show that the attempt to reconfigure the foundational
   narrative of Venezuela by way of literary fiction on the one hand, and
   the aim of consolidating a renewed political project on the other,
   though they had a wide editorial broadcasting did not materialize in any
   political practice because a coup d' etat that moved Gallegos away early
   from the executive power, re-established in Venezuela a traditional
   republican vision and an elitist, authoritarian government.},

   Democracy, the State, Civil Society, and a ``Politics of Presence{''}},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the gap between globally promoted definitions of
   liberal democracy and the different ways in which the concept is
   interpreted by individual politicians and civil society representatives
   in Cambodia. By taking as our point of departure the gap between
   ``hegemonic{''} views of democracy and locally lived democracy
   experiences and strategies, we argue that one of the basic concepts of
   liberal democracy-the concept of the ``politics of ideas{''}-does not
   easily match local facets of democracy. Followers of liberal democracy
   give priority to the representation of ideas and ideologies over the
   question of who represents them. This priority, however, seems to
   correspond poorly to the situation in present-day Cambodia. Based on
   extensive field material, the article demonstrates how Cambodian
   interpretations of the Western understanding of ``liberal democracy{''}
   try to bridge the gap between the praxis of the ``politics of ideas{''}
   and the ``politics of presence.{''}},

Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-78},
Abstract = {Protests from different social movements sometimes coincide, but does
   that mean that one movement is influencing the other and increasing its
   ``action mobilization,{''} or are different sets of factors causing the
   coincident protests? This paper examines that question in reference to
   two sets of coincident protests: those of people with disabilities and
   those of the pro-Democracy protests of 2011. It shows that, although
   disability protests did not start at the same time as the pro-Democracy
   protests, a number happened during and after, and in close physical
   proximity to, those protests. Neither set of protests acknowledged or
   referred to the other. While it is likely that a new law in Egypt and
   the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities were among
   the mobilizing factors for people with disabilities, it also appears
   that the language of ``rights{''} began to diffuse from the
   pro-Democracy protests to the disability protests.},

Abstract = {When do incumbent parties that expect to win elections under
   majoritarian electoral rules adopt more proportional electoral systems
   and forgo seat-maximization? Electoral system reforms from two different
   political contexts, late 19th-century Belgium and post-communist
   Bulgaria disrupt predictions that PR is adopted by parties facing
   electoral defeat or high uncertainty. I argue that dominant party status
   and the extra-institutional tactics of the opposition can cause
   incumbents to eschew seat-maximization. When a powerful ruling party is
   more concerned about the stability of the regime than about victory in
   the upcoming election, it can accept a tactical loss of legislative
   seats in exchange for gains in the arena of regime transition.},

Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {193-210},
Abstract = {The paper examines how questions of power are addressed in neoliberal
   thought. The thesis underlying this endeavor is the following: all
   varieties of neoliberal thought harbor a blind spot regarding various
   forms of power. This means that certain power effects are overlooked or
   systematically brushed aside by definitional fiat. The paper aims to
   validate this thesis by discussing two leading proponents of neoliberal
   thought whose respective approaches to the issue of power can be
   considered representative of neoliberal theory in general: Friedrich
   August von Hayek and Walter Eucken. While Hayek attempts to marginalize
   certain forms of economic power through a strict focus on a narrow
   understanding of coercion, Eucken confronts the issue of market power
   directly. Still, he in turn remains oblivious not only to the power
   effects of his own `scientific' discourse but also the subjectivating
   power of markets to mold `entrepreneurial subjects'.},

Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {27},
Number = {105},
Pages = {213+},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the use and the impact of the ``call for
   proposals{''} policy tool at the French local government level. This
   increasingly implemented device is an integral part of the incentive
   policy designs based on the subsidiarity principle. A case study of a
   call for proposals that was established by a Regional Council in the
   cultural heritage field was carried out. It focused on the application
   process of four candidates - four local authorities - at a
   micro-sociological level. The findings of this analysis highlight
   discrete self-discipline trends, which are masked by appearances of
   choice. Three dynamics can be identified: (1) the urgency in which the
   candidacy took place; (2) the anticipation strategies used to identify
   and write the ``right{''} project; (3) the effects of this operation
   perceivable through the attitudes of the local government agents. They
   have therefore led the agents to learn how to deal with the criteria of
   the call for proposals, by producing themselves their own points of
   reference in a situation of uncertainty.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {253-272},
Abstract = {American government textbooks signal to students the kinds of topics
   that are important and, by omission, the kinds of topics that are not
   important to the discipline of political science. This article examines
   portrayals of women in introductory American politics textbooks through
   a quantitative content analysis of 22 widely used texts. We find that
   textbook coverage of women is scarce, tends to disregard important
   sources of diversity among women, reinforces traditional gender roles,
   and gives scant attention to women as political actors. Typical
   presentations of women thus reinforce women's status as political
   outsiders, mirroring their marginalization in American political life.
   We argue this content depresses interest in the academic study of
   political science and engagement with American political life more
   generally. However, we find that textbooks with one or more female
   author have significantly more gender- related content. Female political
   scientists better integrate gender into their textbooks and, thus, may
   be more likely to engage female students, who are underrepresented in
   the political science major.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {95-118},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Scholars have recently argued that Friedrich Schiller makes a signal
   contribution to republican political theory in his view of ``aesthetic
   education,'' which offers a means of elevating self-interest to virtue.
   However, though this education is lauded in theory, it has been
   denigrated as implausible, irresponsible, or dangerous in practice. This
   paper argues that the criticisms rest on a faulty assumption that
   artistic objects constitute the sole substance of this ``aesthetic
   education.'' Through a reading of Schiller's work throughout the 1790s,
   I make the case that this ``education'' occurs also through an encounter
   with the ``moral beauty'' of individual exemplars. This interpretation
   fits with Schiller's republican allegiances, saves Schiller's project
   from political irrelevance, and enriches Schiller's contribution to
   contemporary republican political theory. However, I argue that Schiller
   was attentive to the dangers of this ``aesthetic education'' in his play
   Wallenstein, in which Schiller dramatizes the tragic relationship
   between individual exemplar and political order.},

Title = {Mainstreaming adaptation to climate change in a federal state setting:
   Policy changes in flood protection and tourism promotion in Austria?},
Journal = {OSTERREICHISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR POLITIKWISSENSCHAFT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-47},
Abstract = {Since it became clear that mitigation efforts will not suffice to halt
   climate change, governments have complemented them with adaptation
   efforts. While adaptation to climate change in unitary states is mainly
   concerned with mainstreaming or integrating respective goals and
   measures horizontally into a variety of sectors, federal states such as
   Austria or Germany add a vertical dimension to the challenge: here more
   than anywhere else, climate change adaptation also requires coordination
   between federal and provincial governments. While the literature on
   environmental federalism suggests that federal states are ill-equipped
   to protect global public goods but have advantages in solving local
   environmental problems, it is unclear how helpful federalism is in
   addressing local impacts of a global problem. We address this gap by
   exploring to what extent two sectors highly vulnerable to climate change
   but rarely subject to policy analyses flood protection and tourism
   embrace adaptation at and across federal, provincial and local levels of
   government in Austria. With regard to horizontal mainstreaming, the
   paper shows that both sectors struggle with adaptation issues in their
   own ways. With regard to vertical mainstreaming, it reveals strong
   coordination and support functions of the provinces (in particular in
   flood protection). Since municipalities are often overwhelmed by the
   complexities of climate change, we conclude that federal systems could
   prove helpful in mediating between national guidance and local adaption
   measures.},

Abstract = {In the mid-1980s the National Action Committee on the Status of Women
   (NAC) was considered the main ``face{''} of the Canadian women's
   movement and a major player in Canadian politics. However, by the end of
   the decade, NAC began losing crucial federal funding and suffered
   internal divisions amongst member groups. By the 2000s, NAC slowly
   became a less relevant feminist political advocate and has since
   completely disappeared from Canadian politics. This paper explains the
   decline and disappearance of NAC from the 1980s to the present day to
   help understand the state of the nationallevel women's movement in
   Canada. Drawing largely on the political opportunity structure approach
   and a neo-institutional focus on changes in federalism and the rise of
   neoliberal ideas in Canada, the paper argues with NAC gone,
   opportunities for the emergence of a new national voice for Canadian
   women are limited at best. Even though this does not in and of itself
   signify an end to organized feminism in the country, it does not bode
   well for the health of the national-level women's movement.},

Abstract = {In April 2013, a controversy arose when a working paper (Herndon, Ash,
   and Pollin 2013) claimed to show serious errors in a highly cited and
   influential economics paper by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff
   (2010). The Reinhart and Rogoff paper had come to serve as authoritative
   evidence in elite conversations (Krugman 2013) that high levels of debt,
   especially above the ``90 percent {[}debt/GDP] threshold{''} (Reinhart
   and Rogoff 2010, 577), posed a risk to economic growth. Much of the
   coverage of this controversy focused on an error that was a ``perfect
   made-for-TV mistake{''} (Stevenson and Wolfers 2013) involving a simple
   error in the formula used in their Excel calculations. The real story
   here, however, is that it took three years for this error and other
   issues to be discovered because replication files were not publicly
   available, nor were they provided to scholars when asked. If
   professional norms or the American Economic Review had required that
   authors publish replication files, this debate would be advanced by
   three years and discussions about austerity policies would have been
   based on a more clear-sighted appraisal of the evidence.},

Abstract = {This study uses multiwave panel data from the 2008 presidential election
   to investigate the impact of partisan news exposure on changes in vote
   preferences over time. Overcoming key limitations of prior research, the
   analysis distinguishes among the potential effects originally delineated
   by Lazarsfeld and colleagues (): (1) activationmotivating partisans who
   initially say they are undecided or planning to defect to shift their
   vote back to their own party's candidate; (2) conversionmotivating
   partisans to shift their vote to the opposing party's candidate; and (3)
   reinforcementstrengthening partisans' preference for their initial vote
   choice. The results reveal only modest evidence that partisan news
   reinforces existing vote preferences. Surprisingly, partisan news plays
   a more robust role motivating changes in vote choice: news slanted
   toward citizens' own partisanship increased the odds of activation and
   decreased the odds of conversion, while news slanted away from citizens'
   own partisanship proved a strong counterforce working in the opposite
   direction.},

Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {195-211},
Abstract = {Some theorists argue that appropriate responses to terrorism are in part
   shaped by popular sentiment. In two experiments, using representative
   design and ecological stimuli (e.g. actual news reports), we present
   evidence for some of the ways popular sentiment about terrorism tracks
   theory and can be constructed. In Experiment 1, we document that using
   the word `terrorist' to describe a group of people decreases willingness
   to understand the group's grievances, decreases willingness to negotiate
   with the group, increases perceived permissibility of violence against
   the group, and decreases the perceived rationality of the group. In
   Experiment 2, we demonstrate that judgment about the permissibility of
   the use of force against terrorist groups can be biased by simple
   memory-priming manipulations. Results are interpreted in terms of (1)
   implications for philosophical theories about terrorism and (2) the role
   that experimental investigation can play in applied ethics.},

Abstract = {This article investigates whether and how gender shapes access to elite
   political networks, using the case of Argentina, the first country in
   the world to adopt a national-level quota law in 1991. Quotas have
   significantly improved women's access to elected office, without
   altering either the gendered hierarchies or gendered power networks that
   govern political advancement. We find that while men and women elected
   to the national congress have considerable political experience, men are
   more likely to have held executive office, particularly posts that
   provide access to resources that sustain clientelism. We further find
   that female legislators are less likely to be married and have children
   than male legislators, indicating that women's domestic responsibilities
   circumscribe their political careers.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats
   negotiated and agreed the Coalitions approach to the EU with a view to
   shed light on how each party exerted influence over this policy area.
   For that purpose the article analyses how the two parties of the
   Coalition negotiated the programme of government, agreed on the
   distribution of government portfolios and have handled three of most
   divisive European issues faced by the Coalition, namely the European
   Union Act 2011, the exercise of the veto at the December 2011 EU summit
   and the announcement of the referendum on EU membership. The article
   argues that the Conservatives are the drivers of the Coalitions approach
   to the EU however the Liberal Democrats have acted as navigators
   ensuring, most of the time, that the agreed roadmap is respected.},

Abstract = {In the 50s and 60s of the last century, Real Madrid Club of Football
   became the sportive herald of ``Spanish miracle{''}, generating in Spain
   and abroad a wave of admiration that was promptly capitalized by the
   Franco regime. During the Francoism, the club became one of the most
   effective disseminators of ``banal nationalism{''} that the dictatorship
   would inculcate in the population, especially the emigrants abroad. This
   image of Real Madrid as an internationally successful sport entity
   allows us to reflect on the relationships that are established between
   sport and political power, especially in the elusive theme of national

Abstract = {This article focuses on the situation of migrants and their descendants
   in European labour markets. This important socioeconomic dimension of
   the current crisis illuminates the role of pre-existing policies and
   institutions and points the way to political solutions. The article
   begins with a comparative puzzle: how can one account for
   cross-national, cross-local, and cross-sectoral variation in the labour
   market outcomes of migrant-origin minority groups and explain
   migrant-origin and gender differences. This is followed by a critical
   examination of debates on the `integration' of migrants and the `second
   generation' reflecting political diatribes on the across-the-board poor
   performance of minorities and the role of ethnic or religious factors.
   An alternative explanation underscores the importance of policy
   paradigms and institutional hurdles focusing on three aspects of
   European political economies: welfare state arrangements, education, and
   sub-national labour market policies. The arguments put forth rely on
   comparative aggregate data and surveys in countries representative of
   ideal types according to the original version of the varieties of
   capitalism, worlds of welfare, and integration models literature, in
   particular France, Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands.},

Abstract = {The manner in which mass loyalty in socialist and other
   post-totalitarian societies is maintained is still a matter of
   discussion. To contribute to the debate this article studies strategies
   of discontent in late Czech socialism as described in 60 oral history
   narratives of three groups of narrators (communist functionaries,
   dissidents and ordinary people). Drawing on a modified version of
   Hirsch's exit-voice-loyalty model, the study reveals an important
   characteristic of the expression of discontent in this post-totalitarian
   society-the strategic distinction between political and non-political
   behaviour. Labelling discontent as either a political or non-political
   matter was a key trait of power plays.},

Abstract = {Explanations of Americans' attitudes toward immigration emphasize
   threats to national identity and culture. However, we do not know the
   specific sources of cultural threat or whether they operate locally.
   Native-born residents commonly voice concerns about the prevalence of
   Spanish, suggesting that foreign languages might be one such source of
   threat. This article uses survey experiments to provide one of the first
   causal tests of the impact of written Spanish on Americans' immigration
   attitudes. One experiment (N = 351) was conducted online with a
   nationally representative sample, while a second was embedded in an exit
   poll (N = 902). The experiments show that Spanish has differential
   impacts depending on Americans' prior contact with it. Among those who
   hear Spanish frequently in day-to-day life, seeing written Spanish
   induces anti-immigration attitudes. These findings suggest that language
   can foster cultural threat, and they highlight a mechanism through which
   local encounters can be threatening.},

Abstract = {The question of eligibility for international sporting representation
   (ISR) has become increasingly contentious. In this paper we argue that
   the current ISR regulations are outdated and problematic. Sporting
   governing bodies ought to ignore citizenship as a criterion for ISR, and
   instead ISR should be based on a normative account of national belonging
   which would operate primarily on grounds of early socialisation and
   long-term residency. This approach would avoid many of the pragmatic and
   moral pathologies of ISR, and would utilise sports potential in
   promoting a liberal and progressive understanding of national ties.},

Abstract = {This article surveys marriage immigration from the Philippines to South
   Korea, the public policies of both governments, and ongoing
   developments, challenges, and their implications for future policy.
   Policies in both countries provide the context in which international
   marriages occur and impact the sociocultural, political, economic life
   of marriage immigrants and their ``multicultural families.{''}Philippine
   policies are still generally limited to a ban on commercial brokerage
   and provision of predeparture orientation programs for migrant brides.
   The Korean government has adopted policies to support these groups and
   to transform South Korea into a ``more mature, multicultural
   society,{''}but the results have so far been mixed. Sociodemographic,
   economic, and political trends suggest that marriage immigration will
   persist with the following implications: continued emphasis onrights and
   welfare in future policies; more stringent regulation of marriage
   agencies; an increasingly important role for marriage immigrants in
   policymaking and implementation; and the necessity of policy adjustments
   and international cooperation among stakeholders.},

Abstract = {Structure of electoral cleavages is an important indicator of the
   socio-political state of society. However, studying this topic at the
   level of a country at large is fraught with serious mistakes: if
   elections are fair in some places and merely imitative in others, the
   overall picture may be akin to the average temperature in the hospital.
   To solve this problem, Yu.Korgunyuk turns to the analysis of data at the
   level of territorial electoral commissions employing his own
   methodology. His research results in a type of regional map of electoral
   cleavages that allows to understand in which regions of the Russian
   Federation electoral life is still lingering on, and in which its demise
   has become irreversible.},

Abstract = {Does economic inequality influence citizens' support for democracy?
   Political economy theory suggests that in a country with high
   inequality, the majority of the population will support democracy as a
   potential mechanism for redistribution. Much of the survey and
   area-studies literature, by contrast, suggests that inequality generates
   political disillusion and regime dissatisfaction. To clarify this
   disagreement, we distinguish between prospective versus retrospective
   evaluations as well as between egocentric versus sociotropic
   evaluations. We test the resulting hypotheses in a multilevel analysis
   conducted in 40 democracies. We find that citizens are retrospective and
   sociotropic, meaning that higher levels of economic inequality reduce
   support for democracy amongst all social classes. We also find a small
   prospective egocentric effect, in that the reduction in democratic
   support in highly unequal countries is slightly less severe amongst the
   poor, suggesting they believe that democracy might increase future
   redistribution.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},

Volume = {19},

Pages = {15-40},
Abstract = {The financial crisis of 2007-2008 severely disrupted the hegemony of
   neoliberalism. This article argues that since the establishment of the
   Coalition Government in 2010, a trend has become discernible within
   public opinion towards a new consensus on the size of the state, the
   role of markets and the function of civil society. This consensus
   constitutes a distinctive British centrist ideology, termed New
   Centrism. The article examines the methodological and ideological
   backdrop to New Centrism, considering the particular features of British
   party competition, rival critiques of the crisis and an ontology of the
   old neoliberal settlement. The article also assesses consensus in
   contemporary British politics and situates the rebirth of centrism in
   Britain in a comparison with the ideological heritage of centrism in
   European polities, drawing out a substantive characterization of the New
   Centrist ideological position as Britain's direct equivalent.},

Abstract = {Based on a comparative study carried out in France and Germany, this
   article explores the mobilisations of ``victims of racism{''}. It shows
   how in the last two decades the lived experience of racism has became a
   pathway for asserting claims in antiracist struggles. ``Lived
   experience{''} is expressed through ethnoracial identifications, which
   converts racialised bodies into a political ressource. This comparative
   study between France and Germany shines light upon nationally
   contextualised processes which aim to introduce racialised points of
   view in the field of the national antiracist struggle.},

Abstract = {This study addresses the changing strategies of social inclusion, which
   the Hungarian elites in Romania pursued after WWII. The establishment of
   communist rule in Romania involved the members of the Hungarian ethnic
   minority in very different ways. As early as 1946, inner tensions and
   debates occurred inside this community, while groups from its elite
   organized manifestations of resistance against the new rulers. After
   1947, the communist leadership of Romania dramatically changed its
   policies with regard to the ethnic Hungarians, and this caused a great
   disillusion to those who believed that the collective rights of
   minorities would be guaranteed in the new political framework. The
   events of 1956 reshaped the way the cultural elites of that ethnic group
   related to the communist regime. Later, the manifest nationalistic
   propaganda of late communism in Romania generated political dissent
   among the members of a new generation of Hungarian intellectuals. It is
   in that period that the post-1989 political strategies of this community
   originate. When the cultural elite of the Hungarian minority had to
   assume the role of building a representative political structure in the
   transition to democracy, its representatives continued to a great extent
   to act like in late communism.},

Title = {How racial cues affect support for American racial hierarchy among
   African Americans and Whites},
Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3},
Pages = {350-367},
Abstract = {Though racial hierarchy has been critical to American political
   development and continues to color much of American politics, little is
   known about the extent to which political factors mitigate or exacerbate
   support for the racial status quo. Using insights gained from research
   on system justification and racial priming, this paper examines how the
   use of negative racial cues by political elites affects support for
   American racial hierarchy among African Americans and Whites, where
   racial hierarchy is assessed both explicitly (with survey items) and
   implicitly (with the Implicit Association Test). Results from two
   original experiments suggest that the effect of elite racial cues on
   support for racial hierarchy is moderated by political ideology, and the
   strength and direction of the effects varies by racial group and the
   type of support for racial hierarchy - explicit or implicit - being
   examined.},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {79-96},
Abstract = {This article engages with the suicide bomber as he or she appears in the
   terrorism studies literature. In contrast to sensationalised narratives
   of the suicide bomber as pathological or fanatical, terrorism studies
   has increasingly come to view suicide bombing as a rational phenomenon
   that follows an identifiable strategic logic. Following Foucault's
   articulation of governmentality, I read this literature as a
   governmental practice that attempts to understand the latent rationality
   of suicide bombing so that the phenomenon may be effectively governed
   and managed. With this understanding, I look specifically at the
   terrorism studies accounts of female suicide bombers and argue that the
   concerns they articulate regarding the superior capacity of these women
   to go undetected, such as with the use of fake pregnancies as disguises,
   produces the female suicide bomber as a uniquely risky and ungovernable
   subject.},

   expression of anger, contempt, and disgust by leaders of ideologically
   motivated groups when talking about their archrival opponent outgroups
   is associated with subsequent political aggression. That study was
   limited in two ways, first because it only analyzed emotions expressed
   in text, and second because it analyzed only text excerpts that directly
   mentioned the outgroups. In this study, we remedied both limitations by
   analyzing emotions nonverbally expressed by leaders in videos, and by
   comparing both outgroup and non-outgroup mentions. Leaders of groups
   that eventually committed acts of aggression expressed significantly
   more anger, contempt, and disgust when talking about their archrival
   opponent outgroups than when not talking, whereas there was no such
   difference for acts of resistance. These findings reinforced the
   potentially important role of anger, contempt, and disgust in the
   escalation to political aggression.},

Title = {Post-Disaster Housing Recovery: The Promise and Peril of Social Capital},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Pages = {119-143},
Abstract = {Researchers argue that social networks based on shared values, trust,
   and norms can facilitate collective action, and such social capital
   increases the ability of communities to recover after a disaster,
   implying that the presence of social capital ensures collective
   community action after a disaster and enables recovery. Drawing from
   comparative case studies of Bhuj and Bachhau, urban centres impacted by
   the 2001 Gujarat earthquake in India, this study presents a nuanced view
   of the role of social capital during post-disaster recovery. It argues
   that it is important to consider community contexts that are inherent to
   the amount of social capital available and the use of resources through
   social networks. The study demonstrates that strong internal bonds based
   on mutual trust did not necessarily lead to collective action for
   post-disaster housing recovery among communities in Bhuj and Bachhau.
   Moreover, the amount of social capital available through bonding
   networks differed among communities, depending upon their pre-disaster
   networks and the resources embedded in them. The study findings expand
   upon the role of social capital during disaster recovery; in particular,
   they contribute to public policy debates on the ability of communities
   to engage in collective action to meet post-disaster housing needs.},

Abstract = {The Belfast Agreement created an entirely new framework for the
   protection of human rights in Northern Ireland, the centrepiece of which
   was the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC). From the
   outset, human rights activists in Northern Ireland invested much hope in
   the ability of the NIHRC to help deliver a new rights-based approach to
   governance in Northern Ireland. However, since its inception, unionists
   in Northern Ireland have had a difficult relationship with this
   organisation, and the purpose of this article is to explore in greater
   depth the relationship between unionists and the NIHRC in the period
   between 1999 and 2005 during Professor Brice Dickson's tenure as Chief
   Commissioner. First, it considers the context, powers and remit of the
   NIHRC, before moving on to explore and analyse the relationship between
   influential strands of unionist opinion and the NIHRC 1999-2005,
   identifying what the key issues were for unionists during this period.},

Abstract = {The Court of Justice of the European Union acts as a constitutional
   jurisdiction reviewing European legislative acts. However, the
   competence of the Courtto declare the partial or total invalidity of
   such acts has not been defined in the Treaties, unlike it happens in the
   legal systems of the Member States relating to their constitutional
   courts, and that competence has been unsatisfactorily defined in the
   Court of Justice jurisprudence on that subject. Therefore, in this
   article it is proposed a reformulation of that jurisprudence, defining
   specific criteria for partial annulment of legislative acts, taking into
   account the intention of the legislature to establish the severability
   or non-severability of the acts, and excluding the understanding of the
   inseverability of a legislative act provision as a dismissing action's
   cause.},

Abstract = {This article makes the case for a novel democratic subtype, populist
   democracy, indicating a situation in which both the party in office and
   at least the major opposition force(s) in a pluralist system are
   populist. Based on a minimal definition of populism as `democratic
   illiberalism', and through the comparative analysis of
   post-authoritarian Greece and post-communist Hungary, the article
   reveals the particular stages, as well as the causal mechanisms, that
   may prompt the emergence of populist democracy in contemporary politics.
   It also points to the tendency of such systems to produce polarized
   two-party systems, and it calls for further research on the topic.},

Abstract = {Among the unique meanings and images which form the Vyborg space by the
   citizens one can distinguish at least the images - an European town, a
   multicultural town and a town with the special exclusiveness, moreover
   so, they coexist successfully. In other words, although local identity
   prevails in Vyborg, its space is unique because there are several types
   of identity. Over the recent decades the space has been re-interpreted:
   defense functions of the town (or solely of the fortress town) have
   evolved into connecting, contact, which is demonstrated by the fact that
   Vyborg represents a borderzone between cultures, traditions and values.},

Abstract = {The Parliamentary debates on the clause which became section 31 of the
   Growth and Enterprise Act 2013 (allowing employees to agree to sign away
   employment rights for shares in the employing company) show that
   scrutiny by the House of Commons is very poor, and that scrutiny by the
   House of Lords is intense and very well-informed. If the Government
   loses the argument on a Bill in the House of Lords, it will lose the
   vote. However, during Parliamentary ping-pong (the back-and-forth
   process of amendment of a Bill between the two Houses) the Commons, and
   the Government, will normally get their way, however weak the policy
   proposal, provided that concessions on detail are made, unless the issue
   is regarded by the Lords as one of fundamental principle.},

   determine ASEAN's survival and success. Moreover, it insists that ASEAN
   is literally subject to structural powers, derived from material and
   resource capacity, in which leadership is highly attached to a leader's
   charisma. Finally, the paper proposes that the benevolent roles of
   Indonesia with strong emphasis on soft power are a key element of
   success.},

Title = {Europe as a Beacon of Democracy? Citizenship Policies Relating to Youth
   and Migrants in Portugal},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},

Volume = {10},

Pages = {51-68},
Abstract = {This article aims to compare discourses about national and European
   policies on active citizenship and democratic participation, with a
   particular focus on youth and migrants. For this purpose we analysed
   official documents of public institutions and nongovernmental
   organizations (NGOs) in order to assess how the process of
   Europeanization has influenced national policies with regard to
   increasing political participation and citizens' civic awareness.
   Additionally, we conducted interviews with policy makers and NGO leaders
   in order to integrate and compare different levels of discourse and thus
   identify potential dissonances. Analysis of the documents shows that
   there is a strong concern to match national policy priorities with those
   established by international organizations. Notwithstanding positive
   perceptions, NGO leaders and policy makers criticize the ways policies
   have been implemented, stressing the need to adopt a strategy that
   bridges the gap between the prescribed and the real, as well as the
   importance of overcoming the hegemony of economic factors in policy
   decisions. In this regard, NGO leaders criticize the cynicism of
   political leaders and policies motivated by demographic and economic
   concerns. In relation to European identity and integration, NGO leaders
   argue that Europe must be collectively constructed; yet, policy makers
   stress that the failure of the Constitutional Treaty in 2005 resulted
   from a deficit in the negotiation process. In sum, this article suggests
   that it is necessary to promote greater involvement of civil society in
   the design and implementation of policies which, in turn, may contribute
   to the strengthening of shared democratic principles.},

Abstract = {The development of cultural policy analysis by social science has been
   produced a theorization about cultural policy models from sociology and
   political science. This analysis shows the influence of the national
   model of cultural policy on the forms of governance and management of
   cultural facilities. However, in this paper we will defend that
   currently the local model of cultural policy decisively influences the
   model of cultural institutions. This is explained by the growing
   importance of culture in local development strategies. In order to
   demonstrate this we will analyze the case of the Barcelona Model of
   local development and cultural policy, that is characterized for the
   level of local government leadership, multilevel governance, the use of
   culture in urban planning processes and a tendency to use public-private
   partnership in public management. This Model influences the genesis and
   development of the cultural facilities and it produces a singular and
   relatively successful model},

Abstract = {The 18th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) brought several
   changes at the top leadership. A fifth generation of rulers rose to
   power and the new Central Committee underwent a profound reshuffle of
   relations between its internal factions. This paper seeks to clarify the
   extent to which the power balance within the Chinese political elite has
   changed since the 18th Congress, and the actual strength of the main
   factions of the CCP. The results of the research show that the analyses
   which emphasise the return to the centre of political arena of Jiang
   Zemin and his faction - the Shanghai gang - are partly overstated. Quite
   to the contrary, elements of continuity with the previous Chinese
   leadership's line-up tend to prevail over elements of novelty.},

Title = {The Penal Matrix. Becoming an Adult under Judicial Protection},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {27},
Number = {108},
Pages = {11+},
Abstract = {In France, the Protection judiciaire de la jeunesse (PJJ) is a public
   administration in charge of educating minors under penal surveillance.
   Juvenile offenders are monitored by judges specialized in children
   issues whom decisions are implemented by civil servants of the PJJ
   (educators mostly, but also psychologists and social workers). Drawing
   on a fieldwork conducted in a local Youth Bureau of the PJJ in 2010,
   this article examines the practices and discourses of professionals who
   consider both autonomy and responsibility as matrix and justificatory
   values of their action. Their work is analyzed as a process which aims
   at producing autonomous selves and future responsible adults - that is
   to say people able to exist as independent and distinct subjects of
   value as normalized ones. Thus, this article questions rehabilitative
   and life-saving components of control, in order to problematize social
   work as a binding pedagogy that corrects and transforms selves, and aims
   at turning minors into subjects of superior capabilities by modifying
   their wills and desires.},

   Administration in Switzerland once again is on the upswing since the
   millenium, which shows in a significant expansion of academic training
   programs. This development rests upon a solid body of research that
   keeps being vividly and versatilely extended as will be shown by
   examples from the various social-scientific sub-disciplines ranging from
   sociology to public management. Whereas the empirical material of this
   research primarily refers to the Swiss setting, its findings find
   remarkable international attention. While Swiss Public Administration
   thus has gained in size and relevance in recent years, there still is
   potential for a further continuation of this line of research.},

Abstract = {Assuming that the issue of fragmentation of international human rights
   law can also be usefully examined in the case-law on particular rights
   using a comparative method, this article examines the divergence and
   convergence of freedom of assembly guarantees and jurisprudence in
   international fora. It finds that some identified divergences in fact
   point to underlying common concerns and assumptions about assemblies. On
   this basis, the article argues that the fragmentation discourse is prone
   to structurally analogous, though ``reverse{''}, fallacies as the
   methodology of comparative law. In particular, the functionalist method
   is much criticised for being apologetic or trapped within one's own
   conceptual and institutional system, a concern which might be present in
   the fragmentation debate as well. The article concludes on this basis by
   formulating some suggestions which might be applied to examining
   fragmentation in international human rights law and potentially beyond.},

Journal = {CANADIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-26},
Abstract = {For descriptive and analytical reasons there is an understandable
   tendency to view political parties as homogenous. Yet it is widely known
   that most parties, particularly those that compete in single-member
   plurality systems, are effectively coalitions. This paper explores
   support for the Reform Party of Canada in part to better understand the
   character of the current governing Conservative party of which it was a
   founding component. We find a party that attracted two distinct kinds of
   supporters: radicals, for whom support reflected the appeal of Reform
   party policies, its leader and ideology, and protest voters for whom it
   was mainly an alternative to the then-governing Liberals. These
   supporters were geographically concentrated, with the former in Western
   Canada, and the latter in Eastern Canada. Such diversity describes one
   of the central challenges confronting all parties operating in Canada's
   single member plurality system: sustaining a coalition of supporters in
   which reasons for attachment to the party vary by region. As with
   previous governments, it helps to explain the peculiar political demands
   that confront the current Conservative government as it seeks to
   maintain this coalition.},

Abstract = {Drawing on our research and blogging on Israel and the
   Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we make three claims about the role of
   scholar-bloggers in the social media age. First, as scholar-bloggers
   with some degree of ethno-national attachments related to our area of
   expertise, we contend that we are well positioned to issue the kinds of
   critiques that may resonate more deeply due to the very subjectivity
   that some perceive as a liability. Second, through the melding of
   scholarly arguments with popular writing forms, scholar-bloggers are
   uniquely poised to be at the forefront of public engagement and
   political literacy both with social media publics and with students.
   Third, the subjectivity hazard is an intrinsic part of any type of
   research and writing, whether that writing is aimed at a scholarly
   audience or any other, and should not be used as an argument against
   academic involvement in social media. Ultimately, subjectivities of both
   consumers and producers can evolve through these highly interactive
   media, a dynamic that deserves further examination.},

Pages = {72+},
Abstract = {The paper is devoted to the analysis of development of expert
   communities and think tanks in three neighbor Russian regions:
   Chelyabinskaya and Sverdlovskaya oblasts and Permskiy kray. It was
   demonstrated on the experience of these three regions that prominent
   conditions for the arising think tanks of different types are a real
   level of political plurality and existence of community of political
   scientists. The corresponding conditions are most suitable in Permskiy
   kray, where arbitrary democratic political practices take place and
   where authoritative and stable community of political scientists exists.
   Owing to these conditions a lot of stable think tanks work in this
   region, and many of them act as public policy centers. In the case of
   Sverdlovskaya oblast the existence during fifteen years of two stable
   power centers - governor Eduard Rossel, and mayor of oblast' central
   city Arkadiy Chernetskiy, ensured some level of political pluralism.
   Many political scientists used then to participate actively in political
   struggle as experts, experiencing consequences of fail of their patrons.
   During the last years frequent changes of governors accompanied by
   renovation of regional political elites resulted in diminishing of most
   analytical centers. Chelyabinskaya oblast is at the end of this list.
   Governor Peyotr Sumin dominated in the political field near to fifteen
   years, and community of political scientists are very weak and split.},

Abstract = {This article shortly reviews the literature on the circulation of norms
   in the context of accession to the European Union (EU) and European
   neighbourhood policy (ENP) in order to show that debates on transfer in
   other disciplines of social sciences can fruitfully nurture those on
   norm exportation in international relations and in the EU foreign policy
   in particular. The example of differentiated interpretations and
   translations of the ``soft norm{''} of ``good governance{''} in the
   field of institutional reforms shows that it is necessary to combine
   difference concepts in order to detail more precisely ongoing processes
   in relation to the eastern neighbourhood.},

Abstract = {Vicente Santamaria de Paredes was the most influential professor of the
   Spanish Political Law during the Restoration (1874-1923). Successor of
   Manuel Colmeiro and predecessor of Adolfo Posada in the chair of this
   academic discipline at the Central University of Madrid, their main
   works were the Curso de Derecho Politico and the Curso de Derecho
   Administrativo. Both were published for first time in the eighties of
   the nineteenth century and re-edited many times after. Santamaria had
   also an important activity as a lawyer, as a member of Parliament inside
   the Liberal Party, as a minister of Education in a Cabinet headed by
   Segismundo Moret and as preceptor of King Alfonso XIII. Santamaria
   promoted the Act which in 1888 carried out a deeply reform of the
   administrative jurisdiction and drew up the new functions of the Consejo
   de Estado. This essay deals with his career path, especially in the
   field of the Political Law.},

   policy network at the local government level; the empirical reference is
   a public action in the tourist town of Valle de Bravo. The conclusions
   suggest that it has been an alternative structure to address public
   affairs because there are non-governmental actors with power and control
   taking part in the public action. These actors are more important than
   the government.},

Abstract = {The North Korean government has long been suspected of involvement in

   Wang and Stephan Blancke look at developments over the past decade,
   intensified counter-narcotics co-operation between the Chinese and South
   Korean police forces, and the failure of the North Korean government to
   control private involvement in the illicit drug business, which has had
   an unexpected outcome: a crystal-meth epidemic. These trends expose a
   severe threat to Northeast Asia and the wider international community.},

Abstract = {This paper reports the views of 25 constitutional scholars on the 2008
   prorogation. A large majority of scholars agree that the Governor
   General had discretion in 2008 to refuse the Prime Minister. Most hold
   that the 2008 prorogation harmed principles of responsible government,
   and a majority favour the development of a cabinet manual to outline
   roles and responsibilities to avoid future crises. Based on the survey
   data, I propose four unique schools of thought on this event, and
   consider how future research can test, assess, and further refine these
   findings.},

Abstract = {Wealth redistribution in a society is related to the social planner's
   beliefs about social justice. In this paper, the social planner's
   preferences are described by a Choquet integral, which is a convex
   combination of a weighted utilitarian social welfare function and an
   egalitarian social welfare function. By spending resources on lobbying,
   interest groups can change the social planner's preferences, by shifting
   the weights of the utilitarian part, or by shifting more or less weight
   to the egalitarian part. We use a model of a two-player lobbying game
   and obtain the conditions for a pure strategy Nash equilibrium of the
   game.},

   the described religions, i.e. Judaism, Islam or Christianity, different
   moment in the developmental process is defined as the age of religious
   maturity, which involves full responsibility for actions and obligations
   associated with religious rites. The religious practice in the family
   life shapes the manner and method according to which the young woman is
   raised, the priorities according to which she will live in her adult
   life, and the values to which she will adhere. Basically, the common
   aspect to all three religions: Judaism, Christianity or Islam is the top
   choice of religion by the child's parents, which, in most cases, means
   the transfer of religious tradition cultivated by parents to their
   children.},

Abstract = {How difficult is it for political scientists in Britain to engage with
   the mass media and what benefits can they expect from such engagement?
   On the basis of a survey of academics from all disciplines who appear
   frequently on the broadcast media, a second survey of political
   scientists and interviews with academics, journalists and producers we
   examine how often UK academics appear on the media, how they manage to
   get invited to appear and what they talk about over the airwaves. The
   evidence points among other things to the predominantly passive role of
   scholars, especially social scientists, as media commentators and the
   limited opportunities that traditional broadcast media offer for
   research dissemination. If getting research out to a wider audience is a
   key goal of media engagement, then blog posts appear to be more
   effective than seeking radio or TV coverage. The article goes on to
   explore the implications of the results for the wider normative debate
   about the need for academics to engage with the public through the
   media.},

   crisis diagnosis to the presence of this conceptual divide and suggests
   overcoming it by focusing on the work of Michel Foucault, especially his
   concept of the ``rectangle of the good parrhesia.{''} Foucault's
   analysis goes beyond conflict-consensus through its positive and
   creative reconceptualization of political authority featuring a
   transformative capacity linked to the idea of telling the truth.},

Abstract = {This article aims to analyze the behavior of China as a regional power
   by applying it to the specific case of Central Asia. The central
   argument is that Beijing is trying to boost economic, political and
   military ties with the Central Asian Republics, although its soft power
   is still very ineffective in the region. Moreover, the Chinese regional
   ambitions are often viewed with suspicion by neighboring Central Asian
   countries, which still see Russia as a great economic, military and
   cultural reference, givenits long Soviet past.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes contemporary democracies from a deliberative
   democratic standpoint and focuses on the connection between public and
   empowered spaces. The idea of deliberative systems and the concept of
   ``transmission{''} are introduced to discuss the ways in which the
   public is able to affect the empowered spaces. While elections perform
   important democratic functions, alone they cannot provide a good quality
   means for connecting deliberation in the public to that of actors in the
   empowered space. The problem with transmission is exacerbated to the
   extent that alternative forms of participation are neglected. The
   limited ability of the public to affect the empowered space in
   deliberative and democratic ways contributes to the crisis of democratic
   systems. One solution to this problem is to acknowledge the role of
   citizens' deliberation. The article argues for the systematic
   introduction of spaces for citizens' deliberation that would parallel
   existing decision-making.},

Abstract = {In the instant analysis that followed, pundits dubbed the 2014 midterms
   an election ``wave{''} for the Republican Party. Our article argues that
   ``wave{''} is one of the most abused terms in American political
   discourse. Although political waves do exist, our article argues that
   they come in a variety of shapes, are created by a constellation of
   factors beyond anti-incumbency, and can have a number of different
   effects on the next national election cycle. Our analysis shows that the
   2014 wave (if there was a wave in the ocean) was neither as large as
   pundits suggested nor as politically impactful as some spinners have
   claimed. Elections are determined by terrain and climate, both of which
   favored Republicans in 2014. Republicans captured or defended Senate
   seats where they should have in nine deep-red states. Focusing on
   gubernatorial and Senate campaigns in seven purple states, we see that
   Republicans won eight out of the 12 contests and five out of the nine
   most competitive contests. Although there has been an immense amount of
   attention to turnout, our analysis demonstrates that Republican
   victories were sometimes due to turnout, sometimes due to performance
   among independents, and sometimes due to a combination of these factors.
   This mixed picture complicates the analysis of the Republican victories,
   suggesting that the Rising American Electorate (youth, minorities,
   women) will not simply carry the Democrats to victory in 2016, and that
   anti-Obama public opinion alone will not be enough to deliver the White
   House to Republicans. It also provides yet more evidence that there is
   not a one-size-fits-all strategy when it comes to campaign focus and
   targeting.},

Abstract = {Welfare programs distribute benefits to citizens. Perhaps even more
   importantly, by conveying powerful messages about how the state views
   poor people, welfare programs shape people's views about themselves as
   subjects or citizens. Theoretical debates on how public policies can
   enhance democratic citizenship inspire our study of Brazil's Bolsa
   Familia (Family Grant). Has this conditional cash transfer program,
   which forms a major point of contact between the state and millions of
   poor Brazilians, elevated feelings of social inclusion and agency? A
   prominent perspective in the welfare-state literature would not expect a
   positive outcome given the strict means testing and behavioral
   requirements entailed. Yet our focus group research with Bolsa Familia
   recipients suggests that the program does foster a sense of belonging
   and efficacy. Policy design and government discourse matter. This
   innovative welfare program yields rich insights on alternative paths to
   citizenship development for middle-and low-income countries in the third
   wave of democracy.},

Abstract = {Armed conflict, and to a lesser extent terrorism, have detrimental
   effect on economic and social development through destruction of human
   and physical capital and ensuing disruption to economic activity. There
   is also likely to be an indirect effect of political instability through
   its impact on foreign aid. The net effect is not obvious; violence may
   discourage aid donors and hence lead to a fall in received aid on the
   one hand, but it may well lead to an increase in foreign aid as donors
   offer reimbursement for counterterrorism efforts on the other hand. This
   paper uses a panel of countries to identify the net effect of armed
   conflict and terrorism, both domestic and international, on aid
   receipts. It shows that armed conflict has a negative effect on the
   amounts of both bilateral and multilateral aid. It also finds that
   terrorism tends to increase foreign assistance. The effect is stronger
   for bilateral aid; this is consistent with the expectation that they are
   likely to use foreign aid to directly or indirectly assist governments
   fighting terrorism. Nonetheless, these results do not hold for Muslim
   countries which do not receive increased aid when suffering from
   terrorism.},

Abstract = {While scholars may be pleased with parsimonious models of the presidency
   in which institutional variables determine presidents' decision-making
   structures, veteran policy makers argue that scholars miss the essence
   of decision: people make decisions. This article tests the impact of the
   president as a variable. The transition from Kennedy to Johnson is a
   case where all variables remained the same, except the occupant of the
   Oval Office. Study of the impact of a new president on decision making
   toward China helps define the influence of both institutional and
   presidential- centered variables as well as the importance of senior
   presidential advisors},

   expressions, in the political domain, of more basic personal values.
   Basic personal values (e.g., security, achievement, benevolence,
   hedonism) are organized on a circular continuum that reflects their
   conflicting and compatible motivations. We theorize that this circular
   motivational structure also gives coherence to political values. We
   assess this theorizing with data from 15 countries, using eight core
   political values (e.g., free enterprise, law and order) and ten basic
   personal values. We specify the underlying basic values expected to
   promote or oppose each political value. We offer different hypotheses
   for the 12 non-communist and three post-communist countries studied,
   where the political context suggests different meanings of a basic or
   political value. Correlation and regression analyses support almost all
   hypotheses. Moreover, basic values account for substantially more
   variance in political values than age, gender, education, and income.
   Multidimensional scaling analyses demonstrate graphically how the
   circular motivational continuum of basic personal values structures
   relations among core political values. This study strengthens the
   assumption that individual differences in basic personal values play a
   critical role in political thought.},

Abstract = {How do electoral institutions affect self-identified partisanship? I
   hypothesize that party registration acts to anchor a person's party
   identification, tying a person to a political party even when their
   underlying preferences may align them with the other party. Estimating a
   random effects multinomial logit model, I find individuals registered
   with a party are more likely to self-identify with that party and away
   from the other party. Party registration also affects voting in
   presidential elections but not in House elections, leading to greater
   defection in the former where voters have more information about the
   candidates. These insights illuminate varying rates of electoral
   realignment, particularly among southern states, and the makeup of
   primary electorates in states with and without party registration. (C)

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the process of the formulation of public policy for
   the indigenous population of the city of Medellin in the period
   2008-2009, through two phases: i) to diagnostic and prioritized the
   issues of the 22 indigenous ethnic groups living the city, and ii) the
   formulation of public policy. From the ethnic approach to the analysis
   of public policies, it is noted that despite the initial consensus among
   the indigenous population, represented in two urban indigenous councils
   and the municipal administration ignorance of negotiations and
   agreements initially achieved by one of the councils of the city, and
   therefore the political conflicts within the Indigenous Social Alliance
   led to the failure of this policy.},

Abstract = {Two recent strands of research have proposed that state capacity
   facilitates autocratic and democratic survival, respectively. While
   convincing arguments sustain each of these expectations, prior research
   has neglected a crucial distinction with respect to state capacity: that
   between monopoly on violence and administrative effectiveness. In this
   article, we first formulate propositions about the relationship between
   each of these different aspects of state capacity and political regime
   stability. We then subject these propositions to empirical assessment
   through cross-national, statistical analysis. Our findings show that
   state capacity does indeed tend to enhance regime stability in both
   autocracies and democracies. Yet, the analyses also reveal that what
   primarily matters in autocracies is the monopoly on violence whereas
   administrative effectiveness is what stabilizes democracies. Finally, we
   discuss alternative interpretations of the patterns and conclude that
   our results go a long way toward making sense of apparent
   inconsistencies in the findings of previous studies.},

Abstract = {This article shows that the issue of immigration remains very central to
   understanding notions such as national identity and threats to
   homogeneity in Turkey and Hungary. Even in the absence of large-scale
   immigration, conservative socio-political leanings commonly prevail
   against immigration due to a general aversion of foreignness in
   societies. In presenting how two conservative right parties grapple with
   the self-inflicted problem of immigration, this article advocates that
   political parties usurp prevalent fears among their voters.},

Abstract = {The television movie ``Generation War{''} was lavishly staged as a major
   media event. It told the story of a group of young Germans in the Second
   World War and claimed to break taboos and launch a discussion about the
   past. The deliberate blurring of documents and fiction, both in the film
   and in the accompanying documentaries, suggested authenticity and
   realism. But in terms of content, this film largely perpetuated the
   German myth of victimization that post-war cinema had cultivated.
   Anti-Semitism was portrayed as above all a problem of the Polish Home
   Army. Criticism in Poland was accordingly fierce. Both in Germany and in
   Poland, the reception was self-centred, a dialogue did not materialize.},

Abstract = {The 2014 European election in Northern Ireland, while containing a
   greater field of candidates than ever before, returned the three sitting
   Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) without too much disruption to
   the status quo. Sinn Fein (SF) topped the poll with their candidate
   Martina Anderson increasing the party's vote and the Democratic Unionist
   Party's Diane Dodds came in second with a comfortable margin over the
   third successful candidate, the Ulster Unionist Party's Jim Nicholson.
   Following up the three MEPs with challenging performances were the
   Social Democratic and Labour Party's Alex Attwood and the Traditional
   Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister. Anderson was new to the European
   elections and regained the seat for SF with ease, being the only
   candidate to pass the quota on the first count. The tussle between
   Nicholson, Attwood and Allister turned out to be more competitive for
   the third seat with only 7,000 first preference votes separating the
   three. In the end, it was a result that was largely expected. Drawing
   upon party political manifestos and leaflets, media coverage and other
   relevant sources, the report assesses the campaign, outcome and
   consequences of the 2014 European election in Northern Ireland.},

Abstract = {The article demonstrates that the rigid use of veto capacity in

   legislative period from 2009 to 2013. By analysing several legislative
   projects the article shows that their contents or non-adoption were an
   effect of liberals' vetoes. This policy-seeking strategy provoked
   conflicts within the coalition and stalemate making it impossible to
   realise popular measures that would have enhanced the Liberals'
   reputation and the importance of the domain for the voters who were
   mainly interested in economic and social policy. Moreover, the Liberals'
   vetoes led to a loss of support from its major coalition partner in the
   pre-election campaign. Thus governmental parties have to trade off
   policy and vote-seeking goals in order to get re-elected.},

Journal = {POLITY},

Volume = {46},

Abstract = {This article explores some discrepancies between Alfarabi's and Ibn
   Sina's treatments of the political sphere and of the role of the first
   ruler or prophet in establishing and maintaining the political order.
   While Alfarabi makes much of the religious function of the first ruler
   and calls him by a secular name, Ibn Sina treats the first ruler as
   little more than the guarantor of the trustworthiness of contract law,
   yet consistently refers to him as ``prophet.{''} Alfarabi, in other
   words, is content with secular language, even though his aims are lofty,
   whereas Ibn Sina employs elevated, religious language, even though his
   aims appear more realistic. This article unveils an irony: that
   fundamentally similar understandings of the political situation of man
   and of the philosopher in relation to the city-can account for the
   various differences between these thinkers' emphases and modes of
   presentation.},

Abstract = {Using updated Archigos Data, as well as structural and event data, we
   construct a split-population duration model of irregular leadership
   changes. These are leadership changes that occur outside of the normal,
   legal framework for leadership transitions. Our model was estimated in
   March 2014 and produced probability estimates of leadership changes in
   many countries in the world. We used a wisdom-of-the-crowds approach to
   combining estimates from various different models. Ukraine and Thailand
   are among those in which we had the highest predictions for irregular

Year = {2014},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {In his article, `What Should Egalitarians Believe?', Martin O'Neill
   argues, amongst other things, that egalitarians should reject both Telic
   and Deontic Egalitarianism and that they should adopt in their place a
   version of Non-Intrinsic Egalitarianism, specifically, the Pluralist
   Non-Intrinsic Egalitarian View. The central purpose of my article is to
   challenge O'Neill's assumption that he can defend each of the various
   propositions that make up his position simultaneously. I do this with
   two arguments. First, I argue that in order to justify why egalitarians
   should adopt a version of Non-Intrinsic Egalitarianism, O'Neill is bound
   to rely on forms of egalitarianism that are either Telic or Deontic, and
   so he is no longer able to affirm that egalitarians should reject both
   Telic and Deontic Egalitarianism. Second, I argue that by allowing the
   inclusion of non-egalitarian reasons into the Pluralist Non-Intrinsic
   Egalitarian View, O'Neill opens the floodgates to an indefinite number
   of other non-egalitarian reasons, such that it is scarcely credible that
   the Pluralist Non-Intrinsic Egalitarian View really is an egalitarian
   view after all.},

Abstract = {Turkey is undergoing the most substantial constitutional reform process
   in its history, at the same time as carrying out significant peace talks
   with the Kurdistan Workers' Party. These two processes will have
   profound effects on the country's future governance. Most importantly,
   the processes could contribute to bridging gaps in Turkey's polarized
   society. As the processes take place in secret, their substantive
   contents are currently unknown. This article provides a critical
   analysis of the processes in the light of the new theory of
   constitutionalism, paying particular attention to the changing role of
   the European Union in Turkey's reform discussions. This analysis leads
   to some sceptical conclusions: given the secrecy, exclusiveness and
   political hostility surrounding the processes, it seems that they are
   unlikely to achieve their potential. In addition, despite its
   contradictions, the weakening of European Union conditionality appears
   to have negatively affected the reform process.},

Abstract = {In January 2001, a peaceful urban revolt ousted President Joseph Estrada
   of the Philippines amid evidence of the president's involvement in
   illegal gambling. Using Estrada's ouster as a case study, this article
   examines the ground-up process that turns everyday criminality in the
   Philippines into public scandal. It contends that scandalous
   politicsacts of illegality perpetrated by the political elite in various
   localities-are a constant feature of the Philippine state. However, it
   is only when these acts become legible to the observers of national
   politics that a public scandal occurs. In examining the nexus between
   scandalous politics and public scandal, the article views scandal as a
   mediated phenomenon, one premised on the concerns of middle-class
   politics in Manila.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Volume = {76},

Abstract = {Electoral accountability depends on citizens making informed choices at
   the voting booth. We explore whether the gender of U.S. Senators
   influences what people know about their senators. We also examine
   whether people's level of information about men and women senators
   affects their participation in politics. We develop theoretical
   expectations to explain why a senator's gender may influence citizens'
   knowledge and behaviors. We rely on the 2006 Congressional Cooperative
   Election Survey and examine the population of U.S. Senators serving in
   the 109th Congress. We find that women know far less about their
   senators than men. Second, the gap in political knowledge closes sharply
   when women senators represent women citizens. Third, perhaps most
   importantly, women citizens are more active in politics when represented
   by women senators. These findings suggest the confluence of more women
   senators and additional women voters may produce important changes in
   the policy outcomes of the U.S. Congress.},

Abstract = {European Union (EU) public policy is notoriously technical and consensus
   orientated, and dialogue between political institutions and interest
   groups may enhance tendencies for inward looking and elite politics. A
   new European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) mechanism seems to offer an
   opportunity to address these structural defects. We examine the entire
   set of more than 60 signature collection campaigns stimulated by the ECI
   for the degree of contention and type of campaign they bring to EU
   politics. A key feature of a majority of campaigns involves a diversity
   of origin, both by territory and campaign source. We record the diverse
   ways in which the ECI has been utilised by campaigners, noting how
   campaigns have largely been introduced by a markedly different set of
   activists than professionalised EU lobbyists, many newly mobilised by a
   direct participation device and which may require EU lobby organisations
   to engage with new forms of campaigning. A key finding is that campaigns
   originating from sponsors already well linked to EU politics were less
   likely to be of a contentious nature than those from other sources.},

Abstract = {We consider the behavior of an incumbent that can deploy local public
   goods and private goods to buy votes, and is unable to verify vote
   choice but capable of monitoring voter turnout, a common scenario in
   secret-ballot polities. As advanced by recent literature, the ability to
   monitor turnout rather than vote choice implies that politicians should
   use targetable private goods to mobilize voters. However, politicians
   also deploy non-excludable local public goods, which have low
   mobilization potential because of free-rider incentives. We argue that
   vote-buying politicians reserve local public goods for loyal
   constituencies (where they enjoy support from most voters that bother to
   turn out) and provide private goods in other constituencies where they
   gain from motivating less committed supporters to turn out. We test
   aggregate-level implications of our theory on Venezuela's social
   programs.},

Abstract = {Nearly two years after removal of Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali and Hosni
   Mubarak, Tunisia and Egypt are still in transition: gains made by early
   2013 remain tenuous, and whether democracy takes root remains to be
   seen. This article identifies variables affecting these states'
   prospects for democratic development by drawing lessons from the
   post-communist coloured revolutions of the early 2000s, when democratic
   forces had difficulty consolidating initial gains. Based on these cases,
   we suggest that choices available to political actors, in particular the
   ability of democratic opposition forces to maintain unity and support a
   common transition platform, and their success in removing old regime
   elites, will be crucial in the post-Arab Spring environment. However, we
   also examine structural variables, including the nature of the ousted
   authoritarian regime and external leverage, which point to differences
   between the coloured revolutions and MENA uprisings and suggest limits
   to cross-regional comparison.},

Title = {Lifecycle changes and the activation of habitual voting: The case of
   Costa Rica},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {35},
Pages = {188-199},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Under circumstances of substantial turnout reductions, the development
   of electoral habits may constitute a key factor to attenuate or even
   revert such tendency in the long term. Using a unique dataset I examine
   the extent to which age and lifecycle changes mediate the effects of
   prior turnout (habituation) on future electoral behavior. Three findings
   are highlighted. First, age and turnout(t-1) reinforce each other and
   boost turnout to higher rates. Second, even under favorable
   circumstances, residential mobility still can disrupt individuals voting
   patterns, regardless of whether their behavior was already habituated.
   Finally, habitual voting is activated by the time individuals
   participate in their fourth election, and the sooner they cast their
   first vote. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Despite a slogan advocating a change from practices of the past, Barack
   Obama's presidential campaign of 2008 had an intriguing similarity to
   that of Richard Nixon in 1968. Like Nixon, Obama benefited from and
   secured victory partly due to his opposition to a contentious war of
   choice. The wars in Vietnam and Iraq provided the political and cultural
   circumstances that made Nixon and Obama credible candidates in 1968 and
   2008, respectively. The wars weakened support for the incumbent party
   and caused divisions within the country and in their own parties that
   both men exploited to neutralize political rivals in the primary season
   and defeat their opponent in the general election. This article examines
   the manner in which Obama, like Nixon, benefited directly from conflict
   by promoting his opposition and apparent solutions to gain public
   confidence, neutralize political opponents, and secure the presidency.},

Abstract = {Governments since the 1980s have reshaped the public sector by selling
   public businesses and other assets, and by introducing competition in
   the supply of taxpayer-funded services. Explanations for these new
   directions have focused on political ideologies about the proper role of
   government, and economic arguments about business efficiency, while
   noting an international trend towards diffusion of these policy ideas.
   However, the methods for achieving significant policy shifts have often
   been overlooked. This study examines the case of Queensland,
   highlighting a wider range of reform factors, including bureaucratic
   advice and commission of audit recommendations.},

Abstract = {How does ethnic diversity affect social trust? The conflict hypothesis,
   which predicts a negative effect, and the contact hypothesis, which
   predicts a positive effect, represent the main competing answers. This
   article argues that the `true' answer to the question is contingent upon
   the social units under study and how they interact. More specifically,
   it is argued that diversity will have a negative effect on social trust
   when focusing on social units where intergroup contacts are easy to
   avoid (neighbourhoods broadly defined), whereas diversity will have a
   positive effect when focusing on social units where intergroup contacts
   are hard to avoid and are supported by higher authorities (e. g.,
   workplaces). The data substantiating the argument is from the first
   round of the European Social Survey, covering 30,000 individuals nested
   within 22 countries, and is analysed by means of multilevel linear
   regression modeling.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the impact of recent decentralizing reforms on the
   fiscal autonomy of Macedonian municipalities. It begins by considering
   how the short-term political calculations and intra-party dynamics of
   governing parties may have influenced both the design and implementation
   of fiscal decentralization. The article evaluates the revenue,
   expenditure, and contractual autonomy of Macedonian municipalities. It
   argues that the political-economic context within which fiscal
   decentralization has been conceived and implemented thus far has not
   been conducive to enhancing the fiscal autonomy of the municipalities.
   The research confirms that, while constitutionally guaranteed
   decentralization processes may be harder to reverse than others, it is
   not impossible. Advances in either administrative or political
   decentralization can be undermined by tightening controls over fiscal
   relations.},

Abstract = {Religion played a central role in Tocqueville's thinking and writing,
   and it was one of the major features of American society and culture as
   described by Tocqueville. This paper draws upon the working papers and
   text of his Democracy in America to revisit some of the key questions he
   asked about religion and to raise a few further questions that emerge
   from his responses. This paper also demonstrates how Tocqueville
   sometimes trimmed his opinions and arguments in order to appeal more
   effectively to his intended audience, the French reader.},

Abstract = {A major justification for bringing government closer to the people is
   that it improves the opportunities for and frequency of citizen
   participation in the political system. This article first reviews the
   major arguments for decentralisation and why it is credited with
   increasing participation. I then perform statistical analyses in 22
   states with country-level decentralisation data and public opinion data
   drawn from the 2006 European Social Survey. The findings generally fail
   to support the conventional wisdom that decentralisation improves
   political participation.},

Abstract = {We evaluate the role of a new type of democratic institution,
   participatory budgeting (PB), for improving citizens' well-being.
   Participatory institutions are said to enhance governance, citizens'
   empowerment, and the quality of democracy, creating a virtuous cycle to
   improve the poor's well-being. Drawing from an original database of
   Brazil's largest cities over the last 20 years, we assess whether
   adopting PB programs influences several indicators of well-being inputs,
   processes, and outcomes. We find PB programs are strongly associated
   with increases in health care spending, increases in civil society
   organizations, and decreases in infant mortality rates. This connection
   strengthens dramatically as PB programs remain in place over longer time
   frames. Furthermore, PB's connection to well-being strengthens in the
   hand of mayors from the nationally powerful, ideologically and
   electorally motivated Workers' Party. Our argument directly addresses
   debates on democracy and well-being and has powerful implications for
   participation, governance, and economic development.},

Abstract = {Could racial or religious bias within the United Nations be hindering
   efforts to prevent and punish the crime of genocide? I answer this
   question by surveying the UN response to a variety of alleged genocides,
   ranging from Biafra starting in the late 1960s to Syria starting in
   2012. In terms of quantitative analysis, this article explores whether
   the UN response to claims of genocide is proportionate to the scale of
   actual harm, using absolute death tolls and percentage reductions in the
   populations of specific minority groups to assess harm. It finds that
   voting blocs based on racial or religious identity may be warping the UN
   response to potential genocides, resulting in disproportionate attention
   across cases. In this regard, the Arab League, the Non-Aligned Movement,
   and the Republic of Turkey appear to play important roles in shaping UN
   responses. In terms of qualitative analysis, the article surveys
   evidence that key actors at the United Nations may have been motivated
   by bias in framing collective responses to claims of genocide and other
   mass violence.},

Abstract = {In this article I will provide a critical analysis of the traditional
   maternal role and its social implications. In order to do so, I will
   examine the innovative potential of the, so to say, `alternative forms'
   of motherhood, so as to show the controversial overlap between the
   classical figure of the mother and the possibility of a polymorphic
   notion of motherhood opened up by widespread social practices and
   medical developments. This enquiry will show that the collapse of
   womanhood into motherhood not only affects women's lives and their
   positioning in society, but also reinforces and underpins discourses
   which hold back broader cultural and technological changes.},

Title = {Democracy in crisis? The declining support for national democracy in
   European countries, 2007-2011},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},

Abstract = {The Great Recession that started in 2007/2008 has been the worst
   economic downturn since the crisis of the 1930s in Europe. It led to a
   major sovereign debt crisis, which is arguably the biggest challenge for
   the European Union (EU) and its common currency. Not since the 1950s
   have advanced democracies experienced such a dramatic external
   imposition of austerity and structural reform policies through inter- or
   supranational organisations such as the EU and the International
   Monetary Fund ( IMF) or as implicitly requested by international
   financial markets. Did this massive interference with the room for
   maneuver of parliaments and governments in many countries erode support
   for national democracy in the crisis since 2007? Did citizens realise
   that their national democratic institutions were no longer able to
   effectively decide on major economic and social policies, on economic
   and welfare state institutions? And did they react by concluding that
   this constrained democracy no longer merited further support? These are
   the questions guiding this article, which compares 26 EU countries in
   2007-2011 and re-analyses 78 national surveys. Aggregate data from these
   surveys is analysed in a time-series cross-section design to examine
   changes in democratic support at the country level. The hypotheses also
   are tested at the individual level by estimating a series of
   cross-classified multilevel logistic regression models. Support for
   national democracy - operationalised as satisfaction with the way
   democracy works and as trust in parliament - declined dramatically
   during the crisis. This was caused both by international organisations
   and markets interfering with national democratic procedures and by the
   deteriorating situation of the national economy as perceived by
   individual citizens.},

Number = {3},
Pages = {407-429},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Term limits remain a popular policy reform and have generated a great
   deal of scholarship as a result. Although many predicted that term
   limits would benefit the Republican party, the literature finds no
   marked partisan effects, possibly because termed-out legislators have
   largely been replaced by copartisans. This article demonstrates that
   term limits have indeed had partisan effects-just not on electoral
   outcomes. Term limits have caused a significant reallocation of
   institutional power from Democrats to Republicans (as measured by
   contributions from access-oriented interest groups), in large part
   because they have removed more senior Democrats than Republicans. The
   partisan effects of term limits therefore point to the institutional
   value of seniority.},

Abstract = {Most contemporary political theories of sovereignty - from Giorgio
   Agamben to Achille Mbembe - have argued that the emergency powers
   claimed by the Bush administration under the auspices of the War on
   Terror epitomized what Carl Schmitt calls a state of exception. If so, I
   argue, perhaps it is time for new visions of sovereignty to emerge, ones
   attendant to the eccentricities of the present conjuncture. Occupy Wall
   Street and the Arab Spring are but two obvious examples of
   counterpublics that seem to have presented new modalities of sovereign
   life worth reflecting upon. Hardly states of exception, these are scenes
   of sovereignty that are more fraught and precarious, more democratic. I
   argue that the theories of sovereignty of George Bataille and Frantz
   Fanon may hold clues for coming to terms with these new sovereign
   scenes. Though often under-emphasized in the scholarly literature on
   Bataille and Fanon, for both thinkers sovereignty is a condition of
   existence, an expression of a surreal mode of esthetic experience and
   poetic beauty. I argue that drawing attention to the comparison of the
   political thought of Bataille and Fanon, and especially to the value of
   surrealism for contemporary political theory generally, holds promise
   for those of us interested in challenging the Schmittian consensus. At
   stake is a refreshed understanding of sovereignty, not as norm or
   exception, but as a condition of political life lived by everyday
   subjects caught in a surreal state in-between.},

Abstract = {The major dependent variable in peace science research has appropriately
   been death from inter-group conflict with war the major focus. However,
   a tenable hypothesis is that the same or similar motivations result in
   other risks to life. For example, the number of human deaths each year
   from preventable nonmilitary sources is approximately 20,000,000. Most
   major sources that assess the loss of life from military and related
   conflicts identify, over a long period of time, not more than
   2,000,000/year. This dependent variable may also be extended to the
   non-military category. For example, evidence has emerged that
   approximately twenty- percent of the active duty female members of the
   US military are sexually assaulted by other members of the military
   during their period of service (Dick 2012). Thus, it seems reasonable to
   address a variety of phenomena that may be represented by a common set
   of attributes. These variables should include degree of physical injury,
   size of acting units, and public vs. private agents. Preventable non-
   military death is similar to the classification for death from war
   except that the agents are frequently private, such as corporations.
   This analysis is intended to contribute to a continuing discussion of
   the boundaries of the peace science domain. One function of the
   discussion is to foster the examination of a range of behaviors that may

   concludes with reference to the problem of understanding a central
   factor in inter-group conflict - identification with the grop.},

Journal = {POLITICAL QUARTERLY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {85},
Number = {3},
Pages = {296-303},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Under pressure from voters, and from other parties, Europe's centre-left
   has had to re-evaluate its position on migration. The UK Labour party is
   no exception. Public concern about large-scale immigration clearly
   contributed to its heavy defeat at the 2010 general election. Since then
   it has been slowly but surely hardening its stance on the issue,
   although this is by no means unprecedented: while the rise of UKIP may
   have upped the ante in recent months, Labour has a long history of
   adjusting policy in this area so as to remain competitive with its main
   rival, the Conservative party. Labour is now asking itself whether it
   will be possible to do this without challenging one of the fundamental
   precepts of EU membershipthe right of free movement of people. Whatever
   the result of this internal debate between the party's beer drinkers'
   and its wine drinkers', Labour may still have difficulty in neutralising
   immigration as an issue since, for the most part, it continues to insist
   on giving an essentially economic answer to what for many voters is
   actually a cultural question.},

Journal = {PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS},
Year = {2014},

Abstract = {This article is a response to Berry's arguments on the impact of
   population ageing as potentially marginalising younger people in the
   democratic process. Berry constructs a pessimistic account where a
   powerful grey vote will enact an age-based `majority rule' and posits
   this as a `democratic deficit' that contravenes the `unwritten' rules of
   democracy. This response argues that automatic assumptions of
   age-related majority rule are frequently based upon a highly flawed grey
   power model and the need to incorporate intergenerational and
   intra-family solidarity, as well as life-cycle factors into these
   debates. This response agrees that older voters are likely to become
   much more important in electoral politics, but not because they will
   vote as a bloc or aggressively pursue material self-interest, but
   because ageing policy challenges may increasingly attain the status of
   valence issues in future elections.},

Abstract = {In the last decade, the feminist movement has pointed out some
   permanence, as well as updates in regard to their struggle claims. Such
   a scenario is within a context of globalization of capital that
   stimulates increasingly inequality in society, as well as in the various
   forms of exploitation. For women, this inequality is expressed in the
   exploitation of their own body, in addition to salary matters. It is
   also associated in perpetuating the values of competition and
   individualism that makes difficult the processes of political
   organization of the different subjects in capitalist society. These
   elements are fundamental to understand the dynamics of organization,
   struggles and challenges imposed on the feminist movement in Latin
   America. In this line, this article's reflection, the result of
   political and academic studies, it is intended to draw a critical
   analysis of the performance of the feminist movement in Latin America
   noting their main struggles, and to point out the current challenges for
   its articulation. The methodology for this analysis was a
   bibliographical study about the subject, amplified by the experiences
   lived in the interior of the feminist movement in Brazil. Therefore, the
   research's results suggest that despite peculiarities and diversities of
   the women's movement in Latin America, we can speak of a Latin American
   feminism. We therefore conclude that this collective identity is shaped
   by the common context of the patriarchal and capitalist society in which
   this collective subject is immersed.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In this article, we use a regression discontinuity design to estimate
   the causal effect of incumbency on campaign contributions in the U. S.
   House and state legislatures. In both settings, incumbency causes
   approximately a 20-25 percentage-point increase in the share of
   donations flowing to the incumbent's party. The effect size does not
   vary with legislator experience and does not appear to depend on
   incumbent office-holder benefits. Instead, as we show, the effect is
   primarily the result of donations from access-oriented interest groups,
   especially donors from industries under heavy regulation and those with
   less ideological ties. Given the role of money in elections, the
   findings suggest that access-oriented interest groups are an important
   driver of the electoral security of incumbents.},

Abstract = {Racism has been in sharp decline in recent decades yet the word, as
   accusation, is used more than ever. The word/idea needs to be more
   restrictively defined and kept for when it is really needed. When almost
   everyone is a racist, no one is. To this end we need to distinguish more
   clearly between the greater comfort people often feel among familiar
   people and places and active hostility towards outsider ethnic groups.
   We also need a more discriminating language to describe the spectrum of
   discrimination. Prejudice, clannishnesseven in some instances
   discrimination itselfshould be regarded as sentiments and behaviours
   that are distinct from proper racism.},

Abstract = {Spatial theories of voting are appealing because they link voters'
   electoral choices to candidates' policy positions. Yet if voters lack
   political sophistication and awareness of candidate positions, they may
   not measure up to the cognitive demands of spatial voting models. Using
   district experts to ascertain House candidates' positions on the same
   liberal-conservative scale as in a survey of constituents, we find that
   proximity voting is common, even among voters unaware of candidates'
   ideological positions. Since voting based on party identification or
   presidential approval often produces votes consistent with the spatial
   model, such alternative decision rules explain this result by serving as
   powerful proxies for proximity voting. In addition, facilitator
   variables such as involvement in politically expert interpersonal
   networks, the ideological difference between candidates, and voters'
   distance from the district ideological cut point help explain proximity
   voting.},

Abstract = {Gaston Bouthoul, even though he is the inventor of the neologism
   ``Polemology{''}, founder of the French Institute of Polemology, pioneer
   of sociology of war and a very talented researcher for the high
   scientifical divulgation, is a little-known and rarely studied
   sociologist. Along the twenties and thirties, when he holds a prominent
   position in the enviromment of Rene Worms, Gaston Richard and the
   International Institue of Sociology, he points their work towards the
   alleged causes of wars, understanding war as another social phenomenon.
   Due to its cyclical or periodical nature, the war-phenomenon approaches
   the biological processes. The 1970s was the golden age of polemology.
   The publication of two journals -Guerres et paix and Etudes
   polemologiques-, several treatises and essays on the sociology of war
   and the development of an international network of contributors helped,
   no doubt, to the scientific institutionalization of polemology. The
   Bouthoul's polemological paradigm eclipses after 1980, coinciding with
   the sociologist's death. In this paper we offer some keys of Bouthoul's
   thought.},

Abstract = {Delli Carpini and Keeter showed that political knowledge is more or less
   general, meaning that informed citizens are usually informed in all
   aspects of political knowledge. Unfortunately, political knowledge is
   not evenly distributed. This is even more problematic when we keep in
   mind that the politically informed are also more politically active. The
   aim of this paper is to find out how informed Slovenians are as citizens
   of a young post-socialist democracy and who is informed. We used data
   from the European Election Study 2009 and performed a simple comparison
   of mean values and a linear regression model. Slovenians turned out to
   be moderately knowledgeable, with higher levels of EU political
   knowledge in comparison to national political knowledge. Slovenians were
   also among the most knowledgeable citizens in the EU member states.
   Differences in the level of knowledge are present between males and
   females, education groups and classes, based on the level of news
   attention and political interest.},

Abstract = {This article explores the multiple challenges President Bill Clinton
   faced when he spoke in Selma, Alabama, at the thirty-fifth anniversary
   commemoration of Bloody Sunday. Given the symbolic weight of Selma
   within public memory, its centrality within U.S. nationalistic
   narratives about equality and Clinton's own personal and political
   persona, the president had to operate within narrow rhetorical
   parameters on this occasion. His response was to both observe and depart
   from norms of presidents' commemorative discourse. An analysis of the
   speech suggests Clinton commemorated Bloody Sunday less than he
   memorialized the U.S. presidency, invigorating memories of its past and
   future power.},

Abstract = {Through documentary research, this paper intends to verify how the Human
   Development Reports (HDRs) strive to build an action and procedures
   agenda for the various countries that form the Latin-American continent.
   Among the main challenges highlighted in the HDRs are those related to
   the distribution of public resources in favor of the segments that live
   in a situation of extreme poverty. Building ways to reach those living
   in situations of deprivation and powerlessness is suggested as the
   central challenge that must be considered in the agenda of developing
   countries. The HDRs have not only discussed some policies to fight
   multidimensional poverty, but also proposed many actions and procedures
   to the State, civil society, NGOs and voluntary groups concerning
   eradication of many forms of deprivation and powerlessness in force on
   the continent., is study aims to verify how the formulators of HDRs deal
   with the difficulties of devolution of income, power and educational,
   professional opportunities and political participation in Latin America.},

Abstract = {In Mexico, President Enrique Pena Nieto's new administration has
   actively passed proposals to reform at least six key policy aspects of
   the country's economic life, arguing that it is moving toward efficient
   government and a new enhanced social orientation dearly needed in that
   society. Using the theoretical framework of the definition of government
   versus governance in political economy and organization, the strengths
   and potential weaknesses of the proposed reforms are put into
   perspective with emphasis on the energy reform passed in August 2013,
   and under discussion in Mexico's Congress until the end of the year. The
   theoretical framework is also useful to make a comparison of the
   proposal with governance structures in oil companies that the Pena Nieto
   administration has mentioned as paradigms for Mexico, namely Petrobras,
   Ecopetrol, and Statoil. With this framework, true economic efficiency
   incentives and welfare sharing under Mexico's proposal can finally be
   delineated.},

   classical paradigm of leadership to a new formula for leading tomorrow's
   organizations. According to the author, the main challenge for
   organizational management today is to facilitate environments that
   inspire and engage people. Essential components of such an environment
   are fairness and transparency, the offering of autonomy, opportunities
   for self-development, and engagement around a purpose beyond merely
   making profits.},

Abstract = {Throughout the Obama Administration, state attorneys general (AGs) have
   collaborated on several high-profile political issues. To get a fuller
   picture of this contemporary AG activism, this article analyzes AG
   participation in lawsuits and amicus curiae briefs before the U.S.
   Supreme Court across three presidential administrations. The results
   suggest that AGs' agendas have increasingly diverged throughout the
   Obama Administration, reflecting greater vertical conflict between AGs
   and the federal government as well as horizontal conflict among AGs
   themselves. Several factors have contributed to this development,
   including the broader polarization of American politics, intensified
   activism among Republican AGs, and increased collaborations between AGs
   and ideological interest groups. Much as with partisan contestation in
   other venues, these AG conflicts show few signs of abating.},

Abstract = {The cultural diversity of the world needs to education for the peace,
   working the values related to the Culture of Peace, like the respect,
   the justice, the equality, the tolerance and the interculturality. The
   fundamental aim of our research is to know and to value how the
   educational centers turn into the most suitable scenes to develop the
   education. For it we have realized a study in a center of Infantile and
   Primary Education of the Autonomous City of Melilla, the College
   Velazquez, with which we try to know the reality that is lived in the
   school centers of the city in the relative to the promotion of the
   Interculturality and the Culture of Peace between the pupils of
   different groups. We have used a qualitative methodology, which has
   allowed us to form a group of discussion with several teachers of
   different professional profiles. As more relevant result stands out than
   the music, in spite of the hourly restrictions that the legislation has
   established for this matter, it is one of the best resources to educate
   in values and to promote the Interculturality and the Culture of Peace.},

Abstract = {This article presents two arguments. The first relates to the relevance
   of citizen participation vis-a-vis the design and implementation of
   public policy. More specifically, the article empirically demonstrates
   how a model of community decentralisation can have a number of practical
   benefits for crisis-management policy. The second argument relates to a
   question that has come to characterise studies of citizen participation
   in public policy. Why is it that there is so much rhetoric in support of
   participation but so little action in terms of the day-to-day realities
   of policy implementation? We place this question in a crisis-management
   context so that we might ask: why is it that crisis-management systems
   built around the principles of community resilience continue to fail on
   these very grounds? We find our answer to this question in state-centric
   governance settings which devolve authority, but do not relinquish it.},

Abstract = {The development of the private sector in Vietnam since the mid-1990s has
   accompanied the emergence of organised business interests, which is
   recognised as vital to pursuing the agenda of economic modernisation.
   This article aims to explore the significance of the interactions
   between the state and business associations representing
   small-and-medium enterprises. It demonstrates that business associations
   have transformed state-business relations in a way that is
   distinguishable from state corporatism or societal pluralism. The
   analysis examines the interplay between state actors and emerging
   non-state entities, and the deliberative capacity of intermediary
   organisations in the policy-making process, specifically through the
   Vietnam Association of Small and Medium Enterprises. It is argued that
   this process constitutes a new mode of political participation that
   reflects the entanglement of the state and private capital interests. It
   reveals features of contained participation and contributes to the
   research agenda on deliberative and governance practices in
   post-socialist transitional economies.},

Abstract = {The diffusion of digital media allows the emergence of new types of
   relations between grassroots campaigners and organisers. This article
   presents the results of a comparative qualitative study of two Italian
   cases of grassroots online participation: a local electoral campaign and
   a single-issue social movement. The first case is `Tell your Milano', a
   project that took place during the electoral campaign for Mayor of Milan
   in the spring of 2011. The second case is the `Purple People' (Popolo
   Viola), an Italian social movement started in 2009 to demand the
   resignation of the Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi. The article
   introduces the concept of a `grassroots orchestra': a grassroots
   campaign aimed at a short-term objective, coordinated by a
   non-grassroots political actor and performed by a community sharing a
   uniform and coherent context.},

Abstract = {Before 1914 it was common opinion that in a more and more civilized
   world, war would disappear. International violence was largely
   considered a mistake simply avoidable by reason and political skill.
   This optimistic opinion was to be questioned first by a warmongering
   culture that celebrated violence; and later by the explosion of the war
   among the most civilized European States. In this situation, most of the
   pacifists abandoned their ideas declaring war historically necessary or
   politically opportune. Just a few European intellectuals opposed the
   conflict searching for a new pacifistic rhetoric and new arguments
   against war. The essay deals with this searching during the first part
   of the war, i.e. 1914 and 1915, when the defeat of peace and of any
   pacifist ideas seemed complete.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the social bases underpinning the widely different
   trajectories of nuclear energy policies across Western European
   countries. Employing a set of surveys carried out in the last thirty
   years, it examines the conditional effects of ideology and geographical
   proximity to a nuclear power plant on attitudes toward nuclear energy,
   as well as the long- and short-term dynamics of belief updating after
   the occurrence of major accidents. Results highlight how proximity can
   strengthen, weaken or have no effect on the ideological component of
   these attitudes. Moreover, the publics of most countries with experience
   in nuclear energy display the traits of Bayesian dynamics of belief
   updating, especially in the vicinity of a plant. The article also shows
   the fairly exceptional traits of French public opinion. In conclusion,
   the broad social constraints within which governments operate, across
   time and space, shed light on the different policy trajectories of
   European countries.},

Abstract = {I examine the hypothesis that race affects citizens' perceptions of
   candidates' ideologies. In the past, systematic tests of this hypothesis
   have relied almost entirely on data drawn from experiments. While
   experimental research designs have contributed much to the analysis of
   political stereotypes and heuristics, the extent to which experimental
   research on this hypothesis is externally valid is open to question.
   Moreover, experimental approaches are not well-suited to estimating the
   magnitude of the effects of stereotypes in real-world situations,
   especially in the context of complex political phenomena such as
   election campaigns. In this article, I develop a statistical model of
   the effects of race on perceptions of candidates' ideologies and
   estimate the model using data on incumbent candidates from the American
   National Election Studies. The results suggest that, ceteris paribus,
   white citizens will tend to perceive black candidates to be more liberal
   than ideologically similar white candidates. In contrast, the
   perceptions of black respondents are not affected by the race of
   candidates, although black respondents' perceptions are more strongly
   correlated with candidates' positions on issues of particular interest
   to minorities than the perceptions of white respondents. I discuss the
   implications of these findings with respect to descriptive
   representation in the United States, the accountability of office
   holders, and the study of voting behavior.},

Abstract = {While complementary in many ways, the cartel and the conditional party
   government (CPG) theories of legislative party power have disparate
   expectations for the stability of the majority party's negative agenda
   control. Cartel theorists contend that negative agenda control is
   relatively constant over time, while CPG proponents suggest that this
   type of veto power varies with intra-party preference cohesion and
   inter-party preference distinction. In this article, we enter this
   debate by considering an alternative and under-explored indicator of
   negative agenda control: participation in discharge petition efforts.
   Our findings demonstrate the instability of the majority party's ability
   to control discharge efforts, with majority party (co)sponsors showing a
   significantly greater likelihood of waffling' during periods of stronger
   party unity and more vigorous leadership power.},

Abstract = {Human beings are social animals. Life in society requires individuals to
   modulate their behavior accordingly to the norms that rule social
   contexts. Despite being generally sanctioned, violence remains a major
   issue worldwide. Advances in neuroscience and molecular biology are
   shedding new light on the biological mechanisms that underlie poor
   inhibitory control in impulsive aggression and the lack of empathy and
   emotional resonance in predatory violence. The increase in
   neuroscientific knowledge on the biological underpinnings of impulse
   control, moral judgment and social behavior may contribute to a wider
   understanding of the notion of free-will and responsibility. Here, we
   briefly discuss novel findings on the neurobiological correlates of
   aggressive and antisocial behavior and their potential ethical, forensic
   and political implications.},

Abstract = {The literature on the determinants of democratization has long been
   dominated by a view that claimed a central role for economic development
   ('modernization'). Acemoglu et al. (2008, 2009) have recently challenged
   the robustness of empirical support for the modernization hypothesis. As
   an alternative, they claim that democratization is likely to occur in
   moments of economic crisis. Bruckner and Ciccone (2011) appear to offer
   strong support for this latter view, and claim that lagged adverse GDP
   shocks generated by poor rainfall generate `windows of opportunity' for
   democratization in contemporary Sub-Saharan Africa. The current article
   presents evidence that Bruckner and Ciccone's provocative finding does
   not survive several sensible robustness checks, calling into question
   whether their claim in fact offers new insights into the process of
   democratization.},

Abstract = {This article examines how House candidates used Twitter during the 2012
   campaign. Using a content analysis of every tweet from each candidate
   for the House in the final two months before the 2012 election, this
   study provides a snapshot of House candidates' ``Twitter style.{''} In
   particular, this article shows that incumbents, Democrats, women, and
   those in competitive races tweet differently than challengers,
   Republicans, minor party candidates, men, and those in safe districts.},

Abstract = {Inside the European Parliament political groups reveal levels of voting
   cohesion similar to that we observe in national parliaments. Faced with
   a conflict of interests between their national party and their European
   group, members of the European Parliament (MEPs) surprisingly often
   prioritize the latter principal over the former. In this article, I
   argue that domestic-level parliamentary scrutiny can have a tremendous
   impact on MEPs' loyalties. Using data on the voting behaviour of German
   and Czech MEPs, I find that, under scrutiny, MEPs from governing parties
   are significantly more likely to vote against the instructions of their
   group leadership. The effect of domestic-level scrutiny on MEPs from
   opposition parties is weaker and depends on the dossier's political
   salience. These results provide further support for the strategic use of
   parliamentary scrutiny in European Union politics.},

Abstract = {Numerous studies have found that elite and popular preferences influence
   decision making on the U.S. Supreme Court; yet, uncertainty remains
   about when, how, and why the Court is constrained by external pressure.
   I argue the justices are constrained, at least in part, because they
   fear nonimplementation of their decisions. I test this theory by
   utilizing a recent study of judicial power, which finds the Court enjoys
   greater implementation power in ``vertical{''} cases (those involving
   criminal and civil liability) than in ``lateral{''} cases (all others;
   e.g., those involving schools or government agencies). I find that Court
   constraint is strongest in important lateral cases-those cases in which
   implementation depends on support from nonjudicial actors. My findings
   suggest that Supreme Court constraint is driven by the justices' fear of
   nonimplementation and is, therefore, dependent on institutional context.},

Abstract = {Drawing from extensive fieldwork and a rich literature on policy
   dynamics, I offer a preliminary comparative analysis of the policy
   process in Qatar and Kuwait focusing mainly on the participants. I
   assess the broad outlines of politics and power in decision-making
   processes in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) while suggesting means
   of making them more efficient, representative, and responsive to the
   needs of citizens. This is the first academic article investigating
   similarities and differences through a systematic analysis of the policy
   participants in these two countries and their role in the policy-making
   process; few studies analyze comparatively the dynamics of policy making
   in the GCC. Considering the emerging need for governments to develop and
   implement better processes and increase public participation in
   government decisions as the result of the Arab revolutions, this article
   provides recommendations for Qatar and Kuwait, with potential
   application in the region.},

Abstract = {Despite political support and reiterated calls for re-industrialization,
   the German model (defined as a strong industry backed by the banking
   sector; greater cooperation between trade unions, the government and
   corporate boards; an export-driven economy) has remained unachievable in
   France. The industrial sector and exports have been receding since the
   1970s; industrial relations have deteriorated and the `National
   champions' policy (that is, picking winners, for example, Airbus, or
   creating them via mergers, subsidizing large-scale pivotal industries,
   for example, IT Plan of 1968, coal and steel industries) was abandoned
   in the 1980s. Did that vacuum let the British model slowly take root in
   France? Are France and the United Kingdom heading toward greater
   convergence, or do elements of differentiation remain? This article
   argues that despite some changes to a more liberal political economy in
   France, British-modelled `active' labor policies, and a shift to
   international and financial capitalism remains stronger in France than
   in the United Kingdom. The current crises help highlight persistent
   differences.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical account of suffrage extensions from a
   specific perspective: the strategic role of the middle class in the
   struggle for political power. Extensions are analyzed as a game among
   three players: the elite, the middle class, and the poor. To thwart the
   threat presented by the poor, the elite had to cede economic and
   political power to the middle class, who in turn might have an interest
   in extending suffrage further, either immediately or in some future.
   Whether suffrage was extended to the poor in one step or first only to
   the middle class depended on state's capacity to repress and the
   strength of the middle class, along with some economic variables.
   Consistent with this theory, empirical results show that suffrage
   extensions did not reduce rebellious activity, but rather that economic
   growth and military power are strong predictors of decreases in the
   number of rebellions.},

Abstract = {This article tries to identify the conditions under which international
   policy diffusion occurs, focusing on networks among states. In the
   existing policy diffusion literature, `networks' have recently attracted
   the attention of scholars. Using Agent-Based Simulation, we consider the
   question of whether a new policy diffuses more widely in a community
   with dense networks or in a community with sparse networks. Our results
   show that denser networks do not always lead to more diffusion.
   Moreover, we find that `network structure', namely whether easily
   affected states are connected to innovators, greatly determines the
   outcome of policy diffusion. Conducting a deductive thought-experiment
   rather than inductive (mainly statistical) analysis, our research
   presents a counter-intuitive result concerning the effects of network
   density on policy diffusion. In addition, we make a contribution to the
   methodology of international relations by attempting to bridge the unit-
   and system-levels.},

Title = {21st century politics: New faces/new spaces},
Journal = {AUSTRALASIAN PARLIAMENTARY REVIEW},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Politics has been described as a man's game and a man's place. Further,
   the design of houses of politics also embeds this dominant masculine
   ethos. Traditional Chambers have been large with only limited seating
   arrangements ensuring that only privileged elite can participate and
   both officials and the public are located at some distance and separate
   from the elected officials. Such a Chamber ensures that Members of
   Parliament (MPs) need to face each other and the dominant interaction is
   adversarial. Within this system however, women have been able to carve
   out new spaces, or use existing ones in different ways, to become more
   involved with the mechanisms of parliament and provide alternative
   routes to leadership. In doing so, they have introduced elements of the
   private domain (nurturing, dialogue and inclusion) to the public domain.
   The way in which space is used is fundamental and its treatment has
   consequences for individuals, organizations and societies (Clegg and
   Kornberger 2006). Dale's (2005) work emphasises the social character of
   architecture, which recognises the impact that it has on the behaviours
   of individuals and nowhere is this more pertinent than the way the
   Australian Parliament House operates.
   This paper draws on the experiences of Australian parliamentarians to
   examine the way in which the new Australian Parliament House shapes the
   way in which the Australian political cultural norms and practices are
   shaped and maintained. It also seeks to explore the way the Members of
   Parliament experience these spaces and how some MPs have been able to
   bring new ways of utilising the space to ensure it is more accommodating
   to the men and women who inhabit this building at the apex of
   Australia's political life. In doing so, such MPs are seeking to ensure
   that the practices and processes of Australia's political system are
   reflective of the men and women who inhabit this national institution at
   the beginning of the 21st century.},

Abstract = {This article presents the first investigation of whether and how party
   identification is influenced by direct democratic institutions. The
   concept of party identification is of central interest to political
   science. Despite declining partisan attachment and increasing
   dealignment among voters, little systematic evidence exists as to which
   factors influence individual party identification. Our article
   contributes to improving on this lacuna by considering the educative
   effects of direct democratic institutions. Theoretically, two competing
   hypotheses are plausible. On the one hand, direct democracy might
   strengthen political parties and promote the need for cues so that
   voters succumb to the allure of partisan attachment. On the other hand,
   direct democracy might provide an alternative to the representational
   function of political parties thus rendering party identification less
   essential. Drawing on recent data from the Swiss cantons, we estimate
   multi-level models. Our analyses, though giving support to the
   alternative hypothesis, yield some surprising findings.},

Abstract = {Politics in the Council is Janus-faced. There is bargaining with
   identifiable winners and losers, yet the voting records show high levels
   of agreement. These two sides have almost exclusively been studied in
   isolation even though standard theoretical models of voting typically
   assume that actors' behaviour is guided by their positions relative to
   the proposal and the status quo. By combining positional data and voting
   data, we evaluate to what extent voting is driven by salience-weighted
   issue-specific positions. Our results show that governments' voting
   behaviour is guided by their issue-specific positions. The relationship
   between preference-based positions and votes is stronger when we impute
   values for the missing positions in the positional data. This
   illustrates the importance of cautious treatment of missing data in EU
   decision-making.},

Title = {Revolving door lobbyists and interest representation},
Journal = {INTEREST GROUPS \& ADVOCACY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {4-29},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Although experience inside the halls of power afford lobbyists valuable
   political, policy and procedural skills that can improve the
   deliberative process, it also gives them privileged access to former
   employers that others do not have. Washington's revolving door evokes
   legitimate ethical concerns, such as when former legislators resign
   their seats to take lucrative jobs representing the very industries they
   regulate. However, social scientists know surprisingly little about the
   revolving door beyond such sensational, albeit important, cases. To shed
   more light on the broader phenomenon, we systematically explore the
   revolving door on a large scale to answer a simple question: Do
   revolving door lobbyists represent different interests than conventional
   lobbyists? If, as revolving door proponents imply, these lobbyists work
   on behalf of organized interests solely for their specialized
   subject-matter expertise, then we would expect them to represent
   clienteles that are no different than conventional lobbyists.
   Alternatively, if they represent a wider variety of economic interests
   than conventional lobbyists then we assume they are hired more for their
   ability to get a foot in the door than to serve as policy expert
   adjuncts to government. Using evidence from original data on the
   professional biographies of roughly 1600 registered lobbyists - which we
   link to data from almost 50 000 quarterly Lobbying Disclosure Act
   reports - we expose a significant transparency loophole in the law.
   Because lobbyists are not required to continuously disclose their
   `covered official' status - the statutory definition of revolving door -
   periodic lobbying disclosure reports effectively hide the revolving door
   from public scrutiny. Instead, we rely on our more comprehensive
   information on lobbyists' connections to previous employers to more
   accurately measure the size and scope of Washington's revolving door,
   and to investigate how these connections affect which interests they
   represent. We find that revolving door lobbyists have worked mostly in
   Congress, tend to work as contract lobbyists rather than in-house
   government-relations staff and are more likely to specialize in lobbying
   for appropriations earmarks. Then, after controlling for a variety of
   lobbying specializations, we show that former members of Congress are no
   more likely than other lobbyists to attract a more economically diverse
   set of clients than their conventional-lobbyist counterparts. However,
   congressional staffers who had worked their way up the organizational
   ladder on Capitol Hill do. We infer that well-connected congressional
   staffers who spin through the revolving door sell access to key decision
   makers in Congress, not their industry-or issue-specific technical or
   substantive expertise. Simply, the revolving door problem is not limited
   to a handful of headline-catching former legislators, is much bigger
   than the existing lobbying disclosure regime reveals and most
   importantly - significantly distorts the representation of interests
   before government. The practical implications are clear: lobbying
   transparency rules, cooling-off periods and other restrictions are
   insufficient disincentives. Interest group demand for access is simply
   too strong. We advocate enhancing lobbying transparency by expanding the
   statutory definitions of lobbying activities, requiring lobbyists to
   disclose more details about government employment and shifting some of
   the disclosure burden to democratically accountable government officials
   themselves.},

Abstract = {The relationship between American political thought (APT) and American
   political development (APD) as phenomena as well as subfields in
   American Politics has not been sufficiently theorized. This essay takes
   up what I call the Second Founding of 1787-89 as the critical case for
   examining the close relationship between APT and APD. The statesmen of
   that era were thinkers and developmentalists of the first order; they
   understood the inseparable link between political justification and
   political change. This dynamic relationship between American political
   thought and development practiced in 1787-89 can be used as a blueprint
   for understanding the entwined cycles of political justification and
   change in American politics.},

Title = {Party brands and voting},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {33},
Pages = {153-165},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Some scholars argue that Western societies have seen a decreasing impact
   of voting behavior based on cleavages and party identifications.
   Equally, issue ownership voting is seemingly not increasing its
   relevance by filling this gap. From this departure we seek out an
   alternative variable by posing the question: Do party brands influence
   voting behavior? Currently, we do not know because the two research
   fields of voting behavior and party brands are currently not explicitly
   linked. Traditionally, the study of voting behavior has gained powerful
   insights from concepts such as cleavage structure, party identification
   and issue ownership. On the other hand, the study of political brands
   has illuminated how people employ brands in their identity construction
   and how voters use party brands to differentiate between political
   parties. In this light, the article first distinguishes the brand
   concept from related heuristics and voting models. Next, the article
   measures the brand value of Danish parties by utilizing a representative
   association analysis. Finally, this measure is used to conduct the very
   first empirical analysis of a party brand's effect on voting behavior.
   Overall, the primary finding demonstrates that political brand value
   (PBV) has an effect on voting behavior also when a number of other
   relevant explanatory variables are held constant. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The persistence of policy switcheswhereby presidents renege on campaign
   promises shortly after winning elections30 years after Latin America's
   redemocratization defies established notions of democratic
   representation, and poses a puzzle to analysts and voters alike. In this
   article, I advance current explanations for switches, by arguing they
   can only be understood in the context of currency booms and crises,
   typical of Latin American economies after their reintegration into world
   finance in the 1970s. To test my propositions empirically, I examine
   elections held in the region between 1978 and 2006 and find evidence
   consistent with the claim that switches are more likely to occur in
   periods of dollar scarcity, when the need to attract financial capital
   to the economy pushes leftist presidents into adopting policies opposed
   to the programs they announced during campaign.},

Abstract = {This article explores the paradox of constructive ambiguity. Based on a
   focused, longitudinal comparison of the European Union's energy and
   defence policies, it analyses the role played by strategies of ambiguity
   in European integration. Ambiguity is found to be an attractive strategy
   for political entrepreneurs when member state preferences are
   heterogeneous and the EU's legal basis is weak. It is likely to be
   effective, however, only if it is embedded in an institutional
   opportunity structure - that is, a formal-legal context - that
   entrepreneurs can fold into their strategic repertoire of ideas. While
   ambiguity can be strategic in circumstances where clarity would create
   strong opposition, it is not sufficient to entrench a European policy if
   it does not rest on an institutional basis. This suggests that European
   political entrepreneurs should be wary of relying on coalition building
   by ambiguity only.},

Abstract = {The European Commission has promised to promote decent work in the
   African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries through pro-poor direct
   investment and livelihood-creating trade deals. Aligning with the
   discourse of the International Labour Organisation, the European
   Commission seeks to achieve fair globalisation' in which economic growth
   is translated into decent jobs. Applying a moral economy perspective,
   however, the article argues that there is a disjuncture between the
   norms espoused under the Decent Work Agenda and the tangible
   implications of European interventions in ACP economies. Specifically,
   Economic Partnership Agreements will have deleterious consequences for
   the lives of many poorer producers and workers in ACP countries. The
   provision of Aid for Trade for decent work, moreover, may not deliver
   meaningful decent work opportunities in ACP countries. In this analysis,
   the article explores the emergent normativity-outcomes gap in this
   sphere of European Union external relations.},

Abstract = {Following the stagnation of negotiations with the African, Caribbean and
   Pacific states, the centrepiece of the European Union's (EU's) trade and
   development strategy has been a reform of the Generalised System of
   Preferences. Although policy-makers in the Commission's Directorate
   General for Trade have argued they are refocusing' these preferences on
   the neediest', by rendering a significant proportion of emerging
   economies' exports ineligible for the scheme, this article argues that
   the reform is actually part of a broader reciprocity' agenda being
   pursued in the context of the current economic crisis. This is about
   ensuring the EU possesses sufficient offensive leverage in ongoing free
   trade agreement negotiations, rather than representing any mercantilist
   move towards greater domestic protection. In arguing that the EU's
   developmental trade agenda is increasingly subordinated to commercial
   imperatives, this article adds to a literature that has situated the
   study of EU trade and development policy within the field of political
   economy.},

   the Canadian Arctic: An Institutionalist Perspective},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {43-61},
Abstract = {One of the most exciting developments in Canadian federalism has been
   the emergence of Aboriginal self-governing regions. This paper
   constructs a theoretical framework for exploring the evolution of
   intra-jurisdictional relations in the self-governing Inuit regions of
   the Canadian Arctic. Intra-jurisdictional relations in these regions are
   characterized by a unique set of relationships between elected
   governments and organizations that represent the beneficiaries of
   land-claims agreements. Using the literature on historical
   institutionalism, we argue that the nature of Inuit intra-jurisdictional
   relations following the establishment of self-government can be
   explained by the institutional choices made prior to the signing of
   land-claims agreements and/or self-government agreements. To illustrate
   the potential of our framework for analysing Inuit intra-jurisdictional
   relations, we briefly examine the experiences of Nunavut, an
   Inuit-dominated region and the newest territory in the Canadian
   federation.},

Pages = {459-484},
Abstract = {The dynamics of, first, modernity, and, later, globalization have
   generated conditions and stimuli for the expansion of Islam. Patterns of
   emigration have seen millions of Muslims become part of the West. Global
   political and cultural tendencies include a `rebellion' or resistance
   from some traditional Muslims to preexisting cultural traditions in
   these places of insertion, exemplified in Europe in practices such as
   the use of the veil or hijab. Developments within Islamic territories
   themselves have included an increased participation in Islamist
   movements. These trends have generated reactions including a Western
   `fear of the other' in regard to Islamism. One manifestation of this
   fear has been the erection of barriers to migration, constituting what
   we choose to denominate here as teichopolitics: The attempt of
   controlling the persons' flow by means of the raising of physical
   barriers, be they barbed-wired fences of walls, with the aim to impede
   the exit and entry to a territory. This securitized response however
   runs the risk of feeding resentment from Islamist groups in a
   counterproductive manner.},

Abstract = {It is well established that for Alexis de Tocqueville the future of
   democracy is contingent. This essay argues that in his oft-neglected
   report on the penitentiary system in America, Tocqueville bears witness
   to one of these futures-a dystopic democracy in which the essential
   bulwarks of liberty have been stripped away, leaving behind perfect
   equality but also perfect servitude Specifically, the penitentiaries
   deprive prisoners of their basic religious freedoms, attack their habits
   of association, and subject them to the tyranny of public opinion
   through the rigorous but mild disciplinary regime of the warden. By
   presenting a tangible imaginative of democratic equality taken to its
   limits, Tocqueville encourages his readers to heed his later
   recommendations for the maintenance of institutions and practices
   without which freedom is, at best, contingent.},

Abstract = {Unlike his theory of justice as fairness, John Rawls's political
   liberalism has generally been spared from critiques regarding what is
   due to the disabled. This paper demonstrates that, due to the account of
   the basic ideas of society and persons provided by Rawls, political
   liberalism requires that the interests of numerous individuals with
   disabilities should be put aside when the most fundamental issues of
   justice are settled. The aim is to accommodate within public reason the
   due concern for the disabled while upholding political liberalism. To
   achieve this aim, a revision of the basic ideas of persons and society
   is proposed. The idea of persons should be regarded as more fundamental
   than that of social cooperation, and persons should be defined in terms
   of minimal moral powers.},

Journal = {TEORIA Y REALIDAD CONSTITUCIONAL},

Pages = {99-140},
Abstract = {The UE is founded on a set of values which are mentioned in an explicit
   manner in Art. 2 of the TEU: respect for human dignity, freedom,
   democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights.
   Values which the same article states that are common to the Member
   States. Until now, the protection of these fundamental values is based
   on the mechanism foreseen in Art. 7 of the TEU. The existence of this
   mechanism though has not prevented the violation of these fundamental
   values by several of the Member States from taking place. This is why
   this article proposes the establishing of a new mechanism - the
   ``Copenhagen mechanism{''} - which would be able to monitor the
   performance of the Member States on a permanent basis in order to
   prevent the violations from taking place, but which would also be able
   to impose the most serious penalties to the most serious violations of
   these fundamental values, including the expulsion of the UE.},

Abstract = {This article applies neuroscience and Borderlands theory to reveal how
   unconscious bias currently stabilizes suppressive policing practices in
   America despite new efforts at reform. Illustrative cases are offered
   from Oakland and Santa Barbara, California, with a focus on civil gang
   injunctions (CGIs) and youth gang suppression. Theoretical analysis of
   these cases reveals how the unconscious biases of validity illusions and
   framing effects operate despite the best intentions of law enforcement
   personnel. Such unconscious or implicit biases create contradictions
   between the stated beliefs and actions of law enforcement. In turn,
   these unintended self-contradictions then work to the detriment of
   Latino and Black boys. The analysis here also extends to how unconscious
   biases and unintended selfcontradictions can influence municipal
   policymaking in favor of suppressive police tactics such as CGIs,
   thereby displacing evidence-based policies that are proven to be far
   more effective. The article concludes with brief discussion of some of
   the means by which the unconscious biases - effects to which everyone is
   involuntarily prone -can be disrupted.},

Abstract = {Following the end of NATO `Operation Unified Protector' in Libya there
   has been an intense debate in the international community with respect
   to the impact of the military engagement on both the emerging
   `responsibility to protect' (R2P) norm as well as on the international
   community's commitment to enforce it. The study examines the impact of
   the international military intervention in Libya on this debate by
   looking at whether Operation Unified Protector contributed to
   strengthening or weakening the development of R2P. To do so, it first
   examines whether the authorization to use force in Libya was indeed
   grounded on R2P, as well as whether it was perceived as such by the
   international community. Secondly, the research examines whether the
   intervening parties' actual use of force was consistent with R2P.
   Finally, the research provides an assessment of the current state of R2P
   post-Libya.},

Abstract = {In low-information elections, voters are likely to rely on heuristics
   when choosing candidates. Based on survey experiments conducted prior to
   Brazil's 2012 municipal elections, I examine the effect of candidates'
   professional titles, such as ``doctor{''} and ``pastor,{''} on voting
   behavior. Using the ``pastor{''} title in one's electoral name tends to
   decrease vote intention, although evangelical Christians respond
   positively while members of other religious groups are repelled. The
   broader atmosphere of political competition between Brazilian
   evangelicals and Catholics helps explain the presence of both out-group
   and in-group cueing effects. The ``doctor{''} title has a positive
   effect on vote intention that appears to be mediated by the positive
   stereotypes, such as intelligence and competence, associated with
   members of this profession.},

   Minorities Summary},
Journal = {SECURITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {361-369},
Abstract = {In 2014 Ukraine conducted two national elections against a backdrop of
   political upheaval and a separatist conflict in which national minority
   concerns were voiced by some parties. In the context of the election
   process, reports by international observers did not reflect
   discrimination against national minorities as voters or candidates.
   However, a dearth of candidates campaigning as national minorities or
   including national minority issues in their platforms was observed, and
   can be traced to peculiarities of the legal framework that disadvantage
   smaller and compact political forces. It was observed that candidates of
   various national minority backgrounds may campaign and win elections,
   but few declare themselves to be representing the interest of a national
   minority. This was true for both the proportional and simple majority
   races during the parliamentary elections, in which only five candidates
   campaigning as national minority representatives were elected to
   parliament. Ultimately the main issue for national minorities in
   Ukraine's political process is not one of discrimination, but the
   realistic opportunity for robust representation and advocacy of their
   communities' concerns at the national level.},

Title = {Laneside, Then Left a Bit? Britain's Secret Political Talks with
   Loyalist Paramilitaries in Northern Ireland, 1973-1976},
Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {298-317},
Abstract = {This article examines talks that took place between British government
   officials and loyalist paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland at a
   critical moment in the most recent Troubles. In particular, this article
   describes talks that took place secretly at the Northern Ireland
   Office's `Laneside' building, a secluded suburban house used by British
   diplomats and MI6 officers on the shores of Belfast Lough between 1971
   and 1976. Drawing on both recently released archive material as well as
   interviews with those who worked at and visited Laneside, this article
   explores what went on at these talks and analyses their outcomes from
   three different perspectives. This article demonstrates that the most
   accurate perspective from which to view what occurred in these meetings
   is neither top-down (government led) nor bottom-up (paramilitary led),
   but one that looks at what went on there as part of a conversation which
   both sets of participants for a time found useful. For the loyalists,
   Laneside had a role as a venue to think about strategy (rather than
   negotiate ends). For the British these were conversations that were
   useful in furnishing their understanding of loyalism, and as a place
   where policies could be explained and problems better understood.
   Looking at what occurred at Laneside as a semi-autonomous governmental
   body in Northern Ireland reveals key insights into both the loyalist
   paramilitaries' political ideas as well as the aims of British policy in
   Northern Ireland. Furthermore, this middle perspective holds a mirror up
   to the more familiar talks then occurring between the very same British
   officials and the Provisional IRA.},

Abstract = {Justifications for war often invoke reputational or social aspirations:
   the need to protect national honor, status, reputation for resolve,
   credibility, and respect. Studies of these motives struggle with a
   variety of challenges: their primary empirical manifestation consists of
   beliefs, agents have incentives to misrepresent these beliefs, their
   logic is context specific, and they meld intrinsic and instrumental
   motives. To help overcome these challenges, this review offers a general
   conceptual framework that integrates their strategic, cultural, and
   psychological logics. We summarize important findings and open
   questions, including (a) whether leaders care about their reputations
   and status, (b) how to address the tension between instrumental and
   intrinsic motives, (c) how observers draw inferences, (d) to whom and
   across what contextual breadth these inferences apply, and (e) how these
   relate to domestic audience costs. Many important, tractable questions
   remain for future studies to answer.},

Abstract = {By means of del Rio Prada v. Spain judgment, the ECHR Grand Chamber has
   consolidated its flexible approach regarding the distinction between
   penalties and measures relating to their execution; the Court has also
   established clearly that while the States are free to determine their
   own criminal policy, they must comply with the unconditionally
   prohibition of retrospective application of the criminal law. In its
   turn, the Audiencia Nacional has resorted to an expeditious execution
   procedure of the judgment whose legal foundations are far from clear.
   Due to the significance of the case, some sectors have given way to the
   temptation to criticize both the judgment and the Court itself, common
   attitude also to other countries and that can be explained but not
   justified on account of the impact that the ECHR decisions may have on
   especially sensitive areas of national law; however, in the face of a
   condemnation judgment, the solution is not in discrediting the messenger
   but in strengthening the dialogue amongst Courts.},

Volume = {76},
Number = {1},
Pages = {86-97},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {According to traditional arguments, judicial review is a legitimate
   element of representative government because it allows decisions about
   individual rights to be made in a venue more insulated from electoral
   pressure than are legislative institutions. The hope is that this
   insulation helps generate better outcomes than would a system of
   legislative supremacy. The relevance of this outcome-oriented
   perspective has been challenged on four main grounds: majoritarian,
   participatory, disagreement-based, and methodological. The first two
   contend that judicial review is procedurally illegitimate, while the
   second two argue that we should assess judicial review on procedural
   grounds. We show that none of these arguments undermine the traditional
   insulation-based and outcome-oriented approach to the question of
   judicial review's legitimacy.},

Journal = {SECURITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {370-382},
Abstract = {In the international arena there are some encouraging developments in
   relation to accountability and transparency for the use of armed drones.
   It is increasingly recognized that remote pilotless aircraft have become
   part of modern warfare, and that sometimes they are also used outside
   the context of armed conflict. Subsequently, both international
   humanitarian and human rights law can apply. The issue of access to
   justice, however, receives less explicit socio-political attention.
   Victims of armed remote pilotless aircraft strikes meet countless
   challenges in effectuating their right to an effective remedy. Often
   even a formal recognition that a strike has taken place is lacking.
   Furthermore, the states involved fail to publicly release information
   about their own investigations. This makes it difficult for those
   affected to substantiate their status as a victim and seek justice,
   including reparations. The international community should, in addition
   to urging involved states to independently and impartially investigate
   all armed drone strikes, ensure that access to an effective remedy for
   civilian victims, whether on an international, transnational or national
   level, becomes a reality.},

Abstract = {In order to encircle the German Reich in the period from the 1880s to
   World War I, Britain's strategies included the inciting of war itself to
   defeat the growing might of Germany. It used all financial, military,
   and political means simply because Germany had emerged as an economic
   challenger to British hegemony. Mr Engdahl's understanding of that
   history and how tragic it was for the world prompted him to write Target
   China (Engdahl 2013) as he realized that a very similar strategy has
   been adopted by the West, with Washington today replacing London,
   against the emergence of a sovereign Chinese economic great power. In
   the context of his book, Mr Engdahl shares his views on some significant
   issues of the contemporary world geopolitical situation in this

Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {207-227},
Abstract = {The content of African maritime security as an emerging policy field is
   contested. It can be located anywhere between traditional security
   politics (related to piracy, maritime terrorism and unregulated
   fishing), developmental and environmentalist concerns, and efforts to
   regain economic sovereignty over African territorial and offshore
   waters. As a result, since approximately 2005 the institutional place of
   maritime security in continental politics has been in flux. This article
   traces the origins of the debate on maritime security in Africa. The
   main concern here is to examine the relationship between the nascent
   African Peace and Security Architecture on the one hand and maritime
   security and safety politics on the other from both an institutional and
   a political perspective. Maritime security represents one of a number of
   peace and security related policy fields in the making that also allows
   for insights into the division of labor emerging among various
   stakeholders, such as the African Union Commission, Regional Economic
   Communities, and African Union member states, and into the related
   challenges of policy coordination and harmonization.},

Title = {Ethiopian customary dispute resolution mechanisms: Forms of restorative
   justice?},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {125-154},
Abstract = {The customary dispute resolution mechanisms of Ethiopia are playing an
   important role in resolving crimes of any kind and maintaining peace and
   stability in the community though they are not recognised by law and not
   properly organised. The customary dispute resolution mechanisms are run
   by elders; involve reconciliation of the conflicting parties and their
   respective families using different customary rituals where needed;
   emphasise the restitution of victims and reintegration of offenders; and
   aim at restoring the previous peaceful relationship within the community
   as well as maintaining their future peaceful relationships by avoiding
   the culturally accepted practices of revenge. However, despite the fact
   that Ethiopia's indigenous knowledge base of customary justice practice
   has the enormous advantage of implementing the ideals of restorative
   justice, restorative justice has not yet taken root in the criminal
   justice system of Ethiopia. This article examines the legal, de jure,
   and factual, de facto, jurisdictions of Ethiopian customary dispute
   resolution mechanisms in resolving criminal matters, and explores
   whether they are compatible with the core values and principles of
   restorative justice. Based on the analysis of the relevant legislations,
   literature in restorative justice and customary dispute resolution
   mechanisms, and interviews, it is found that Ethiopian customary dispute
   resolution mechanisms are compatible with the values and principles of
   restorative justice. Hence, it is argued that the customary mechanisms
   of Ethiopia can be used as a basis to develop restorative justice
   programmes if they are properly institutionalised and sufficient legal
   recognition is provided for their functioning.},

Journal = {TEMAS Y DEBATES},

Abstract = {This communication attempts to analyse the implications of Niccolo
   Machiavelli's thoughts as pictured in The Prince and how these remain
   valid nowadays. The author's starting point is the question about why
   violence is necessary for the survival of a political regime.
   The article also analyses the importance that violence has as States'
   specific means. Special attention is paid to the attributes of the
   sovereign-subject relation and therefore, the importance of the monopoly
   of violence by the ruler is explained. The author attempts to expose the
   persistence of repression as politics' decisive element. Also, special
   attention is paid to the conditions that should regulate violence usage
   by States for it to serve governments' purposes. Finally, the tension
   between States and democratization is explored.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I begin a preliminary exploration of the ways in which
   neo-Roman republicanism, organized as it is around the twin notions of
   free person and free state, might contribute to the ongoing conversation
   about the ethics of migration. I extrapolate and sketch distinctively
   republican responses to the following migration-related issues:
   refugees, resident non-citizens, international freedom of movement and
   state rights to exclude would-be immigrants. I indicate areas where I
   think republicans are on the strongest ground, areas where
   republicanism's contribution is limited and areas where republicans face
   important dilemmas. I examine how these dilemmas might be addressed from
   within republican theory. The aim is to reflect upon the ethics of
   migration through the lens of the neo-Roman conception of political
   liberty, to see what we learn both about enduring questions in the
   ethics of migration and about the appeal of contemporary republicanism
   as a political theory.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the essay by R. H. Moreno-Duran De la barbarie a la
   imaginacion (1976) considering the proposal as a critical contribution
   to the tradition of the possibility of inquiring from literature in
   Latin American cultural identity. With this objetive, De la barbarie a
   la imaginacion has been approached from a perspective wich places it as
   a critical operation in the tradition of Latin American essays. The
   critical operation proposed by Moreno-Duran involves recognizing
   imaginary projection through which Latin America has been built as a
   narrative process. In analizing this operation has been thought not only
   aesthetic matters but, as this paper concludes, covering aspects that
   allow to identify it as an expression of politic matter as literature is
   conceived as knowledge, that is, as an object of action, an object to
   construct cultural and political subjectivities. This knowledge wich has
   (imagines) the literature, in the Moreno-Duran's proposed, would a
   knowledge on how to be Latin American, a knowledge that allows to know
   and recognize how Latin America is built imaginatively to itself.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1-12},
Abstract = {Policy and program design is a major theme of contemporary policy
   research, aimed at improving the understanding of how the processes,
   methods and tools of policy-making are employed to better formulate
   effective policies and programs, and to understand the reasons why such
   designs are not forthcoming. However while many efforts have been made
   to evaluate policy design, less work has focused on program designs.
   This article sets out to fill this gap in knowledge of design practices
   in policy-making. It outlines the nature of the study of policy design
   with a particular focus on the nature of programs and the lessons
   derived from empirical experience regarding the conditions that enhance
   program effectiveness.},

Title = {The ``Nature{''} of American Immigration Restrictionism},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {52-75},
Abstract = {How do commitments to nature factor into the American immigration
   restrictionist movement? This question initially appears odd; in
   contemporary American politics, environmentalism is generally assumed to
   be a value of the political left, and restrictionism of the right.
   Through an in-depth analysis of the American ``environmental
   restrictionist{''} logic, this article suggests that the reality is more
   complicated. First, the historical trajectory of the relationship
   between nature and restrictionism is outlined, demonstrating that
   commitments to particular conceptions of nature have long intersected
   with American restrictionism. Second, textual analysis, semi-structured
   interviews, and content analysis are employed in analyzing how
   contemporary activists making the environmental argument against
   immigration conceptualize nature and relate it to foundational ideals of
   political community, political economy, and governance. Three discourses
   of environmental restrictionism are identified, and the role that nature
   plays in each is detailed. The article concludes by reflecting on the
   resonance of these ``natures{''} with mainstream American greens, and
   offering several prescriptions for environmentalists concerned with
   inclusion and social justice.},

   Sacs?},
Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {163-180},
Abstract = {Road maps have become popular in recent African efforts to mediate and
   resolve conflicts. The African Union singly, or in concert with Regional
   Economic Communities and international actors, has invoked road maps as
   mediation and conflict resolution templates in Darfur, Libya, Ctoe
   d'Ivoire, Madagascar, and North-South Sudan. Although they are growing
   in significance, there is very little understanding of their usefulness
   and efficacy in peacemaking. It is important to understand whether road
   maps are pathways to peace or simply rhetorical tools that conceal the
   difficulties of negotiating protracted conflicts. More critical,
   therefore, is determining whether road maps facilitate or foreclose
   conflict resolution. This article probes these questions by examining
   some of the road maps in recent African conflicts with a view to
   shedding light on their conceptions, deployment, and impact on resolving
   conflicts. Both as process and content tools, road maps exemplify new
   collective African approaches to conflict resolution, but they also face
   severe constraints in managing conflicts that are characterized by deep
   divisions.},

Title = {The influence of threatening parental primes on mothers' versus fathers'
   policy preferences},
Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {4},
Pages = {607-623},
Abstract = {Citizens' personal identity groups exert a powerful influence over their
   preferences, particularly when their identity-related interests are
   perceived to be under threat. In American political rhetoric, parents
   are an identity group frequently targeted with fear and anxiety in the
   hopes of attracting support for particular policies. In this paper, we
   argue that these appeals to parental concerns do not influence all
   parents in the same way. With an experimental study of a large sample of
   parents, we find that threatening parental appeals exert a greater
   influence on fathers' policy preferences than they do on mothers'. To
   explain this difference, we rely on existing theories that mothers
   consistently incorporate parenthood into their preference formation,
   thereby minimizing their susceptibility to parental priming. For
   fathers, on the other hand, the relevance of parenthood for preference
   formation is dependent upon contextual factors, like identity primes.
   With a second experiment, we find strong support for this mechanism.
   This research has important implications for the distinct ways in which
   mothers and fathers incorporate their parental identity in political
   decision-making. More broadly, we offer insight into when identity
   primes might cause variability of response within identity groups.},

Volume = {76},

Pages = {15-26},

Abstract = {This article examines how political appeals to a shared human
   vulnerability could potentially deconstruct the able/disabled binary
   that continues to exist in the case of disability. The notion of
   vulnerability is important because it moves us beyond thinking about
   disability as a discrimination issue and approaches it as a shared
   matter of political planning and public welfare. To begin, I adjudicate
   between competing conceptions of vulnerability and its relationship to
   politics, focusing on the writings of Alasdair MacIntyre and Judith
   Butler. Drawing from both authors while emphasizing Butler's politicized
   version of vulnerability, I make the case for how disability scholars
   and activists should shift political efforts from a narrow focus on
   identity politics to a more encompassing vision of coalition politics,
   thereby removing the stigma of needing special protections for currently
   disabled citizens, while also making the case for the state to provide
   adequate social rights for all citizens.},

Abstract = {The examination of the level of permissiveness in the two morality
   policy fields abortion and same-sex partnerships across Western European
   countries from 1960 to 2010 reveals that Catholic states do not
   significantly differ from their Protestant counterparts in terms of
   their policy outputs today. But Catholicism can slow down the pace of
   reforms. Through a detailed, explorative investigation of the reforms in
   Austria, which was quick to install a more permissive abortion regime
   but a laggard in introducing legal recognition of same-sex couples, we
   derive first theoretical implications using an inductive approach. The
   Austrian case reveals that the influence of the Catholic Church may
   impede reforms as long as institutional and cultural opportunity
   structures do not promote secular-permissive efforts to politicize the
   issue and secure a majority for policy change.},

Abstract = {Comparative studies are rare in the study of online communication
   campaigning. The authors chose two cases, Poland and France, to describe
   the two campaigns for the Parliamentary elections. Content analysis
   allowed the authors to detect online communication strategies and
   parties' attempt to reach different audiences. Web-cartography
   illustrates the parties' network connections. The authors find strong
   cross-country and resource-based differences for the more interactive
   and engaging features (Web 2.0), which are not that powerful for
   explaining audience-targeting strategies. Overall a sales strategy and a
   focus on marketing dominated over e-representation (exhibiting the
   parties' political record). In both countries social media platforms are
   well incorporated into online strategies. Facebook dominates in Poland,
   Twitter in France. Web cartography gives a counterintuitive picture of
   the Polish parties'network being much more personalized but also of more
   ghettoing within the supporting environment.},

   conclusion drawn up. Some accents are made on the threats of
   ethno-separatism. In the same time, the author considers a case of the
   one from the calmest region of Ukraine - Chernivtsi oblast (Ukrainian
   Bukovyna), where the tradition of tolerance went back to the Austrian
   time. There are both positive and negative trends to be taken into
   account. Finally, some suggestions and proposals of making inter-ethnic

Abstract = {Before we can even discuss democratic consolidation, at least three
   minimal conditions must be fulfilled. Besides, those consolidated
   democracies should also fulfil several other conditions(2) that have not
   attracted such attention of scientific analyses, as have the three
   minimum conditions, among which Linz and Stepan specifically stress the
   importance of economic consolidation.(3) This article analyses the
   processes of democratic consolidation in the former Yugoslav republics.
   It is clearly evident from various democratic consolidation measurements
   that most former Yugoslav republics have not yet reached the level of
   consolidated democracies; authors test the thesis that one of the
   reasons for that is also the unsuccessful economic consolidation.},

Abstract = {Civil wars have become common and wide spread, particularly in Africa.
   Civil war negatively affects rural livelihoods and contributes to
   increased vulnerability. Yet, there is limited understanding of how
   people survive in such circumstances. This article attempts to offer a
   nuanced understanding of the level of resilience and vulnerability
   during Sudan's civil war in the 1990s. The main thesis of this article
   is that households exposed to prolonged conflict undertake livelihood
   strategies that are effective under certain conditions and less
   effective in other settings. The households exposed to exogenous
   counter-insurgency warfare are found to be more resilient than those
   exposed to endogenous counter-insurgency warfare. Also, a negative
   relationship between wealth and vulnerability is found in the context of
   exogenous counter-insurgency warfare, while a positive relationship
   between wealth and vulnerability is observed in the context of
   endogenous counter-insurgency warfare, with the non-poor becoming more
   vulnerable than the poor. The findings of this paper may have some value
   for informing policy decisions and practical humanitarian approaches
   during civil war.},

Abstract = {Are human rights general moral norms or are they conceptually tied to
   the political function of setting limits to the sovereignty of states?
   The essay steers a middle-course in conceptualizing human rights as
   basic norms of political morality. Human rights emerge out of general
   moral claims held by individual human beings simply as such, but they
   play a particular role as necessary conditions of political legitimacy.
   Nevertheless, we should not identify them with those norms whose
   violation might justify restrictions on the sovereignty of other states.
   Such an equation would result in an all too minimalist conception of
   human rights. The essay defends a more ambitions conception. It
   integrates civil rights and human rights, particular states and global
   politics, democracy and collective self-determination under the
   perspective of a division of moral labor.},

   decisions in the three security dimensions as well as of a number of
   draft documents that failed to reach consensus. The main documents that
   are analyzed include declarations on the Helsinki+40 process and on
   protracted conflicts, and decisions on countering kidnapping for ransom
   and terrorist foreign fighters, preventing corruption, improving
   disaster risk reduction, and on combating violence against women. The
   article concludes that the Swiss osce Chairmanship helped to reaffirm

Abstract = {Much of the recent literature on the violent groups that turn to
   electoral politics centers on the conditions under which these groups
   undertake these transitions, the types of groups that are likely to do
   so, and the moderating implications these transitions have on the groups
   involved. While the literature offers insights into the costs and
   benefits associated with a transition to nonviolent forms of politics,
   there is an apparent gap when it comes to delineating the variety of
   costs and benefits associated with these transitions, especially from
   the perspectives of the violent groups that may or may not undertake
   them. This paper begins to fill this gap in the literature through an
   investigation of the benefits violent groups may gain from a transition
   to electoral politics, as well as the costs these transitions may
   impose. Implications of turning to electoral politics for group
   legitimacy, popular support, bargaining position, group objectives, and
   group survival figure prominently among the costs and benefits. Looking
   at these transitions from the point of view of violent groups, it
   becomes apparent that even though groups may expect to benefit from this
   transition, there are many ways in which they do not.},

Abstract = {In this paper I analyze what personal traits define a good politician
   from the perspective of the Latin-American legislators. In addition to
   verifying whether these qualities are the same elected by citizens, in
   this work I compare them with the qualities that serve to win elections.
   Furthermore, different analyses remark the effect that political
   knowledge has on these preferences, making charisma more attractive
   among citizens with low levels of political sophistication. However,
   little is known about the impact of this variable for politicians. This
   article measures a)whether education and political knowledge also alter
   the perception of the deputies on what characteristics are more valued
   b) which of these characteristics serve better to gain elections, as
   well as c) the influence of constituents' political sophistication.},

Abstract = {This paper aims at studying environmental participative movements which
   have national/European/international relevance and use digital media, as
   well as local connections and conventional networks for interacting,
   socializing, mobilizing people and tackling civic and social issues. By
   using a comparative approach, this article focuses on Italian and
   European projects promoted by movements in order to support a culture of
   environmental security and a sustainable development for everybody. The
   analysis highlights significant differences among movements in terms of
   capability of interacting with institutions and other stakeholders,
   establishing partnerships and cooperating for local development and
   community empowerment. The objective is to provide a first model of
   environmental socialization based on several promising features:
   networks and innovative forms of partnership; level of activism and
   capability of planning participative initiatives; intensity of civic
   cohesion that is the ability of creating connections beyond their own
   movement, rooting inside the territorial community in a meaningful and
   enduring way.},

Abstract = {This paper will examine Plaid Cymru's experience in government from 2007
   to 2011. Drawing on literature on autonomist parties, parties in
   government for the first time, and Strom and Muller's
   policy/office/votes framework, the paper examines where strategic
   `trade-offs' were made and what the consequences of such trade-offs
   were. The paper takes a qualitative approach, using semi-structured
   interview and documentary data. The paper finds that Plaid Cymru valued
   the policy-seeking potential of office at the expense of vote-seeking
   ones because of the importance of `autonomist' goals, namely the 2011
   referendum which saw primary law-making powers granted to the Welsh
   Assembly. Furthermore, the experience of governmental office exposed
   organizational vulnerabilities in the party's leadership structures
   which undermined the ability to construct an effective vote-winning
   strategy at the 2011 Welsh election, where the party lost four seats.},

Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},

Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {318-329},
Abstract = {From 2008 there were persistent calls to hold a public inquiry into the
   events leading up to the banking collapse and subsequent economic
   recession. However, the Abbeylara judgment of 2001 ruled that an
   Oireachtas Inquiry Committee was acting outside its powers as its
   findings could adversely affect the good name of a person. Consequently,
   the scope for parliamentary inquiries was limited. In March 2011, the
   Fine Gael/Labour coalition government committed to holding a referendum
   to address the issues raised by the Supreme Court Abbeylara judgment.
   The terms of the referendum were announced in September 2011 and polling
   day was scheduled for 27 October 2011. Despite opinion polls
   consistently indicating support for the amendment, the amendment was
   narrowly defeated. This report suggests a combination of issues,
   including time constraints, lack of information and debate, and
   opposition from the legal profession, notably, eight former attorneys
   general, ultimately contributed to the defeat of the Oireachtas
   Inquiries referendum.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-59},
Abstract = {We examine how the discourse in three radio interviews, between 2008 and
   2010, with the then Irish Minister for Finance, constructed state
   support, including a banking guarantee, to private sector banks in
   Ireland. These interviews provide insights into the kind of neoliberal
   discourse that was prevalent in Ireland during what is referred to as
   the Celtic Tiger period. Neoliberal discourse is a free market ideology,
   yet it is precisely the workings of the market mechanism that the state
   prevented from operating by intervening on the banks' behalf. Analysis
   of the interviews thus provides a stark example of neoliberal discourse
   under strain, but persistent, within the context of a financial crisis
   that threatened the Irish economy. The analysis specifically focuses on
   the work done by the Minister, in these interviews, in maintaining a
   separation between the concerns of the market and the state.},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of the failure of Constantine Mitsotakis's government
   (1990-1993) to reinstitute liberalism, populism became broadly seen as
   the best vote-catching strategy, thus effectively contaminating Greece's
   political and party systems. The country developed into a populist
   democracy, a democratic subtype in which all major parties, whether in
   government or in opposition, are, and behave as, populist. Populist
   dominance rests on three biased beliefs that became systematized after
   the 198os: the anti-market bias; the anti-foreign bias; and the
   anti-institutional bias.},

Abstract = {Patronage across the social board would not have been feasible without
   the development of an additional mechanism for the distribution of
   state-related benefits. Such was the system of polarized bipartistn that
   developed in Greece after j981, featuring a two-party format and
   distinctly polarizing mechanics. For almost three decades thereafter,
   the unusual party system ensured that the two major populist parties
   regularly alternated in state power. It also explains the strategic'

Pages = {126-137},
Abstract = {Contemporary Greece shows clearly what may happen when both the
   political class and the voting public indulge in their particularistic
   interests by externalizing the cost at the expense of institutions. The
   populist democracy that resulted out of such collusion in Greece led to
   a deep crisis of legitimation and rendered the political system prone to
   breakdown. Normatively the Greek case argues forcibly against the idea
   that populism may be a corrective of democracy. Instead, it is suggested
   that Greece's only way out of its current impasse is the return to
   liberalism and the reinstitution of liberal principles.},

Title = {The Six Essential Components of Sustainable Socialism: From Building the
   Productive Forces to Combating Bourgeois Liberalization},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Pages = {267-288},
Abstract = {A sustainable socialist society has six essential components: (1) an
   economic system that builds the productive forces and promotes common
   prosperity in a steady, sustainable manner; (2) a political system that
   supports a vigorous people's democracy focused on implementing the
   people's political agenda; (3) a strong, united, and fully sovereign
   socialist homeland; (4) a progressive socialist culture; (5) resource
   management policies that promote a flourishing natural environment while
   meeting the people's economic needs; and (6) successful resistance to
   bourgeois liberalization. Sustainable socialism is the result of
   successfully constructing, managing, and preserving the six components.
   In order to prevent contradictions, the components must be
   scientifically harmonized in a way that is appropriate to national
   conditions. In addition to harmonization, dynamic, highly organized, and
   vigilant political leadership is necessary for launching and organizing
   the drive for sustainable socialism and protecting the gains of
   socialism from reactionaries. The communist party working through the
   instrument of the people's democratic dictatorship provides these
   organizing, harmonizing, and protective functions. Thus, the leading
   role of the communist party becomes the overarching principle that
   guides the construction, implementation, and scientific harmonization of
   the six components of sustainable socialism.},

Abstract = {In recent literature, life satisfaction and welfare have been
   extensively studied. However, limited attention has been given to the
   effect that crime may have over these variables. Using the case of
   Bogota this paper shows that urban crime rates, specially murder rate,
   have a positive impact on individuals' life dissatisfaction. This effect
   seems to be mediated by the general perception of insecurity and not by
   the households' victimization. In particular the perception of
   insecurity has a great impact on the unhappiness of those households
   that changed their perceptions because of the criminal activity. The
   conclusion of this paper is that it is necessary not only to reduce the
   crime rates, but also to generate good security perceptions.},

Abstract = {Conceptual debates in terrorism research tend to understate the role
   that private companies play in countering terrorism, and rarely offer
   workable solutions around how the `terms of engagement' between industry
   and the public sector could be improved in this field. This paper
   addresses this by considering the opportunity presented by the
   appointment of a `Director - Security Industry Engagement' within the
   Office for Security and Counter Terrorism (OSCT) at the UK Home Office;
   a development which demonstrates how the publicprivate interactions
   which feature as part of the UK's `CONTEST' strategy have become an
   increasingly important priority for the Government. To stimulate a new
   debate on this subject, the paper proposes both a revised approach
   towards `industrial engagement' and a programme of key priorities which
   could form the basis of the new appointee's strategy. Whatever function
   the new Director fulfils, the private sector's role in countering
   terrorism should be bounded by strong principles and receive more
   effective oversight than at present.},

Year = {2014},

Pages = {41-57},
Abstract = {Terrorism has been increasingly viewed as a complex phenomenon imbued
   with political objectives and media interests. From this perspective, it
   is crucial to understand how terrorism is socially represented and the
   role the media plays in creating and molding its image. Using four
   scales, this study explores the following issues as they relate to
   normal populations who have no link to terrorism: (1) Terrorist
   Definitions; (2) Attitudes, Beliefs and Experiences of Terrorism; (3)
   Immediate Impact of Terrorism; and (4) perceived positive or negative
   role of the media. Moreover, the study analyzes the role of political
   orientation and the need for cognitive closure (NFC) in shaping one's
   representations of terrorism. The sample consists of 409 Italian
   respondents. Four analyses of main components were conducted.
   Subsequently, a second-order factor analysis of all four scales
   generated a three-factor solution that accounts for 51\% of the
   variance. Finally, a correlational analysis of political orientation,
   NFC, and representations of terrorists and terrorism was performed.
   Results suggest that more conservative participants, who exhibited a
   higher NFC, view terrorists as psychologically deviant and criminal. By
   contrast, left-wing participants, with a lower NFC, view terrorism as a
   complex phenomenon linked to politics of fear and discrimination. These
   participants view the media as having a negative role relating to the
   perpetuation of terrorism.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the new principles of the ``philosophy of
   frontier{''} - e.g. reflexive exploration (intensified by the level of
   social consciousness) of anthropological, socio-political, and
   socio-cultural changes that are characteristic of the Modernity and are
   revealed by different versions of ``post-history{''} concepts. In this
   sense, such conceptions as theories of the ``death of the
   nation-state,{''} of ``zones of problematic statehood,{''} of
   ``de-sovereignization,{''} of the ``golden billion,{''} etc., constitute
   one rank of concepts, which are subjects to detailed examination at a
   new - ``global,{''} ``social{''} format, considering its main trends and
   prospects. The article is an expanded version of a paper given by the
   author at the ``Globalization and De-Sovereignization{''} international
   conference (Kosovska Mitrovica, September 2013).},

Abstract = {The international cooperation in agricultural and rural subjects had an
   important role in Argentina, as the experiences in these topics helped
   to improve the impacts of the new cooperation projets in the region. In
   this regard, we have to highlight three key issues: a) the cooperation
   in agricultural and rural topics is extremely specific, as the agents
   have to provide to an integral approach of the problems affecting the
   country, appealing to innovative solutions, adapted to local contexts;
   b) the cooperation projects are learning spaces shared by many actors;
   c) cooperation between Latinamerican countries is a prime source of
   information to improve cooperation experiences. All these questions have
   place in a context of a changing cooperation logic, going from a
   cooperation model tending to make up for the market failures, to a model
   aimed to strengthen the agents to deal with the operating conditions of
   the current markets and institutions.},

Pages = {381-401},
Abstract = {How does globalisation, especially foreign direct investment, influence
   the risk of intrastate conflict? While several prominent studies have
   found that globalisation reduces the probability of civil war, we use
   new data and methods to approach the question. In particular, we test
   for the possibility that foreign investment is endogenous to conflict
   risk and appropriately use inward foreign investment stock rather than
   net inflow to measure an economy's exposure to international capital
   markets. We find no evidence that foreign investment affects civil
   conflict, suggesting that governments' fundamental security interests
   trump the economic losses they can expect to suffer from failing to
   compromise with potential rebel groups.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the distinction between cultural and political (or
   civic) nationalism. The idea of an apolitical cultural nationalism can
   be traced at least as far back as the German historian Friedrich
   Meinecke's work in the early twentieth century. In the 1940s, Hans Kohn
   overlaid this cultural-political divide with an East-West divide, and in
   the 1970s, John Plamenatz cemented this typology in political studies
   with his article on ``Two Types of Nationalism.{''} Despite various
   amendments since then, this divide still informs debates in political
   theory so that civic nationalism remains privileged as the only
   appropriate form of nationalism. Yet the political equality associated
   with civic nationalism has been premised on a false assumption of
   cultural homogeneity with deleterious effects for minority cultures. I
   argue that historically behind the ideological mask that civic
   nationalism is non-cultural and benign, it has always had a cultural
   agenda at its core.},

Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Pages = {245-259},
Abstract = {In this article, I use the civic republican tradition as a theoretical
   lens to examine how Mexican-Americans in a transnational community have
   drawn on their wartime service to demand equal treatment as citizens and
   legal residence as immigrants. I interpret this account through a frame
   of ``Tejano republicanism{''} originating in the historical experience
   of civil rights groups led by South Texas veterans. Originating as
   Texas-based US citizen-only groups, the League of United Latin American
   Citizens and the American G.I. Forum's struggle for equal rights evolved
   to include a broader nationwide pan-Latino constituency including
   unauthorized immigrants by the 1970s. Today, both groups support
   military service as a pathway to citizenship for all unauthorized
   immigrants in the spirit of their founding generation's struggle for
   civil rights. But unauthorized immigrants who want to follow this
   pathway to citizenship can no longer do so, as they are barred from
   enlisting. To respond to this new challenge, I apply my historical and
   normative account of earned citizenship to analyze and critique current
   US policies governing immigrant enlistment and the Development, Relief,
   and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act's military service provision.
   As a whole, this article serves as a work of applied political theory
   with implications for the contemporary US immigration reform debate.},

   Case of Korea},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-66},
Abstract = {The 2009 South Korean Presidential Committee on Green Growth set a
   long-term vision for South Korea to ``go green.{''}The Green Growth
   Korea (GGK) initiative has been instrumental in the formation of the
   international Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI). The initiative is
   heralded as a qualitatively new and exportable growth paradigm. The
   paper argues that the narrative on ``newness{''}is a myth and that green
   growth represents a continuity of elite-led responses to the
   contradictions of capital accumulation in the South Korean
   developmentalist state. These splits in hegemonic ``leadership{''}are a
   result of the uneven relationship between domestic and transnational
   Chaebol interests, and the political interests of the developmentalist
   state and the promotion of South Korea as ``global Korea.{''}This is
   creating an economy based on a developmentalist model that has provided
   the conditions for a decoupling of the economy from big business
   interests, which have been integral to developmentalist success. These
   economic interests remain reliant on the economic and political policies
   of the developmentalist state, which these interests are undermining.
   Green growth is an elite-led narrative that obscures these elite
   conflicts under the banner of Korean green growth nationalism.},

Abstract = {The essay proposes a research's trace to elaborate a political theory of
   cooperation, in other words to consider the cooperative phenomenon as
   described by a particular way of collective action that is not included
   in the famous hirschmanian distinction between exit, voice and loyalty.
   Neither the voice option nor the exit one are believed in by the
   cooperative business participants, that practice a different form of
   action based on self-confidence and the partners' common interest. This
   form of collective action can be preliminary defined as entry. The entry
   brings back to the market the ones who chose for the exit option, at the
   same time preserving the typical voice option character: the strength of
   the protest against capitalistic relationships. The cooperative business
   represents, in virtue of this twofold feature of the way of action of
   its members, a political as well economic option.},

Abstract = {Democracy is today a system that is expanding around the world or at
   least, was expanding in the second half of the 20th Century and
   moreover, is still being demanded by people who are deprived of it,
   although not in the countries where it is established and seen by a
   growing number of people as an authentic achievement. What is the cause
   of this dual and conflicting perception of democr acy? To a great extent
   it is due to the fact that the principle underlying it involves
   something more than a political system. Throughout the centuries, this
   was practically the only form in which democracy was conceived and
   discussed. At odds with the formalist tradition, this article approaches
   the issue of democracy from the works of Spinoza and Marx},

Abstract = {This article investigates whether and how changes in issue focus in
   election campaigns affect voting intention, even if no preference change
   takes place, and whether such effects vary systematically across
   different groups of voters. Evidence is reported from two survey
   experiments of Norwegian voters, where respondents were treated with
   information drawing their attention towards issues pertaining either to
   immigration or the environment. Although irrelevant for policy learning
   or persuasion, this information strongly increased the support of
   particular parties. More specifically, parties with ownership' of the
   issues involved gained votes. Certain types of voters were more likely
   to change voting intentions post-treatment than others, but which types
   crucially depended on the issue area under focus. Nevertheless, the
   results indicate that the issue focus of campaigns is very important for
   vote choice. Hence, one should expect that, for instance, even neutral'
   political news coverage at or close to election day could affect voters
   in predictable ways. Furthermore, one should expect different parties to
   fight hard to steer the focus of campaigns towards issues where they
   have ownership.},

   developments of political science in different countries through the
   analysis of articles published in academic journals. Building on
   existing literature on the history of the discipline, this contribution
   provides an attempt to produce a quantitatively informed description of
   political science publishing in Portugal from 2000 to 2012. Results show
   that the yearly output in national journals increased notably, mainly
   driven by international relations and comparative politics. A strong
   majority of articles are authored by researchers from domestic
   institutions. Nevertheless, the period under analysis witnessed an
   expanding scope beyond the domestic case and an increasing comparative

Abstract = {Thiis article seeks to present an introductory panorama of the questions
   arising from the relation between strategic intelligence and organized
   crime. Organized crime structures have strategic importance because they
   have the capacity of deploying their activities in the strategic
   scenario in opposition to the State. Thus, considering a strategic
   context with high levels of ambiguity associated with the data,
   information and knowledge regarding organized crime, the challenge for
   intelligence resides in understanding how criminal operations or
   businesses function, how criminals work and choose their victims, how
   they legitimate their assets and the products of their criminal
   activities, which are their strengths and, above all, which are the
   weaknesses of the systems and procedures used by criminal organizations.
   To achieve this goal big volumes of data and information must be put in
   context, most of which come from the systematic exploitation of open
   sources. Only in this way is possible to build a reference frame to
   elaborate strategic intelligence products adapted to the nature of the
   security threat that organized crime embodies, in the 21st century.},

Abstract = {How is cultural otherness any different from the historical otherness
   already found in our existing canons of thought? This essay examines an
   influential Chinese conversation that raised a similar question in
   struggling with its own parochialism. Claiming that all ``Western{''}
   knowledge originated in China, these Chinese reformers see the
   differences presented by foreign knowledge as identical to those already
   authorizing innovation within their existing activity of
   knowledge-production. Noting that current academic theory-production
   treats the otherness of past authors in a similar way, I argue that we
   must broach something like a China-origins claim if we are to see
   typically marginalized ({''}non-Western{''}) thought as part of what
   disciplines our thought, rather than serves simply as its target of
   inclusion. Doing so, we blur self/foreign binaries and enable future
   innovation of thought on radically new terms.},

Abstract = {My article examines whether supermajority vote requirements (SMVR) to
   raise taxes in California's constitution suppresses state tax burdens.
   SMVR is a politically popular but contentious measure that 16 states
   have adopted and many other states have attempted to adopt. The
   rationale behind the rule is to contain the growth of government by
   making it costly to form a winning coalition to raise taxes.
   Nonetheless, the current empirical literature is mixed at best and
   suffers from causal inference. I take a different approach from extant
   literature and estimate the causal effect of SMVR on tax burdens in
   California by using synthetic control methods. The results show that,
   from 1979 to 2008, SMVR reduced the state nonproperty tax burden by an
   average of \$1.44 per \$100 of personal income, which is equivalent to
   21\% of the total tax burden for each year. The effect of SMVR was
   immediate after its adoption, but has abated over time.},

Abstract = {Pointing out the remarkable levels of hostile interaction in the air
   space over contested territory between states like China and Japan or
   Greece and Turkey we argue that air space incursions can be interpreted
   as a rational strategy with ultimately political aims. In our
   interpretation deliberate intrusions of military aircraft into sensitive
   air space serve as an indirect risk-generating mechanism, as they will
   trigger scrambles of the opposed government's air force which may
   escalate into a military crisis. We derive testable hypotheses from a
   game-theoretic model, which we developed in earlier work to explore the
   strategic logic behind this risk-generating mechanism more rigorously.
   In order to test whether the model's predictions regarding the effect of
   short-term economic developments on the states' interaction hold, we
   built a database of daily event observations from the Hellenic National
   Defence General Staff reports of the last 4 years, containing time
   series data of Turkish intrusions into Greek-claimed air space and the
   number of dogfights between Greek and Turkish fighter planes. What we
   find is that not only Greek engagements of Turkish intruders but also
   massed, provocative Turkish intrusions have become significantly less
   likely after the onset of the Greek economic crisis. These findings are
   well in line with the predictions of the model and thus supportive of
   our theory.},

Abstract = {In 1889, the proclamation of the republic in Brazil led to formal
   changes in the political organization of the country. Republican
   federalism replaced monarchical centralism, and gave prominence to the
   groups that held economic power in the States. The policies of the
   governors and States began to be formulated during the presidency of
   Campos Sales and strengthened the alliance between the President of the
   Republic with the power of the State oligarchies, making the governors
   strong supporters of the Republic. Thus, rather than being a true
   federalism, with the democratic backing of a plural political system, it
   became a displaced federalism, - that is a type of ``Statism{''} based
   on the power of the state oligarchies. As a counterpart to this concept
   of the Republic, (and this is the central issue of this paper) a number
   of political voices were raised demanding that the federal government
   should wield a greater degree of power over the states. Among these,
   attention should be drawn to the role of the Federalist Party
   (1892-1928), a political party founded by the liberal Gaspar Silveira
   Martins from Rio Grande do Sul State, who insisted on backing unitary
   federalism as a form of reaction to the ``undermining{''} of the central
   government by the States. This paper seeks to highlight the centralist
   features embodied in the federalist program. These involve conducting an
   analysis of the ``Political Testament{''} left as the legacy of the
   liberal magistrate in 1901, which was an important theoretical critique
   of the dominant ideology in Rio Grande do Sul of the First Republic -
   the concept of ``Castilhism{''}, and the model of the republic that
   prevailed at a national level at that time. We also seek to analyze how
   the question of federal interventionism, that was put forward by Gaspar
   Martins in his ``Testament{''}, was a driving-force behind the
   parliamentary speeches produced in that era, and influenced the
   activities of the main},

   discusses key conceptual, methodological, and practical issues in

   breadth of coverage and analytical depth. Methodologically, we develop
   new software tools that allow a largely automated identification of
   changes in formal rules and that permit a valid, quantitative
   measurement of the amount of changes in a text. We demonstrate the
   application of the four approaches and the new tools using data on

Abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between socioeconomic resources
   and women's political participation, more precisely whether the
   distinction between individual and household resources helps to identify
   different mechanisms behind a possible resource effect. Based on a
   Bayesian multilevel analysis using the Swiss Election Study 2011, we
   show that both individual and household resources matter for explaining
   female electoral participation. However, resource effects must not
   necessarily be positive: While higher education of women and their
   partners tend to increase female participation, a demanding job of
   either the woman and/or her partner rather decreases her propensity to
   vote. Moreover, the mechanisms behind partner effects are contingent on
   women's individual resource endowment. While low and medium educated
   women most strongly profit from higher educational partner resources,
   i.e. from a compensatory mechanism, the resource time seems to
   particularly confine political involvement of women with both high
   professional status or no employment.},

Abstract = {This paper is a contribution to the study of the impact of public
   opinion and evolutions in opinion on the occurrence of international
   terrorism. First, we replicate Krueger and Maleckova's (2009) model of
   the relationship between attitudes towards world leaders and occurrences
   of international terrorist incidents, using more recent data-the Gallup
   Survey data from 2010 on public opinion in Middle Eastern and North
   African countries and the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) data
   on international terrorism from 2009 to 2011. The analysis confirms the
   model of the earlier study, although, due to the distribution of
   terrorist incidents in the new sample, the evidence of the correlation
   between terrorist attacks and public opinion weakens. Second, we
   exercise an out-of-sample prediction of terrorist attacks using the
   estimated model based on the data from the 2004 to 2008 period to
   predict the occurrence of attacks in 2009-2011. The findings suggest
   that Krueger and Maleckova's (2009) model is unstable, either due to the
   instability of the process or the problematic nature of terrorism data.
   Further research is necessary to explain and test these results.},

Abstract = {The question of how to explain policy change has led to important
   academic debate over the past two decades. This article challenges
   explanations regarding veto players (VPs), arguing that interest groups
   (IGs) sometimes play a more decisive role than VPs depending on the
   degree of organization and mobilization of such groups. The comparative
   analysis of judicial reforms in Italy, Belgium, and France shows the
   conditions under which IGsunderstood here as legal professionsmatter in
   the lawmaking process. Ceteris paribus, the more cohesive and legitimate
   an IG, the more likely it is to influence lawmaking regardless of the VP
   configuration. Analyses of legislative and policy change should
   therefore consider not only institutional and partisan actors but also
   the role of social group and IG in this process.},

Abstract = {Using an original data set of roll call votes and bill co-sponsorships
   across three high salience issues (immigration, labor, and education)

   111th Congress to assess representation of Latinos. Partisanship is the
   key determinant in member behavior on voting, not the member's race or
   ethnicity or constituent demographics. For bill co-sponsorships, Latino
   members are only more active on high salience issue areas compared with
   non-Latino members. Increases in Latino population do not influence
   behavior. The results also indicate that African American and Democratic
   legislators offer Latinos considerable amounts of substantive
   representation.},

Abstract = {The paper begins with an overview of contemporary liberal-egalitarian
   theories in order to show the diversity among different understandings
   of justice. Then, the paper draws a borderline between luck
   egalitarianism (Arneson, G. A. Cohen, Roemer) and a pro-democratic,
   relational egalitarianism (Rawls, J. Cohen, Anderson, Barry) that
   focuses on the society's structure, i.e. the production of its inner
   relations.
   The following part introduces the idea of reflective equilibrium and its
   theoretical benefits in terms of ``de-metaphysised{''} ethics.
   Furthermore, this part elaborates Dworkin's liberal principle of justice
   as the basis of his liberal moral doctrine.
   Finally, the paper shows that a ``de-metaphysised{''} ethics could not
   be equated with the conception of justice as mutual advantage, and
   neither is it lost in an Archimedean skepticism. By referring to Barry's
   work, the paper elaborates the idea of justice as impartiality through
   the debate between moral objectivism and skepticism.
   The paper ends with synthesising a conclusion of the previous three
   parts. Also, it defines justice as implied by Rawls' liberal
   egalitarianism. Ultimately, the paper identifies the need for further
   research of the topic that would elaborate and answer the questions
   highlighted by this paper.},

Abstract = {For the significance of the First World War, the question when and how
   it came to an end is more important than the question of how it started.
   What kind of traces did it leave in the collective memory of the
   participating nations and what kind of reactions did it provoke? With
   this question, the First World War is placed in the context of the
   general problem of how peoples and cultures in history reacted to
   dramatic, overwhelming violent events, such as the Trojan War or the
   Thirty Years War, events that deeply roused all of the participants.},

Abstract = {The paper analyzes the link between Kant's ``Perpetual peace{''} and the
   democratic peace paradigm with which contemporary International
   Relations are being interpreted. In doing so, the monadic and dyadic
   versions of liberal theory of democratic peace are explained through the
   institutional-structural and cultural-normative models. The theory of
   democratic peace is critically analyzed, with emphasis on the causal
   relationship between the independent variable, the democratic regime,
   and the dependent variable, peace. Empirical studies of cases in which
   the crises among democratic states have not resulted in war are also
   questioned, which brings into doubt the causal logic of the theory
   itself. In critical thought about the democratic peace theory, special
   emphasis is placed on the realistic interpretation of causes that are
   believed to contribute to democratic peace, as well as on the existence
   of the so-called ``democratic war{''}. There exist a number of factors
   explaining this foreign policy behavior of democracies and their hiding
   behind the theses of the theory of democratic peace. An example is the
   position of power that democracy occupies in International Relations,
   with which, aside from liberal dependent variables, realistic variables
   must be taken into account as well, such as the concentration of power,
   economic interdependence and national interest.},

Abstract = {This article examines the focus of Fianna Fail policy initiatives
   relating to the Northern Ireland issue in the period 1969-1973 within
   the context of their interpretation of Irish republicanism and beliefs
   as to where Irish interests lay. Managing the consequences of the
   emerging conflict within the southern jurisdiction is explored through
   the lens of national sovereignty, political and institutional authority
   and the defence of the rights of Irish citizens. Critiques that hold
   that a fresh politics had emerged in the Republic of Ireland during the
   1960s are challenged as the limitations on new thinking on the national
   question are assessed. The Fianna Fail administration under Jack Lynch
   pursued a cautious approach, designed to reaffirm Irish sovereignty to
   both national and international audiences, uphold political authority
   and the rule of law within the state and restate the case for Irish
   reunification at every available opportunity. Confrontations between the
   British political, security and legal apparatus and their Irish
   equivalents reflected a resolute Irish government exercising political
   autonomy in pursuit of its objectives in a manner consistent with the
   norms of the time. Only slowly did Fianna Fail reappraise, in a limited
   manner, its approach when progress at an intergovernmental level seemed
   possible.},

Abstract = {Since the 2008 economic crisis, there has been upheaval across Europe.
   In Ireland, the collapse of the banking, construction and property
   sectors, and the 2010 EU/International Monetary Fund loan and attached
   austerity conditions resulted in a dramatic election in 2011 that saw
   the removal of the dominant political party from power. Ireland provides
   an important case study to examine political legitimacy given the
   perceived culpability of political authorities in the recession and the
   effects of austerity on the population's welfare. In this article, we
   examine data from the European Social Survey over a ten-year period
   (2002-2012) to ascertain the impact of the crisis on political
   legitimacy. We measure change in trust in political institutions,
   satisfaction with government and the link between social trust and
   political legitimacy. The analysis is repeated separating `winners'
   (those who voted for the parties in power) from `losers' (those who did
   not vote for the parties in power). We find that trust in political
   institutions and satisfaction with government has declined since 2008.
   However, while satisfaction with government is increasing since the 2011
   election, trust in government continues to decline. Social trust is only
   declining for those who did not vote for the parties in power.},

Abstract = {The 2013 federal election led to a considerable change in the German
   party system. Yet Chancellor Merkel secured a third term, once again, as
   chancellor of a grand coalition. This analysis shows that Angela Merkel
   was much more popular than her SPD challenger, Peer Steinbruck.
   Moreover, she was perceived as somewhat more representative of the
   values and policies of the party she stood for than her competitor. What
   is more, the candidates' perceived representativeness conditioned the
   impact of candidate preferences on vote choice in complex ways. As a
   result, support for Angela Merkel was likely to translate into votes for
   the CDU/CSU, whereas support for Peer Steinbruck did not easily earn SPD
   votes. The article thus concludes that, in contrast to her challenger,
   Angela Merkel was an electoral asset for her party. The CDU/CSU's
   impressive result in the 2013 federal outcome can thus be interpreted,
   to some extent, as reflecting its leader's popularity.},

Title = {On violence in Habermas's philosophy of language},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Habermas does not rule out the possibility of violence in language. In
   fact his account explicitly licenses a broad conception of violence as
   `systematically distorted communication'. Yet he does rule out the
   possibility that language simultaneously imposes as it discloses. That
   is, his argument precludes the possibility of recognizing that there is
   an antinomy at the heart of language and philosophical reason. This
   occlusion of the simultaneously world-disclosing and world-imposing
   character of language feeds and sustains Habermas's legal and political
   arguments, where he states that in order to achieve consensus rational
   deliberation must eliminate force. In this paper, I claim that this
   argument operates through a manoeuvre that leaves Habermas's position
   curiously blind to its own predicament. To explain why, I turn to Kant's
   treatment of the problem of evil in Religion Within the Boundaries of
   Mere Reason. Here, as in the Western philosophical tradition more
   generally, evil has no separate existence: it is folded back into Kant's
   philosophical scheme. Arendt notes that as soon as Kant identifies the
   problem of evil he rationalizes it into comprehensible motives. I will
   show how, through a move that is structurally similar to Kant's
   rationalization of evil, Habermas rationalizes and attempts to eliminate
   violence from his consideration of law and language. In Habermas's work,
   law and language appear as ciphers for reason. The case to be made here
   is that Habermas's inability to recognize the paradoxical character of
   language and reason makes his work blind to the violence in which it is
   unavoidably implicated.},

Abstract = {One of the leading debates today centers on how citizens can make the
   most of the possibilities offered by ICTs to take part in governmental
   decision-making processes. These new forms of relationship linking
   citizens and public power would seem to promote an evolution from a
   representative democratic system to a conversational and open democracy
   that complements and perfects it. The aim of this paper is to analyze
   the regulations on electronic participation adopted in the Spanish
   autonomous communities, their application, and the political and social
   effects. These reflections are on part of the global reality that ICTs
   are generating. They focus on institutional initiatives, leaving to one
   side other movements arising from the citizens themselves beyond the
   scope of the institutional framework. The main conclusion reached in
   this review is that ICTs are another tool for increasing the right to
   participation, bearing in mind that e-democracy is, above all else,
   democracy.},

Abstract = {Knowledge-based assets, intellectual property, and capital play a
   fundamental role in an enterprise's competitiveness, especially in small
   knowledge intensive enterprises. Small knowledge intensive enterprises
   need to create new ways of operating in order to manage the intellectual
   and knowledge-based assets in their organizations more efficiently.
   Organizational knowledge and intellectual properly can be protected,
   either formally via IPR, or informally via efficient knowledge
   management. Successful IP protection requires systematic intellectual
   properly and knowledge management. Intellectual properly protection via
   efficient knowledge management affects the entire organization rather
   than being just a separate task It needs to be embedded in
   organizational work routines, practices, and processes as an overall
   operational strategy. When embedded in organizational work processes, IP
   protection and knowledge management become a continuous part of work
   routines and tasks in the enterprise, not a separate action.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) signed Association Agreements on 27 June 2014
   with Georgia, the Republic of Moldova, and Ukraine. The Association
   Agreement (AA) is the EU's main instrument to bring the countries in the
   Eastern Partnership (EaP) closer to EU standards and norms. For the
   citizens of the EaP countries to benefit from these agreements, a more
   in-depth knowledge of the EU and the EU Member States is required to be
   reflected in a comparative approach to European Union studies. We
   examine these implications on the need to expand and adapt, the content
   and approach to research and teaching European Union studies, with the
   transdisciplinary approach becoming increasingly dominant, becoming a
   modern tool for research in social sciences. This contribution aims to
   offer insight into the implementation of transdisciplinarity in the
   methodology of education and research as it is determined by current
   increasing global challenges. This approach should serve as a means of
   integrating a number of main goals as part of learning, teaching and
   research processes: strengthening employability of young people and
   preparing them for citizenship. We discuss the need for modernizing
   European studies in the EU Member States that could serve as an example
   for the EU Eastern Partnership countries. We conclude that the
   theoretical approach to European and related studies of other
   disciplines and their practical implications should always be
   transdisciplinary in nature and benefit from direct in-situ exposure and
   should be fully integrated in university curricula.},

Abstract = {Corruption has been the single most cited reason for the seizure of
   power from governments in Thailand. Yet few studies on corruption in
   Thailand have problematized the term ``corruption{''} despite it being
   repeatedly used to legitimize the overthrow of government. This article
   examines the discourse on corruption of the reform movements between the
   two coup d'etats in Thailand in 1991 and 2006. I focus on the reform
   efforts that culminated in the 1997 constitution and those that
   culminated in establishment of the opposition movement, the People's
   Alliance for Democracy (PAD). I argue that the PAD's conception of
   corruption was intertwined with the notions of morality, nationalism,
   and royalism, which differed from what was envisioned in the 1997
   constitution. They were thus not satisfied with the outcomes of reforms
   and resorted to overthrowing the democratic system altogether.},

   describes the resource governance system in the area that has developed

   by the state through a patron-client system has led to a conflict with
   it, fostering over- exploitation of natural resources. The article
   argues that conflict harms the management of the lake and ultimately,

Abstract = {This article examines the extent to which the Freedom of Information Act
   (FOI) is used by members of the UK Parliament to hold the government to
   account, compared with the experience in New Zealand, Australia, Canada
   and Ireland. As with other accountability mechanisms, FOI can be used
   for a range of issues. It is primarily a tool of opposition and can be a
   versatile weapon, useful in the right time and place. However, it does
   not significantly enhance accountability and remains a minority pursuit.
   This is because FOI takes time, members are creatures of habit and it is
   useful only in particular ways.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to study and to compare the influence of
   local unemployment on the vote in French elections for the European
   Parliament, in French legislative elections and in French presidential
   elections. The results of our paper showed that if we study the vote in
   the second round of French presidential elections over the 1988-2007
   period (without 2002), the influence of the annual change in the local
   unemployment on the vote for the Left is much greater than for the vote
   for the Left in the first round of legislative elections (1986-2007),
   and French elections for the European Parliament (1984-2009). For French
   presidential elections, we build two variables taking into account the
   responsibility of the incumbent President for the economic situation
   after a cohabitation period. We make estimates for the second-round vote
   of French presidential elections (without the 2002 French presidential
   election or with an estimated vote for this election). We show that over
   the 1988-2007 and 1988-2012 periods (without 2002), it is not necessary
   to take into account the influence of cohabitation periods on the
   responsibility of the government in relation to the economic situation.},

Abstract = {A masterful study of the entrenchment and disastrous consequences of
   post-civil rights era racial segregation, Elizabeth Anderson's The
   Imperative of Integration more than lives up to its title. This article
   highlights two contributions of Anderson's book: the way it models the
   work of non-ideal theorizing by offering an empirical account of the
   contemporary US that is grounded in close study of the most pressing
   social problems and the consequences of different remedies; and the way
   it re-conceives the argument for affirmative action. The article also
   raises two concerns about Anderson's approach. First, it contends that
   Anderson's argument depends too heavily on the cultivation of national
   identity and is insufficiently attentive to the dangers of such
   identification. Second, it demonstrates what is lost when segregation is
   approached as a problem to be solved. In conclusion, this article
   advocates a politics of de-segregation as an alternative that shares
   many of Anderson's ends without losing sight of the limitations of
   integration as an ideal.},

Abstract = {This article presents initial findings from one of the first comparative
   studies of women as foreign policy decision-makers in Western industrial
   systems. It begins with an overview of why political leaders matter to
   the conduct of contemporary international relations and what the
   existing literature tells us about women's engagement in that domain.
   Next, we develop five propositions based on previous research, and
   evaluate them using longitudinal data from 10 established democratic
   systems. Analysing the public statements of appointees in the three
   countries with the most female elites, we report that women
   decision-makers were more likely to express pro-feminist rhetoric than
   the men who preceded or succeeded them; moreover, the most vocal
   pro-equality elites came from left-of-centre political backgrounds, and
   often had pre-recruitment experience in progressive parties or social
   movements. The discussion concludes with a brief look at promising
   directions for future research.},

Abstract = {A real-life ``Game of Thrones{''} is developing in the wider region
   surrounding the Black Sea and beyond, extending to the Middle East,
   Southeast Europe, and Mediterranean regions, through multileveled
   approaches to security and strategy. What ignited separatist movements
   in the regions of Ukraine in 2014 was just the starting point of a
   larger change that will eventually affect the balance of power and the
   future role of states in the area and neighborhood. Developments in the
   region have reached a pivotal point; one that requires a total change of
   objectives and strategies. A shift in the power balance between leading
   and peripheral states is therefore beginning to manifest itself. New
   alliances will be created and old ones will be reshaped or forgotten.},

Title = {Social Media Used by Government Institutions in Iceland: Application,
   Role and Aims},
Journal = {ICELANDIC REVIEW OF POLITICS \& ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {The purpose of this research was to study the use and role of social
   media hosted by government institutions in Iceland. The research was
   conducted using quantitative and qualitative research methods. A survey
   was sent electronically to all government institutions in Iceland and
   semi-structured interviews were conducted with specialists working for
   institutions.
   No research has been conducted on this subject in Iceland before. It was
   therefore considered timely that a research was conducted on the use of
   social media in public institutions, with the intention of adding new
   knowledge to the field. No similar research from outside of Iceland was
   found, but this research was based on related studies and sources from
   abroad.
   A little less than half of government institutions used social media as
   part of their activities and Facebook and YouTube were most widely used.
   Popularity, circulation, usefulness and convenience were the most
   important factors when choosing social media. The majority of
   institutions had neither defined social media goals nor the role and
   responsibility of employees when using social media. The institutions
   placed strong emphasis on publishing adverts and news items on the
   institutions' activities via social media pages and there were a
   considerable number of references to material on other web pages.
   Among other things the interviewees said that the purpose of using
   social media was information dissemination, reception of information,
   more visibility, the opening of institutions to the public and increased
   transparency. They talked about the importance of being informal on
   social media, but they also pointed out that there had been some fear
   among institutions of using them, in particular fear of employees
   showing a human side via social media. There was minimal use of original
   material on institutions' social media pages, while institutions were
   quite systematic in posting material from their website through social
   media. Also, the public did not post much material on social media used
   by institutions.},

Abstract = {Political scientists have long recognized Robert Penn Warren's work as a
   fruitful means of exploring American political life. Indeed, All the
   King's Men has justly been called one of the greatest American political
   novels. Despite this attention, however, Warren's most overtly political
   work-Democracy and Poetry-has yet to receive anything but a cursory
   treatment. This lacuna in the literature is even more surprising given
   the work's theme; Warren's Democracy and Poetry can and perhaps should
   be read as a defense of democracy, especially in its distinctively
   American formulation. This article will assess Warren's defense of
   democracy by attending to the argument of Democracy and Poetry, thus
   providing scholars of American politics with two opportunities otherwise
   unavailable: a modern prognosis of American democracy by one of her more
   prominent and perspicacious poets, as well as a poetic prescription for
   democracy's future in light of contemporary political, social, and
   economic challenges.},

Abstract = {Child marriage customs occur all over the world, whereby children are
   given into marriage well before they attain puberty in most cases or
   even the age to get married as defined by several laws in Nigeria and
   other countries of the world. It is a common thing today to find a
   prevalence of such practices widespread in several parts of the world
   particularly in Africa, Asia, and South America. Often times, child
   marriages are frequently associated with marriages that are conceived
   and arranged by parents, whereby, only one marriage-partner usually the
   female is a child. This practice has prevailed despite the fact that
   many countries in Africa have a legal regime on the minimum age for
   marriage which is either pegged on 16 or 18 depending on the country.
   Some reasons adduced in favour of the practice like conflict, poverty,
   religion, and tradition escalates incidence of early marriages in
   Sub-Saharan Africa.
   In Nigeria, A significant number of early marriage is prevalent in most
   cultures in the country with most girls married off by age 15, and
   several others married off by the time they attain the age of 18. This
   practice is extremely prevalent in some communities in the Northwest
   region of Nigeria. However, in recent times it is noteworthy that the
   activities of human rights groups condemning child marriages and
   highlighting its attendant consequences have considerably brought about
   a remarkable decline of the practice in several parts of Nigeria.
   In this paper, we examined the high incidence of early marriage in
   Nigeria and argued that despite the availability of legal regime on
   early marriage as well as Nigeria's international human rights
   obligations, much more work is needed to eliminate the detrimental
   cultural practice of child marriage of young girls in Nigeria and
   proffered a solution to its menace.},

Abstract = {Although the New Labour period witnessed a high degree of institutional
   formation in the United Kingdom, many of its initiatives, from regional
   development agencies to the Film Council, have not survived. One
   exception is the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts
   (NESTA). Using interviews and unpublished documentation, this article
   traces the pre-history of NESTA, its origins as an idea in the last
   years of the Major administration, the policy networks that helped
   develop it and its realisation under New Labour. The argument is that by
   examining the trajectory of NESTA, we can see many of the themes of New
   Labour's cultural policy, particularly what came to be thought of as its
   `creative economy' policy, under which an early enthusiasm for
   supporting small cultural businesses was replaced by the discourse of
   creativity and innovation, progressively emptying the policy of its
   concerns with culture in favour of a focus on economic growth.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the memoirs of Hassan Rowhani, Iran's chief nuclear
   negotiator (2003-2005) and newly elected president, this paper considers
   the impact of the Bush Administration's Iran policy on the internal
   politics of the Islamic Republic and the dynamics of its nuclear
   negotiation strategy. It argues that the administration had a
   detrimental effect on international nuclear negotiations with Iran and
   should be considered at least partially responsible for the current
   nuclear impasse. Identifying three key areas, it focuses on the
   administration's rejection of constructive engagement with the
   relatively moderate government of President Mohammad Khatami; the
   negative influence of the USA during Iran's nuclear negotiations with
   the EU3; and the administration's refusal to provide the Iranians with
   confidence-building incentives, or countenance unconditional nuclear
   talks, despite a policy change in Washington that was ostensibly
   multilateralist and gave the impression of directly engaging with the
   Iranians.},

Abstract = {Legally independent central banks leave elected politicians with little
   direct control over monetary policy. The most important indirect channel
   of influence for governments thus consists in appointing `responsive'
   central bank officials and removing `hostile' ones. This premise is
   tested by examining the effect of partisan ties between central bank
   governors and governments or presidents in 30 European democracies
   between 1945 and 2012. Drawing on an original dataset containing
   information on the party affiliations of 195 governors, event history
   models are employed to show that affiliation with a party represented in
   the executive (the government or the presidency) has a large and
   significant positive effect on governor survival. However, affiliation
   with an opposition party only increases governors' hazards during the
   first four years of their term, suggesting that the impact of the party
   label may be overridden as more reliable information about a governor
   becomes available.},

Abstract = {This paper uses the concepts of slavery, citizenship, the body and
   political subjectivity to interrogate how gendered bodies are produced,
   regulated and normalised. It explores the `wrong body' claim within
   transsexual narratives to analyse how we can be enslaved by/to our body.
   The coercive force of embodied existence is demonstrated by examining
   how gender norms act on us through our bodies, thus identifying the body
   as a major conduit of power. It argues that the `wrong body' claim must
   be understood as a discursive construction that is rendered possible by
   established gender norms and practices, which place heavy restrictions
   on the available actions of individuals. These norms and practices are
   linked to the normalising processes of becoming an acceptable citizen.
   It is argued that the enslaving effects of embodiment can be mitigated
   through constructing alternative narratives of gender based upon
   performativity and fluidity. Such alternative gender narratives are used
   to contest and disrupt the meaning of the acceptable citizen, thus
   opening up new claims for citizenship and new forms of embodied
   subjectivity. These narratives are then used to critique the medical
   community's understanding and treatment of transsexuality, which is
   itself a site of coercion and normalisation.},

Abstract = {This work reflects on the character of the modalities that non-status
   migrants are deploying in the context of current politics of the camp,
   with special attention to the Italian context. It will suggest that once
   the possibilities of dissent through the voice (the political tool par
   excellence in a liberal democracy, and one associated primarily with
   rationality and the capacity for reason) are foreclosed, migrants tend
   to resort to another powerful tool: their own body. Detainees have made
   their bodies speak by resorting to practices of self-mutilation, hunger
   strike, suicide attempts, and lips and eyes sewing. Detainees' violent
   acts of dissent are not dissimilar from the violent modalities used, a
   few centuries earlier, by some enslaved people who chose liberty through
   death. The aim is not so much to make comparison between the two
   figures, but to emphasise the way in which, under conditions of extreme
   control, subjugation or unfreedom, acts of dissent and resistance - and
   thus acts of politics, as articulated in Ranciere's concept of dissensus
   - are not necessarily enacted through democratic practices but, on the
   contrary, through whatever modalities are available to them, including
   violent (self-harm) modalities.},

Abstract = {This study probes the institutional mechanism of democratic
   responsiveness and elite public policy agreement in particular. The
   theoretical idea is that institutions impact policy agreement via
   information asymmetry built into elite public relations. As institutions
   concentrates public authority and hence increase clarity of
   responsibility, the information asymmetry in elite public relations gets
   lower which, in turn, enhances the public's ability to sanction elites
   and, as a result, makes elites more responsive to the public. Relying on
   the 1996 Top Decision Makers Survey on European integration, a
   cross-national and multi-level analysis confirms the information
   asymmetry hypothesis. In particular, the results show that elite public
   policy agreement on European integration is stronger in countries with
   greater clarity of responsibility. However, evidence also reveals that
   the horizontal clarity of responsibility induces greater agreement
   between elites and the public than the vertical clarity of
   responsibility.},

Abstract = {Beyond traditional places for exchanges within organizations (for
   example, ward or branch meetings), virtual communication forums give
   members of political parties an opportunity to express their opinions on
   line. The social network of the Parti Socialiste (PS) in France, the
   Coopol, was created on January 12, 2010, and seems to hold out new
   prospects for public debate. The mediated exchanges which took place on
   this platform have allowed us to analyze the political debate among
   activists between July and October 2011. The results are based on
   different types of data (statistical analysis of text, web surveys and
   qualitative interviews) gathered while observing the debate on the forum
   and through interviews with voters and activists. The rationale for the
   use of three different approaches is related to the fact that the
   article presents several studies that can be evaluated in their totality
   but should be taken singly in each case. The information provided by
   this article makes it an important case study which explains in an
   empirical way the latest theoretical approaches within this research
   field.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the corruption among the governors in the
   Colombian Atlantic region. This is a research report that explores
   corruption levels among the governors and the factors that affect it.
   The central argument is that this region shows high levels of corruption
   (except for Atlantico) in which two modalities are articulated, the
   first modality expresses a combination of clans and political families,
   business and political networks of contractors; the second one includes,
   in addition, paramilitary criminal groups as actors of public resources
   appropriation and distortion of democratic political competition. It
   highlights as well that the action of the control entities is very
   active, but it is fundamentally sanctionatory and works primarily as a
   late and slow ex post control.},

Abstract = {Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) and gender equality have been
   defined as two priorities of the international development agenda in the
   last years and so have been recognized by the Spanish Cooperation.
   However, the Spanish commitment to PCD and gender equality shows
   political discourses and practices that are not always in line with the
   promotion of international development pro-gender equality. In this
   paper, we analyzed the different discourses on development and gender
   equality in the Spanish Cooperation during the period 2008-2012. In
   addition, we examine the structure and the funding for gender equality
   of the Socialist Government (2008-2011) and the Popular Government
   (2011-2012). The ultimate goal is to highlight the inconsistencies
   between the commitment to development and gender equality as well as its
   implications in relation to the promotion of PCD.},

Abstract = {Around 1980, states and corporations from core countries led by the U.S.
   government started to demand from other countries reforms that increased
   the scope and strength of private intellectual property rights. The
   resulting global upward ratchet of intellectual property protection has
   not developed uniformly across time and space. This study presents a
   theory of cross-national variation in intellectual property regimes
   based on a comparative-historical analysis of the making of intellectual
   property rules in South American soybean agriculture (Argentina, Brazil,
   and Paraguay). It concludes that a corporatist pattern of rule-making is
   conducive to a weak intellectual property regime (Argentina), whereas
   pluralism (Brazil) and state capture and abstention (Paraguay) are more
   conducive to strong intellectual property regimes.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a state of the art about a fundamental issue between
   the Western and Eastern world: the modernity as an identity element in
   Turkey. Consequently, four segments are developed according to the
   modernity and Turkish westernization: Fall of the empire, birth of the
   republic, military power and alignment with the Western world during the
   Cold War. This review contains key references in the deconstruction of
   the Turkish identity, which is an issue of great relevance in
   contemporary history, and reveals possibilities of change in Middle
   Eastern nations. The methodology was based on an extensive review of
   secondary sources according to each developed section, and included
   international databases, libraries and national bookstores. The latter
   implied the purchase of certain books to account references about
   Turkey.},

Abstract = {I examine the impact of depth and rigidity in international trade
   agreements. Increasing the depth of required cooperation lowers the
   likelihood of full compliance and the stability of a trade regime. In
   contrast, increasing the rigidity of an agreement raises the likelihood
   of full compliance and lowers stability. Both depth and rigidity can
   lower tariffs if a state does not defect from its treaty obligations. I
   argue that if we control for the benefits of trade liberalization, then
   observable treaties will have a negative relationship between depth and
   rigidity. Deep agreements will be flexible, while shallow agreements
   will be rigid.},

Abstract = {During the period of competitive capitalism, legal theory understands by
   law only the general rule and not every command of the sovereign. To say
   that the law is general is to give not only a description of its formal
   structure but also to indicate that it has a minimum of material content
   in that it guarantees a minimum of freedom. Legal theory and legal
   practice undergo decisive changes in the stage of monopoly capitalism.
   This period is characterized by the victory of the theory of free
   discretion which demands that the judge is freed from the fetters of
   positive law and shifts the center of gravity of the legal system to
   those legal standards of conduct. These legal standards of conduct are
   stressed since they are an excellent means for furthering monopolistic
   interests to which rational law merely constitutes an obstacle. The
   legal theory of monopoly capitalism was implemented by National
   Socialism. If we undestand by law a system of norms distinguished from
   the will or command of the sovereign, then we must deny a specific legal
   character to the legal system of the authoritarian state.},

Abstract = {How does political ambition affect strategies of cooperation in
   Congress? What activities do legislators develop with their peers to
   maximize their career goals? One of the main collaborative activities in
   a legislature, cosponsorship, has been widely analyzed in the literature
   as a position taking device. However, most findings have been restricted
   to environments where ambition is static (i.e., legislators pursuing
   permanent reelection), which restricts de facto the variety of causes
   and implications of legislative cooperation. I analyze patterns of
   cosponsorship as a function of ambition in a multilevel setting where
   legislators praise subnational executive positions more than a seat in
   the House. Through the analysis of about 48,000 bills introduced in the
   Argentine Congress between 1983 and 2007 and the development of a map of
   political careers, I follow a social networks approach to unfold
   different patterns of legislative cooperation. Findings show that
   patterns of cooperation among prospective gubernatorial candidates are
   strongly positive, while similar effects are not observed at the
   municipal level.},

Title = {Can oil-reliant countries democratize? An assessment of the role of

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {722-742},
Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {A cursory look around the world shows that few oil-reliant countries can
   be categorized as democracies, particularly those in the Middle East. In
   fact, many studies have suggested that oil wealth hinders
   democratization. The recent ``Arab Spring{''} and subsequent political
   instability in oil-producing states such as Algeria, Egypt, Libya and
   Syria gives rise to questions regarding the prospects for democracy in
   these types of countries. This article provides an analysis of the
   possible role that civil society may play in democratization in
   oil-reliant states by looking at the case of Algeria. I argue that the
   seemingly meaningless and artificial acts of ``liberalization{''}
   initiated by the Algerian government in the late 1980s, which initially
   allowed civic associations to form, have provided an opening for some
   civic associations to organize and oppose the government. This process
   of liberalization, regardless of how empty it may have seemed at first,
   has ``opened floodgates{''} that now cannot be closed. Thus, the recent
   protests in Algeria, and continued opposition to the government, can be
   seen as directly facilitated by the government's prior liberalization
   and opening of the system to civic associations.},

Abstract = {This article advances the discussion of democratization as a complex
   process. Much of the democratization story focuses on wealth and how it
   advances or maintains liberalization. However, in this work, we
   demonstrate that the route to democracy and the route to wealth lie in
   the limitations on the state, specifically the rule of law which holds
   the state accountable as it creates a realm of sovereign space for man.
   We focus on the rule of law and evaluate how the lack of corruption in
   government and the enforcement of property rights impact wealth, the
   formation of civil society, and the corresponding shift of power
   structures that lead to democratization efforts. We analyze the
   hypothesized relationships through a nested analysis design, focusing on
   the developing world, where previous modernization theories have been
   less applicable, and explain how rule of law has an increasing impact on
   both development and democratization.},

Abstract = {Framing plays an important role in public policy. Interest groups
   strategically highlight some aspects of a policy proposal while
   downplaying others in order to steer the policy debate in a favorable
   direction. Despite the importance of framing, we still know relatively
   little about the framing strategies of interest groups due to
   methodological difficulties that have prevented scholars from
   systematically studying interest group framing across a large number of
   interest groups and multiple policy debates. This article therefore
   provides an overview of three novel research methods that allow
   researchers to systematically measure interest group frames. More
   specifically, this article introduces a word-based quantitative text
   analysis technique, a manual, computer-assisted content analysis
   approach and face-to-face interviews designed to systematically identify
   interest group frames. The results generated by all three techniques are
   compared on the basis of a case study of interest group framing in an
   environmental policy debate in the European Union.},

Abstract = {In August 2005, just a month after the announcement that London had
   succeeded in its bid to host the 2012 Olympic Games, the UK national
   press witnessed a brief rash of stories alleging the presence of a
   crocodile or similar water monster lurking beneath the surface of the
   River Lea the river that runs from the town of Luton in Bedfordshire
   down to join the Thames adjacent to the Olympic site. This story
   re-emerged in November 2011 when a campaigner against the environmental
   impact of the Olympics on the river area claimed to have seen further
   evidence of crocodilian activity. This article will explore the reasons
   for the proliferation of this story, in terms both of its function as a
   metonymic news-hook (it opened up directly related concerns as to the
   impact, organisation and security of the Games) and of its metaphorical
   significance (its incarnation of a superstructure's fears of an emerging
   threat of a monstrous underclass - one that might at once comprise
   terrorists, rioters and anti-establishment campaigners). It will
   conclude by suggesting that this monstrous myth might hold within it the
   possibility of the convergence of populist news media and popular
   democracy.},

Abstract = {The idea of the university as it originated in medieval Europe was that
   of a self-governing community of teachers and students. However that
   ideal has been undermined in Australia, where legislative changes over
   the past 20 years have led to a progressive diminution in university
   autonomy. Changes to Commonwealth and State legislation mean that
   universities are now subject to the same internal governance rules as
   trading corporations, and these are incompatible with the mission of a
   university and with academic independence. In addition, the regulation
   of universities has become so invasive that they can no longer be seen
   as truly autonomous self-accrediting institutions. This article examines
   the harmful effect of these changes and suggests what changes should be
   made to the law in order to restore a governance framework for
   universities which is consistent with their social purpose.},

Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3},
Pages = {288-313},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This essay places Isaiah Berlin's famous ``Two Concepts of Liberty{''}
   in conversation with perspectives defined as black fugitive thought. The
   latter is used to refer principally to Aime Cesaire, W. E. B. Du Bois
   and David Walker. It argues that the trope of liberty in Western liberal
   political theory, exemplified in a lineage that connects Berlin, John
   Stuart Mill and Benjamin Constant, has maintained its universal meaning
   and coherence by excluding and silencing any representations of its
   modernity gestations, affiliations and entanglements with Atlantic
   slavery and European empires. This particular incarnation of theory is
   characterized as the Western discursive and hegemonic effects of
   colonial-racial foreclosure. Foreclosure describes the discursive
   contexts in which particular terms or references become impossible to
   formulate because the means by which they could be formulated have been
   excluded from the discursive context. Through an examination of the
   action of foreclosure, based largely on unraveling the liberal-colonial
   convergences of Two Concepts the essay reflects on the political and
   theoretical problems posed for black political thought by the hegemony
   of Western formulations of liberty that deny their indebtedness to
   Western colonialism. Drawing upon juxtapositions between white
   liberal/republican thinkers and black fugitivity thinkers, it argues a
   particular lineage of black political thought is compelled to conceive
   of itself as an escape from the colonial and racial hegemony of Western
   liberty.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to investigate the discourse of Vaclav Klaus on
   European integration by analysing his discourse on the euro during his
   term of office as President of the Czech Republic. The authors apply
   critical discourse analysis to selected speeches by Klaus, using their
   findings to analyse Klaus's position on the euro and European
   integration through the conceptual lens of soft versus hard
   Euroscepticism and the difference between the strategic and ideological
   foundations of Klaus's views. The research confirms the expectation that
   a consistent, deeply ideological motivation lies behind Klaus's
   negligible concern for strategy, as well as finding a connection between
   national-conservative political and neoliberal economic streams in
   Klaus's political thought. The analysis also brings interesting insights
   into the debate over the concept of Euroscepticism.},

Abstract = {Political scientists have been caught by surprise by some of the world's
   most dramatic political transformations. To assess how the discipline
   fared in explaining two of the most large-scale and unexpected
   developments of the past decades, we compare scholarship around the time
   of popular mobilization in Eastern Europe in 1989 and the Arab world in
   2011. We argue that while scholars cannot be expected to predict utterly
   extraordinary events such as revolutions and mass mobilization, in these
   two cases disciplinary trends left scholars ill-prepared to explain
   them. Political scientists used similar paradigms to study both regions,
   emphasizing their failure to develop politically and economically along
   the lines of Western Europe and the United States. Sovietologists tended
   to study the communist bloc as either anomalously totalitarian or
   modernizing towards ``convergence{''} with the West. Likewise, political
   scientists studying the Arab world focused disproportionately on the
   prospects for democratization or the barriers to it, and they now risk
   treating the 2011 protest movements essentially as non-events if they
   are not clearly tied to institutional democratic reform. By broadening
   their research agendas beyond a focus on regime type, political
   scientists will be better prepared to understand future changes in the
   Middle East and elsewhere.},

Abstract = {This article explores the implications of Charles Taylor's politics of
   recognition for a global feminist theory. The main contention is that
   Taylor's thought implies an innovative dialogue about human rights that
   assists a flexible understanding of diverse women's needs. This central
   claim is developed, however unexpectedly, by focusing on the
   controversial practice of footbinding. Prevalent in imperial China, this
   debilitating convention was supported by values that contrast markedly
   with those of the modern West. The case thus confronts global feminists
   with the serious issue of comprehending sympathetically the lived
   concerns of diverse human beings, while reacting critically to the
   oppression that they may experience. A creative reading of Taylor's
   theory here yields, I argue, commitments to two normative claims that I
   call `narrativity' and `instability'. Together, these claims promise not
   a static form of recognition based on uncontroversial rights to autonomy
   or bodily integrity but an imaginative dialogue which is sensitive to
   cultural differences in the interpretation of human needs and critical
   of culturally diverse forms of oppression. The critique of footbinding
   implied by Taylor's thought is finally developed through comparison with
   contemporary cosmetic surgeries in the West. The study reveals a
   feminist politics of recognition attuned to subaltern struggles over the
   meaning of human rights and of women as active participants in this
   vital, ongoing work.},

Abstract = {Several recent field experimental studies show that social pressure
   raises the likelihood of turning out to vote in elections. Ratcheting up
   social pressure to show subjects their own as well as their neighbors'
   prior voting history significantly increases the effectiveness of direct
   mail messages. A key component in stimulating this effect seems to be
   the presence of individual vote history. When voters are presented with
   less specific turnout information, such as vote history for the
   community at-large, the effects on turnout often dissipate. Sensitizing
   voters to such descriptive norms appears to do little to stimulate
   participation. To address this contrast, this study presents results
   from a voter mobilization field experiment conducted in Hawthorne, CA
   prior to the November 2011 municipal elections. The experiment is a
   fully crossed 2 x 3 factorial study in which subjects were randomly
   assigned to one of six conditions, in which they receive no mailing, a
   mailing with individual vote history only, a mailing with individual
   vote history and a message emphasizing high (or low) community-level
   turnout from a previous election, and a mailing emphasizing high (or
   low) community-level turnout only. County voter files were used to
   randomly assign voters to treatment and control and to report the
   effects of each mailing on voter turnout. We find that only messages
   that included information about subjects' own voting histories
   effectively mobilized them to vote.},

Abstract = {Most assessments of the influence of scholars and public intellectuals
   focus on their ideas, which are based upon an implicit assumption that
   their widespread circulation are a result of the veracity and strength
   of the ideas themselves, rather than the processes of production and
   distribution, including the intellectual's own contribution to the
   ideas' popularity by attending conferences and public rallies, writing
   for periodicals, and so on. This concise article offers an assessment of
   the late Stuart Hall's role as a socialist public intellectual by
   connecting the person, scholar and public intellectual to the
   organisations, institutions and publications through which his
   contributions to both cultural studies and left politics were produced
   and distributed. This article includes an emphasis on Hall's
   `Thatcherism' thesis and his public interventions via the periodical,
   Marxism Today, during the 1980s.},

Abstract = {In this article, I examine how term limits affect the amount of time
   that legislators focus on constituency service and fundraising. I use
   data from the 2002 U.S. State Legislative Survey conducted by Carey,
   Niemi, Powell, and Moncrief to provide support for my hypotheses. The
   results from the data analysis suggest that in the presence of term
   limits, legislators with long-term career goals in politics spend less
   time on constituency service activities and more time on fundraising
   with their caucus. For legislators with short-term career goals in
   politics, there is very little evidence to suggest that term limits have
   an effect on how much time they spend on constituency service activities
   and fundraising activities.},

Abstract = {Why do people see elections as fair or unfair? In prior accounts,
   evaluations of the election depend on people's candidate preferences,
   where supporters of the winning candidate tend to call the election fair

   perceptions of election fairness reflect not just the election outcome,
   but also the campaign process. Using a set of multilevel models and data
   from the 1996-2004 American National Election Studies, I explore the
   consequences of campaign experiences in shaping people's evaluations of
   the fairness of a presidential election. I find that as campaign
   competition increases, people are less likely to translate their
   feelings about the candidates into their evaluations of the election.
   Rather than alienating citizens, competitive campaigns mitigate the
   effects of prior preferences in a way that promotes the legitimacy of
   elections. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The article addresses the crucial but still relatively understudied
   issue of political perceptions, specifically the perceptions of members
   of parliament (MPs) regarding the positioning of voters on the
   left-right spectrum, and the accuracy thereof. It focuses on the
   Portuguese case, which differs from others studied to date in terms of
   the links between MPs and voters (in contrast to prior research,
   Portuguese voters do not vote for an MP candidate but for a party list;
   the representation process is mediated by political parties). The
   article begins by characterizing Portuguese MP perceptions of voters'
   left-right positions, and then explores the reasons for MPs' perceptual
   accuracy. The findings show that MP perceptions are shaped by wishful
   thinking, reiterating previous research, and that party integration is
   an important new factor explaining perceptual accuracy.},

Title = {Progressiveness and the New Right: The Electoral Relevance of Culturally

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {584-604},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Whereas electoral support for new-rightist parties is often understood
   as driven by ethnocentric anti-immigrant sentiments, scholars have noted
   that new-rightist politicians have, surprisingly, stressed culturally
   progressive arguments in the last decade. Using recent Dutch survey data
   (N = 1,302) especially collected for this purpose, the article analyses
   the electoral relevance of three types of cultural progressiveness for
   voting for the new right and their relation to the well-documented
   anti-immigrant agenda. The analysis shows that neither moral
   progressiveness nor aversion to public interference of religious
   orthodoxy underlies the new-rightist vote. Support for freedom of speech
   proves relevant, but, in accordance with literature on the new right's
   electoral strategy and with theorising on framing, this only leads
   towards the new right among those who are ethnocentric. These findings
   are discussed in the light of electoral competition, and questions for
   further research are formulated.},

Title = {Holding governments accountable? Individual heterogeneity in performance
   voting},

Abstract = {This study suggests that performance voting is characterised by
   extensive individual heterogeneity. Most economic voting studies to date
   treat voters as rather homogeneous in their reactions to economic
   performance of incumbents. Yet, a large and well-established line of
   research from the American context demonstrates the conditional impact
   of political sophistication and salience on voters' political attitudes
   and behaviour. Building on this work, this article explores
   individual-level variation in performance voting due to political
   sophistication and salience. Utilising cross-national data from the
   Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) including 25 democracies,
   performance voting is examined across an array of policy areas including
   the economy, social welfare, immigration and national security, and it
   is shown that political sophistication and salience are key moderators
   of performance voting. The findings suggest that holding governments to
   account for past performance is mainly the prerogative of the highly
   sophisticated and thus may be more laborious than previously assumed. At
   the same time, the results indicate that the sophistication gap in
   performance voting narrows when voters attach a higher degree of
   salience to a policy area. As long as voters care enough about
   government activities in a particular policy area, incumbents can expect
   credit or blame for policy outcomes. This should provide at least some
   impetus for responsive policy making.},

Abstract = {The political and collective self-perception of a protest movement is
   seen in the historical events, persons, and symbols it chooses in order
   to mobilise and integrate its supporters. In the first phase of the
   Euromaidan, references to the symbolism of the Ukrainian state and the
   European Union played a central role. The more determined resistance to
   the regime of President Viktor Yanukovych and its use of force became,
   the more Cossack traditions moved into the foreground. These symbolise
   the Ukrainian quest for freedom and the spirit of resistance. The Maidan
   became an incarnation of the Zaporizhzhian Sich. By contrast, dubious
   nationalist symbols, such as the red-black flag of the Organisation of
   Ukrainian Nationalists and images of Stepan Bandera, remained a rather
   peripheral phenomenon.},

   thermometers for Democrats and Republicans on items that measure
   African-American assessments of the political parties' ability to handle
   certain issues. The results indicate that those matters of race and
   economics influence party identification. Moreover, party competence
   perceptions influence partisanship more than party identification.
   Unlike the literature suggesting that individual factors are not
   significant, I find that individual life circumstances do influence
   African-Americans' party identification.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2014},

Abstract = {A significant and influential body of research suggests that electoral
   systems influence legislators' behaviour. Yet, individual legislators
   are potentially motivated by other concerns, such as policy and office.
   What happens when competing goals predict contradictory behaviour, for
   example, when electoral incentives clash with enticements to win prized
   post-election positions (mega-seats)? When party leaders cartelize the
   allocation of mega-seats, the anticipated effects of the electoral
   system on legislators' behaviour may dissolve - creating strong parties
   in the legislature despite a candidate-centred electoral system. New
   data on mega-seats and voting behaviour in the Irish parliament between
   1980 and 2010 supports the notion that mega-seat considerations trump
   the impact of the electoral system on roll-call behaviour. The
   implication is that what goes on within the legislature may be more
   important for influencing legislators' behaviour than what goes on at
   the ballot box.},

Abstract = {In this article, we advance a generic theory of institutional change and
   illustrate it through a study of the Gas Deregulation Act of 1977-78.
   The passage of the Act provides an informative case study about
   institutional change as an innovative postcloture filibuster was
   implemented, and then defeated, in the course of the debate. Contrary to
   Shepsle's argument that institutions determine outcomes, we argue that
   the legislative majority shaped the institution to get the policy
   outcome it wanted. We find evidence that negotiations among competing
   coalitions constrained outcomes to be inside the uncovered set. When the
   filibuster-related rules threatened to lead to an outcome outside of the
   uncovered set, the rules were changed to avoid this outcome. Our
   analysis calls into question both the view of majority rule as
   generically leading to chaos and the view that institutions are the
   essential tool to overcome such instability.},

Abstract = {Civic online participation garnered much interest during the last decade
   relative to the transformation of the concept of democracy in a move
   from representative to participatoty. In the European Union (EU), both
   the types and the number of online opportunities for citizen empowerment
   have divers fwd tremendously with the advancement of information and
   communication technology (ICT). The present study undertakes an in-depth
   research of Debate Europe, an online deliberation mechanism initiated in
   2008 by the European Commission. A quantitative and qualitative content
   analysis was carried out in order to examine thoroughly the
   contributions received from posters for the two most popular discussion
   threads on the English-language portal in the 2009 EP electoral year.
   The empirical evidence allowed for the identification of participation
   dynamics based on two dimensions: interactivity and rationality.
   Findings suggest that such moderated discussions advanced high
   interactivity and rationality that could provide valuable input at the
   EU level. While the prerequisites for a transition from micro-public
   spheres to transnational civic engagement exist, this is done only
   partially due to the lack of an adequate infrastructure to feedback
   opinions into institutional decision-making mechanisms in the EU.},

Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2014},
Number = {7},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {South Sudan, the newest state in the World, faces its first major crisis
   after just two years of existence. The current crisis was shaped around
   two tribe leaders, but also around two leaders of the same army and
   political party. At first it was about a political feud between
   President Kiir and former vice-president Machar; it continued with the
   supposition of a coup d'etat, led by Machar, and now the whole crisis is
   taking the form of an inter-ethnic civil war between the two dominant
   tribes in South Sudan, the Dinka and Nuer. The following article will be
   a conflict analysis of the current situation in order to determine the
   drivers of the conflict and how they influenced the parties' course of
   actions. Being a conflict analysis, it uses official and informal
   sources never used in the same place until now, together with the
   author's opinion about the con?lict, along with that of our fellow
   colleagues who studied the situation, in order to present a detailed and
   complex description of this new crisis in South Sudan.},

Abstract = {Populism has been on the rise for some time in Europe now, and its rise
   has been one of the key concerns of Peter Mair. He has linked it to the
   increasing erosion of the representative function of European party
   systems. The spectre that haunted him was partyless democracy', a
   democratic regime where parties had lost their representative function,
   which opened the door for unmediated populist protest. While largely
   sharing his interpretation of the overall structural trends giving rise
   to the populist challenges in Western Europe, the article is critical of
   the static character of his assessment. It suggests that there are three
   forms of protest populism', all of which may eventually end up
   transforming the West European party systems in the name of the new
   structuring conflicts that characterise contemporary European societies.
   In addition, it proposes to extend the scope of Peter's argument to the
   less established democracies of Central and Eastern Europe.},

Abstract = {This article introduces a novel dataset on the agenda of the European
   Council, the most powerful political body and core informal agenda
   setter of the EU. Using the approach taken by the Comparative Agendas
   Project, we trace political issue attention over a 38-year period
   (1975-2012). The insights in the agenda-setting processes within the
   European Council shed more light on the overall agenda of the EU and its
   temporal dynamics. This article explains the construction of the
   dataset, describes its features, and gives some examples of possible
   applications.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the relationship between direct democracy and
   political trust. We suggest a solution to the controversy in research
   centering on positive versus negative effects of direct democracy by
   analytically differentiating between the availability of direct
   democratic rights and the actual use of those rights. Theoretically,
   greater availability of direct democratic rights may enhance political
   trust by increasing citizens' perception that political authorities can
   be controlled as well as by incentivizing political authorities to act
   trustworthily. In contrast, the actual use of the corresponding direct
   democratic instruments may initiate distrust as it signals to citizens
   that political authorities do not act in the public's interest. We test
   both hypotheses for the very first time with sub-national data of
   Switzerland. The empirical results seem to support our theoretical
   arguments.},

Abstract = {Using data from the 2008 presidential nomination contest, we offer
   systematic tests of the relationships between traditional campaign
   factors, the Internet and campaign performance. We find that claims of
   the Internet's relevance to modern campaigns are warranted, as it is a
   unique facet of campaigns and significantly improves candidates'
   financial and electoral support. The Internet is especially helpful to
   candidates in generating small-donor contributions and in maximizing
   contributions after early primary victories. Overall, these findings
   suggest that the Internet offers a viable mechanism for long-shot
   candidates to overcome the resource demands of the current presidential
   nomination system.},

Abstract = {This article spells out the methodological and technical problems that
   arise when building a database on politicians holding a position in
   representative institutions. Using the example of an existing database
   of Spanish MPs (1980-2011), the authors discuss the criteria they have
   used and the solutions applied to solve several challenges: parsimony,
   social desirability, multicollinearity, temporality control, adjustment
   to electoral results, level of information, and electoral cycles. Some
   descriptive statistics related to the data as well as research questions
   regarding political elites are also put forward.},

   Outgroup Trust},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},

Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {125-142},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Most studies on ethnic diversity and social trust rely on the standard
   measure of generalized trust. This study complements existing work on
   this topic by examining the effect of diversity on trust toward
   outgroups. This innovation is motivated by two closely connected
   arguments: At first, most existent studies are conducted in the
   framework of intergroup contact and conflict theory. These theories
   directly allude to trust toward outgroups. Second, recent empirical
   studies show that the standard measure of generalized trust is much less
   generalized than theoretically assumed. Instead it is blurred by a great
   deal of particularized trust. Explicit outgroup trust therefore seems to
   be better suited to empirically testing the extent to which growing
   ethnic diversity influences trust toward people different from oneself.
   The cross-national analysis yields a positive relationship between
   diversity and outgroup trust, which is an interesting finding given the
   current debate dominated by conflict theoretical reasoning.},

Abstract = {With the advancements in modern capitalism, significant changes have
   been made in its goals and instruments. Past crises and the experiences
   acquired by economic institutions gave rise to the development of a
   special pattern of consumption rooted in the industrial revolution. In
   the post-modern period, we can observe the rise of a new ideology which
   is going through its completing process very quickly and a large mass is
   gaining a new perspective and prestige in consumerist societies.
   Understanding a consumerist society helps us to find out what
   instruments and fighting strategies the ideology of consumption uses and
   to what it causes damage. The role of the media is very important in
   this regard because they help to create false needs using virtual
   methods. On the other hand, due to the close relationship between
   ideology and politics, the consumerism crisis in society can be
   politically managed with success. In this regard, it is necessary for
   the political managers to understand different dimensions of the
   existing crisis and the challenges of the consumerist society and to
   find appropriate scientific and practical solutions to the problem. The
   main purpose of the present study is to shed some light on the
   challenges of a consumerist society by analyzing the features of the
   ideology of consumption and to focus on the influential role modern
   human beings play in this society as consumers and to evaluate the
   political dimensions of management of consumption pattern.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the evolution of the role and the nature of the
   work that elected representatives in Westminster-type parliamentary
   systems accomplish in their riding. Drawing on recent data documenting
   the riding activities of Quebec's Members of the National Assembly and
   Members of Parliament, we re-evaluate the conclusions of surveys
   conducted more than 40 years ago. The new data points to gender-based
   differences in the way elected representatives understand their role and
   the expectations of their constituents. Today's elected parliamentarians
   are still primarily concerned with their function as representatives of
   the people, while they are less driven by personal ideas. We also find

Abstract = {This paper identifies and describes two new norm-based strategies for
   institutional change to address intractable social problems. In both
   strategies, advocates foreground and criticize norms supporting the
   institutional status quo before either promoting an alternative existing
   norm via normative reframing of the issue, or creating and promoting an
   entirely new norm via normative innovation to build support for new
   institutional arrangements. Drawing on examples of institutional change
   addressing the problems of climate change and violence against women,
   the analysis illustrates how these strategies are especially effective
   in the face of opposition from vested interests or problematic existing
   norms.},

Abstract = {Holders of rights sue the intermediately service providers (ISPs) for
   contributory liability through the ISPs knowledge of infringement
   specifically for copyright infringement trademark and other rights.
   Formalism in the light of corrective justice strictly limits ISPs
   liability to fault based liability theory, but to evaluate ISPs fault
   gives credit to the probabilistic knowledge that requires ISPs to serve
   as the police for owners of rights. Furthermore, they are for
   establishing corrective justice law applies the mathematics though on
   the knowledge of fault via attempts to achieve all of the answers
   regarding the measure of evaluating ISPs' knowledge from secondary
   liability rather than computing philosophy, social science, or realism.
   Other common theories recognize chief justice brain or reasonable man
   mind induced as critical of ISPs' knowledge of infringement. This is in
   contrast with computing mind philosophy. Research will answer
   inconsistency of theories and ISP knowledge to protect all parties'
   rights.},

Abstract = {Scholars have found that, even when a crisis creates demand for reform,
   a focal point is often necessary to overcome obstacles to change. I
   argue that, with surprising frequency, U.S. blue-ribbon commissions use
   their bipartisan political credibility to provide this focal point and
   thereby catalyze postcrisis government reform. Since commission-inspired
   reform is often designed to integrate or centralize policy making, I
   further explain that commissions can be useful presidential tools for
   asserting power over agencies. I test my argument on an original data
   set that includes new measures of commission influence.},

Abstract = {This article examines the gender ideology of the parliamentary radical
   right populist party (RRPP) - the Sweden Democrats. More specifically,
   the article analyses how the party integrates old nationalist ideas
   about the importance of traditional gender roles and male superiority
   for the stability and welfare of the nation with new nationalist ideas
   about Sweden as the most gender-equal nation in the world. Prior studies
   suggest that RRPPs have integrated gender equality as a policy measure
   against multiculturalism and immigration. Our analysis shows this to be
   true also of the Sweden Democrats. However, unlike prior scholarship, we
   argue that the integration of gender equality is a tenuous and difficult
   one, as nationalist ideologies generally rest on ideas of sexual
   difference and male superiority. While the Sweden Democrats claim to
   support gender equality in discussions of multiculturalism and
   immigration, the party is a fierce critic of gender equality in all
   other contexts.},

Abstract = {The author compares two political parties, one from Eastern/Central
   Europe, and the other from Western Europe - Hungarian Jobbik and Dutch
   Party for Freedom of Geert Wilders - to portray some of the
   similarities, as well as the differences, between radical right parties
   in Western and Eastern European countries. The article is divided into
   three parts. In the first part, the author presents the contemporary
   radical right. Contemporary radical right, in comparison to the interwar
   radical right, is not necessary anti-systemic, but mainly
   ultra-nationalistic, xenophobic and homophobic. Although the term
   radical right describes one party family, this party family has
   significant internal differences. Therefore, there are many definitions,
   which are trying to grasp this political phenomenon. The second part of
   the article analyses the Hungarian Jobbik. The author concludes that
   Jobbik satisfies all the characteristics of the radical right, and
   therefore represents a truly radical right party. The third part of the
   article is devoted to the Dutch Party for Freedom. The author concludes
   that this party can also be regarded as a radical right party.},

Abstract = {State legislatures have been extremely active in passing legislation
   relating to all facets of immigration policy over the last several
   years. In this article, I develop a framework that explains how party
   ideology, party control of the legislature, and electoral conditions
   affect the likelihood that a state legislature will adopt policies that
   increase immigration enforcement. I test my arguments using state
   immigration policy adoption data that span from 2005 to 2011. I find
   that conservative Republican state parties are more likely to pass
   legislation enhancing immigration enforcement-on the condition that the
   Republican Party controls the state's legislative institutions. However,
   the willingness of Republican-controlled legislatures to pass
   immigration reform is often tempered by electoral concerns.
   Republican-controlled legislatures in states where Latinos make up a
   large proportion of the electorate are significantly less likely to
   adopt new legislation that targets undocumented migrants. I argue that
   Republican support for increasing sanctions on undocumented migrants is
   eroded by the potential for an electoral backlash from Latino voters.
   Democratic-controlled legislatures are unlikely to pass legislation
   under any conditions. Ultimately, the observed pattern of policy
   adoption is the product of the trade-off between the state parties'
   ideologically driven policy goals and the electoral consequences
   associated with actually implementing immigration policies.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes a rich Swedish data set with information on the
   electoral turnout of a large sample of adoptees, their siblings, their
   adoptive parents, and their biological parents. We use a simple
   regression framework to decompose the parent-child resemblance in voting
   into pre-birth factors, measured by biological parents' voting, and
   post-birth factors, measured by adoptive parents' voting. Adoptees are
   more likely to vote if their biological parents were voters and if they
   were assigned to families in which the adoptive parents vote. We find
   evidence of interactions between the pre- and post-birth factors: the
   effect of the post-birth environment on turnout is greater amongst
   adoptees whose biological mothers are nonvoters. We also show that the
   relationships between parental characteristics, such as education, and
   child turnout, persist even in the absence of a genetic link between
   parent and child. The regression-based framework we utilize provides a
   basis for the integration of behavior-genetic research into mainstream
   political science.},

Abstract = {We argue that the Supreme Court's long-term goal of maintaining
   legitimacy and institutional power reflects an underdeveloped strategic
   consideration in models of judicial decision making. Our article posits
   that both institutional-and policy-related incentives exist for the
   Court to engage in strategic behavior, and that those motivations may be
   differentially applicable to decision making in constitutional versus
   statutory cases. Our results offer broad confirmation of the above
   hypotheses, providing an important supplement to our understanding of
   how Congress may affect the Supreme Court's role in constructing legal
   policy.},

Abstract = {Judith Shklar's dictum, `the worst evil of cruelty', is well known. What
   this means for her political theory and how such theory is construed are
   rarely explored. This article maintains that Shklar's turn towards
   cruelty/suffering has a specific role in the development of her
   political argument. It allows her both to curb her long-standing
   skepticism, and to use it creatively. This is because suffering must be
   examined from the perspectives of history and philosophy, which produce
   two sets of knowledge, each limiting the overbearing tendencies of the
   other. The way Shklar uses the tension between history and philosophy
   for progressive purposes, and her idea that politics can mediate between
   history and philosophy, makes her a very contemporary theorist, similar
   to those who critically engage foundationalism without wanting to
   dispose of it completely. Approaching Shklar's `Putting Cruelty First'
   through her engagement with history and philosophy, and making use of
   the concepts of `realism' (Bernard Williams) and `weak ontology'
   (Stephen White) to do so are a more productive route to understanding
   her dictum than the usual one of examining it through the prism of her
   `liberalism of fear'.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1},
Pages = {54-67},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {The Convoy of No Confidence' was a trucking convoy that converged on
   Canberra in 2011 in a failed attempt to force the Gillard Labor
   government to an early election. At the time, there was widespread
   speculation that it was an astroturf' or synthetic grassroots movement.
   This article assesses the extent to which this alleged astroturf event
   exhibited populist elements, measured against Taggart's definition of
   populism. Unlike most Australian populist movements, which have been
   hostile towards all major parties (or all the big banks), the convoy's
   participants directed their anger almost entirely towards the Gillard
   government. In this, they were joined by Coalition politicians and
   right-wing media. The article finds that such one-sidedness is
   insufficient to characterise the convoy definitively as an Astroturf
   group, and therefore not genuinely populist. It also suggests that there
   may be a continuum between populist and astroturf
   movements.????2011??????????????,???????????????????????????????????????

Abstract = {Edward Snowden was castigated by government officials and mainstream
   mass media as a traitor, spy, and international criminal when he
   released information about the National Security Agency (NSA) secret and
   massive surveillance of virtually all U.S. electronic communication.
   More than ``wiretapping{''} is involved in the spin being put on
   Snowden's revelations. A lot of institutional duplicity has been
   revealed. The reaction of United States officials can be seen as a
   dramatic performance to demonstrate their moral resolve and complete
   power (even as Snowden challenged it) in order to dissuade other
   whistleblowers from following suite, as well as maintain authority and a
   discourse of fear about terrorism that justifies surveillance and other
   forms of social control.},

Abstract = {This essay proposes a specific discussion regarding the reason why in
   Mexico, in general terms, there are bad governments. The assumption is
   that the reason is not just that there is lack of capacity or technical
   instruments in Mexican governments. Rather, the main reason to be
   proposed is that governments in democratic contexts are affected all the
   time by political actors, projects, and conflicts. Is the capacity to
   achieve objectives in this uncertain context what makes a good
   government. How to achieve this capacity, in order to resolve public
   problems? The most important strategic way is to develop open and
   democratic governments; ones that are able to achieve results
   negotiating, discussing and debating options with different political
   and social actors. In other terms, governments that are able to use its
   political nature in order to, through democratic means, achieve its
   objectives. Administrative politics or administering politics might
   become useful words to understand the idea of goo governments defended
   in this essay.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},

Abstract = {Establishing an administrative body dedicated to European integration is
   the favourite option chosen by European Union (EU) member states prior
   to their accession. Since the political change of 2004, Georgia is
   European-oriented and still expressing its will for joining the EU. In
   this regard, Georgia has created a Ministry for European and
   Euro-Atlantic Integration. However, the Tbilisi-based authorities have
   not applied yet, and the Brussels-based institutions do not consider its
   partner as a potential candidate. In fact, the Transcaucasian Republic
   considers itself as a European nation and is subsequently looking for
   closing ties with the EU, which is considered as a shield against the
   Russian threat. Therefore, the ministry's goals are the Europeanization
   of Georgia as well as gaining value in the EU's eyes. The following
   article is written from an administrative point of view, with an
   analysis of the structure of European and Georgian ministries, and
   interviews with Georgian officials.},

Abstract = {This article studies the gender values that are promoted both in the

   Revenue Policy of the Region of Madrid and in the events that are
   organized for this group by public institutions and NGOs. The process of
   ``socialization{''} that occurs in the educative groups for Gypsy women
   is focused on constructing an image of what it is to be a ``Gypsy modern
   woman{''}. Through multiple mechanisms and discursive techniques a
   specific conception of gender equality is transmitted in these educative
   spaces. In addition to this, Gypsy women are continually urged to assume
   certain values and social practices (of gender identity, of
   ``citizenship{''}, of parenting, etc..), while an archetype of ``Gypsy
   Woman{''} which condenses powerful stereotypes and prejudices about the
   ``Gypsy culture{''} and the gender relations characteristics of this
   group is constructed.},

Abstract = {What normative principles should multicultural states be guided by in
   responding to minority claims for the accommodation of cultural and
   religious social practices? This article explores how theories of
   non-domination can contribute to debates on this question in the
   multiculturalism literature. It examines Philip Pettit's, Cecile
   Laborde's and Frank Lovett's republican theories and argues that
   non-domination-based approaches to multicultural accommodation are more
   suitable to assess the dynamic of intra- and inter-group relations than
   the prominent liberal-multiculturalist alternative. However, their
   advantages are not contingent on the wider theories from which they
   emerge, but rather related to generalizable features of the
   non-domination ideal. This suggests that non-domination should also be
   appealing to non-republicans, who can adopt it minimally as a critical
   principle to determine illegitimate policies.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the role of humanitarian intervention as a tool of
   foreign policy in the Conservative-led Coalition. The first section of
   the paper provides historical context and assesses the traditional
   approaches to humanitarian intervention as an instrument of foreign
   policy of Conservative governments since the end of the Cold War. This
   analytical narrative considers the Major Governments response to the
   Bosnian War. The second section of the paper considers the
   Conservative-led Coalitions approach to humanitarian intervention in two
   ways: first by an examination of the influence of Blairs humanitarian
   intervention and secondly, by an evaluation of British involvement in
   the Libyan Revolution of 2011. The third and final section of the paper
   offers an explanatory interpretation of the Conservative-led Coalitions
   humanitarian intervention. This interpretation is predicated on an
   English School theoretical framework for understanding international
   relations and, in particular, advances the argument that the global
   worldview of David Cameron, William Hague and their liberal Conservative
   colleagues can be understood as solidarist.},

Abstract = {The saga surrounding Iran's potential nuclearisation is a reflection of
   a more nefarious set of strategies that range from the exportation of
   the Islamic revolution and the spread of a militant brand of
   Ithna-Ashriya (Twelver/Imami) Shia ideology to a more
   geopolitically-centred projection of Iranian influence along the Arabian
   Gulf littoral and into the Arabian Peninsula for the objective of
   harnessing Iranian power over its main regional rivals, Saudi Arabia and
   the other GCC states. This work focuses on a single flashpoint - Bahrain
   - which the Islamic Republic identifies as a gateway for achieving these
   ambitions. It presents and explores the main lines of argumentation
   deployed by the Islamic Republic in the long-attempt to extend its
   sovereignty over Bahrain and shows how such proclamations may produce
   violence on the ground.},

Abstract = {In the UK, armed services personnel are perceived to become
   institutionalised during service, with negative connotations, especially
   in the process of transition to veteran status. Beverly P Bergman,
   Howard J Burdett and Neil Greenberg argue that institutionalisation is
   an inappropriate model, and that becoming a member of the armed forces
   is better represented by a model of culture shock, with reverse culture
   shock being experienced upon leaving. The adoption of this model would
   be useful both in preparing UK service personnel for civilian life and
   in supporting them after transition, and may help to predict
   vulnerability.},

   science and technology is highlighted. Moreover I present past research
   related to two more factors that are very important for the
   understanding of the information's distortions and biased perception of
   social world: that is (a) affect and availability heuristic, and (b)
   motivated reasoning. Consequences of the cognitive biases for the
   evaluation of risks related to technology are discussed},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1-2, SI},
Pages = {108-126},
Abstract = {This article contributes to the debate on the relationship between
   marketing and propaganda through an analysis of social marketing as a
   mode of governing in permanent campaigning. The working hypothesis is
   that social marketing operations are agitational rather than
   propagandistic. The conceptual approach stems from a comparison of
   propaganda and marketing with Fordist and post-Fordist modes of
   production and governance. The research into the role of agitation
   involves an empirical study of the UK government campaign against
   benefit fraud, the most expensive of its kind. Using a combination of
   methodologies, the political context is framed through a discourse
   analysis that charts the historical emergence of the problem of benefit
   fraud and the material effects of this discourse on welfare spending
   allocation, content analysis is used to identify correspondences between
   different newspapers' rhetoric and policy under different governments,
   and semiotic analysis helps to decode the message of the campaign
   against benefit fraud, as it relates to the overall government's
   strategy on this issue. The study offers insights into the political
   strategy of the government of New Labour between 1997 and 2010 and its
   resort to agitational techniques, exposing the limitations of government
   marketing and public relations in the context of an overall crisis of
   its political legitimacy, in both economic and political terms.},

Abstract = {Jan-Werner Muller provides a four-dimensional framework for
   comprehending conservatism as a political ideology. We focus on
   conservatism as a political philosophy, rather than an ideology, and
   provide more detailed analysis in order to re-assess Muller's framework;
   arguing that the suggested sociological and aesthetic dimensions do not
   play significant roles in defining political conservatism, while the
   suggested methodological and philosophical dimensions are better
   understood in terms of an alternative analytic structure.},
