Title = {Between punishment and discipline: comparing strategies to control
   unauthorized immigration in the United States},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {18},
Number = {6-7},
Pages = {579-599},
Abstract = {Immigration scholars have noted the rise of a distinctive discourse
   concerning immigrants in the United States. The `immigrant threat'
   discourse is said to portray immigrants as an existential threat to the
   country and contributes to highly restrictive enforcement policies.
   Through a close examination of national political debates concerning
   comprehensive immigration reform(CIR) (2005-2007), the paper shows that
   most politicians involved in this debate (from liberal Democrats to
   conservative Republicans) agreed with the basic assumptions of this
   general discourse. But the paper also identifies important variants on
   the `threat' discourse and associated strategies. Hardline conservatives
   stressed that the essential `illegalness' of immigrants posed a threat
   to the country. Protecting the nation state from this threat required
   policies to totally banish all undocumented immigrants from the country,
   irrespective of their `good' conduct or exceptional circumstances.
   Moderate and liberal reform advocates agreed with the idea that
   undocumented immigrants posed a threat to the country. However, they
   believed that banishment alone could not address the threat. Instead
   they advocated a strategy of risk management whereby the population
   would be differentiated according to levels of risk (high to low
   priority) and policies of inclusion and exclusion would be adjusted
   accordingly. This would allow the government to incorporate low
   risk/priority immigrants while freeing government resources to target
   the `truly threatening' groups (i.e., criminals, delinquents, homeless,
   repeat unauthorized entries, etc.). Thus, while both sides conceded that
   undocumented immigrants were a threat to the country, they developed
   important variants on the discourse and contrasting policy solutions to
   exert control over the population.},

Title = {Humanitarian encounters: Biafra, NGOs and imaginings of the Third World
   in Britain and Ireland, 1967-70},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2-3, SI},
Pages = {299-315},
Abstract = {This article examines the influence of the Biafran humanitarian crisis
   on British and Irish conceptions of the Third World. Drawing on evidence
   from non- government organizations (NGOs) in both countries, it argues
   that the explosion of non-governmental activity in this period, combined
   with the unprecedented attention afforded to the relief effort,
   crystallized a popular vision of the Third World that was rooted in
   western internationalism and the legacies of the imperial world. The
   model of humanitarian action pursued by Oxfam, Save the Children, Africa
   Concern and others transformed non- governmental actors into key
   mediators between the west and the Third World. Yet, this article
   argues, the image they presented and the tactics they pursued can only
   be understood as part of a broader adjustment to a decolonized world.
   From very different beginnings (British postcolonial responsibilities
   versus a strong anticolonial narrative in Ireland) considerable
   similarities emerged between British and Irish NGOs. The response to
   Biafra was an extension of the missionary and colonial service ethos,
   and generated a model of relief that privileged humanitarian action over
   local political and human agency. That paternalistic approach further
   reinforced traditional attitudes to the Third World through renewed
   emphases on donation, dependency, expatriate volunteers and western
   concepts of `needs' and `development'. This article concludes,
   therefore, by arguing that Biafra played a vital role in the shift from
   imperial humanitarianism to neo-humanitarianism and the rise of liberal
   humanitarian governance. The vision of an inclusive `common humanity'
   the NGOs espoused was in practice rooted in a very western understanding
   of humanitarian responsibilities and a very western image of the Third
   World.},

Abstract = {Terrorist acts by Boko Haram have attracted enormous scholarly attention
   in recent years. A majority of the studies have implicated Islam in the
   emergence and dynamics of the uprising. In contrast to this popular
   view, this article argues that, despite the strategic role played by
   Islamic religion in the uprising, terrorism and its security threats in
   northern Nigeria are more a product of a governance crisis including
   pervasive corruption, growing youth unemployment and poverty. It further
   argues that if good governance concurrently with development is not
   employed as a remedial strategy, the Nigerian State will further create
   a much more enabling environment for the growth of resistance from
   below. Thus, it concludes that good governance and credible leadership
   practices are antidotes to terrorism in Nigeria.},

Abstract = {What is the relationship between a personalistic style of government and
   presidential approval? And, to what extent the relationships between
   evaluations of the economy, partisanship and presidential approval are
   conditioned by a personalistic government style? We answer these
   questions using survey data and contextual information on government
   style. Data on government style comes from an original measure designed
   to capture this variable. Results suggest: Although all personalistic
   leaders establish an emotional link with people, some of them complement
   this link with authoritarian practices. There is a positive link between
   personalistic government style and presidential approval. Personalistic
   government style plays a conditional role as it boosts the effect of
   sociotropic evaluations on presidential approval.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {580-599},
Abstract = {Theorists have recently argued that in order to protect migrants from
   vulnerability and domination, host countries should grant voting rights
   to all residents, including those who are present on the territory on a
   temporary visa. Although we endorse the inclusive and egalitarian
   rationale of this approach, we argue that it is based on the presumption
   that all migrants aim at permanent inclusion and is therefore inadequate
   in the case of those who are engaged in `temporary migration projects'.
   We suggest that in order to provide these migrants with a form of
   political voice that fits their life plans, we need to look at different
   institutional tools than conventional voting rights, and we point to
   trade unions and migrant organizations as promising alternatives. We
   also show that, contrary to what may be thought of other forms of
   temporary mobility, temporary migration projects and the institutional
   solutions we propose in order to address the needs of the migrants
   involved are not disruptive of liberal-democratic institutions.},

Abstract = {In the context of the Colombian transitional process, this paper
   discusses, from two perspectives, the redress of indigenous women who
   have been victims of sexual violence. First of all, this article argues
   the importance of considering transitional justice from a political
   economy point of view, which takes into account the real possibilities
   the Colombian State has in order to do integral reparation to this group
   of victims. On the other hand, it suggests that understanding this
   political economy requires a questioning on the way sexual violence has
   affected women's bodily experience.},

Abstract = {During the First World War, around 35,000 Irishmen - hailing from both
   the north and south of the island - gave their lives fighting for the
   British Empire, of which Ireland was then a part. Many tens of thousands
   more served in Britain's armed forces in theatres around the globe, and
   especially on the Western Front. Yet this contribution has only recently
   been recognised by the general public in Ireland; and is largely
   overlooked by that in Britain. Catriona Pennell explores how tempestuous
   relationships and political division throughout the twentieth century
   have coloured the memory of the war within the British Isles.},

Abstract = {The contemporary political context of the Cold Post-war has seen diverse
   emerging phenomena such as the globalization, interrelation of
   communications, fragmentation of State power and a new concentration of
   power in non-state actors that compete and compromise the stability of
   the nation-state. Actors like the criminal organizations, inserted in
   the global crime networks, have become special competitors which are
   globally interconnected and generate political, economic and security
   problems around the world. From the perspective of political theory and
   security, this paper studies the problem of criminal organizations that
   join the global crime networks and work against the nation-state,
   especially the case of Colombia. In addition to this, it explains the
   origins of the criminal organizations, their development and global
   interaction; in the case of Colombia, the crime groups are analyzed, how
   they join the networks and communicate with groups in the Middle East,
   Italy, Mexico, Central America, Japan and China. Notwithstanding, this
   issue has a high impact on the Colombian economy and security.},

Abstract = {In 1791, being neither mentioned in the Code of Police nor in the
   Criminal Code, prostitution is de facto decriminalized. Yet, by adopting
   a scale of analysis that focused on police work, it appears that the
   prostitution phenomenon becomes an object of attentive reflection and
   definition of the central police administration under the Directory
   regime (1795-1799). Its records emphasize the constant vigilance
   exercised against the ``scandal of prostitution{''} that is particularly
   stated and denounced in reports on the state of esprit public. As an
   answer to prostitution decriminalization, this discourse and its ensuing
   practices develop the outlines of a new framework for action against
   prostitution. This paper will thus take this police administration's
   discourse seriously, account for its normative logics and its practical
   foundations and analyze its efficiency or inefficiency on the field of
   policing practices, in order to seize anew revolutionary politics of
   prostitution.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {76},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-57},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Even though visual images and television are ubiquitous in politics,
   surveys rarely use visuals to assess what people know about politics. I
   measure visual political knowledge in a series of experiments that ask
   otherwise identical questions using either relevant visual elements or
   words only. These experiments were embedded in two representative
   surveys of U.S. residents conducted in 2003 and 2008. Adding a visual to
   an otherwise identical knowledge question causes, on average, a small
   but significant increase in correct answers. Treatment effects are
   larger for a subset of the population: women, older people, the less
   educated, and people with a visual cognitive style all perform
   disproportionately better on visual knowledge questions. Validation
   shows that visual knowledge is as indicative of civic competence as
   verbal knowledge. Hence, traditional verbal-only questions miss a
   significant amount of political knowledge. Several population segments
   previously deemed ill-informed in fact store some political information
   visually.},

Abstract = {The article explores the evolution of the British Labour Party's
   ideology. After briefly touching upon the ideological origins of
   labourism and its development during the 20th century, the author
   analyzes in detail theoretical searching that unfolded within the party
   at the end of the last century and led to the emergence of the so-called
   ``New Labourism{''} that marked a rejection of etatist-redistributive
   social model and recognition of advantages of private initiative and
   market economy. Having notified a visible tendency among labourists to
   return to a more traditional agenda after 2007, N.Rabotyazhev suggests
   that the results of the Labour Party in the parliamentary elections in
   2015 will largely depend on whether it will manage to develop by that
   time a convincing project combining center-left values with the
   imperatives of globalization and ``new economy{''}.},

   regional peace, security and stability. As the largest regional
   organization with a strong expertise in assisting States and in
   capacity-building, also contributing to politico-military aspects of
   security by developing its own set of norms regulating transfers of
   conventional arms - some of them already going beyond the Treaty, some
   others complemented by the ATT's provisions -, the osce can do a lot to
   support and promote the new Treaty and its implementation, through the
   diversity of the positions expressed by its participating States.},

   transformations of the last decades that heralded the triumph of liberal
   principles only partly affected political, cultural and ideological
   foundations that define the inner world of the European peoples; and a
   variety of disasters and challenges of this century may reunite
   conservative ideas with their former conceptual value. In this case,
   ascribing values to these ideas, which are now largely depleted, will
   once again become popular and in demand.},

   individual countries. In order to be able to establish the differences
   and patterns in institutional profiles of the MFAs, this article
   proposes to observe the vertical and horizontal concentration in their
   organisational structures, the role of political-mandate based
   leadership and the balance between the main foreign policy focus areas.
   In the empirical part of the article, the MFAs of the 28 European Union
   member states are put into comparison. The article concludes by
   reflecting on the empirical and theoretical implications of the proposed
   characteristics of the institutional profiles.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the evolution of the Welfare State in American
   Federalism, highlighting the role played by Judicial Review. With such
   an aim, we first study the causes of the so-called ``American
   Exceptionalism{''}, in reference to the lack of constitutional
   enforcement of social rights. Concretely, we will focus on the
   frustrated attempts of the Supreme Court to give efficacy to certain
   social rights through the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal
   Constitution. Once this exception and its reasons are fully
   acknowledged, we are able to discuss how the construction of the welfare
   state in the United States, since the New Deal to the present day, has
   been accompanied by an interpretation of Federal categories very
   favourable to the powers of the National Congress. Similarly, we will
   analyse the limitations that state judges have when enforcing social
   rights protected in state constitutions as well as the current debate
   taking place at the state level regarding possible reformulations of the
   judicial function when it comes to implement provisions of social nature
   that require public policies. Finally, and in light of the recent case
   law of the Supreme Court, we will insist on the necessary judicial
   deference in cases in which Federal categories are used to implement new
   welfare goals.},

Abstract = {As a matter of fact, Kronstadt is a unique space: geographically
   situated on the watershed between Russia and Europe, it mostly preserves
   ``internal{''} orientation - in other words, aimed at its insulation,
   than external. Such historically formed space perception impacts the
   immunity of the bases of local identity among the citizens. Despite the
   loss of a forbidden city status in 1996, the features of isolatedness
   and peculiarity are still typical for Kronstadt. It is possible to
   follow these characteristics on the level of written sources, which
   clearly demonstrate the markers of this city's ``uniqueness{''}},

Abstract = {Documenting the extraordinary potency and reach of the European backlash
   against multiculturalism, this essay provides a new theoretical model
   for explaining it. Rather than focusing primarily on demographic and
   institutional facts about Islamic immigration - such as education,
   wealth, participation and mobility - the author proposes a cultural
   sociological approach that focuses on meanings and emotions as core
   issues for civil societies. As the demographic presence of Islamic
   immigrants has intensified, the anti-civil construction of Islamic
   qualities has led European masses, leaders and intellectuals, not only
   from the right but from the centre and left, to demand homogenizing
   assimilation. Representing public practices of Islam as threatening
   European democracy, newly restrictive citizenship tests have emerged
   alongside growing xenophobic political parties and newly threatening
   neo-fascist violence. Initially brought to Europe for economic and
   political reasons, the question has now become whether the children and
   grandchildren of Islamic immigrants can be incorporated into European
   civil society. The conflict is not over whether immigrants should be
   incorporated but over the grounds for doing so},

Abstract = {In East Asia, China's growing economic weight and economic initiative,
   along with the corresponding intensification of intra-East Asian
   economic ties, has renewed debates about the roles played by major power
   leadership in regional integration. Focusing on China's particular
   relations with Southeast Asian states, this article investigates the
   extent to which China can be said to be substantiating or redirecting
   existing patterns of East Asian integration. It does so by considering
   some basic markers of Chinese influence in trade, investment and aid, as
   well as the domestic-political and regional-political dimensions of
   leadership that can complicate the ability of otherwise materially able
   powers to lead. While recent economic initiatives like the Asian
   Infrastructure Investment Bank suggest that China is turning to a more
   proactive approach to East Asian integration, this article also
   highlights how any prospective leading Chinese role seems likely to be
   conditioned by a system of expectations and interests constituted by
   Southeast Asian states and their historical relations with the US and
   Japan.},

Abstract = {What effect do online public consultations have on legislative duration
   in the European Union? While scholars are divided on whether
   consultations speed things up or slow things down, they agree that
   consultations affect how decision-makers think about legislative
   proposals. I argue that this is only part of the story: the impact of
   consultations on legislation duration is also a function of the
   administrative capacity of decision-makers and their staff to process
   consultation submissions. I test this argument using a unique data set
   of over 750 legislative proposals in the period 2009-2013. I find that
   consultations tend to have a negative impact on the time it takes to
   pass legislation. However, this negative effect is less pronounced when
   decision-makers have sufficient administrative capacity to process
   submissions.},

Title = {Data, Measures and Methods The influence of the legislative
   redistricting of 2009: Methodological issues and first insights},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {In 2009, following a legislative redistricting lead by the right, 18.1
   per cent of the French cities moved from one constituency to another.
   The aim of this note is to provide some methodological issues about this
   redistricting and some insights about its influence on the electoral
   results. The main result goes in the sense of a partisan manipulation:
   due to the redistricting, the left lost 14 constituencies. Whereas it
   actually gained 333 constituencies in 2012, it would have gained 347
   constituencies if the redistricting had remained unchanged between 2007
   and 2012. However, the difference between these two proportions is not
   statistically significant. Consequently, even if it appears as if the
   left lost out from the 2009 redistricting, we conclude that it did not
   have a significant effect on the extent of the left's victory.},

Abstract = {Explanations for the incumbency advantage in American elections have
   typically pointed to the institutional advantages that incumbents enjoy
   over challengers but overlook the role of individual traits that
   reinforce this bias. The institutional advantages enjoyed by incumbents
   give voters more certainty about who incumbents are and what they might
   do when (and if) they assume office. We argue that these institutional
   advantages make incumbents particularly attractive to risk-averse
   individuals, who shy away from uncertainty and embrace choices that
   provide more certainty. Using data from 2008 and 2010 Cooperative
   Congressional Election Study, we show that citizens who are more risk
   averse are more likely to support incumbent candidates, while citizens
   who are more risk accepting are more likely to vote for challengers. The
   foundations of the incumbency advantage, we find, lie not only in the
   institutional perks of office but also in the individual minds of
   voters.},

Abstract = {Despite large population gains, political observers commonly refer to
   Latinos as a sleeping giant because of low voter turnout. Conversely,
   steady declines in union membership have led some to label organized
   labor a dinosaur. Several unions have made special outreach efforts to
   Latinos to rebuild their ranks and improve Latino political
   participation. Incorporating insights from the Civic Voluntarism Model,
   we find union affiliation increases Latino voter registration and
   turnout, and disproportionately so in comparison with non-Latinos and in
   recent elections. We conclude that continued declines in union
   membership have significant implications for Latino political power and
   inequalities in political voice.},

Abstract = {China's recent efforts in extending social protection resonate with the
   goals of the Social Protection Floor, even if Chinese policy-makers have
   not explicitly incorporated the Floor in the reform process. However, as
   this review of developments in the fields of social assistance,
   unemployment insurance, pensions, and health insurance suggests, major
   challenges persist, namely inadequate and declining benefit levels,
   funding issues, and fragmentation of the system, which to some degree
   have perpetuated existing inequalities. These challenges reflect a
   strong institutional heritage from the pre-reform era, which poses the
   biggest obstacle to the development of a coherent national social
   protection system.},

Abstract = {Research shows that when the more liberal Democratic Party controls the
   national government, unemployment is lower, but whether liberal state
   governments are associated with lower unemployment has not been
   examined. We argue that more left-leaning governments in the U.S. states
   have the same preference for and willingness to use government to reduce
   unemployment, but that the greater resource and policymaking constraints
   that the states face during economic downturns limit their ability to
   shape unemployment to economic growth periods. We find evidence for
   these arguments in an analysis of the U.S. states for the period of
   1975-2010. Specifically, when economic growth is low, liberal state
   governments are associated with increases in unemployment rates similar
   to or even somewhat higher than conservative governments, but when
   growth is moderate to high, liberal state governments are associated
   with greater-than-expected reductions in unemployment. We also provide
   some evidence that different state spending decisions between liberal
   and conservative state governments may explain these patterns.},

Abstract = {Voter participation is widely viewed as invaluable by democratic
   theorists, and a large majority of members of the Canadian public
   believe that low turnout weakens Canadian democracy. In response to
   decreasing rates of turnout in federal elections, Elections Canada has
   run advertising campaigns during the last several election campaigns
   encouraging Canadians to participate by voting. Using Election Canadian
   Study data from 2006 and 2008, this note examines the effect of
   Elections Canada's advertisements upon turnout and the partisan outcome
   of elections. Results reveal that the ad campaigns have effects upon
   both factors. The ads increase turnout among segments of the population
   with traditionally low turnout rates and are associated with an overall
   decrease in the Conservative party's vote share.},

Abstract = {The incumbency advantage is typically thought to constrain female
   political representation, but can female incumbency provide a signal to
   parties that reduces strategic gender bias? We argue that once women
   prove they can win elections, parties will revise their strategic
   evaluations of their value as candidates. We test this using an original
   dataset of twenty-one Chilean elections between 1989 and 2012. We use a
   Heckman selection model to assess re-election rates by incumbent
   candidate gender, conditional on the re-nomination of incumbents. We
   find that female incumbents are just as likely to be re-nominated and
   re-elected as their male counterparts.},

Abstract = {This study examines the extent that Latinos' sense of social, economic,
   and political power shapes their perceptions of commonality with blacks
   and whites. In accordance with my theory, which builds on the racial
   threat and group position theories, I find that Latinos' sense of power
   structures their perceptions of blacks and whites. When native-born
   Latinos feel economically threatened, they are less likely to perceive
   commonality with blacks. When native-born Latinos gain some political
   influence, they identify less with whites. Among Latino immigrants who
   perceive discrimination, residing in a high-threat economic setting is
   negatively related to perceiving commonality with whites.},

Abstract = {Time and time again, representation of the Holocaust by means of art has
   been declared impossible, and nonetheless it is tried over and over.
   Andrzej Wajda's film about the Polish physician Janusz Korczak, who ran
   an orphanage in the Warsaw Ghetto and went to his death with those under
   his protection, does not conceal the dilemmas its hero faced. But its
   reconciliatory ending `and unwavering affirmation of education and
   enlightenment are misleading. A provocative, historically incorrect film
   such as Quentin Tarantino's ``Inglorious Bastards{''} does greater
   justice to the moral complexity of its topic than conventional
   ``Holocaust cinema{''}.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The global economic and financial crisis is a challenge for all
   governments, but particularly for federal states because divided and/or
   shared territorial powers make federations susceptible to coordination
   problems in fiscal policy making. This article explores the effects of
   the ongoing crisis on federal relations. Three kinds of problems that
   may become the cause of federal tensions and conflicts are evoked:
   opportunism of subgovernments, centralisation and erosion of solidarity
   among members of the federation. Our analysis of fiscal policies and
   federal conflicts of 11 federations between 2007 and the present reveals
   three kinds of coordination problems: shirking in the use of federal
   government grants, rent-seeking in equalisation payments, and
   over-borrowing and over-spending. Our results show that shirking
   remained limited to few cases and occurred only in the first part of the
   crisis. However, rent-seeking and over-borrowing and over-spending led
   to a reduction of solidarity among subgovernments and to increased
   regulation of the fiscal discretion of the members of the federation.
   Subsequently, tensions in federal relations increased - although only in
   one case did this challenged the federal order.},

Abstract = {This article explores the voice of black minority ethnic (BME) women in
   devolved Scotland. Particular attention is given to examining
   multicultural policies and devolved political processes and how these
   impact on the position of BME women in the political life of Scotland.
   The study is based on secondary analysis of existing survey and focus
   group data, and primary data drawn from qualitative interviews conducted
   with a sample of respondents from political and non-governmental
   organisations.
   Drawing on feminist theories of multiculturalism, culture is perceived
   as dynamic and contested and the research depicts BME women as agents
   engaged in shaping Scotland and their own cultures. The findings show
   that devolution has created a political opportunity structure more
   favourable to the voices of BME women. However, this voice remains quiet
   and is limited by barriers within and outside of BME communities. The
   research also highlights the role of third sector organisations in
   enabling the voice of BME women. The author concludes by arguing that
   successive devolved governments' promotion of multiculturalism in
   Scotland has benefited BME women but with important limitations.},

Abstract = {John Tomasi argues that aggressively pro-market, capitalist regimes can
   secure fair equality of opportunity-a level playing field-even as they
   honor people's thick economic liberties. The trick is to rely on markets
   to spread prosperity and high-quality healthcare and education to all.
   That done, each person will have fair opportunity. Or will she? In
   truth, Tomasi's ``market-democratic{''} plan cannot bring genuinely fair
   opportunity to all, even at the level of ideal theory. Nor can it
   plausibly promise to increase the ``quality{''} of opportunity: the
   supply, that is, of intrinsically desirable work.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {1},
Number = {3},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {Here I propose procedural replication as a method for diagnosing errors
   and omissions and identifying research artifacts in published studies.
   The goal of procedural replication is not to make substantive
   contributions so much as improve research practice, or how scientists go
   about doing science. This is accomplished by generating checklists of
   lessons learned that scholars can use to assess the reliability of new
   or existing studies, guide editorial reviews, and make scientific
   knowledge production more reliable. I demonstrate the method by
   implementing a procedural replication of Michael Ross's controversial
   finding that democracy has no effect on child mortality. I find this
   null finding is an artifact of the way five-year averages were computed
   and the static nature of the preferred model. I demonstrate, using
   causal diagrams, how concerns about listwise deletion and selection bias
   affecting previous studies may have been overstated. I also provide a
   checklist with lessons learned.},

Abstract = {Mainly justified by the growing concern about vulnerabilities of IT
   systems, some new technologies are being integrated into computing
   devices, for realizing so-called Trusted Computing systems. However;
   they are raising questions about intrusive cyber-control over individual
   user activities and data, but also about consequences in cyber-war
   scenarios. The aim of this article is to confront Trusted Computing
   systems with distributed Trust Management systems, which realize access
   control for local resources on the basis of delegation of access rights,
   according to local trust decisions. Both technologies are discussed from
   various points of view: architecture, vision, ethics, politics and law.
   Some experimentations are also presented, to show the applicability of
   Trust Management techniques to modem Service-Oriented Architectures.},

Abstract = {Reconstruction of a society through foreign intervention has been a
   topical issue during recent years mainly because of the events that have
   taken place in Afghanistan and Iraq. These countries are facing an
   extrinsic pressure to undergo a series of social, political and economic
   reforms. While the prevailing interest is derived from ongoing
   occupations, notable attention has also been paid to corresponding
   experiences of the past. This has especially placed the Allied
   occupation of Japan under the spotlight. Despite the unique internal and
   external characteristics of the process that took place in Japan from
   1945 to 1952, the political reconstruction of Japan can be utilized as a
   frame of reference against which the lessons drawn from the recent
   democratization processes can be reflected. This not only reveals the
   challenges and possibilities of the political reconstruction processes
   aiming at democracy, but also leads to the question as to whether the
   process of democratization can ever meet the demands of democracy if it
   is enforced by foreign occupiers. The experiences in Japan suggest that
   the utilization of nondemocratic practices and the period of
   pseudo-democracy do not rule out the possibility of the emergence of a
   genuine democracy.},

Abstract = {Aviation is a major globalizing force for the transfer of people, goods,
   and power, as well as a tool of positive statecraft. Through
   intergovernmental and transnational relationships, the United States and
   European Union have helped countries such as Ukraine and Azerbaijan
   build capacity - human, technical, and legal - and engage more fully in
   the global aviation system. These relationships provide Washington and
   Brussels with avenues of influence and enhance the potential for
   civil-military cooperation, without the overt provocation of Moscow.
   This article argues that this form of constructive engagement is not an
   exclusive strategy for diplomacy, but a long-term investment in the
   development of Russia's near abroad.},

   Care Reform},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},

Pages = {493-514},

Abstract = {Pundits and politicians debated whether race was implicated in the
   rancorous public forums and demonstrations over health care reform.
   Research suggests that for many white Americans, racial predispositions
   play a greater role in their opinions on health care than non-racial
   predispositions. Building on this work, I examine the extent to which
   anger uniquely activates white racial attitudes and increases their
   effect on preferences for health care reform. My theory suggests this
   effect occurs because anger and thoughts about race are tightly linked
   in memory. Using a nationally representative experiment over two waves,
   I induced several emotions to elicit anger, fear, enthusiasm, or
   relaxation. The results show that anger uniquely pushes racial
   conservatives to be more opposing of health care reform while it
   triggers more support among racial liberals. On the other hand, anger
   does not enhance the effect of race-neutral principles on health care
   reform.},

Abstract = {With the increased electoral success of anti-immigration parties,
   questions regarding what impact the parties actually have naturally
   follow. Previous research has rarely explored this question.
   Furthermore, within this body of research, one is given different
   answers. While some argue that anti-immigration parties have made an
   impact on public policy, others find no such evidence. This article
   shows that some of this inconsistency is a consequence of the
   methodological strategies that have been employed. Previous studies are
   either single case studies or comparisons of a small number of
   countries. Consequently, different parties in different institutional
   settings are compared, making it difficult to estimate the actual impact
   of the party of interest. In order to circumvent such methodological
   problems, this article explores the question of anti-immigration party
   impact on a local level and asks if the Sweden Democrats (SD) have
   managed to influence decisions on refugee reception in Swedish
   municipalities. The analysis shows mixed results. First, while unable to
   find an independent effect of the size of the representation of the SD,
   it appears that the party's impact is conditioned by them holding the
   balance of power. Second, the SD's impact is not dependent upon whether
   there is right-wing or left-wing rule, although local migration policy
   is stricter when the main right-wing party has strong support.},

Abstract = {The recent political changes in the region, such as Russia's annexation
   of Crimea and Moldova's signature of an Association Agreement with the
   EU, have transformed the political context of the Transnistrian problem,
   ongoing for the past 20 years. The repositioning of the involved actors
   - Moldova, Russia, Transnistria, and Ukraine - in the context of these
   new political realities might be the key to breaking the deadlock
   surrounding this breakaway region. In this article, the author explores
   each actor's evolving approaches to the problem and assesses how the
   problem could be resolved or exacerbated in the near future.},

Abstract = {The central question examined in this paper is: does a state of legal
   exception exist in the context of sport and sporting competitions? That
   is, does the law of a particular land no longer apply on the fields of
   sport, much like it does not on many fields of war? An unobtrusive
   methodology, using legal case files as data, is used in this study to
   further examine this question. Four main areas of law are explored in
   particular including: 1) procedural law, 2) human rights law, 3)
   criminal law, and 4) EU law. The overall finding of this study is that
   no all-encompassing exception from the law exists in sport, but that
   sport does receive special considerations and privileges allowing for
   legal exceptions in many areas.},

   Post-Authoritarian Chile},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {20},
Number = {5},
Pages = {751-766},

Abstract = {Chile's parties have been characterized as `European' in their
   development and institutionalization, but `Latin American' in their high
   degree of political localism. Yet the specialized literature has not
   tested these tendencies nor developed a theory as to how they may
   coexist. Using the concept of party nationalization, we establish the
   veracity of the claims in the literature and propose a theory of static
   and dynamic nationalization development. We show that, as in Western
   European systems, Chile's political parties exhibited progressive static
   nationalization until 1973. Since re-democratization, parties have
   demonstrated low levels of static nationalization, while the coalitions
   are highly nationalized. Concurrently, both parties and the coalitions
   have exhibited low levels of dynamic nationalization like parties
   throughout Latin America. We argue that these conflicting patterns are
   due to the interactive effect of functional cleavages and electoral
   institutions.},

Abstract = {Marshall Medoff and Christopher Dennis identify some errors in National
   Abortion Rights Action League's (NARAL) data on the effective start
   dates of various state-level antiabortion laws. However, they
   misunderstand the purpose of my 2011 State Politics and Policy Quarterly
   article which was to measure the impact of a range of antiabortion
   lawsnot analyze competing theories as to why the abortion rate has
   fallen in the United States. Furthermore, their analysis contains a
   number of critical measurement, and methodological and estimation
   errors. When these errors are corrected, the empirical results add to
   the substantial body of peer-reviewed research which finds that public
   funding restrictions, parental involvement laws, and properly designed
   informed consent laws all reduce the incidence of abortion.},

Title = {Conceptualizing vote buying},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {35},
Pages = {315-327},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This study investigates the concept of vote buying, with a particular
   focus on its usage in research on clientelism. Vote buying is often
   poorly defined. Such conceptual ambiguity may distort descriptive
   findings and threaten the validity of causal claims. Qualitative
   analysis suggests that researchers often employ the concept of vote
   buying differently, and regressions from Nigeria and Mexico suggest that
   using alternative definitions can yield divergent empirical results.
   This diverse usage also poses the risk of conceptual stretching, because
   scholars often use vote buying to describe other phenomena. To improve
   future research, analysts should pay close attention to the
   conceptualization of vote buying. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The Middle East region is undergoing its most difficult time in this
   century. Iraq's invasion has indeed caused widespread repercussions. The
   failure of efforts between Turkey and Iran to come to terms with one
   another in leading the developments in the region on a peaceful
   co-existence of different sects resulted in an increased polarization of
   the region. Turkey's growing involvement in Syria together with the US
   and some Western partners, helped to generate a counter-bloc comprised
   of Iran, Russia, and China. When considered with their supporters in
   Iraq and Syria this is indeed a strong bloc. One may say there is a new
   cold war in the making in the Middle East. Much has been said, written,
   and speculated about the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL),
   but it is clear that it will take a huge effort to uproot it from the
   lands it has occupied. It is a common perception in the international
   community that the AKP government assisted al-Nusra and ISIL and that
   Gulf funding was used in this process. This has caused considerable
   consternation not only in Syria but also in Iraq, and certainly in Iran
   and Russia. In this article, the author argues that Turkish foreign
   policy in the region has been on a downward slide since the AKP
   government gradually dispensed with secular principles. Today, the
   credibility of Turkish foreign policy has hit rock bottom in the region.},

Abstract = {Complications with decisive decision-making and policy implementation
   during the European financial crisis have initiated the debate on
   necessity of the European institutional and legal reforms in upcoming
   years to avoid similar complications in the future. The list of problems
   to be fixed is long: the lack of transparency in terms of member states'
   joint obligations, insufficient scrutiny, an absence of clear norms and
   convincing sanctions, and the inability of the central institutions to
   regain control over member state violations of the Eurozone criteria are
   some examples of problems to be solved with planned reforms. The visions
   of solutions are also different, varying from the federal union, to the
   ``stakeholders{''} union inspired by the IMF model, but also a
   simplification and reparation of the current community model is seen as
   one possible option. Which would be the legal, institutional and fiscal
   effects of planned institutional reforms and how they influence existing
   decision-making logic and balance from the perspective of small member
   states are the main research questions of this article.},

Abstract = {Unsurprisingly, opinion polls of how people intend to vote in the
   referendum on 18 September have become a prominent feature of the
   referendum campaign. At first glance they have painted a picture of
   remarkable stability, albeit with some narrowing of the lead of the No
   side over Yes during the winter of 2014. However, different companies'
   polls have consistently produced substantially different estimates of
   the level of support for Yes and No. Although there are also some
   important differences between the polls in the ways in which they are
   being conducted, there is no simple correspondence between the method
   used and tendency to produce a relatively high or low level of support
   for Yes. It is thus far from clear why different polls are producing
   different results, resulting in considerable uncertainty about the exact
   state of the referendum race.},

Abstract = {This work analyses the evolution of Ecuadorian political parties `
   territorial coverage since the return to democracy.It uses district-
   level electoral returns from between 1979 and 2013 for three different
   types of elections ( presidential,national deputy,provincial deputy) to
   evaluate the territorial homogeneity of the parties in each period (<<
   static >> nationalization) as well as the homogeneity of temporal change
   (<< dynamic >> nationalization).Through use of electoral cartography, as
   well as mixed model statistical analysis, the results show a high level
   of volatility along both dimensions of nationalization for all parties,
   including the government ` s ALIANZA PAIS.The analysis also reveals that
   widespread voter support for legislators from a single party is driven
   by presidential coattails rather than through developing deep roots in
   districts.The geographical analysis indicates that regionalism has
   persisted in Ecuadorian political parties since 1979 despite the success
   of Rafael Correa ` s party at the polls.},

Abstract = {When do militant organizations transition to political parties? Once
   reaching the productive limits of political violence, militant
   organizations sometimes seek to adopt party politics in order to
   continue pursuing their political ends or ``outcome'' goals. However,
   most militant organizations remain incapable of transitioning due to two
   common constraints: the base constituency's preference for violence and
   credibility deficiencies vis-a-vis the adversary. Analyzing an original
   dataset of 406 organizations, I find evidence that partial outcome-goal
   achievement and state supporters help militant organizations overcome
   the obstacles preventing transition. Crucially, whereas the complete
   achievement of militant outcome goals absorbs the chief organizational
   incentive to transition, partial achievement of outcome goals fosters
   transition to the party format more than any other factor.},

Abstract = {Nelson Mandela's disqualification as a ``political prisoner{''} marks a
   historic, world encounter between two forms of international, postwar
   political practice: (i) decolonization and (ii) nongovernmental human
   rights organizations. The historical and political epistemologies of
   these two strategies are demonstrably at odds with one another. From
   this angle, the decision of Amnesty International (1964) to disqualify
   Mandela as a political prisoner constitutes a crucial moment in the
   formation of international human rights activism. Amnesty International,
   through its de facto alignment with the apartheid state and its
   juridical monopoly over the definition and terms of ``acceptable{''} and
   ``legitimate{''} uses of force, materially activated the logical
   anti-colonial device implicit in the Universal Declaration of Human
   Rights. Instead of being a minor incident of little significance, the
   disqualification of Mandela marks the inflection point for international
   discourse on human rights after the Second World War. At the same time,
   by introducing the major international NGOs, Amnesty becomes an ally of
   state violence by omission, by rejecting out-of-hand any and all claims
   for the right to armed resistance, regardless of past or present
   conditions.},

Abstract = {The following notes seek to provide an approach to the setting of the
   local autonomy on the system applied in Venezuela, taking as a
   foundation the national and foreign doctrine on the subject, and having
   as a basis the constitutional and legal regulations on the matter. In
   this regard, we propose a brief historical approach to the context,
   developing the evolution of the autonomy in the system and its reception
   by the Venezuelan municipality; in turn, a conceptualization of contents
   and principles, its consecration in the system and its aspects.
   Similarly, roughly, to offer some reflections regarding their decline
   given the complex picture of centralization that has prevailed in
   Venezuela in recent years. This paper presents a reflective research,
   theoretical, with the purpose of providing a conceptual framework that
   gives us an objective look on the subject.},

Abstract = {We study effects of wartime violence on social cohesion in the context
   of Nepal's 10-year civil war. We begin with the observation that
   violence increased levels of collective action like voting and community
   organization-a finding consistent with other recent studies of
   postconflict societies. We use lab-in-the-field techniques to tease
   apart such effects. Our causal-identification strategy exploits
   communities' exogenous isolation from the unpredictable path of
   insurgency combined with matching. We find that violence-affected
   communities exhibit higher levels of prosocial motivation, measured by
   altruistic giving, public good contributions, investment in trust-based
   transactions, and willingness to reciprocate trust-based investments. We
   find evidence to support two social transformation mechanisms: (1) a
   purging mechanism by which less social persons disproportionately flee
   communities plagued by war and (2) a collective coping mechanism by
   which individuals who have few options to flee band together to cope
   with threats.},

Abstract = {The May 2014 European Parliament (EP) elections were characterised by
   the success of far-right Eurosceptic parties, including the French Front
   National, UKIP, the Danish People's Party, the Hungarian Jobbik, the
   Austrian FPo, the True Finns and the Greek Golden Dawn. However, a
   closer look at the results across Europe indicates that the success of
   far-right parties in the EP elections is neither a linear nor a
   clear-cut phenomenon: (1) the far right actually declined in many
   European countries compared to the 2009 results; (2) some of the
   countries that have experienced the worst of the economic crisis,
   including Spain, Portugal and Ireland, did not experience a significant
   rise in far-right party support; and (3) far right' is too broad an
   umbrella term, covering parties that are too different from each other
   to be grouped in one single party family.},

Abstract = {A persistent theme in the British and international debates about
   immigration and diversity is the controversial claim that living in
   diverse areas has negative consequences for intergroup attitudes and
   community relations. In the present paper we test this claim by
   investigating the impact of neighbourhood diversity and self-reported
   intergroup contact on orientations (outgroup attitudes and social
   distance) toward one religious outgroup: Muslims. Respondents were both
   White British majority (N=867) and non-Muslim ethnic minority (N=567)
   residents of neighbourhoods in England which varied in their proportion
   of ethnic minority residents. We tested both direct and indirect (via
   intergroup contact) effects of diversity on outgroup orientations toward
   Muslims. Results show that individuals living in more ethnically diverse
   areasregardless of whether they are White British members of the
   majority or non-Muslim members of ethnic minoritieshave more positive
   contact with Muslims, with positive consequences for intergroup
   relations with Muslims.},

Abstract = {The use of neuroscience in political science inquiry has steadily
   increased over the last decade, yet many remain skeptical regarding its
   usefulness in explaining outcomes and solving puzzles. In this article
   we develop ramifications of the neuroscientific paradigm of the `social
   brain' and critically assess its utility for political science. We argue
   that this model has promise in three distinct areas of research:
   challenging assumptions, clarifying conceptions, and specifying
   conditions. We then apply this theoretical framework to a specific
   puzzle in political science that transcends sub-field distinctions:
   social norm compliance. We argue that utilizing the social brain
   paradigm allows us to clarify precisely what social norms are at a
   physical level, challenge the underlying assumptions of current social
   norm research, and specify precise and testable conditions of compliance
   and non-compliance behavior. Ultimately we suggest that the social brain
   specifically and neuroscience generally offer much promise for political
   scientists, although scholars must be critical and careful in their
   justification and application of neuroscientific data.},

Abstract = {We develop a general theory of budgetary politics and examine its
   implications on a new data set on U. S. government expenditures from
   1791 to 2010. We draw on three major approaches to budgeting:
   decision-making theories, primarily incrementalism and serial
   processing; policy process models; and path dependency. We show that the
   incrementalist budget model is recursive and that its solution is
   exponential growth, and isolate three periods in which it operates in
   pure form. The equilibrium periods are separated by critical junctures,
   associated with wars or economic collapse. We assess policy process
   dynamics by examining the deviations within equilibrium periods. We
   offer three takeaways: (1) exponential incrementalism is fundamental to
   a theory of budgeting; (2) disjoint shifts in the level of exponential
   incrementalism are caused only by critical moments; (3) temporally
   localized dynamics cause bends in the exponential path, longer returns
   to the path within budgetary eras, and annual punctuations in budget
   changes.},

Abstract = {Nearly every aggregate study of minority legislative representation has
   observed outcomes of elections (officeholders), rather than the supply
   of minority candidates. Because of this, scholars have left a large
   amount of important data, the election losers, out of their models of
   minority representation. The evidence presented in this article
   demonstrates that voters in the United States cannot choose minority
   officeholders because there are rarely minority candidates on the
   ballot. I use state legislative candidate data from Carsey et al. (2008)
   and Klarner et al. (2012) to test models of Latino representation that
   correct for first-stage selection bias. Once candidate self-selection is
   taken into account, the probability of electing a Latino increases
   enormously. I then use data from 2010 to make out-of-sample predictions,
   which clearly favor the conditional model. Thus, our current
   understanding of Latino representation is significantly biased by
   ignoring the first stage of an election, a candidate's decision to run.},

Abstract = {Is there any innovative theoretical structure to analyze and describe
   regional integration processes? We aim to justify an affirmative answer
   taking into account Niklas Luhmann's modern systems theory but going
   further in the sense of a post-national perspective in order to describe
   the European Union's integration process. Luhmannian's concepts of
   politics were not completely developed in order to show grounds for this
   affirmation, but they set up a theoretical structure which allows us to
   introduce new elements and reformulate other notions to justify it. Face
   to the globalization process, regional integration processes expose a
   reality where uncertainty and risk are not unusual - we cannot know the
   whole reality, we cannot know the entire world and we cannot know the
   future. Keeping ourselves in descriptive terms, not stepping into the
   normative, we do not expect to give salvation formulas for integration
   processes nor world-level citizens, but we would expose an innovative
   way to explain social phenomena and, punctually, post-national political
   transition with a theory based on societal functional differentiation
   paradigm. If Nation State seems to be overtaken by new political
   structures, maybe it is time to expose a new theoretical proposal, a
   post-national and systemic interpretation of politics.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the article is to analyze current Russian policy toward
   Southeast Asian countries and to examine prospects for the future
   development of Russia-(ASEAN) relations. This article is structured
   around three issues, discussed in three parts. The first part examines
   the evolution of Russia- ASEAN political relations from the
   establishment of the ``dialogue partnership{''} to the present time and
   Russia's participation in the multilateral cooperation structures under
   the ASEAN umbrella. The second part concentrates on the achievements and
   the problems of economic and technical cooperation between the
   countries. Special attention is paid to the recent initiatives of the
   Russian government to foster the economic development of Far East
   territories. The third part is devoted to the analysis of Russia- ASEAN
   relations from the point of view of cultural interaction. It argues that
   despite optimistic official rhetoric, Russian policy in the Asian
   dimension is not balanced and there is no clear strategy to improve
   Russia's place in the region.},

Abstract = {This article deals with the analysis of tourism competitiveness for the
   cities of Morelia, Mexico and Alcala de Henares, Spain, based on the
   conceptual aspects of tourism, tourism competitiveness, public policy,
   foreign direct investment and tourism marketing. In addition to these
   concepts, cultural resources and human resources are considered as
   determinants of the tourism competitiveness for these cities. After this
   conceptual analysis, presents the main theories of tourism
   competitiveness and also public policies for the development of tourism.
   To obtain the results, an instrument was constructed using the Likert
   scale and after it's implementation, the results show that the tourism
   competitiveness of Morelia, Mexico is particularly determined by human
   resources, tourism marketing, public policy and foreign direct
   investment; while for the city of Alcala de Henares, Spain, tourism
   competitiveness is determined by the tourism marketing, cultural
   resources, public policy and foreign direct investment. In this work,
   the other factors mentioned were not decisive for the tourism
   competitiveness.},

Abstract = {When you transcend the reductionism of both genocentrism and cultural
   theories that bracket human being from its species origins and
   biological character, a reciprocal movement between the findings of
   refined experience and biological research becomes available. Drawing
   upon recent work in dynamic theories of evolution that respect the human
   achievements of meaning, freedom, consciousness, and creativity, this
   essay explores how those findings can inform our understandings and
   practices of freedom, and vice versa. Along the way, it criticizes the
   critique of genocentrism pursued by Thomas Nagel, contending that it
   ignores ``teleodynamism{''} in favor of teleological finalism.},

Abstract = {This article is about the politics of `the exception' and the role of
   `exceptionalism' in contemporary international theory. The concept of
   `the exception' was coined by Carl Schmitt and has in recent years
   become an inspiration for international relations theorists and foreign
   policy analysts, especially when engaging with issues such as great
   power politics, humanitarian intervention and the war against terrorism.
   It is concluded that attempts to apply Schmitt's concept of `the
   exception' seldom are persuasive and sometimes even contradictory to
   Schmitt's theory. When dealt with out of context, `the exception'
   becomes just an expression about something else. It is shown that there
   are other ways of handling the kind of political problem observed by
   Schmitt than what he and his followers are offering.},

Abstract = {Policy makers use political strategies when implementing public
   policies. This is the result of an increasing number of empirical
   studies-especially from research on unpopular welfare state reforms.
   However, an overarching theoretical framework systematizing the existing
   work is still missing from the literature. The present article tackles
   this shortcoming. Our approach starts from the assumption that the
   electoral consequences of policies result from the combination of two
   dimensions: the popularity of a policy and the attribution of
   responsibility for that policy. Drawing on theories of electoral support
   and political behavior, we unfold a catalog of strategies according to
   how they operate to influence these two dimensions.},

Abstract = {If candidates do not state clear issue positions, then voters cannot
   anticipate how the candidates will govern if elected nor hold candidates
   accountable for breaking campaign pledges. Yet, previous research argues
   electoral incentives lead candidates to avoid discussing the key issues
   of the day. Even though silence on issues is the modal campaign
   strategy, this paper argues that candidates systematically make clear
   issue statements on occasion. We identify three variables that predict
   whether a candidate will address an issue and the clarity of the
   candidate's stance on that issue: (i) the public salience of an issue;
   (ii) ideological congruence between candidate and district; and (iii)
   candidate quality. This argument is tested using data on candidate
   position-taking regarding the Iraq War and gay marriage collected from
   the campaign websites of U.S. House candidates in 2006 and 2008.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The online submission and payment of tax returns was the aim of a recent
   common regulation transposed by means of Spanish Ministerial Order
   HAP/2194/2013 (22 November) regulating the procedures and general
   conditions for submitting certain self-assessment and information tax
   returns. Basically, this Order establishes a common regulatory framework
   for the online lodging of self-assessment and information returns. It
   concentrates the existing law into one statue and so avoids the
   dispersion of regulations. This common regulation will undoubtedly
   contribute to clarifying and simplifying the application of tax
   regulations in this very recent and changeable area and will improve
   legal certainty.
   This Ministerial Order governs matters including the ways for filing
   self-assessment returns (including the new ``PIN 24 Hour{''} system of
   signing with an access key in a register beforehand as a user),
   self-assessment returns that must be submitted online, the general
   procedure for the online submission of self-assessment returns, the ways
   for submitting information returns, information returns that must be
   submitted online (including the controversial online annual VAT summary
   return) and the procedure for the online submission of information
   returns.},

Abstract = {Established in 1976 as the Andean Reserve Fund, the Latin American
   Reserve Fund continues to be a central component of the regional
   financial architecture in Latin America. As the only institution of its
   kind in the region, this Fund provides valuable insight into the
   feasibility of mechanisms of regional cooperation aimed at improving the
   efficiency of financial crisis prevention and management. This is
   especially important in light of the fact that countries in the region
   have unilaterally accumulated unprecedented amounts of international
   reserves over the past couple of decades. This article empirically
   assesses the effectiveness of the Fund's interventions while providing
   an institutional analysis of its current and future viability.},

Title = {To Share or to Keep: The Afterlife of Yugoslavia's Heritage and the
   Contemporary Heritage Management Practices},
Journal = {POLITICKA MISAO-CROATIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {51},
Number = {5},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article revisits Yugoslav heritage through the example of the
   monumental network dedicated to the People's Liberation Struggle (NOB),
   now interpreted through the lenses of contemporary heritage management
   practice. The monumental network of the NOB was created as a part of
   official identity management strategy of the state, and is
   unquestionably a shared heritage of the former Yugoslav region. The
   contemporary heritage-interpretation and management practices within the
   region tend to provide them with a strong national prefix, commonly
   disregarding their initial shared nature, and contribute to the
   processes of contemporary national identification. The efficient
   managing of the shared properties of heritage in question poses a
   substantial practical challenge and a burning issue in need of thorough
   investigation. For this purpose, this critical intervention offers one
   possible approach for overcoming the current issues in heritage

Abstract = {The Crimean crisis and the struggle with Russia over Ukraine's
   territorial integrity mean a limited return to an East-West
   confrontation in Europe, the likes of which have not been seen since the
   end of Cold War and the integration of the post-communist states in a
   new, pan-European system and a global economic, financial, and
   communication order that is growing ever more deeply and tightly
   integrated. The Kremlin, which seeks a new, imperial Russian hegemony in
   the post-Soviet space - now within the regulatory framework of a
   ``Eurasian Union{''} - felt strategically threatened by the EU-oriented
   ``Maidan-revolution{''} in Ukraine. Moscow responded by illegally
   annexing the Crimea - the base of its Black Sea Fleet and a symbol of
   Russian national greatness - and by destabilizing Ukraine so as to
   prevent its integration in the West and bind it to Russia permanently.},

Title = {Policy Congruence and Style of Representation: Party Voters and
   Political Parties},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {538-563},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article focuses on whether styles of representation influence
   policy congruence. Style of representation is defined at the party level
   as the proportion of representatives within parties who are partisans,
   delegates or trustees. Policy congruence refers to how close on the
   left-right scale the mean position of a party as placed by its
   candidates is compared to that of party voters. The article concludes
   that where there are higher proportions of trustees within parties,
   there is a greater degree of policy congruence, whereas a higher
   proportion of partisans results in less policy congruence. The
   proportion of delegates has no significant impact on congruence after
   taking account of other party and country measures. This indicates that
   party constraints on representatives are applied at the cost of
   congruence with voters, and that when representatives enjoy more
   flexibility to follow their own opinions, the party displays greater
   congruence with its own voters.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes an integrated model that identifies the variables
   that explain judicial decision-making in Latin American Supreme Courts.
   As a case study considering the individual votes of the judges of the
   Fiscal and Tax Chamber of the Ecuadorian Supreme Court, the article
   finds empirical evidence that the characteristics of the cases, judges'
   time remaining time on the bench, the government's political strength,
   and the performance of the economy are good predictors of judicial vote.
   Unlike research suggesting that judges vote sincerely according to their
   own ideological preferences this article provides evidence that such
   actors decide cases strategically.},

Abstract = {Democratic politics is forged upon the creation and management of a
   number of complex social relationships that are mediated through the
   creation of a set of expectations about the respective obligations and
   responsibilities of each actor. However, we actually know very little
   about how the public's expectations of political processes, political
   institutions and politicians can be managed. The danger, as recent
   research has started to reveal, is that the public's expectations can be
   overinflated because of the pressures of political competition to the
   extent that subsequent failure is almost inevitable. This article
   departs from the conventional approach to this topic, with its emphasis
   on the creation of `expectation gaps', and instead develops a more
   original and distinctive focus on `expectation vacuums' and `expectation
   clouding'. As such, the central argument of this article is that the May
   2012 rejection of elected mayors in the vast majority of cities
   reflected the existence of an `expectation vacuum' and `expectation
   clouding'. This interpretation raises fresh questions about (inter alia)
   the politics of public expectations, the tools of contemporary
   statecraft and the future of local governance.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, the number of undocumented immigrants residing in
   developed countries has grown significantly. Their nebulous presence
   undermines states' ability to exert control over their populations and
   territories. In response, most host states have implemented large-scale
   regularizations to legalize undocumented immigrants' status. Yet we
   possess limited understanding of the impact these policies exert on the
   states themselves. This article examines the relationship between
   immigrant regularization, state capacity, and sovereignty. I argue that
   regularizations reveal a contradiction between popular images of state
   sovereignty and a state's actual capacity to wield authority. On one
   hand, regularizations facilitate the collection of information,
   enhancing taxation capacity, immigration control, and the rule of law.
   On the other, by implementing these policies, states concurrently
   demonstrate an inability to regulate migration and punish transgressors,
   thereby undermining perceptions of state sovereignty. Thus
   regularizations can transform states by revealing the tension between
   ideal images and concrete practices.},

Abstract = {What motivates individuals to participate in contentious, political
   forms of collective action? In this article, I consider the possibility
   that the promise of social esteem from an ingroup can act as a powerful
   selective incentive for individuals to participate in contentious
   politics. I conducted a field experiment-the first to my knowledge to
   take place in the context of a political march, rally, or
   social-identity event-to isolate this esteem mechanism from others.
   Using measures of intent to attend, actual attendance, and reported
   attendance at a gay and lesbian pride event in New Jersey, I find
   evidence that the promise of social esteem boosts all three measures of
   participation. The article offers new theoretical and practical
   implications for the study of participation in nonvoting forms of
   collective action.},

Abstract = {The capacity to sustain policies over time and the capacity to adjust
   policies in the face of changing circumstances are two desirable
   properties of policymaking systems. Veto player theory, a very
   influential approach in comparative politics, has suggested that
   polities with more veto players will have the capacity to sustain
   policies at the expense of the ability to change policy when necessary.
   This paper argues that once intertemporal considerations are explicitly
   included, it is not necessarily true that polities with more stable and
   credible policies have more difficulty in adapting their policies, nor
   that polities with more veto players have more difficulty in adjusting
   policies to new circumstances. More generally, the paper argues that,
   when studying the effects of political institutions on policy outcomes,
   an intertemporal perspective might lead to predictions different from
   those emanating from more a-temporal approaches.},

Abstract = {This article asks whether student peer advisors can contribute to
   curriculum `internationalisation' through their role in promoting and
   supporting student mobility. We conducted a single case study of Erasmus
   student mobility at Loughborough University between 2010-2012, and our
   experiment offers a perspective on the possible futures of European
   Studies, where the decline of foreign language learning may find
   compensation in the internationalisation of the curriculum via the

   results are ultimately due to a lack of clarity about the counterfactual
   being considered. We use a simple model to show that an increase in
   district magnitude reduces expected proportionality in a plurality
   system only if it is accompanied by a reduction in the number of
   districts. This conditional prediction helps to explain the diversity of
   existing findings and is consistent with our own analysis of both U.S.
   congressional delegations and local councils in Britain. (C) 2013

Title = {Presidential coattails in Taiwan: An analysis of voter- and
   candidate-specific data},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {33},
Pages = {175-185},

Abstract = {Considerable empirical evidence demonstrates presidential coattail
   effects in elections held in the US. Employing hybrid logit and mixed
   logit models that analyze data collected from voters and candidates in
   Taiwan, this study examines coattail effects in a non-American setting.
   The findings show that presidential coattails exert powerful influences
   on Taiwanese citizens' vote choices and take the form of conversion.
   Contrary to American experiences, the mediating role of incumbency is
   quite minimal. Presidential coattails thus provide the president with an
   important source of influence in the legislative body. The linkage
   between presidential and legislative politics through coattails can help
   the operation of Taiwan's democratic institutions. Future research on
   voting behavior needs to consider voter characteristics as well as
   candidate attributes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Korean political parties have been organizationally unstable for
   decades, even after 1987 when a democratic transition from authoritarian
   military-based politics was achieved. Many studies have argued that the
   instability has been caused by the Confucian culture of Korean politics.
   This paper suggests a different view of the political phenomenon: Korean
   party instability has been due to the `cue-chasing behaviors' of
   self-interested politicians, rather than Confucian morality. This study
   examines the proposition with a historical exploration of Korean
   political parties between 1987 and 2012.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the impact of populist radical right parties on
   national party systems in Western Europe. Has the emergence of this new
   party family changed the interaction of party competition within Western
   European countries? First, I look at party system change with regard to
   numerical and numerical-ideological terms. Second, I evaluate the effect
   populist radical right parties have had on the different dimensions of
   party systems. Third, I assess the claim that the rise of populist
   radical right parties has created bipolarizing party system. Fourth, I
   look at the effect the rise of the populist radical right has had on the
   logic of coalition formation. The primary conclusion is that,
   irrespective of conceptualization and operationalization, populist
   radical right parties have not fundamentally changed party systems in
   Western Europe.},

Abstract = {Changes to the institutional structure of trade policymaking are
   important to understanding why Japan remained largely on the sidelines
   of the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership (TPP) negotiations
   in 2010-2012. The Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) embarked on a series
   of changes to policymaking institutions, which initially empowered the
   prime minister and cabinet at the expense of pro-agriculture
   backbenchers in the ruling party. However, the potential for a
   breakthrough on farm trade substantially diminished as the institutional
   reforms were reversed, allowing political supporters of domestic farm
   interests once more to assert their voice and influence in trade
   policymaking. Tracing the process of DPJ government decision-making on
   the TPP reveals that `bringing the party back in' was a major factor in
   preventing Japan's formally joining the TPP negotiations, despite the
   strong pro-TPP sentiments of DPJ prime ministers, thus limiting
   prospects for agricultural trade liberalization.},

Abstract = {Using his post-Civil War poetry and prose, this essay investigates the
   role of industrialization in Walt Whitman's internationalist thought.
   Reconsidering him as a Hegelian thinker, it explores his
   characterization of progress in the modern world as a product of the
   expansion of industry across the globe. Although Whitman saw this
   process as driven by American industrial progress, his views were not
   conventionally imperialistic. Instead, fusing materialist and idealist
   principles, he sought to transcend the nation in favor of an
   international order of cosmopolitan global communities, as depicted in
   his poetic descriptions of the urban crowd. The essay considers the
   implications of Whitman's internationalism for American political
   theory, particularly in today's rapidly globalizing world.},

Abstract = {In a 1985 publication David Cameron reported that historically leftist
   governments had governed with smaller deficits than rightist
   governments. The party ideology variable was incorporated into a large
   body of subsequent research, mainly by economists, to study the growth
   of public spending and indebtedness. Most agreed with Cameron; some did
   not. Virtually all studies focused on western European nations (but not
   subnational governments). This study analyzes provincial deficits or
   surpluses over the period 1966 to 2009 and determines that rightist
   parties, despite controls for economic and other political variables,
   have lower budgetary deficits, a finding which contradicts Cameron but
   is consistent with five previous studies of provincial spending in
   Canada.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that the hierarchical market economy (HME) category
   does not provide an adequate starting point for addressing capitalist
   diversity in Latin America. Building from a critical perspective on the
   global commodity chain (GCC) and global production network (GPN)
   approaches, it instead considers the impact of firms' transnational
   relations and the often neglected role of workingclass struggles. It
   will argue that capitalist diversity can only be understood at the nexus
   of these ostensibly global and local phenomena; and by specifying the
   strategic decisions taken by firms in Argentina's automobile industry,
   it will account for the failure of that sector. Finally, it examines the
   role of working- class struggles in the industry in Cordoba, Argentina,
   arguing that these were vital in shaping the specific and unstable form
   of capitalist diversity in Argentina, as well as potential alternatives
   to it.},

Abstract = {Liberalism begins with the free individual; the liberal state comes into
   being in order to preserve that freedom. Part of that freedom, to use
   the language of John Stuart Mill, is choosing one's own life plan,
   escaping the forms and lifestyles imposed on us by history or nature.
   Two texts from ancient AthensEuripides' Bacchae and Plato's
   Republicexplore the challenge posed by what I call `the escape from
   form.' The Bacchae, while capturing our longing for a freedom from form,
   portrays the devastation of a city invaded by just that freedom; the
   Republic, while capturing the epistemological and political need for
   form, portrays a frightening vision of a city so bound by form that it
   becomes immobile. Socrates' self-critique in his reconsideration of the
   artisan in Republic 10, however, unites the forms his Callipolis demands
   with the multiplicity of human identities that the god Dionysus brings
   to Thebes in Euripides' tragedy.},

Abstract = {Is it even logically possible for democracy promotion policies to
   succeed in the sense that they increase democracy in other countries?
   Empirical research on the conditions for success in democracy promotion
   must assume an affirmative answer to this question. To study something
   empirically, it must be logically possible in the first place. Some
   critical and normative theorists, on the other hand, answer the same
   question negatively. They suggest that promotion of democracy from the
   outside is a contradiction in terms, in particular cases or more
   generally. This article offers a framework for clarifying this
   disagreement and for facilitating dialogue across empirical research and
   normative and critical theory. I draw on this framework also to suggest
   a conception of democracy that maximizes the political relevance of both
   normative and empirical analyses of democracy promotion (DP), while
   freeing that same research from the intellectual blockages of potential
   contradictions. Such intellectual advantages follow, I argue, by
   defining democracy as an ideal while making its institutional
   implications explicit; as an exercise of either constituent or
   constituted power, depending on the political phase being studied; and
   as located in the internal relationships of world politics.},

Journal = {CUESTIONES POLITICAS},

Pages = {13-45},
Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {From a panoramic perspective, starting with an analysis of the
   governmental initiatives displayed, certain documents from the actors
   involved, as well as interviews carried out, this work proposes to
   reconstruct the main tensions faced between the most important press
   media and the Brazilian government during the administrations of Lula
   and Dilma. The study suggests that while the government of Lula
   sustained an oscillating relationship between moments of greater tension
   and others of an certain unstable balance, Dilma's government has been
   characterized by a more consensual position toward this sector, which
   has supposed a reduction of the possibilities for governmental political
   action and the materialization of historical, partisan claims with
   regard to greater regulation of the market. It could be stated that the
   Brazilian government, once it recovered a certain equilibrium modeled by
   the very popular presidential leadership of Lula, with a demonstrated
   capacity in 2006 to overcome to adverse media cover age, choose an
   administration of conflict with this sector when the demands for media
   system regulation were delayed in exchange for a reduction in media
   criticism of the government.},

   either a mode of emancipation from power (Lukes) or, conversely, a
   subtle ruse of domination (Foucault). Here it is argued that reasoning
   is intrinsic to political power, with both the potential for power as
   justice (Arendt), and for power as domination (Foucault and Lukes). With
   power and reason as normatively neutral, with both/either normatively
   desirable and undesirable potentials, this raises the fundamental
   question of how to distinguish between justice and domination. These
   issues are explored, taking account of processes of subject formation
   and systems of thought.},

Abstract = {After more than twenty years of vitality, the great globalization debate
   is currently experiencing a state of stagnation. Nonetheless this essay
   argues that the notion of globalization can remain fertile, if it is
   interpreted philosophically and if its age is read through the prism of
   a geographical pattern: the sphere. Following a brief introduction, the
   first section explains the fundamental distinction between the
   cartographic pattern of modernity and the spherical one of
   postmodernity. The second paragraph deals with a particular property of
   the globe, its three-dimensionality, ascribing to it the origin of the
   much-discussed crisis of both the idea and the practices of political
   representation. The third part focuses on a second characteristic of the
   globe, its impermeable closeness, attributing to it the obsolescence of
   the philosophico-political category of hegemony. Globalization would not
   be just the epochal horizon which hosts conflicts of power, but it would
   be in itself the bearer of a networking, unrepresentable and
   post-hegemonic power.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article is to discuss the issue of niche parties and
   apply this approach on the Lithuanian case. The niche parties are
   analysed in the political science since the 1960s, focusing on small
   radical parties and also the single-issue parties that grew up in the
   postmodern West European societies. Nevertheless, during the next
   decades the single-issue parties were supplemented by other types of
   niche parties such as business-firm parties, media parties, generation
   parties, and protest parties. In the first part of our article we
   present the debate on the niche parties and also proper typology of
   niche parties. Successively we apply this typology on five Lithuania
   niche parties that are present in the contemporary Lithuanian party
   system.},

Abstract = {During its development, the process of European Integration has
   certainly shown both the formation of coalitions and the creation of
   cleavages between the governments of the member states. Nevertheless, a
   rigorous study of the continuous redefinition of these internal
   divisions has not been yet attempted, especially in comparative
   perspective. Indeed, by comparing the European path toward a form of
   economic and political union to the history of the United States it is
   possible to drive some interesting element of analysis. In fact, still
   at the beginning of the Twentieth Century, the United States has been
   resembled to a ``Union of potential nation{''} and the very geographical
   morphology has been paralleled to that of the European Continent.
   Moreover, during its history, the US federal system has constantly faced
   a great number of challenges due to the clash between political
   interests deeply rooted in regional cleavages. Starting from the
   reflections of the most important scholar of American sectionalism
   Frederick Jackson Turner, this essay aims at laying the foundations for
   a new perspective in the study of the European political and
   institutional development. An approach which should pay more attention
   to the regional developments of the European political divisions.},

Abstract = {The article discusses political and legal aspects of the presidential
   power transfer in Ukraine in February 2014 from the perspective of the
   development of this institution. Identifying the established system in
   Ukraine as patronal presidentialism, N.Borisov shows that in Ukraine,
   contrary to the promises of the new authorities, the model of presidency
   based on patron-client relations, informal institutions and a scenario
   ``winner takes all{''} is reproduced. According to his assessment, the
   real steps towards democratization of the Ukrainian political system
   have not been undertaken, and it is yet premature to talk about the
   beginning of the transition to ``good{''} or ``good enough{''}
   institutions in Ukraine.},

   counterterrorism and the configuration of political power in its

   Agamben's thesis on the permanent state of exception. Despite its
   resonance with key aspects of homeland security, this thesis is found to
   be analytically limited and theoretically brittle. To overcome its
   shortcomings and provide a better understanding of contemporary
   organisation of political power, a strategic-relational approach is
   suggested, derived from Poulantzas's state theory.},

Title = {Introduction: From Autonomism to Post-Autonomia, from Class Composition

Year = {2014},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {163-177},
Abstract = {This introduction critically addresses the historical development of
   operaismo/autonomism into ``postautonomist{''} thinking. First, it
   argues that the very history of postautonomism allows for criticizing
   the notion of the ``history{''} (or lack thereof) of theorists
   associated with postautonomist Marxism, such as Antonio Negri. It argues
   that the ``all-or-nothing{''} characteristic of autonomism lives on in
   postautonomist theory's denial of mediation (Negri, Berardi), which in
   fact falls short because of it. Current developments within
   postautonomist theory, however, offer an alternative to this bipolar
   logic by redefining notions of subjectivity (Virno, Pasquinelli). The
   emphasis in this strand of postautonomism given to bio- and
   anthropo-politics-a new political anthropology -implies a new form of
   (academic) knowledge production, performed by what Jack Bratich calls
   the ``machinic intellectual.{''} In this sense, postautononism in fact
   urges the rethinking of the very idea of the ``autonomy{''} of
   ``self-valorization.{''}},

Title = {Latin American Social Movements and a New Left Consensus: State and
   Civil Society Challenges to Neoliberal Globalization},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-31},
Abstract = {This article explores the shift to the left in Latin America within the
   context of understanding power relations among, within, and between
   social movements and the state. We examine the emergence and development
   of social movement resistance to neoliberal globalization in Latin
   America over the past two decades, as well as how charismatic leaders of
   the left have captured state power. Through an analysis of the Zapatista
   and Appista Movements in Mexico, the Piqueteros and workers' movements
   in Argentina, the Chavistas in Venezuela, and the Aymara coca-growers
   and indigenous movements in Bolivia, as well as an examination of
   presidential behavior and state power in these countries, this article
   describes and enumerates the alternative models of power in use in Latin
   America today, arguing that a combination of strategies working both
   with and autonomously from the state works best to achieve leftist ends.
   The social movements associated with the shift to the left in Latin
   America today are adopting not one but a combination of approaches or
   meshworks in relation to the state and capital, and they seem to fall
   within two general patterns: (1) reformist and autonomous approaches
   toward the state and capital (Zapatistas and Appistas in Mexico and
   Piqueteros and workers' movements in Argentina); (2) autonomous and
   evolutionary approaches toward the state and capital (Aymara Nation in
   Bolivia and Chavismo in Venezuela). This article is an interpretative
   analysis of the dialectical relationship between social movement and
   state power in Latin America using examples from six movements in four
   countries which help us to elucidate the models of power we see
   emerging. We conclude that controlling state power and working
   autonomously from the state, in tandem, is the most effective strategy
   to achieve leftist ends.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},

Number = {4},
Pages = {448-469},
Abstract = {The problem of past emissions - how to share fairly the costs of
   climate-changing emissions caused by polluters who are no longer in
   existence - presents an increasingly pressing challenge to scholars and
   policy-makers. Since standard contribution-based principles are
   inapplicable when it comes to past emissions, theorists have instead
   proposed various non-contribution-based historical principles. This
   paper develops such a principle - the Inherited Debt Principle - which
   seeks to account for the intuition that historical injustice matters to
   current duties in a way that does not appeal to the counterfactual
   benefits derived from that injustice. This principle, it is argued,
   offers a surprisingly plausible solution to the problem of past
   emissions.},

Title = {Enhancing Student Preparedness for Class through Course Preparation
   Assignments: Preliminary Evidence from the Classroom},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Pages = {204-221},
Abstract = {Student preparation for class is an integral part of the college
   learning experience. In order to incentivize student preparation outside
   class, professors have employed such techniques as reflection papers,
   quizzes, and group discussion, to name but a few. This article explores
   the benefits of using a technique known as ``course preparation
   assignments'' (CPAs; Yamane 2006). We argue that this instructional tool
   provides opportunities for significant guided learning beyond the
   classroom through low-stakes writing assignments that emphasize critical
   thinking and analysis of assigned primary or secondary source materials.
   We theorize the three causal mechanisms for CPA success are (1) forced
   engagement with the material, (2) guidance to engage with difficult
   texts, and (3) practice using higher order cognitive skills. Based upon
   multiple student surveys, we find strong evidence that CPAs foster
   active learning in discussion-based courses by increasing the time
   students spend preparing for class and by providing students with a
   heightened sense of preparedness for classroom discussion and
   activities.},

Title = {Social capital and solving the puzzle of Black women's political
   participation},
Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3},
Pages = {331-349},
Abstract = {In the USA, Black women participate in politics at much higher rates
   than expected, especially given that the group ranks low on many of the
   traditional correlates of political participation, such as income and
   education. Using data from the 2000 Social Capital Benchmark Study and
   the 2011 American National Elections Study, we present an intersectional
   model of Black women's political participation. Our results demonstrate
   that many of the traditional factors associated with high levels of
   political participation matter less for Black women as a group and that
   social capital plays a key role in promoting their political
   participation. The high level of social capital in the group, combined
   with a strong substantive effect of social capital, illustrates the
   potential of social capital to help explain the puzzle of Black women's
   political participation. We provide evidence that social capital plays a
   particularly important role for Black women's political participation
   when compared to other groups. Our results demonstrate the importance of
   an intersectional approach to understanding democratic participation,
   particularly for marginalized groups.},

Abstract = {This contribution theorizes the dynamics among functionally overlapping
   international organizations. Such organizations compete for regulatory
   competencies and provide states with forum-shopping opportunities. This
   triggers an inter-organizational dynamic, within which processes of
   organizational adaptation lead to the emergence of a functional division
   of labor. This division of labor is based upon states' interest in
   functioning international organizations and upon the organizations'
   interest in the preservation of their regulatory competencies. An
   empirical case study which analyzes the dynamics among the World Trade
   Organization (WTO), the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO),
   and the World Health Organization (WHO) lends empirical plausibility to
   the theoretical argument.},

Abstract = {The ``crisis of the social issue{''} in the EU has led to a certain
   consensus in the need to renew the organizational and institutional
   model of public administration. The core of the reform implies important
   administrative changes in most of the European welfare states. Those
   changes are inspired on theories such as the new public management,
   management by objectives or partnership. Such changes involve both
   semantic ({''}sharing responsibilities{''}, ``effective costs{''}, or
   the substitution of ``citizen under an administration{''} by
   ``consumer{''}) and political (predominance of scattered forms of power
   and the individualization of responsibilities) transformations which
   operate in the framework of individuals and State relations. The
   paradigms of activation and flexicurity have been central in this public
   administration modernization project. This commitment with new forms of
   governance of social issues has important consequences for the political
   and moral foundations of social cohesion, and the Spanish case is not an
   exception. This paper aims at looking at those representations of
   ``modernization{''} (as they appear in debates about the employment
   services restructuring policies) in detail as well as providing
   references to the trajectory of such reforms of public services since
   the early eighties to the beginning of the crisis.},

Abstract = {In June 2013, explosive claims and illicit revelations of domestic and
   global American intelligence surveillance operations, hacking, and
   collaboration with US Internet and information technology behemoths
   rocked the world. Simultaneously, the mysterious emergence in the Hong
   Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of runaway American
   intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden at the heart of the intrigue
   shoved the small enclave to the fore of global geopolitics. Claiming to
   rely on Hong Kong's respect for the rule of law and tradition of dissent
   to shield him against American retaliation and extradition, the dubious
   protagonist's statements ingratiated himself to local political groups
   who petitioned Hong Kong and central Chinese governments not to send him
   back to the United States. During ``Defend Snowden{''} demonstrations at
   the US consulate in Hong Kong involving hundreds of supporters, placards
   bearing the image of US President Barack Obama parodied, mocked, and
   ridiculed the leader of the free world using iconic adaptations of
   Captain America, George Orwell's ``Big Brother,{''} and Shepard Fairey's
   Obama ``Hope{''} visuals. Instead of an icon of ``American freedom and
   ideology{''} (Serwer 2008) and an ``idealized American nation{''}
   (Dittmer 2005, 627) Captain America, American president Barack Obama,
   and the United States of America were symbolically transformed into a
   signified Orwellian caped crusader threatening the world.},

Title = {Brokered Politics in Brazil: An Empirical Analysis},
Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {269-300},
Abstract = {An emerging literature emphasizes the importance of vote brokers for
   electoral politics in the developing world. Yet in spite of the great
   interest in the topic, attempts to assess the impact of vote brokerage
   on election returns are exceedingly rare. This paper provides the first
   explicit assessment of the electoral returns to politicians from
   purchasing the allegiances of brokers. It does so by drawing upon a
   unique dataset documenting the allocation of off-the-books payments to
   vote brokers during a gubernatorial reelection campaign in the Brazilian
   state of Minas Gerais. The study finds that in the typical municipality
   buying off local brokers was associated with a 4-6 percentage point
   increase in the vote share obtained by the governor. All told, the
   findings suggest that vote brokerage is a resilient form of political
   linkage that can shape vote choice even in contexts of vote secrecy and
   intermediate levels of economic development.},

Abstract = {The paper uses the example of Czech and German cities to examine the
   involvement of the local sphere in multilevel EU governance. Under some
   conceptualizations (multilevel governance, Europeanization and
   paradiplomacy), cities are perceived to be relevant actors. However, the
   range of their competencies and opportunities to create EU politics
   appears rather unclear and has been left largely unexplored. The
   inclusion of the local sphere in the concept of multilevel governance is
   often merely declaratory in character, without offering a clear
   definition of what is meant by its involvement in practice, what its
   nature and scope are and what restrictions apply. This paper attempts to
   initiate a discussion on the role played by cities as the fourth level
   in European governance and use research to data-map the role played by
   cities in European policymaking.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to our understanding of legislative behaviour in
   mixed-member electoral systems through a simple game-theoretic model. It
   argues that legislators seeking re-election in mixed-member electoral
   systems need to take into account the interests of two distinct
   selectorates rather than an electorate in order to maximize the
   probability of regaining a legislative mandate. Assuming that the policy
   interests of list and district selectorates systematically differ,
   legislators may face diverging demands from two principals whose
   relative capability to sanction incumbents crucially hinges upon the
   reward they may offer. Such reward, I argue, is best understood as the
   strength of the nomination, which refers to the probability of
   subsequent election. A simple game-theoretic model then shows how
   variation in the relative strength of both selectorates induces three
   different scenarios with distinct equilibrium outcomes and thus
   effectively impacts patterns of representation.},

Abstract = {In many post-war contexts, former rebels pursue political careers and
   their advancement is part of the formation of new elites. However, while
   some rise to senior political positions, others have to be content with
   lower level positions or are even completely marginalized. The article
   outlines a theory of the emergence and reproduction of elite power in
   the social space of the post-war society to explain this variance. The
   central proposition is that rebel careers are mainly dependent on power
   resources which have been accumulated after the war and not during the
   conflict. Case studies of Liberia and Kosovo serve as a first
   plausibility probe of our thesis and explain the post-war political
   careers of former rebels in the two cases with the help of the
   theoretical conception.},

Abstract = {The year 2011 finally saw the appearance of an English translation of
   Miguel Abensour's groundbreaking interpretation of Marxian political
   theory in Democracy against the State: Marx and the Machiavellian
   Moment. This review essay will provide a brief critical analysis of the
   main elements of Abensour's contribution. Reading Marx in light of a
   radical democratic interpretation of Machiavelli, Abensour locates in
   the former a model of insurgent democratic practice considered in terms
   of the nonsynthetic struggle of the demos against the forces of the
   state, made for the sake of the multiplication of liberty. Despite
   raising certain concerns regarding Abensour's articulation of the
   relation between democracy and the state and democracy and the
   institution, I argue that his work remains not only an innovative
   reinterpretation of Marx's political thought but also an essential
   contribution to contemporary radical democratic literature that seeks to
   affirm the creative, inventive, and nonexhaustible power of the demos.},

Title = {The Content and Integrative Component of Capstone Experiences: An
   Analysis of Political Science Undergraduate Programs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Pages = {222-242},
Abstract = {In 1991, the APSA Task Force on Political Science recommended elements
   of a curricular structure that would best promote student learning. The
   report stated that there should be a capstone experience at the end of
   the senior year and that the capstone should require students to
   integrate their whole learning experience in the major. This article
   seeks to answer the following questions: Have political science
   departments arrived at any best or common practices in implementing
   capstone experiences? Are capstones performing the integrative function
   they were intended to provide? If not, what are the barriers to
   implementing such capstones? The results of a content analysis of course
   catalog listings for political science programs and of a survey of
   department chairs are reported. The study finds that, while the majority
   of programs utilize capstones, integrative capstones are not used
   extensively. Based on the identification of current practices and
   trends, including specialization, resource constraints, and skills and
   program assessment, this study questions whether the Wahlke Report's
   recommendations should be revisited.},

Title = {On climate, conflict and cumulation: suggestions for integrative
   cumulation of knowledge in the research on climate change and violent
   conflict},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE PEACE \& SECURITY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {263-279},
Abstract = {Possible links between climate change and intra-state violent conflict
   have received major scholarly attention in recent years. But with few
   exceptions there is still a low level of consensus in this research
   field. The article argues that one reason for this disagreement is a
   lack of integrative cumulation of knowledge. Such an integrative
   cumulation is prevented by three obstacles, which have until now hardly
   been discussed in the literature. The first is the use of inadequate
   terms, discussed here with a focus on the labels
   `Malthusian'/'cornucopian' and the operationalization of key variables.
   Secondly, the weaknesses of large-N studies in research on climate
   change and violent conflict are not sufficiently reflected. These
   include a lack of data on crucial concepts as well as deficits of widely
   used datasets. Thirdly, literature that deals with a possible link
   between adverse environmental change and peace (termed here
   `environmental peace perspective') has neither been systematized nor
   adequately considered in the debate so far. The article provides
   examples of these shortcomings and makes suggestions of how to address
   each of them. It also develops an integrative theoretical framework for
   the environmental peace perspective which facilitates its consideration
   in research on climate change and violent conflict.},

Abstract = {Current paradigms of human rights and reconciliation call for
   democratization of memories, with former victims interjecting their
   interpretations of the past, challenging the versions recollected by the
   powerful. The trajectory of comfort women issues has implications not
   only for the Japanese democracy, but also for Korea. The shifts in
   memory are about respect for human rights and the beginning of a
   reconciliatory journey between former adversaries. Reconciliation
   involves multiple stages of self-reflexivity, acknowledgement,
   redistributive justice, corrective mechanisms, and a final movement of
   forgiving. In order to transcend the counterproductive blame games,
   memory, human rights, and reconciliation need to be interwoven. The
   rising global awareness of human rights helps to highlight the
   accountability of the individual, once largely overshadowed by groups,
   with political leaders, and nation-states. Memories are no longer
   confined within national borders. As the comfort women monuments in
   Korea and the United States suggest, they become increasingly
   transnational and even global.},

Abstract = {In the constructivist understanding of instruction and learning, the
   focus is moved from a teacher-oriented to a student-oriented learning
   approach and the autonomy of learners and their social interaction
   become central. The teacher is no longer an authoritative source, but
   acts as a mentor who supports students' deep learning. The student's
   role accordingly changes from a passive listener to an active
   constructor of knowledge. Adopting this perspective, the present paper
   first discusses the implications of the philosophical view of
   constructivism for teaching and learning political science, and then
   analyzes the practical implementation of problem-based learning (PBL) as
   a prime example of the constructivist learning framework.},

Abstract = {In his commentary, Rainer Eisfeld questions the ``certainty{''} of
   statements about Michael Freund's work in the post-war era and in the
   Federal Republic. Eisfeld's attempt to verify his hypothesis that Freund
   was not a convinced democrat with a selective selection of quotes and
   information is not conclusive. In the first part of this analysis,
   Eisfeld's questions and findings will be closely examined. In a second
   step, we will show how a differentiated assessment of Freund in the
   Federal Republic might be achieved. This contribution then concludes
   with reflections on further research needs. In this context, an
   intensive exploration of the ``Founding Fathers{''} understanding of
   democracy as well as a discussion about the theoretical and
   methodological basis of the subject's history are required.},

Abstract = {Currently the phenomenon of BRICS group became a highly disputed issue
   in the expert society. One general approach tends to see BRICS as just a
   group of states united superficially in the analysis of the
   international relations on the basis of their economic indicators.
   Consequently, according to this view, there is no real reason for the
   coordinated actions of these states on the global arena. Another view,
   on the contrary, stresses the potential of BRICS to become a new
   mechanism of global governance. Despite the divergence in the
   development models each state in this group has a rising economic
   profile and influential positions in the respective regions. The
   proposed paper aims to review critically various approaches to the role
   of BRICS in the transformation of global governance system, analyze
   prospects of and challenges to the expansion of such a role and assess
   the possible implications for the international relations at global and
   regional levels.},

Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {18-43},
Abstract = {Finland is generally regarded as a country especially inducive to the
   impact and effectiveness of international human rights law. This article
   examines whether this is also the case for the recommendations of UN
   human rights treaty bodies issued in the context of the process of state
   reporting. The objective is to elucidate the factors that contribute to
   the (in) effectiveness of these recommendations by contrasting the
   Finnish experience with that of the Netherlands and New Zealand. In this
   way, the article proposes several measures that could serve as an
   inspiration for Nordic and other countries, in addition to potentially
   strengthening the impact and effectiveness of the reporting process and
   the recommendations at the national level.},

Abstract = {The current phase of the migration-development nexus emphasizes the
   positive potential of migrants. A gender analysis allows for a better
   understanding of this phase. This article focuses on the international
   discourse arena, the Global Forum on Migration and Development (GFMD),
   and on the paradigmatic case of Mexico. Drawing on feminist theory and
   governmentality approaches, it is argued that particular gendered
   subjectivities, based on gender stereotypes, are mobilized, normalizing
   certain forms of behavior and legitimizing political interventions.
   These gendered subjectivities are embedded in the model of the
   heteronormative transnational family, which is expected to guarantee
   stable social relations and the flow of remittances.},

Abstract = {In July 2006, the UK Government published its counter-terrorism strategy
   known as CONTEST, with the aim to reduce the risk to the UK and its
   interests overseas from terrorism. The document has evolved through two
   updated versions {[}Home Office. (2009). Pursue, prevent, protect,
   prepare: The United Kingdom's strategy for countering terrorism. London:
   HMSO; Home Office. (2011). CONTEST: The United Kingdom's strategy for
   countering terrorism. London: Home Office] and outlines four work
   streams or strands, in which each outlines a specific element of
   counter-terrorism policy in the UK. These work streams are: PURSUE,
   which seeks to catch terrorists; PREPARE, which builds resilience to
   attacks; PROTECT, which hardens potential targets and PREVENT, which
   seeks to stop people becoming or supporting terrorists. This paper
   focuses on the PREVENT stream and explores the possible gendering of the
   role undertaken by police officers tasked with implementing PREVENT in
   the West Midlands. As part of this exploration, findings are presented,
   which enable the article to argue that the skill set PREVENT policing
   requires the officers tasked with its use to have and encourages the
   officers to assign a `gender' to the role. Exactly how this `gender' is
   assigned, what the `gender' of PREVENT is thought to be by the officers
   and how these impacts on the implementation of PREVENT are then
   discussed.},

Title = {LATENT INSTITUTIONS: STANDARD BEHAVIOR PATTERNS OCCURRED SPONTANEOUSLY
   AND THEIR POLITICAL MEANING},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2014},
Number = {6},
Pages = {166-182},
Abstract = {Social institutions play a key role in shaping human behavior.
   Especially, they produce standard patterns of human interaction both in
   economic and political life. However, it is unclear whether social
   institutions are the only source of these patterns. In the paper we
   argue that sometimes standard patterns of human interaction could occur
   spontaneously without influence of any social institution due to certain
   evolutionary reasons. Such standard patterns of human interaction might
   exist being not reflected in human consciousness. For a long time they
   might be not discovered and not studied but remain a force which could
   cause a strong political impact. To study such latent standard patterns
   of human interaction we have designed a new technical tool - so-called
   ``latent institutions{''}. Then, we have discovered the two standard
   patterns of human interaction which deemed to be produced evolutionary
   and occurred spontaneously and which supposed to have a great political
   meaning. The both patterns determine aggressive human behavior in
   political interactions. The first of them is typical for the most part
   of population of modern Russia. The second one was typical for many in
   Western countries in the near past. We used the new technique of
   ``latent institutions{''} to study the two new-discovered standard
   patterns. The result is that they are strictly opposite each other.
   Based on the result we have made certain predictions on the future
   development of the Russian and Western political systems.},

Abstract = {Turning to the analysis of the ``democracy{''} notion, the author notes
   that the widely spread understanding of the democratic arrangement
   presuming such elements of a political system as periodical change of
   political leadership by means of free elections and securing broadest
   individual rights as well as minorities' rights within a national state,
   is far from always corresponding to the substantial meaning of the said
   notion. In the context of such an approach it is the concepts of
   electiveness, suffrage, nation-state etc., that become the subject of
   the author's attention. The objective of the article is to initiate a
   discussion of the problematic zones and of the ``tension points{''} of
   democracy, often to be found at the periphery of the political science
   discourse.},

Abstract = {the format of RIC, BRIC and BRICS, the scale and the scope of

   However, there are significant prerequisites for a substantial
   rapprochement of states, and the main of them is the rejection of the
   establishment of a unipolar world. The BRICS could become for its
   participants a key factor both for strengthening positions in the world
   economic system, and for realization of concrete projects. The economic
   relations in the triangle Russia - China - India should be mentioned
   especially as the implementation of such projects is facilitated by the
   neighborhood of the countries in Eurasia. It is also very important to
   develop comprehensively cultural subsystem, first of all, the
   cooperation in the educational sphere (the strong increase in Chinese
   and Indian student enrollments to Russian universities, and medicine and
   natural science should be priority directions; the strengthening of the
   ties in the sphere of higher education and science). Cultural activities
   should also be dramatically expanded. The BRICS countries are not
   interested in a radical breaking of international political and economic
   relations, but are obliged to contribute to sharp strengthening of their
   positions in the world system.},

Abstract = {This review postulates that today's digital environments unveil an era
   of connectivity, in which digital communication devices exercise a
   general influence on social interactions and public deliberation. From
   this perspective, it argues that connective practices are likely to
   affect two main components of the normative public sphere, namely
   rational criticism and ideological sustainability. Drawing on the case
   of the 2011 Arab revolutions, in which social media proved to have a
   strategic function, this paper illustrates the ideological heterogeneity
   of social networks. Additionally, this article considers how issues of
   rational criticism and ideological sustainability could be improved by
   regulating online interactions and proposes that the digital divide
   could act as a natural process of regulation for today's connective and
   transnational public sphere.},

Abstract = {The citizens of a Hobbesian state, timorous and risk averse in times of
   peace, are expected to become valiant soldiers ready to face death for
   the sake of king and country in war. Far from being an outright error,
   this glaring contradiction is an intentional incoherence in Hobbes's
   political philosophy. Hobbes creates a consistently logical model of
   politics based on a simplified vision of man as a psychological egoist,
   which he superimposes onto what he knows is a more complex human nature.
   In political society, man's innate desire for honor must be tamed
   through education. Hobbes's rhetorical strategy thus casts as insane
   anyone willing to take up arms for any reason other than direct threats
   to their own lives. Hobbes, however, aware of the inadequacy of his own
   narrowly self-interested depiction of man, expects that man's yearning
   for honor and fame after death will resurface in times of war.},

   scholarship has nearly exclusively focused on personal and national
   economic experiences. At present, little to no research analyzes the
   impact of economic distress within one's social network on an
   individual's attitudes. Drawing upon network and contact theories, it is
   argued that financial hardship experienced vicariously through one's
   friends should influence an individual's views about the political
   economy, and ultimately, their economic policy preferences, such as
   support for redistribution. Utilizing national survey data, this article
   demonstrates that having economically distressed friends heightens
   perceived class-based bias in the political systemnamely, that the rich
   have undue influence over politics. Further, moderated regression
   analysis reveals that this effect depends upon the prevalence of
   political discussion within one's friendship network. Finally, mediation
   analysis reveals that, by heightening perceived class-based bias,
   distress within one's friendship network indirectly increases support
   for government efforts to redress inequality.},

Abstract = {This article proposes and justifies a hypothesis that one of the key
   mechanisms of state-building in Russia was interregional differentiation
   based on the construction of the image of the internal ``Other{''}. On
   the basis of the historical data, I.Okunev suggests that under the
   Russian conditions the formation of such image occurred through
   reproduction of semi-peripheries in the outlying areas of new
   colonization. This resulted in the following structure i.e.,
   ``center-periphery-semi-periphery{''}, and the country appeared to be
   ``turned inside out{''} toward its far frontiers. Such mental structure
   that reflected priorities of state regional development did not coincide
   with the economic structure, in which the leading economic centers were
   located within the inland areas (primarily, in the Volga region, the
   Urals, and Siberia). The author concluded that it is the reason for the
   eternal dichotomy of territorial development of Russia oscillating
   between centralization and the need for regional development.},

Abstract = {This article explores definitions of terrorism according to various
   women in the Basque regions of Spain and France. We ask how women in
   social movements and government institutions define terrorism, how
   terrorism influences them, and whether they are viewed as victims of
   violence and/or as political agents who challenge terrorism. We discuss
   three definitions of terrorism: ethnonationalist terrorism of ETA
   (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna), state terrorism against ETA operatives and
   supporters, and terrorismo machista (or intimate terrorism seen as
   gender violence). The article uncovers multiple women's lived
   experiences related to terrorism, and by problematising agency and
   definitions of terrorism, it challenges the binary in international
   relations of women as either victims or violent perpetrators of
   terrorism and it establishes terrorismo machista as political violence
   closely related to other forms of political violence. We conclude that
   women are important political agents regarding multiple types of
   terrorism.},

Abstract = {Since the first studies concerning the interferences between the
   political cycle and the business cycle, authors have provided
   suggestions with regard to what should be done in order to fight induced
   electoral instability. This issue is particularly interesting given the
   fact that the above-mentioned fluctuations exist only in the case of
   voters: we may thus infer either that the voters are ignorant and allow
   such fluctuations to occur or that the only criterion applied for voting
   decisions is the economic one and that voters prefer to have economic
   wealth in the present, punishing the governments which implement
   economic policies with average and long term results. This research aims
   to test the interferences between political cycles and business cycles
   on the case of three countries: Slovakia, Romania and the Republic of
   Moldova. The scope is to verify the hypothesis according to which the
   government prefers an expansionist policy before the elections,
   resulting in a lower level of taxes and unemployment and contributing,
   at the same time, to the increase of the consumption per inhabitant, of
   the GDP and of the subventions granted by the government; this, in turn,
   is followed by a restrictive policy after the elections. Just like
   governmental policies depend on the ``habits{''} of the voters, this
   paper analyses the circumstances in which a non-representative behaviour
   of the voters may determine the behaviour of the government, with
   effects on the economy.},

Volume = {27},
Number = {105},
Pages = {163+},
Abstract = {This article analyses the conditions under which educational French
   actors appropriate and use a pedagogic innovation (mini-companies in
   secondary schools) intended to develop the pupils' entrepreneurial
   skills. In contrast to research developped in a Foucauldian perspective,
   seeing this type of pedagogy as an instrument of production of a new
   ethos fitted to a world valuing interindividual competition, the
   article, based on an inquiry conducted in schools, shows that these
   projects, especially designed for pupils from working class or
   middle-class backgrounds, are primarily mobilized to serve school
   purposes. They tend less to acclimatize the pupils to entrepreneurial
   thinking and behaviour, than to familiarize them with the places
   assigned to them in the school system, and therefore with the places
   that the production system reserves to them.},

Title = {How to Become an Independent Agency: The Creation of the German Federal
   Network Agency},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {43-58},
Abstract = {The German Federal Network Agency (FNA) was established in 2005 as
   multi-utilities regulator thereby creating Germany's first energy
   regulator. It maintains a quite exceptional position in the landscape of
   German agencies because of its far-reaching independence from political
   influence. This independence represents an empirical puzzle, because in
   Germany no comprehensive agencification of the federal administration
   can be observed and independent agencies are rather an exception than a
   rule. This article explores whether this puzzle can be plausibly solved
   by the approach of institutional isomorphism. It argues that the German
   government faced informal pressure from the European Commission and its
   endeavour to build a network of European energy regulators at the
   European level. Furthermore, independent regulatory agencies
   increasingly became a kind of guiding model in the utilities sector.
   Therefore, mechanisms of coercive and mimetic isomorphism can be seen as
   plausible explanations of the agency's independence.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the legal structures and the power concentration
   that developed after the creation of the first revolutionary organs.
   Therefore, it thoroughly examines the Fundamental Statute of the
   Republic of Nicaragua, the Council of State, the Statute on the Rights
   and Guarantees of Nicaraguans, the Statute of the National Assembly and
   the decrees issued by the Executive and Legislative branches. The paper
   describes the arduous route that led to the consolidation of the
   governmental institutions in Nicaragua. This process took place while
   the Reagan Administration funded armed groups known as
   ``contrarrevolucionarios{''}. On the one hand, the analysis emphasizes
   the inconsistencies and confusion of the legal instruments involved and,
   on the other hand, the gestation of a reinforced presidentialism that
   mutilated the independence of the other governmental branches. Both of
   them will be noticed in the Constitution of 1987.},

Abstract = {This article studies the first year of chavismo without Hugo Chavez
   presence in Venezuelan politics. 2013 was not only marked by the death
   of the re-elected president Chavez, but also for how close the
   opposition was to winning the presidential election held to choose a new
   president. The results of this election set the pattern for the year's
   political life, which saw an increase in the level of confrontation
   between the two forces. After taking a look at the countries
   increasingly troubled economy and safety situation and at the December
   local elections, the article concludes analyzing the possibilities that
   open up with the upcoming electoral vacuum.},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {In early 2009, Guadeloupe experienced a 44-day strike against the high
   cost of living and against the illegitimate profits some actors realise
   in the Island's economy. Some of these dominant actors being heirs of
   settlers families, high prices are the starting point for a radical
   political critique. This article analyses the links between violence and
   the use of numbers in the course of the conflict. The mobilisation was a
   time of violence, clashes, and intimidation; but the denunciation of
   abuse also ascribes a central role to quantification, in order to
   estimate profit. This article shows how the figures comprise an
   instrument of mediation being used as a substitute for, or in
   combination with, multifaceted violent actions. It also shows that the
   figures may be themselves coercive techniques, playing a part in violent
   relationships. Quantification can therefore be combined, in a plurality
   of ways, with the transition to violence, not only by avoiding or
   replacing it, but sometimes overlapping with it or being its instrument.},

Abstract = {There were four key issues in Honduras's political conjuncture. First,
   the persistent violence and criminality that made of Honduras the most
   violent country in the world. Second, the clash between government and
   media on the issue of legislative reforms in the telecommunications
   sector. Third, the increase in social protest, especially of teachers,
   indigenous groups, and Afro-Honduran peasants, as a reaction to the
   deepening of neoliberal reforms. And fourth, the general elections,
   whose disputed results allowed the ruling party to continue in
   government. However, the election's results show that Honduras is
   undergoing a profound process of reconfiguration of the political party
   system.},

Abstract = {All non-essential functions of the United States federal government were
   shut down during the first two weeks of October 2013, due to a lapse in
   appropriations for fiscal year 2014. This disruption has a root in the
   Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was passed in March
   2010 to overhaul the US healthcare system. The law was a compromise
   reached to reconcile opposition from various interest groups. By
   examining the politics of opposition to the enactment of the law, this
   study demonstrates how health policies in the United States are shaped
   by political and economic forces emanating from multiple sectors of
   society.},

Journal = {SECURITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS},

Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {312-327},
Abstract = {Like many other successor states of the Soviet Union Ukraine had to find
   a means to accommodate a Russian minority. The Crimean Peninsula was
   granted territorial autonomy within an otherwise unitary Ukrainian
   state. After already striving for this autonomy in the 1990s, the final
   design of the autonomy defined by the Ukrainian state and the Crimean
   constitution remained weak, as Kiev was anxious not to open a Pandora's
   box for further disintegration. The events of March 2014 showed that the
   autonomy was seemingly regarded as insufficient protection by the mainly
   Russian population of Crimea and mobilisation for integration into the
   Russian Federation was high. This paper argues that although without the
   military support of Russia the secession would not have been possible, a
   single focus on Russian aggression is short-sighted in explaining why
   the Crimean autonomy failed. Issues of a lack of power-sharing,
   Ukrainian state fragility and opposing identity narratives have to be
   considered as well.},

Abstract = {Political actors often use public diplomacy in an attempt to promote
   their messages. This study deals with the frame-building process and
   presents the frames on terror used by political actors involved in three
   conflicts that utilize terror as a weapon: the conflict between the
   United States and al-Qaida, the conflict between the United Kingdom and
   Islamic groups, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Each political
   actor's story is divided into three elements (compatible to Entman's
   ``framing{''} definition): problem, cause, and solution. Differences
   among the frames promoted by the actors are explained by variations in
   cultural values and a country's role in the international arena and in
   its previous experience in conflicts.},

Pages = {180-189},
Abstract = {The article tests the wisdom of amending the OSCE rule of consensus
   against past experiences of introducing a ``consensus minus one{''}
   procedure, establishing mandatory cooperative ``mechanisms{''} which can
   be triggered by a qualified minority of states, or introducing
   autonomously operating institutions. It argues that amending the
   consensus rule does not per se lead to a stronger Organization for
   Security and Co-operation in Europe. While the participating states
   could benefit from more independent osce institutions, decisions leading
   in that direction would need time to mature, particularly in the current
   political environment marked by the very low level of mutual trust
   within the OSCE.},

Journal = {NATIONAL IDENTITIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3, SI},

Abstract = {This article explores German planning history of the interwar period,
   the Third Reich, and immediate post-war developments. It discusses how
   landscape was understood as a common cultural good and mediated through
   the homeland preservation movement. The focus is on the ideas of the
   landscape design profession based around the landscape advocates Hinrich
   Meyer-Jungclaussen and Alwin Seifert. The example of the German Autobahn
   highlights the way in which nature and modern technologies were merged
   and how these made technological modernisation socially acceptable. The
   article shows how the process of `scenic embedding' became far more
   ideologically loaded under National Socialism.},

Abstract = {Th is article discusses some challenges and reflections related to the
   area of intelligence in Mexico from a review of the most violent
   scenarios of the Federal Policy War Against Drug Trafficking from 2006
   to 2012 (PFDGCN) are presented. These show the defficiency of one
   historical model of unilateral intelligence personified by the National
   System of Public Security, which did not generated the development of
   greater social cohesion like strategy every day.
   The cases presented are taken up according to the daily social
   indifference that existed in relationship to the operation of bodies of
   organized crime in the areas of monitoring and informal communication
   networks used for the creation of the most violent scenes of PFDGCN.
   Also discussed in the light of the crime concept proposed by Emile
   Durkheim in context of equality that implies the twenty one century.},

Title = {Habermas and the Ideia Radical Reformism: Political Justice in the Era
   of Post-Socialism and the Crisis of Capitalism},
Journal = {REVISTA ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {148-169},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study undertakes an analysis of the political thought of Habermas
   by examining the concept of radical reformism. The argument is conducted
   in two areas: (a) from the time of his first works when he was engaged
   in a criticism of the social-democrat project for a welfare state,
   Habermas argued in favor of a broadening of democratic procedures in
   every social sphere. This was a means of overcoming the bureaucratic
   nature of the State and political parties and the way the democracy of
   the masses is administered, and showing how this could be reflected in
   the economy, culture and politics; (b) from the 1980s onwards, he sought
   to bring about a reaffirmation of the Social-De mocratic project for a
   welfare state at a time of crisis for social democracy and the
   neo-liberal hegemony. This led to the assertion of what for Habermas,
   was a reflective continuity of the State's plans for social welfare and
   was bound up with an affirmation of what social-democracy would
   represent after the collapse of ``real socialism{''}, its alternative
   and the theoretical-political stance par excellence of the non-Communist
   Western left. As a result, the current model of socio-political justice
   would clearly be centred on the reaffirmation of the welfare state,
   while the central driving-force of our democratic societies would be
   opposed to the economic laissez-faire policies of austerity that endowed
   them with legitimacy.},

Abstract = {The European Parliament (EP) has one of the highest proportions of women
   in its ranks, with over a third in 2009. Although previous research has
   pointed to the use of proportional representation (PR) in European
   elections as friendlier' to women, few have looked at differences in the
   types of PR rules in use in each country. In this article, we argue that
   the conventional wisdom according to which institutional designthe
   choice of electoral rulesshould shape the composition of the EP does not
   hold, and suggest that the well-documented empirical connection between
   electoral rules and descriptive representation might in fact be an
   endogenous rather than a causal relationship.},

Abstract = {The class cleavage has been the most important structuring force in most
   West European countries. In the last decades, the question regarding
   whether the social class still influences voting behavior has been
   intensively debated. One strand of literature suggests a transformation
   of the old class divide into a new - or reformulated - class cleavage.
   However, there is still little empirical evidence about the
   circumstances under which this new divide may become important. The
   present paper contributes to fill this gap, by analyzing in how far
   electoral competition conditions the strength of the new class cleavage.
   Applying data from the Swiss National Elections 2007 and 2011 to a
   comparative analysis across cantons we find that the impact of the new
   class cleavage on electoral choice varies according to party system
   polarization. The proportionality of the electoral system, by contrast,
   does not have a clear conditional effect.},

   boarding of the events of February 27th, 1989, and days that continue
   {[}27F]. The first part corresponds with a description of the events
   associated with the whole cycle of protest, trying to delimit different
   stages along with it using two criteria: the type of violence and the
   nature of involved actors. The second part of the work considers the
   different types of explanation generated to explain 27F as a cycle of
   protest: (a) the explanations that are based on social and psychosocial
   factors; (b) the explanations that accepts the existence of a conspiracy
   action. Finally, in the third part, are considered the consequences that
   27F had for the subsequently develop of the venezuelan political
   processes.},

Abstract = {Although citizens often arrive at the same views as their political
   party's leaders, they also respond to information about policy targets
   and effects. Accounting for political context, even in the United
   States, encourages a variable view of how partisanship shapes opinions
   in policy debates. In three survey experiments associated with policies
   supported by both Democrats and Republicans, I find that both aspects of
   policy argumentation and the actors making the arguments can enable
   partisanship to affect public opinion. This process is highly
   conditional, however: sometimes polarization occurs only with the
   presence of a single politician; in other areas, polarization is likely
   following presentation of evidence by either partisan side. The effect
   of policy information on partisan polarization is variable across
   political and policy contexts.},

Abstract = {Parties often are associated with specific issues. They can own an issue
   when they develop a reputation of competence and attention in that
   domain. This paper develops an individual-level model of the effects of
   issue ownership, distinguishing between two aspects of this concept:
   which party is considered to care most about a given issue (associative
   ownership), and which one is perceived to have the best solutions
   (competence ownership). When a party is the associative owner of a given
   issue, voters' preferences on the corresponding issue should have a
   larger impact on the evaluation of the issue owner. But when a party is
   considered to be most competent in that domain, the effect of spatial
   distances should decrease. These hypotheses are tested with a
   statistical model that allows the impact of voter-party issue distances
   on party utilities to vary across both parties and issues. This model is
   tested with data from the 2011 Swiss election study.},

Title = {A perfect match? The impact of statement selection on voting advice
   applications' ability to match voters and parties},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},
Pages = {252-262},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study examines how statement selection systematically affects the
   output of voting advice applications (VAAs). Does the statement
   selection influence how often voters are matched with parties that
   `should be' close to them? Our benchmark is a classic account of issue
   voting, the proximity left-right model. We analyze the Belgian VAA Do
   the Vote Test and find that the output resembles the left-right model.
   When more left-right statements are included, more left-wing voters get
   the advice to vote for left-wing parties and the same is true on the
   right, while simultaneously advantaging parties with more extreme
   positions on this dimension. We also analyze issue saliency and find
   that parties are disadvantaged when more statements about salient issues
   are included. These findings imply tough choices for VAA builders. (C)

Journal = {FRENCH POLITICS},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Two decades ago many commentators suggested that economic globalisation
   had eroded social democratic economic policy capacity. Although this
   argument has largely been discredited, the global financial crisis has
   revived the state-market debate. As governments succumb to fiscal
   consolidation, a similar theory of declining state capacity now
   challenges social democrats. This article redresses the contemporary
   situation by using the economic globalisation debate from the mid-1990s
   to 2005 as a lens through which to comparatively analyse the current
   fiscal policy positions of the Parti Socialiste and the Labour Party. It
   draws similarities between the two situations and illustrates how
   contested notions of the contemporary political economy constrain social
   democratic fiscal policy capacity, suggesting that greater capacity
   exists than is currently acknowledged.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the question regarding post bellum norms of how
   to balance the antagonism between retribution and reconciliation.
   Therefore, the author conducts empirical and inductive research,
   considering the Treaty of Peace with Japan, specifically analyzing the
   process of drafting provisions for war criminals of this treaty. These
   analyses indicate that the methodology, which secures retribution
   through restrained reconciliation, is embodied in Article 11 of the
   Treaty of Peace with Japan. The findings of this study suggest that
   restraining reconciliation for retribution as well as relaxing
   retribution for reconciliation is acceptable for implementing post
   bellum norms.},

Abstract = {The U.S. national military hires private security companies (PSCs) to
   operate in zones of conflict. This article introduces the concept of a
   legitimacy transfer mechanism to answer the question of how nonnational
   providers of military support can be considered legitimate actors in
   areas of conflict. PSCs borrow legitimacy from the state that contracts
   the firm. Private firms do not operate alone; they are hired and, at
   least marginally, directed by a state. By using the established
   legitimacy of industrialized states these firms are able to find
   legitimacy in Western security culture. To maintain future business,
   private security is forced to obey the security culture of the hiring
   state. More so, the firm will mimic the goals and policy of the hiring
   state in an attempt to build its own, independent, sense of legitimacy.},

Abstract = {Culture is a demanding word, particularly when it is used in the context
   of the contemporary academic discipline of international relations (IR).
   It is often employed in order to distinguish one identity from another,
   allegedly illuminating idiosyncrasies embedded in a particular society
   or group of people. The essentialized understanding of culture is also
   detectable in the case of the current debate on the non-Western
   international relations theories (IRT). Non-Western politicians and
   scholars often employ the term culture in order to distinguish their
   values from alleged Western values. However, culture has another
   important function mainly advanced by a left-wing Kyoto School
   philosopher Tosaka Jun, that is, culture as a mirror for critical
   reflection for morality (Tosaka, 1966). This article is based on
   Tosaka's argument that culture has an important function for moral
   reflection beyond that of a mere means to identify one's distinctiveness
   from the West, and it criticizes Japan's soft power diplomacy or the
   total absence of it from that point of view. It also argues that this
   absence is the result of the soft power discourse's over-simplified
   interpretation of culture that results in confrontation between the West
   and the rest, particularly when it is employed in non-Western IRT
   discourses. Towards the end, I examine Miyazaki Hayao's films, Princes
   Mononoke in particular, as examples of cultural works facilitating a
   moment of critical reflection, and I extract embedded messages of
   relevance to critical reflection on contemporary IR literature,
   particularly non-Western literature.},

Abstract = {Liberal international relations theory posits that the behaviour of
   states is affected both by domestic interests and other states with
   which they are linked in significant patterns of interdependence. This
   article examines the relevance of this proposition to states' behaviour
   in the most powerful institution in the furthest reaching example of
   regional integration in the world today: the Council of the European
   Union. Compared to previous research, more detailed evidence is analysed
   in this article on the substance of the political debates that preceded
   Council votes. It is found that states' disagreement with both
   discretionary and nondiscretionary decision outcomes affects the
   likelihood that they dissent at the voting stage. Moreover, in line with
   the theory posited here, the behaviour of states' significant trading
   partners has a particularly marked effect on the likelihood that they
   will dissent.},

Abstract = {While United Nations peacekeeping missions were created to keep peace
   and perform post-conflict activities, since the end of the Cold War
   peacekeepers are more often deployed to active conflicts. Yet, we know
   little about their ability to manage ongoing violence. This article
   provides the first broad empirical examination of UN peacekeeping
   effectiveness in reducing battlefield violence in civil wars. We analyze
   how the number of UN peacekeeping personnel deployed influences the
   amount of battlefield deaths in all civil wars in Africa from 1992 to
   2011. The analyses show that increasing numbers of armed military troops
   are associated with reduced battlefield deaths, while police and
   observers are not. Considering that the UN is often criticized for
   ineffectiveness, these results have important implications: if
   appropriately composed, UN peacekeeping missions reduce violent
   conflict.},

Abstract = {This article presents a unified theory explaining several conflicting
   empirical observations in the politics of campaign finance. It
   identifies those circumstances that foster or frustrate the enactment of
   financing laws that increase the competitiveness of elections. I argue
   that the competitiveness of financing laws is a result of three strong
   incentives when they operate in differently structured party systems.
   First, lawmakers have an incentive to make laws to protect their
   incumbency from competitors. This incentive generally overwhelms the
   (weaker) incentive to enact popular, competition-enhancing reforms.
   Secondly, lawmakers, when they act through political parties, have an
   incentive to cooperate with rivals to reduce the costs of political
   defeats. Thirdly, lawmakers seek to enact reforms that are consistent
   with their normative goals. These incentives combine with several party
   system variables to determine when campaign finance reform is likely to
   occur and how it will impact on the competitiveness of elections.},

Abstract = {This article takes as a point of departure a well-known but rarely
   tested assumption in the literature on state-building and
   democratisation, namely that democratic regimes in newly established
   states are politically unstable. When states take their first steps as
   independent entities, the state-building process is often incomplete,
   the political institutions fragile and democratic routines yet to be
   established. However, with increasing years of independence, these
   democratic shortcomings are expected to be remedied. This makes it
   reasonable to assume that the likelihood of democratic failure decreases
   with increasing years as an independent state. Based on an extensive
   empirical data set, the conclusion was reached that there is indeed a
   negative relationship between the length of independence and democratic
   failure and that this association is insensitive to the period in time
   when the countries received their independence. Furthermore, the results
   suggest that the length of democratic rule has a positive impact on
   democratic stability. However, this pattern is detectable only in states
   created after 1946.},

Abstract = {Since 2005, the Christian Democrats (CDU) modernised family and labour
   market policy by supporting gender equality. Recent explanations trace
   this back to their competition with the Social Democrats (SPD) for
   female voters. What is missing from these accounts is a discussion of
   coalition dynamics. We argue that the drive for modernisation faltered
   under Angela Merkel's second term for three reasons: (1) coalitional
   dynamics in the new Conservative-Liberal coalition; (2) the
   traditionalist CSU wanted to distinguish itself from the moderate
   impulses of the CDU; and (3) the CDU reacted by moving away from its
   former `social democratisation'. As a result, gender equality policies
   in the family and labour market slowed and developed increasing
   inconsistency by indicating not only openness for modern but also
   emphasising conservative ideas. Despite the inherent contradictions this
   appealed to many different voters and contributed to a substantial
   victory for the CDU in the federal election of 2013.},

Abstract = {Expert surveys are a valuable, commonly used instrument to measure party
   positions. Some critics question the cross-national comparability of
   these measures, though, suggesting that experts may lack a common anchor
   for fundamental concepts such as economic left-right. Using anchoring
   vignettes in the 2010 Chapel Hill Expert Survey, we examine the extent
   of cross-national difference in expert ideological placements. We find
   limited evidence of cross-national differences; on the whole, our
   findings further establish expert surveys as a rigorous instrument for
   measuring party positions in a cross-national context.},

Title = {Does Survey Participation Increase Voter Turnout? Re-examining the
   Hawthorne Effect in the Swedish National Election Studies},

Abstract = {A Hawthorne effect found in election studies is that pre-election survey
   participation increases voter turnout. Using the Swedish National
   Election Studies, Granberg and Holmberg (1992) showed evidence in
   support of this effect. However, their findings have been criticized and
   more recent studies have failed to find any treatment effect of
   pre-election survey participation (cf. Mann 2005). This study
   re-examines an updated version of Granberg and Holmberg's time-series
   cumulative data file covering eight additional election studies (for a
   total of 14 election studies from 1960 to 2010). These studies have an
   experimental component, since half of the sample was randomly assigned
   to be interviewed before the election and the other half after the
   election. By comparing validated turnout in the pre-election sample with
   the post-election sample, it is possible to estimate the causal effect
   of survey participation on voter turnout. The results show that
   participating in the pre-election survey indeed has a significant and
   positive effect on voter turnout. Moreover, this article evaluates
   whether the treatment effect is unevenly distributed in the population.
   Results show that citizens with a low propensity to vote are more
   affected by taking part in election studies than citizens with a high
   propensity to vote. The study also estimates the long-term effects of
   survey participation. Results show that participating in an election
   survey can have significant effects on voter turnout several years
   later.},

Abstract = {Studies on what causes a state to democratize have focused on economic,
   social, and international factors. Many of them argue that higher levels
   of education should promote democracy. However, few articulate clearly
   how education affects democratization, and fewer still attempt to test
   the supposed link across time and space. This article fills that gap by
   considering how different levels of education influence democratization,
   and the conditions under which education is most likely to promote
   democracy. Analyses of eighty-five authoritarian spells from 1970 to
   2008 find that higher levels of mass, primary, and tertiary education
   are robustly associated with democratization. Secondary analyses
   indicate that education is most effective in promoting democratization
   when both males and females are educated. An illustration from Tunisia
   follows.},

   China-US BIT negotiations. This is important as the United States has
   become a significant designation for China's outbound FDI; numerous

Abstract = {This article aims to analyse the contribution made by Christian
   movements towards constructing a democratic citizenship in an
   authoritarian context in the backward province of Albacete. Our study
   attempts to analyse the efforts made by grassroots Catholic sectors to
   foster democratic enclaves free from the interference of the Francoist
   state in 1960s and 1970s Spain. These alternative social spaces enabled
   new habits of civil resistance that confronted the socio-cultural
   hegemony of authoritarian values. As a result, throughout these years,
   various social groups started to challenge the sense of the regime's
   impregnable unity. This grassroots experience with the ``power of the
   powerless{''} laid the foundations for negotiations among the political
   elites during the transition to democracy in Spain.},

Abstract = {South Africa's 1996 Constitution is widely lauded as the world's most
   liberal Constitution, yet the document was marred by its context:
   democratisation alongside the accumulation of excessive corporate power
   and the adoption of neoliberal public policy. The 1990s transition
   period generated, in turn, even worse inequality, poverty, unemployment
   and uneven development than during apartheid. The Constitution thus
   became a distraction in vital battles by poor and working people,
   including the first use of its celebrated socio-economic rights for
   unsuccessful interventions in healthcare (kidney dialysis) (1997),
   housing (2000) and water (2009). On the one hand, defensive courtroom
   postures were maintained with the document's help (e.g. anti-eviction
   injunctions) and occasional offensive victories were registered (e.g.
   AIDS medicines for pregnant women to halt HIV transmission to babies).
   But the overall impact was to direct those entering a legal alleyway
   with great expectations, into a cul-de-sac where satisfactory exit was
   blocked by property rights. The only way out has been much more explicit
   direct action, instead of community activists wasting further time,
   effort, resources and strategic credibility promoting the Constitution.},

Abstract = {Umlazi is considered the second most populated African township in South
   Africa, after Soweto. Located in southwestern Durban, Umlazi has long
   been a site of community movements, especially during apartheid.
   Umlazi's Ward 88 was a site of political revival in 2012, a time when
   ideas unified people and motivated them to pursue a common goal. The
   name of those ideas was `Occupy', following a film screening of the 2011
   Occupy movement. There are a variety of lessons from assessing several
   weeks of protest marred by state violence, followed by a Ward Committee
   election won by the Occupy movement, followed by uneven access to
   development resources. The ebb and flow of ideology is one such lesson:
   it is a necessary part of moving from local to global, to address both
   deep problems and the politicians who sustain them.},

Abstract = {We examine group mobilization in direct democracy elections by assessing
   the conditions under which interests will actively support or oppose
   ballot measures. Motivating our analysis is that the decision to
   mobilize is driven by the costs and benefits of group participation, a
   calculus shaped by issue characteristics, state political institutions,
   and the electoral context. Using data from initiative and referendum
   measures appearing on statewide ballots from 2003 to 2008, we find that
   ballot measures involving social and tax issues are likely to produce
   competition among groups and increase the overall number of groups
   involved. In addition, we find that group competition and levels of
   mobilization increased in response to how difficult it would be for the
   legislature to undo the change brought about from passage of a ballot
   measure. Lastly, group competition and levels of mobilization increased
   for ballot measures appearing in nonpresidential election years and for
   ballot measures featuring a close election. Taken together, our results
   suggest that groups engage strategically in direct democracy elections
   to pursue a mix of policy and political goals.},

Abstract = {This article draws upon developments in UK research on political
   rhetoric and political performance in order to examine the incident in
   2013 when French President Francois Hollande committed French forces to
   a US-led punitive strike against Syria, after the use of chemical
   weapons in a Damascus suburb on 21 August. The US-led retaliation did
   not take place. This article analyses Hollande's declaration on 27 July
   and his TV appearance on 15 September. His rhetoric and style are best
   understood as generic to the nature of the presidential office of the
   Fifth Republic. The article concludes by appraising how analysis of the
   French case contributes to the developing literature on rhetoric,
   celebrity and performance.},

Abstract = {The article analyses the procedural requirements that authorities must
   fulfil when granting authorisation for new electricity generating
   capacity according to Article 7 of the Electricity Directive 2009/72/EB.
   Pursuant to the provisions of Article 7 Member States must publish the
   authorisation procedure and the criteria for granting authorisations.
   The criteria must be objective, transparent and non-discriminatory. The
   article asks what these requirements entail and whether they meet the
   intended purpose to ensure access to generating activities and free
   competition. It argues that the rules are too general and do not take
   into account the differing and complex procedures in the Member States
   and the diverse nature of electricity generation plants.},

Title = {Moral panic in Icelandic society: Arrival of ecstasy to Iceland},
Journal = {ICELANDIC REVIEW OF POLITICS \& ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {The use of illegal drugs has often been shown to ignite fear and
   insecurity in society. When a new drug appears the media typically
   reports on this drug and the risk it poses. Soon after ecstasy appeared
   in Iceland in the 1990s its use created a major public uproar and
   insecurity in Icelandic society. In the article the theory of moral
   panic will be used to examine if the arrival of ecstasy to Iceland
   ignited a moral panic. Media reports on ecstasy, public reactions,
   interest groups and government institutions will be analysed. Discourse
   analysis is employed on newspaper reporting on ecstasy between 1985 and
   1997 to detect signs of moral panic. The main conclusion is that
   evidence suggests that a moral panic existed in Iceland as described in
   well-known theories on the subject.},

Abstract = {Will a plurality of cleavages `pull' parties in different directions?
   Are these strains particularly troublesome when competing on issues that
   lack an obvious dimensional fit? Are some parties more likely than
   others to experience these tensions? And does it matter? While the
   essence of the party-political space has received substantial coverage,
   less attention is paid to the effects that multidimensionality may have
   on issue competition. Comparing British and Swedish parties, this
   article analyses how any contradictory positions have been negotiated,
   and when such tensions are likely to emerge.},

Abstract = {While there is much to appreciate in Roy Germano's essay, I argue that
   the analytic filmmaking project as currently presented has flaws that
   need to be addressed before we can proceed with this approach. First,
   Germano underemphasizes many of the similarities among visual, audio,
   and textual data collection and analysis while at the same time failing
   to note important ways in which the two differ. Second, the discussion
   of documentary filmmaking focuses on a particular style of documentary
   and neglects to consider documentaries that are similar in their
   construction to the type of analytic filmmaking he argues for in the
   article. This emphasis on the differences creates needless and
   potentially problematic schisms between two groups of empirical
   researchers who have a great deal in common, in terms of interests and
   methods. Finally, the theoretical framework and the connection between
   theory and data need to be presented much more explicitly so that the
   viewer can follow the argument of the film.},

   candidates in the United States},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {35},
Pages = {283-291},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper shows that attitudes towards Mormons are very divisive on two
   levels: many religious conservatives distrust Mormons and refuse to vote
   for them because they are not Christian as they claim to be, while
   religious and political liberals see Mormons as part of a repressive
   religious coalition along with evangelicals and Catholics. Mormon
   politicians are in an awkward position between these two sides of
   America's ``culture war,{''} not fully accepted by either. Using new
   survey questions about attitudes towards Mormons and Mitt Romney, this
   paper explores the nature of the two anti-Mormonisms and their electoral
   consequences. I argue that feelings about Mormonism have been an
   important factor in respondent evaluations of Mitt Romney. (C) 2014

   to the European level},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {451-475},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Since the 1980s, the level of activism of regions in European Union
   policy-making has greatly increased, leading to the emergence of claims
   that regional governments can and do bypass national government in
   European negotiations. However, two decades after the emergence of the
   concept, the debate about the ability of regions to engage successfully
   in this process of continuous negotiation and to represent their
   interests on the European stage is ongoing. Due to the scarcity of
   research looking at regional interest representation in concrete cases
   of policy-making, it has been difficult to establish to what extent and
   under which circumstances regions do rely on unmediated channels of
   interest representation on the European level. This article examines
   these questions through the activities of seven legislative regions
   during two negotiations of European Directives, as legislative regions
   have a wider choice of channels of interest representation. Overall,
   extensive use of unmediated access in regulatory policy-making is rare
   and can best be explained with reference to domestic conflict and the
   level of influence of a region in domestic European policy-making.
   Differences in the size of a region also influence the ability of a
   region to represent its interests in the coordination of the national
   position and at the European level.},

Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {42},
Number = {4},
Pages = {415-442},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This essay explores the political significance of two largely unexplored
   texts on American radio that Adorno originally composed in English after
   emigrating to the United States: Current of Music: Elements of a Radio
   Theory and The Psychological Technique of Martin Luther Thomas' Radio
   Addresses. Here, productively complicating the traditional image of him,
   Adorno translates his theory to a broader public in ways that reflect a
   desire to understand and inform democratic citizenship as enacted at the
   level of the everyday customs, conventions, and habits of the people.
   Ultimately, Adorno's writings on radio in the United States show how he
   tries to strengthen the substantive practice of democracy through a
   unique form of democratic leadership as democratic pedagogy that
   represents the practical enactment of an early version of negative
   dialectics. With this justification for Adorno's complicated commitments
   to democracy in mind, we might begin to read him as a twentieth-century
   democratic theorist and productively turn to an unlikely thinker, not
   just to read a message in a bottle but to help us chart our current
   position and navigate our future course.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the link between political sophistication and
   electoral volatility. Showing that there is disagreement in the
   literature on whether switching party preferences is related to low or
   high levels of political sophistication, it is then argued that the
   effect of sophistication on vote switching might differ depending on
   when switching is measured. The effect of timing on volatility is
   investigated by means of the Short-term panel of the 2009 German
   Longitudinal Election Study. Results indicate that timing indeed
   matters, while sophistication increases the probability of switching
   parties before the campaign, the effect of political sophistication
   becomes more negative as Election Day draws near.},

Abstract = {A robust finding in the welfare state literature is that public support
   for the welfare state differs widely across countries. Yet recent
   research on the psychology of welfare support suggests that people
   everywhere form welfare opinions using psychological predispositions
   designed to regulate interpersonal help giving using cues regarding
   recipient effort. We argue that this implies that cross-national
   differences in welfare support emerge from mutable differences in
   stereotypes about recipient efforts rather than deep differences in
   psychological predispositions. Using free-association tasks and
   experiments embedded in large-scale, nationally representative surveys
   collected in the United States and Denmark, we test this argument by
   investigating the stability of opinion differences when faced with the
   presence and absence of cues about the deservingness of specific welfare
   recipients. Despite decades of exposure to different cultures and
   welfare institutions, two sentences of information can make welfare
   support across the U. S. and Scandinavian samples substantially and
   statistically indistinguishable.},

Abstract = {How do episodes of intergroup violence affect political opinions toward
   outgroup members? Recent studies offer divergent answers. Some suggest
   violence deepens antagonism and reduces support for compromise, while
   others contend it encourages moderation and concessions to prevent
   further conflict. We argue that violence can fuel both hostility toward
   the outgroup and acceptance of outgroup objectives and provide evidence
   from a unique survey of 1,380 respondents implemented by the authors in
   greater Khartoum in Sudan in 2010 and 2011. We find that Northerners who
   experienced rioting by Southerners in Khartoum in 2005 were more likely
   to support Southern independence but less likely to support citizenship
   for Southerners remaining in the North. In combination, these results
   suggest that political violence hardens negative intergroup attitudes
   and makes individuals willing to concede separation to avoid living
   alongside outgroup members.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {1},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Humans are fundamentally primed for making causal attributions based on
   correlations. This implies that researchers must be careful to present
   their results in a manner that inhibits unwarranted causal attribution.
   In this paper, we present the results of an experiment that suggests
   regression models - one of the primary vehicles for analyzing
   statistical results in political science - encourage causal
   interpretation. Specifically, we demonstrate that presenting
   observational results in a regression model, rather than as a simple
   comparison of means, makes causal interpretation of the results more
   likely. Our experiment drew on a sample of 235 university students from
   three different social science degree programs (political science,
   sociology and economics), all of whom had received substantial training
   in statistics. The subjects were asked to compare and evaluate the
   validity of equivalent results presented as either regression models or
   as a t-test of two sample means. Our experiment shows that the subjects
   who were presented with results as estimates from a regression model
   were more inclined to interpret these results causally. Our experiment
   implies that scholars using regression models should note carefully both
   their models' identifying assumptions and which causal attributions can
   safely be concluded from their analysis.},

Abstract = {Switzerland is a prime example of a starkly decentralized federation.
   Apart from its decentralized structure, direct democracy and
   consociational governance are the defining features of the Swiss
   political system. Within that broader institutional context, we evaluate
   the three hypotheses of this special issue by discussing empirical
   research covering various policy areas. In line with the theoretical
   expectations, our findings support the notion that multilateral
   coordination dominates inter-cantonal relations and that the Swiss
   federal system is based on the principle of symmetric vertical
   competence allocation. However, our analysis does not confirm the third
   expectation of the theoretical framework, namely that in Switzerland
   inter-governmental cooperation is driven by partisan connections among
   ministers. Instead, we argue that the power-sharing mechanism of
   consociational democracy limits partisan dynamics and shifts the focus
   from intra- to inter-party coordination.},

Abstract = {In this article is discussed the concept of gender stereotypes and its
   crucial importance in discrimination toward women and leadership
   positions. The role of mass media, specifically of television, in the
   construction of female social stereotypes and their influence in the
   dominant social perception is analyzed. Two issues that women face in
   leadership situations are considered: trustworthiness and the so called
   ``glass cliff{''} problems. The tactic of reframing political
   communication, is proposed as a way to expose gender stereotypes and
   contribute to the process of social change.},

Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Pages = {341-361},

Abstract = {Over the past few decades, scholars have reassessed the role of
   amour-propre in Rousseau's thought. While it was once believed that he
   had an entirely negative valuation of the emotion, it is now widely held
   that he finds it useful and employs it to strengthen moral attachments,
   conjugal love, civic virtue and moral heroism. At the same time,
   scholars are divided as to whether this positive amour-propre is an
   antidote to the negative or dangerous form. Some scholars are confident
   that `inflamed' amour-propre can be overcome while others adopt a more
   fatalistic view. While mindful of Rousseau's pessimism in his most
   famous works, this essay seeks to identify a middle position. By
   contending Rousseau's discussion of amour-propre is largely concerned
   with the problems surrounding identity construction in commercial, urban
   societies, it will be argued that amour-propre can be lessened to
   manageable levels in more rural societies, that is, agrarian provincial
   life.},

Abstract = {The institutional design of Italy today presents structural elements of
   a federal state, while its political system and culture remain
   centralized. However, the collapse of the party system and rise of the
   Northern League in the 1990s generated a series of decentralizing
   reforms, contradictory in nature and approved primarily for electoral
   advantage or coalitional maintenance. Formal inter-governmental
   relations between the centre and regions are weak, making party politics
   the crucial mechanism for relaying territorial demands between levels of
   government. Party organizations are themselves weak, unable to control
   their elected elites at sub-national levels. This asymmetrical and
   rather dysfunctional system of territorial organization requires
   extensive mediation by the Constitutional Court, whose case law in this
   area has grown enormously since the extensive Constitutional reform of
   2001.},

Title = {Transposition and National-Level Resources: Introducing the Cross-Border
   Healthcare Directive in Eastern Europe},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},
Pages = {693-710},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The Cross-Border Patients' Rights Directive represents an attempt to
   resolve the unclear situation that had developed due to `negative
   integration' within the field of healthcare. While the adoption of the
   directive ends the EU-level decision process, it represents the start of
   the implementation process, where national institutional structures and
   interests play a key role. This article investigates the role of
   resources as a key factor shaping transposition within the member
   states, with a focus on Poland and Bulgaria. The article shows that a
   multidimensional perspective of resources is important for understanding
   transposition of EU directives in member states. While previous research
   has tended to consider resources at the aggregate, national level, the
   present study shows that specific concerns about the `adjustment costs'
   at the sector system level are of key importance.},

Volume = {13},

Pages = {79-90},

Abstract = {In his article, the author argues that city branding is a kind of life
   buoy for some local authorities and governments to attract investors and
   tourists. It is overused, misused, and makes many people think of
   superficial marketing tricks. In most cases, attractive logos, similar
   taglines on empty promises, and fat budgets on advertising are used for
   branding, yielding nothing in return. He points out that governments
   should help the world understand the real, complex, rich, diverse nature
   of their people and landscapes, their history and heritage, and their
   products and resources. The author emphasizes that more engagement, not
   simply communication, with the rest of the world can raise the profile
   of cities. By drawing conclusions from Saffron Brand Consultants'
   ``global city brand barometer{''} report, he points to the correlation
   between two aspects of a city's brand: its ``assets{''} and its
   ``buzz.{''}},

   high percentage of women appointed to ministerial positions but also
   with a higher rate of appointments to prestigious posts.},

   to representing half of the population) pose a particular challenge to
   conventional principles of collective decision-making, and commonly
   threaten political stability. This article analyses the experience of
   two such societies - Northern Ireland and Fiji - with a view to
   exploring whether there are common processes in the route by which
   political stability has been pursued. We assess the manner in which a
   distinctive relationship with Great Britain and its political culture
   has interacted with local conditions to produce a highly competitive,
   bipolar party system. This leads to consideration of the devices that
   have been adopted in an effort to bridge the gap between the
   communities: the Fiji constitution as amended in 1997, and Northern
   Ireland's Good Friday Agreement of 1998. We focus, in particular, on the
   use of unusual (preferential voting) formulas for the election of
   parliamentarians and of an inclusive principle in the selection of
   ministers, and consider the contribution of these institutional devices
   to the attainment of political stability. We find that, in both cases,
   the intervention of forces from outside the political system had a
   decisive impact, though in very different ways. In addition to being
   underpinned by solid institutional design, for political settlements to
   work effectively, some minimal level of trust between rival elites is
   required.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the literature on procedural models of European
   Union politics. We present an overview of the main models of the
   legislative procedures, with a focus on their relevance to European
   Union politics and the literature today. We discuss early controversies
   in the literature and examine the empirical research that tested the
   models. Furthermore, we consider models of other aspects of
   policy-making in the European Union. Finally, we discuss the
   literature's main contributions and principal shortcomings and formulate
   suggestions for improvement. We argue that the models contribute greatly
   to our understanding of European Union politics, offer clear predictions
   regarding policies, institutions' powers, and the extent of gridlock and
   have sparked extensive empirical research. The models of consultation
   and codecision can serve as standard models of unicameral legislatures
   with an agenda setter and bicameral legislatures with bargaining between
   the two chambers, respectively. Moreover, they contribute to the study
   of the implications of institutional reform.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the influence of the politics of presence in
   the most recent parliamentary and European elections in the United
   Kingdom by examining the question of politician mobility. It establishes
   the patterns of regional relationships between the constituencies served
   by elected representatives and their place of birth, and takes into
   account age, gender and political party. It includes the issues of seat
   marginality and `career politicians'. Analytical techniques include the
   Nomogramma di Gandy and multiple correspondence analysis. The UK
   regions, outside London, which have the highest number of Members of
   Parliament (MPs) and Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) born per
   head of population are also the ones that have the least politician
   mobility. The south-east of England, and in particular London, have the
   greatest mobility. In general the patterns for MPs and MEPs are fairly
   similar, except in respect of age. Females were more likely to cross
   more than one regional boundary than males, particularly for
   Conservative MPs, and there was a higher differential in this regard for
   MEPs compared to MPs. It was concluded that while there is considerable
   politician mobility for both MPs and MEPs, the vast majority represent
   constituencies within their region of birth, or an adjacent region.},

   research that investigates the way in which various representations of

   negotiated and transformed through interaction, with a focus on the
   impact of international mobility on political science canon-building.
   Through a case study on Romania and mostly discourse analysis tools, it
   examines in particular the competing discourses on (1) what is
   considered prestigious and scientifically desirable for a national

   tradition should be about in relation with the rest of the scholarly

Abstract = {This article is an engagement with the effects of speed in global
   politics through the lens of what it terms ``Brown's Paradox,{''} Wendy
   Brown's insight that, in a radically accelerating world we ``feel a
   greater political impotence than humans may have felt before, even as we
   occupy a global order more saturated by human power than ever
   before.{''} It begins by discussing the two dominant responses to
   Brown's Paradox: the first, the neoliberal embrace and valorization of
   the uncertainty of an accelerating world, and the second, the
   reactionary attempt to aggressively (re) secure the foundations of
   politics and society (in this latter discussion, the article engages
   with the specific case study of the treatment of Tamil refugees in
   Canada). The discussion of this latter approach will lead us to the
   central concept of this article, the idea of a ressentiment against
   speed. The article will discuss how this ressentiment inhibits our
   ability to productively respond to the challenges of an accelerating
   world, while at the same time frequently authorizing policies of
   violence, marginalization, and exploitation against those constituencies
   which are already most subject to the conditions of accelerating
   globalization. Conversely, this understanding of ressentiment against
   speed will be used to point the way to a politics which, while not
   resolving the contradiction inherent in Brown's Paradox, might teach us
   to live with it-and within it-in a productive and ethical manner.},

Abstract = {Political leadership has more recently powerfully reclaimed a prominent
   status in international political research. This field is widely
   considered to mark an exemplary case of agency-focused research, whose
   relevance is questioned in particular by many scholars from the
   discipline of comparative government with its established focus on
   comparing structures, rather individuals, across countries. In contrast
   to personality-focused contributions to leadership analysis,
   institutionalist approaches conceive of leadership as `structure
   dagency'. While not denying the importance of individual leaders, their
   main focus is on identifying more general patterns of leadership across
   countries. The recent innovations in the theory of political
   institutions provide fascinating new material for thinking about
   leadership and institutions that reach well beyond the established
   agendas of institutionalist leadership research and should leave their
   mark on future studies in comparative political leadership.},

Abstract = {Neopatrimonialism has emerged as the central conceptual label applied by
   scholars to understand the politics of the Central Asian republics. Like
   the use of neopatrimonialism in other regional settings, this article
   argues that the concept has become susceptible to concept misinformation
   and stretching. Adopting a critical perspective, this article highlights
   three significant problems with the application of neopatrimonialism in
   the study of Central Asian politics: its appropriateness and
   operationalisation; the difficulty in ontologically and empirically
   untangling the formal and informal; and an inherent normativty in its
   application. While not advocating an abandonment of the concept, the
   article considers instead how it can be used better in conjunction with
   additional analytical approaches and/or concepts. The article proffers
   that a focus on either formal-institutional structures; discourses of
   power; and the concept of `multiple modernities' would aid comprehension
   of the region and resolve the three issues highlighted in this work.},

Abstract = {Do judges defer to executives with increased institutional control over
   the executive branch? Administrative agencies play a key role in the
   policy implementation process. Executives could view aggressive judicial
   review of executive branch activity as a threat to executive power and
   negatively respond to perceived judicial intrusions. Governors across
   the country possess varying amounts of institutional authority over the
   agencies that comprise their states' executive branches. For example, in
   many states, executive branch officials are elected by the public or
   appointed by someone other than the governor. Increased fragmentation
   increases the difficulty of centralized management and decreases
   gubernatorial influence over the executive branch. I examine whether
   state supreme courts defer more to agencies in states where governors
   have more formal control over the executive branch. I find that state
   supreme courts are more likely to rule in favor of state administrative
   agencies in states where the governor has increased appointment power
   and increased power to review agency rulemaking.},

Abstract = {Between 2002 and 2008 there was a revision of the Master Plan of
   Fortaleza. The Juraci Magalhaes management produced a plan that was
   never voted, contested by agents who criticized the lack of
   democratization and popular participation. The management Luizianne Lins
   restarted the review, generating a plan approved by consensus. This
   article analyzes the institutional design, the formation of decisions
   and potential democratic character of these experiences. The methodology
   involved analysis of documents and videos, direct observation and
   conducting semi-structured interviews. It is estimated that there were
   important democratic innovations. However, the innovations non-impacted
   the institutional structures, making it insufficient to permanently
   change the correlations of strength, the rules and social behaviors in
   urban planning in the city.},

Abstract = {With the renaissance of political realism has come an insistence that
   the study of politics be historically located. While many political
   realists trace their conception of historical inquiry to Thucydides,
   this article shows how Herodotus can offer a more realist approach to
   political phenomena. Herodotus crafts a self-conscious form of
   historical inquiry that foregrounds the actual activity of the historian
   as intersubjective, reflective, and particular. Herodotus thus models a
   historical investigation that shows its own limits while demanding the
   evaluation of its readers, offering a way to address criticisms of
   political realism's singular and unacknowledged historical narratives.
   Moreover, Herodotus's Histories exemplify a disposition toward open
   inquiry among others-what Herodotus calls wonder-that can invigorate
   responsive curiosity as part of the project of historical understanding
   essential to both political realism and contemporary democracies.},

Volume = {108},

Abstract = {Building a strong autocratic state requires stability in ruler-elite
   relations. From this perspective the absence of a successor is
   problematic, as the elite have few incentives to remain loyal if the
   autocrat cannot reward them for their loyalty after his death. However,
   an appointed successor has both the capacity and the motive to challenge
   the autocrat. We argue that a succession based on primogeniture solves
   the dilemma, by providing the regime with a successor who can afford to
   wait to inherit the throne peacefully. We test our hypothesis on a
   dataset covering 961 monarchs ruling 42 European states between 1000 and
   1800, and show that fewer monarchs were deposed in states practicing
   primogeniture than in states practicing alternative succession orders. A
   similar pattern persists in the world's remaining absolute monarchies.
   Primogeniture also contributed to building strong states: In 1801 all
   European monarchies had adopted primogeniture or succumbed to foreign
   enemies.},

Abstract = {While lending for small businesses and business start-up is a
   long-standing feature of economic policy in the UK and Scotland, little
   is known about the support available for those taking the first steps
   into self-employment, particularly people from poorer communities.
   This paper presents the results of a project that aimed to address this
   gap. It mapped provision of support for enterprise, including
   microcredit (small loans for enterprise of (sic)5,000 or less) and
   grants available to people in deprived communities. It found more
   programmes offering grants than loans. Grants programmes, although more
   likely to be time limited and often linkedto European funding, were
   generally better targeted to poor communities than loan programmes that
   were more financially sustainable.
   The introduction of the Grameen Bank to Scotland will increase access to
   microcredit, but this paper argues that there is a place - and a need -
   for both loans and grants to support enterprise development across
   Scotland. A Scottish economic strategy should take account of all levels
   of enterprise development and, in striving towards a fairer Scotland,
   should ensure that the poorest people and communities are not excluded
   from self-employment because of the lack of small amounts of support
   necessary to take the first steps.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Abstract = {This article differentiates between three ways in which electoral cycles
   may impact on participation in elections. First, it identifies a
   simultaneity effect - turnout increases to the extent that elections are
   held on the same date. A second effect is voter fatigue - turnout
   declines when another election has just been held before. Poll voting is
   a third effect. It suggests that turnout increases when another election
   is to be held shortly after. On the basis of a novel dataset that
   includes 2,915 regional elections held in 317 regions and 18 countries
   from 1945 to 2009, evidence is found for all three effects. The results
   point towards a basic dilemma in multilevel electoral systems: increase
   turnout by holding elections on the same date but accept high vote
   congruence across elections or decouple election cycles, which decreases
   vote congruence but lowers participation rates.},

Abstract = {This study addresses the dynamics of the issue space in multiparty
   systems by examining to what extent, and under what conditions, parties
   respond to the issue ownership of other parties on the green issue. To
   understand why some issues become part and parcel of the political
   agenda in multiparty systems, it is crucial not only to examine the
   strategies of issue entrepreneurs, but also the responses of other
   parties. It is argued that the extent to which other parties respond to,
   rather than ignore, the issue mobilisation of green parties depends on
   two factors: how much of an electoral threat the green party poses to a
   specific party; and the extent to which the political and economic
   context makes the green issue a potential vote winner. To analyse the
   evolution of the green issue, a time-series cross-section analysis is
   conducted using data from the Comparative Manifestos Project for 19 West
   European countries from 1980-2010. The findings have important
   implications for understanding issue evolution in multiparty systems and
   how and why the dynamics of party competition on the green issue vary
   across time and space.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {501-518},
Month = {APR 16},
Abstract = {Consociationalism is often proposed for societies deeply divided along
   ethnic lines, yet its recommendation remains contentious. Critics argue
   that it has a low rate of adoption, results in political immobilism, and
   entrenches the divisions it seeks to alleviate. Overlooked in much of
   the criticism, however, is the distinction between liberal and corporate
   forms of consociationalism, alternatively premised on the
   self-determination or predetermination of the ethnic groups involved in
   power-sharing. The article considers whether the critiques apply equally
   to both versions. Corporate consociation freezes a particular
   inter-group configuration in time, leading to drawn-out executive
   formation and, in some cases, to a cementing of divisions. However,
   liberal consociation runs into its own difficulties: consociational
   settlements are generally negotiated at the very point at which group
   identities are most politically salient and divisive. Under these
   conditions, groups are unlikely to settle for anything other than a
   guarantee of their share in power, thus making liberal consociationalism
   less likely to be adopted in negotiated settlements. The article also
   considers the factors enhancing the adoption of liberal consociational
   rules.},

Abstract = {This article provides a comparative analysis of the opening sessions of
   Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) for the last five Prime Ministers in
   order to test a general perception that PMQs has become increasingly a
   focal point for shallow political point scoring rather than serious
   prime ministerial scrutiny. Our data appear to confirm that PMQs has
   become both rowdier and increasingly dominated by the main party
   leaders. It also indicates that Prime Ministers are increasingly
   expected to be able to respond to a wider range of questions, female MPs
   are as likely to ask helpful questions but less likely to ask
   unanswerable questions than male counterparts, and MPs are less likely
   to ask helpful questions and more likely to ask unanswerable questions
   the longer their parliamentary tenure. More surprisingly perhaps, our
   findings also suggest that, at the beginning of their premierships at
   least, Thatcher and Brown appear the most accomplished in terms of the
   fullness of their answers, and Blair and Cameron the least accomplished.},

Abstract = {Studies of French voting behavior have pioneered the inclusion of
   patrimony in explanations of vote choice in presidential elections.
   Patrimony, as measured by the number of assets that an individual owns,
   has been found to matter to vote choice in recent French presidential
   elections. Can we say that its influence has continued with the latest
   2012 presidential election, which took place in the context of the
   European economic crisis? We explore this question using TNS Sofres
   survey data. We find that patrimony continued to matter in 2012, that it
   clearly distinguished supporters of Nicolas Sarkozy from those of
   Francois Hollande, and that its effect on second-round vote choice was
   distinct from that of other socioeconomic determinants. These findings
   provide further support for the idea that capital income needs to be
   taken into account when assessing the relationship between individual
   wealth and voting behavior.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The study of a country's arms sales opens up pathways for investigating
   its domestic and foreign policies. Arms sales are also a phenomenon that
   is greatly affected by globalization. This is certainly the case for
   Russia, especially as regards its arms sales to Asia. This article
   analyzes Russian arms sales to Asia and finds that despite Moscow's
   professed optimism that it can continue to maintain a competitive edge
   and its standing as a key Asian military power, there are many reasons
   for serious concern. These concerns relate to the quality of Russian
   weapons, to the domestic struggle for resources within a thoroughly
   corrupt defense industrial sector, and to external forces such as
   Chinese and South Korean producers who now compete with Russia in the
   global and Asian arms markets. Such trends may lead not only to a
   decline in Russia's overall standing and capabilities in Asia, but also
   to a transformation of Asia's strategic landscape.},

Abstract = {Cyber-threats are one of the most significant problems faced by modern
   Industrial Control Systems (ICS), such as SCADA (Supervisory Control and
   Data Acquisition) systems, as the vulnerabilities of ICS technology
   become serious threats that can ultimately compromise human lives. This
   situation demands a domainspecific approach to cyber threat detection
   within ICS, which is one of the most important contributions of the
   CockpitCI FP7 project (http://CockpitCI.eu). Specifically, this paper
   will present the CockpitCI distributed Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
   for ICS, which provides its core cyber-detection and analysis
   capabilities, also including a description of its components, in terms
   of role, operation, integration, and remote management. Moreover, it
   will also introduce and describe new domain-specific solutions for ICS
   security such as the SCADA Honeypot and the Shadow Security Unit, which
   are part of the CockcpitCI IDS framework.},

   a detailed understanding of the history of IR discipline by combining
   the conceptual and contextual approach, positioning articles within
   three major theoretical debates, categorizing them thematically and then
   placing them within an academic environment. Analyzed articles represent
   the foundation of the IR discipline, hence its history portrays the way
   in which, in SFRY in general, and in Croatia in particular, it attempted
   to create its own identity. Finally, this analysis provides key insights
   related to the context, theoretical framework, discourse and concept
   development of IR in Croatia.},

Abstract = {Ahead of the 2014 local elections, the main opposition, the Republican
   People's Party (CHP), developed an aggressive outreach campaign to add
   new voters to its ranks as the disappearance of its former rivals, the
   Democratic Left Party (DSP), left the CHP with a monopoly over the Left
   and the Gulen Movement broke with the ruling AK Party just months before
   the elections. The election results, however, reaffirmed that the main
   opposition party remained largely unpopular outside major metropolitan
   areas, including Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir. On election day, the CHP
   received less than 5 percent in most of the Southeast and Eastern
   Anatolia, as its efforts to associate with democracy and freedom proved
   futile against the backdrop of controversial alliances with
   extra-parliamentary forces.},

Title = {Boomerangs to Partnerships? Explaining State Participation in
   Transnational Partnerships for Sustainability},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {47},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {481-515},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article examines under what conditions states engage in
   transnational public-private partnerships for the environment. While
   there is hardly a disagreement in the literature on the rise of
   transnational actors and new modes of collaborative governance, their
   interaction with and impact on state institutions remain debated and
   insufficiently illuminated by empirical research. Some scholars of
   globalization interpret transnational partnerships as evidence of state
   insufficiency and retreat, others emphasize the continued primacy of
   state power in manipulating old and new institutional arenas, still
   other scholars anticipate the ``rearticulation{''} of the state to
   partake in new governance. This study is one of the first to examine
   theoretically and empirically, using a sample of some 230 partnerships,
   how domestic capacity, the constituencies of transnational actors, as
   well as international donors and institutions shape the variable
   rearticulation of the state to partake in partnerships. A comparative
   case study of Brazil and Russia provides further detail on the political
   dynamics that enable or constrain state-society collaborations for the
   environment.},

   longer timespan than any analysis to datewe evaluate the leading claims
   about growing polarization along authoritarian/nonauthoritarian lines
   and the reasons for that growth. We find authoritarianism's impact has
   grown for partisanship and voting but has been consistent for policy
   attitudesusually present for social and defense issues, but less so for
   social welfare and foreign policy. This suggests that authoritarianism's
   importance is related to strategic politicians advancing issues that
   touch on the authoritarian/nonauthoritarian divide, and varies across
   election years.},

Title = {Making wasted votes count: Turnout, transfers, and preferential voting
   in practice},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {33},
Pages = {144-152},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Proponents of electoral reform champion the single transferable vote
   (STV) or aligned forms of preferential voting (AV, IRV, RCV) as a method
   to improve participation among and representation of the general public.
   Voters provide an ordinal ranking among alternatives on the ballot, and
   ballots not used to elect a candidate are transferred to another favored
   alternative. Preferential voting is intended to encourage both citizen
   participation in an election and sincere voting. Yet the empirical
   evidence about the effects of preferential voting in the scholarly
   literature is scant. Elections of members to the Dail Eireann, the lower
   house of national parliament in Ireland, provide a wealth of data on
   preferential voting. Data from four recent Irish elections (1997, 2002,
   2007, and 2011) are analyzed to assess the effectiveness of STV on
   reducing wasted votes. The number of nontransferable ballots, votes not
   used for any candidate, is large and increases as the need for lower
   level preferences (that is, later counts or rounds) grows. Voter turnout
   does not correspond to preferential voting in predictable ways; turnout
   declines as the number of candidates elected increases. Although
   preferential voting systems have much to offer, their effects need to be
   evaluated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {16},

Pages = {111-128},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {The context of and the meaning conferred upon the local elections led it
   to be fought in a referandum-like atmosphere. Prior to the March 30
   local elections, various scenarios put forward both for the governing AK
   Party and the opposition parties, which largely remained unfulfilled on
   the elections day. As the local elections is over, a sound analysis of
   the election's context, results, and possible implications is warranted.
   Despite the rapid and dramatic transformation that Turkey has undergone
   over the last decade, particularly since 2007, no such dramatic shift in
   the voters' behaviors has occurred. This article argues that this is
   because of the dominance of the identity-politics, over all other
   issues, that shaped the content and context of the elections. It further
   claims insofar as this dominance continues to prevail over other
   concerns in the elections, no major change should be expected in the
   voters' inclinations and behaviors.},

Abstract = {Following Richard Neustadt, scholarship on the presidency tends to focus
   on presidents as single-minded seekers of political power. But,
   precisely because of the grandness of their political stage, presidents
   may, in fact, have constitutional ambitions concerning not how much
   power they will have but how they will wield their constitutional
   powers. James Madison's presidency provides an important case study of a
   president's constitutional ambitions. Entering office with
   constitutional concerns about the power of the presidency relative to
   the other branches, Madison used his own presidency and especially the
   War of 1812 to model a new type of constitutional office that he thought
   would fit better in the system of the separation of powers.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we estimate the effect of the legal threshold on the
   number of parties and decompose it into a mechanical and a psychological
   effect. We study the case of Morocco, whose local elections afford a
   rare opportunity to uncover the causal effect of the legal threshold,
   using a differences-in-differences approach. Our results show a large
   effect of the legal threshold on the number of parties. We find a large
   psychological effect in absolute terms: a 3\% increase in the legal
   threshold leaves almost one effective party out of the council for
   purely strategic reasons. We conjecture that this large effect is due to
   the lack of institutionalization and programmaticness of most Moroccan
   parties. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Employing a two-level game framework, this study examines the
   decision-making process of the Hatoyama government on the replacement of
   the US Marine air base in Futenma, Okinawa. Before reaching the final
   decision to revert to the existing plan of relocating it to Nago City,
   the cabinet members explored different possible alternatives. Prime
   Minister Hatoyama simultaneously pursued different international and
   domestic goals. Misperception and miscommunication between Tokyo and
   Washington were at play. A two-level game framework provides a clear
   picture of what Hatoyama tried to pursue and why he failed.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {33},
Pages = {41-51},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Voters that come of age at roughly the same time share common influences
   because of the specific political context during their formative years.
   We can therefore assume the errors in a model explaining their political
   behavior to be dependent. Recent advances in social statistical analysis
   of age-period-cohort (APC) effects propose the use of hierarchical
   modeling in combination with repeated cross-sectional survey design to
   solve this problem. We apply these random-intercept models to assess the
   impact of the political context on the development of generational
   turnout patterns, assuming that cohorts that grew up in a
   highly-politicized context have a higher propensity to turnout to vote
   despite of any age or period effects. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Does the Ideological Dispersion of Parties Mediate the Electoral Impact
   of Valence? A Cross-National Study of Party Support in Nine Western
   European Democracies},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {47},

Abstract = {Previous empirical research has found evidence suggesting that the
   character-based valence attributes of parties, such as competence and
   integrity, can have notable effects of levels of electoral support
   (Clark, 2009; Mondak, 1995). A related strand of literature analyzes the
   importance of parties' policy positions. In this study, we bring
   together research on valence and party dispersion to examine whether the
   ideological dispersion of parties in a party system mediates the
   electoral impact of valence. We perform empirical analyses covering nine
   Western European countries over the period 1976 to 2003, and test the
   hypothesis that when parties are more ideologically proximate to the
   mean voter position, character-based valence attributes will be of
   greater significance in determining parties' electoral fortunes.
   Surprisingly, we find no support for this hypothesis. Instead, our
   analyses suggest that the more ideologically dispersed parties are, the
   more likely it is that character-based valence attributes will affect
   parties' vote shares.},

Abstract = {State sponsorship has played a significant facilitating role in
   terrorist violence. The scope and impact of state support has not,
   however, remained fixed; nor has its threat potential. This article
   identifies and depicts three distinct phases of state sponsorship: the
   peak (1970s-80s), intermediate (1990-2001), and low (2001-present)
   phases. The causal factors behind the steady pattern of decline in the
   number of states sponsoring terrorism and the intensity of support
   provided to terrorist clients are analyzed here. Despite this clear
   contraction, state sponsorship continues to merit close attention as the
   salience of state-sponsored terrorism relates not only to the number of
   sponsors and level of support, but also to the threat potential of the
   support sponsors can provide. Therefore, paradoxically, at a time when
   the number of state sponsors is at its nadir, the threat potential of
   terrorism is at its apex, as the proliferation of nuclear technology to
   terrorist sponsors has significantly elevated the potential consequences
   of state sponsorship.},

Abstract = {This article is a meta-critique, from an Althusserian and Poulantzasian
   perspective, of critical accounts of the British state. It is based on a
   `symptomatic reading' of key texts written by Andrew Gamble, Colin Hay
   and Chris Howell, which demonstrates that they misconstrue the dynamics
   of capitalism and the effects of state interventions and class conflict.
   Against this backdrop, the article outlines an approach to state
   analysis based on the concept of `capitalist class domination', which
   avoids the tendency of both critical political science and comparative
   capitalisms scholarship to substitute the study of specific aspects of
   capitalism for the analysis of capitalism as a structured whole.},

Abstract = {To what extent does state intervention in the market condition how
   individuals subjectively experience the lives that they lead? Prevailing
   attempts to understand the relationship between state intervention and
   subjective well-being have yielded mixed empirical results. However,
   these differences result from omitted variable biases, not different
   methodological choices. Drawing on insights from the new social risk and
   quality of governance literatures, this article contends that the policy
   orientation and administrative quality of welfare state programs jointly
   condition the effect of state intervention on life satisfaction. State
   intervention exerts a strong positive effect on perceived satisfaction
   with life when the quality of administrative institutions is high and
   policy interventions focus on insuring individuals against newer,
   post-industrial forms of market risk. This main hypothesis is tested and
   confirmed against an empirical analysis of survey data taken from Wave 5
   of the World Values Survey.},

Abstract = {Chronic communal conflicts often embody prisoner's dilemmas. Both
   communities prefer peace to war. Yet neither trusts the other, viewing
   the other's gain as its loss, so potentially shared interests often go
   unrealized. Achieving positive-sum outcomes from apparently zero-sum
   struggles requires a particular kind of risk-embracing leadership. To
   succeed leaders must (a) see power relations as potentially
   positive-sum, (b) strengthen negotiating adversaries when tempted to
   weaken them, and (c) demonstrate hope for a positive future and take
   great personal risks to achieve it. Such leadership is exemplified by
   Nelson Mandela and F. W. de Klerk in the South African democratic
   transition. To illuminate the strategic dilemmas Mandela and de Klerk
   faced, we examine the work of Robert Axelrod, Thomas Schelling, and
   Josep Colomer, who highlight important dimensions of the problem but
   underplay the role of risk-embracing leadership. Finally we discuss
   leadership successes and failures in the Northern Ireland settlement and
   the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.},

Abstract = {Although the actual constitutional preferences of the Scottish public
   have been analysed at great length, the assessments of how different
   constitutional scenarios will perform in future have received little
   attention. This paper aims to address this by examining how well the
   public think an independent and a devolution max (DevoMax) Scotland will
   perform, looking specifically at the role of national identity and party
   affiliation. Factor analysis is used to construct a latent `performance
   assessment' variable, and this latent variable is used extensively in
   the analysis. The paper finds that, on the whole, there is little
   difference between performance assessments of independence and DevoMax.
   However when considering national identity it can be seen that although
   Scottish identifiers by and large assess independence and DevoMax
   equally, strong British identifiers do not; they are considerably less
   negative about DevoMax. Furthermore, although the patterns of
   performance assessment are unsurprising in terms of party affiliation,
   Labour affiliates are, on the whole, more positive about the future
   performance of an independent Scotland than might have been expected.
   Furthermore, linear regression shows that the `identity' variables have
   a more powerful effect on perceptions of independence than DevoMax.
   These findings suggest that an element of `heuristic shortcutting' might
   be taking place.},

Abstract = {Statelessness as a legal and political problem has attracted increasing
   attention from scholars and international advocacy organisations in
   recent years. This attention has predominantly focussed on the legal
   aspects of statelessness, and has generally held the acquisition of
   citizenship documentation as the primary goal in remedying citizenship
   deprivation. This article explores the merits of this focus through a
   case study of the Nubians of Kenya, widely considered stateless until
   recently. The article connects the focus on citizenship as documented
   status to a liberal conception of citizenship. The article identifies
   the ways in which this approach is helpful, that is, as a means of
   pursuing legal status and possession of individual rights. It then goes
   on to identify more important ways in which a liberal conception of
   citizenship falls short of accounting for the Nubians' citizenship
   problems by neglecting the more collective dimensions of citizenship
   practice and recognition.},

Abstract = {A wide range of studies find that democracies experience more terrorism
   than non-democracies. However, surprisingly little terrorism research
   takes into account the variation among democracies in terms of their
   electoral institutions. Furthermore, despite much discussion of the
   differences in terrorist groups' goals in the literature, little
   quantitative work distinguishes among groups with different goals, and
   none explores whether and how the influence of electoral institutions
   varies among groups with different goals. The argument in this article
   posits that electoral institutions influence the emergence of
   within-system groups, which seek policy changes, but do not influence
   the emergence of anti-system groups, which seek a complete overthrow of
   the existing regime and government. The study finds that within-system
   groups are significantly less likely to emerge in democracies that have
   a proportional representation system and higher levels of district
   magnitude, while neither of these factors affects the emergence of
   anti-system groups.},

Title = {Democracy promotion between the ``political{''} and the

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {21},

Abstract = {Following the end of the East-West conflict, the global spread of
   liberal democracy became an important strategic objective in world
   politics. Primarily, the foreign policy of the US and EU (states)
   demonstrated the relevance of democracy promotion abroad. While Western
   democracies' policy objectives regarding democracy promotion go well
   together, an obvious difference between their approaches in this area
   has often been shown: a largely ``political{''} approach of the US vs a
   ``developmental{''} one of European states. Accordingly, this article
   focuses on recent tendencies in democracy promotion by comparing US and
   German policies in the European post-Soviet space in order to
   investigate the expression of both approaches in a strategically
   important region. It thereby analyses the pivotal case of Belarus, which
   presents a great challenge to democracy promoters. The study concludes
   that external democracy promotion in that part of the world does not
   show a clear differentiation between the two approaches, and suggests a
   few potential explanations to be explored in future research.},

Title = {Self-Regulation in Private and Public Politics},
Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {231-267},
Abstract = {This paper presents a theory of self-regulation by a firm or an industry
   acting collectively in the context of private and public politics. In
   private politics an activist identifies a social issue, makes a demand
   on the firm, and threatens a harmful campaign. The firm self-regulates
   to forestall the campaign or reduce the campaign intensity.
   Self-regulation is decreasing in the campaign cost and the residual harm
   to the firm of conceding to a campaign. The activist moderates its
   demand to increase the forestalling self-regulation, which can lead the
   firm to incur a campaign. The public politics threat is that a
   legislature imposes more stringent regulation on the firm. The firm
   self-regulates to the boundary of the gridlock interval, which negates
   the power of an agenda-setter and forestalls public politics. Private
   politics, however, can lead the firm to self-regulate to the interior of
   the gridlock interval. The firm lobbies to reduce the cost of its
   self-regulation, and self-regulation and lobbying are substitutes. The
   activist increases the saliency of the issue to the constituents of
   pivotal legislators, which increases the cost of lobbying, causing the
   firm to self-regulate more and lobby less.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},

Volume = {10},
Number = {1, SI},

Abstract = {This article looks at current policies concerning the civic and
   political participation of youths, women, migrants, and minorities in
   the European Union. It highlights the ways in which active citizenship
   and civic engagement have become a political priority for European
   institutions. Representation of local policy actors at the supranational
   level and strategies for the inclusion of civil society provide a
   platform for evaluating the impact of Europeanization at the national
   and subnational level. The article focuses on key discourses and
   narratives associated with specific policy frames (e.g. European
   citizenship, European social policies, and the European public sphere
   (EPS)). Some of the key questions addressed by the article are: What are
   the strategies that are employed, both by the European institutions in
   Brussels and organized civil society (OCS), to enhance participation and
   reciprocal communication? What vision of governance do practices such as
   active engagement and civil dialogue represent? Drawing on current
   theories of governance, our article contributes to the debate about the
   EPS by evaluating the role of OCS in bridging the gap between European
   institutions and national polities. Equally, our focus on traditionally
   marginal groups provides a platform for assessing the
   institutionalization of the `European social dimension'.},

Abstract = {What is the `centre'? Drawing across different political science
   literature (including political theory, electoral and party-related and
   public administration), the article examines the different dimensions
   associated with it, including ideological (i.e. as moderate, liberal and
   reformist), organisational (i.e. as based on the median voter and
   catch-all party models) and policy-related (i.e. balancing the values
   and principles of Christian Democracy and social democracy). Against
   these features, the article presents the main challenges against the
   centre in these dimensions (i.e. relative differences between
   ideologies, binary accounts of social and political organisation through
   social cleavages and political party development, the time-specific
   attributes of Christian Democracy/social democracy and the rise of
   neoliberalism). The article concludes with an appeal for additional and
   more detailed analyses of the `centre' in order to gain greater insight
   into the concept.y},

Title = {Leadership Change and the Power of Domestic Audiences: A Game Theoretic
   Account of Escalation and De-escalation in Civil Conflicts},
Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {110-134},
Abstract = {While changes in leadership appear to affect the conflictual or
   cooperative character of government-dissident relations, and the study
   of leadership has been a cornerstone of social science from Weber to
   Neustadt, studies of civil conflict leave the issue of leadership
   largely unexplored. This article represents a first effort to develop a
   theory of leadership change in the unique context of violent intrastate
   politics. Specifically, with respect to civil conflict, how do changes
   in leadership affect the choices made by dissident groups and the
   governments they confront? Can changes in leadership help explain the
   often unpredicted conflictual and cooperative directions that civil
   conflicts take? Using formal modeling, this article specifies conditions
   under which leadership changes may affect the course of a civil
   conflict. Under certain conditions, changes in leadership will signal a
   desire for cooperation and prompt opposing leaders to reorient their own
   domestic audiences in order to reciprocate. This argument is empirically
   examined through case-study plausibility probes. Policy implications
   include an improved understanding of the mechanisms directing political
   dissent and dissident choices and, in so doing, pointing to means of
   resolving or preventing large-scale political violence within states.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {503-520},
Abstract = {In this paper, I critically address the role of arbitrary and contingent
   features in philosophical debates about migration. These features play a
   central role, and display the importance of `unreason' in the debate and
   the limits of rational criticism. Certain elements of political thought
   have to be taken as given, as essential starting points or indispensable
   building blocks. As such, they cannot be exposed to rational criticism.
   Political arrangements such as national borders, nation-states and
   national identities constitute these building blocks, and justify
   coercive borders in order to sustain them. If we are to subject these
   arrangements to critical examination, then we move beyond the limits of
   liberal political philosophy. I examine theorists who take this kind of
   approach to the ethics of immigration: Michael Blake, Samuel Scheffler
   and David Miller. I argue that such approaches ask us to balance
   arbitrary and contingent features of the political world against the
   non-contingent moral equality of the migrant. If we are to recognize the
   migrant as an equal reason-giver in the moral contestation of borders,
   then we are compelled to theorize beyond these limits, and to theorize
   instead about a global community of equals, a post-national world made
   up of transnational belonging.},

Abstract = {This article questions the circulation of norms and policy solutions
   through the European Union's development cooperation policy, the
   relations between the EU and its partners being less marked by
   constraints than with candidate countries. Our analysis focuses on the
   concrete aspect of this policy, by studying human rights and rule of law
   promotion through prison reform projects funded by the EU in its partner
   states, mainly from the neighbourhood. The agents must translate soft
   law into actions that will make up the project. Ultimately, the
   circulation we observe in these projects is far from obvious, but rather
   fine and dependent on interindividual relationships. As a result we
   contend that this circulation should be considered as diffusion rather
   than transfer.},

Abstract = {Given the growing emphasis on career preparation in higher education,
   career centers play important roles on today's college campuses. The
   literature has focused on the reasons students use career services, but
   it has not addressed the vital linkage between career centers and
   academic departments. Using a survey of 279 political science department
   chairs, this study explores the factors that best explain the strength
   of the relationship between political science departments and campus
   career centers. After investigating a host of characteristics, we show
   that close ties between career centers and departments are more likely
   at smaller colleges, in departments where professors advise students (
   as opposed to departments with only professional advisors), and in
   departments that incorporate career preparation into the curriculum. We
   conclude with recommendations for establishing a more collaborative
   partnership between career centers and political science departments.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {375-385},
Abstract = {The article evaluates the civic implications of studying political
   science. Previous research has argued that learning rational choice
   models of political behavior could be detrimental to civic outcomes.
   However, results from our two panel surveys of students at Swedish
   universities show the opposite: studying political science has positive
   effects on trust, and increases the importance that students ascribe to
   voting. The first panel survey shows that political science students are
   more affected by their education than are students of law and mass
   communication. The second panel survey shows that the views of political
   science students at two different educational institutions changed in a
   similar way. The results also suggest that political science students
   became more skeptical towards a participatory democratic ideal and more
   appreciative of representative democracy.},

Abstract = {By analyzing the politics of Indigenous peoples in the United States,
   Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, political scientists gain new
   perspectives on power and powerlessness. Such study offers a new vantage
   point on pathways of exclusion and regulation, as well as on the
   pathways of challenging inequity. It illustrates how beliefs and
   identity configure and reconfigure power. I highlight research from four
   domains of research on Indigenous politics: studies of political
   advocacy, political attitudes, rules of the game, and the public good.
   Political science research on Indigenous peoples fits comfortably within
   the discipline. It is flush with ideas that draw on and speak to other
   theories of politics.},

Title = {An Elephant in the Room: Bias in Evaluating a Required Quantitative
   Methods Course},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Pages = {121-135},
Abstract = {Undergraduate Political Science programs often require students to take
   a quantitative research methods course. Such courses are typically among
   the most poorly rated. This can be due, in part, to the way in which
   courses are evaluated. Students are generally asked to provide an
   overall rating, which, in turn, is widely used by students, faculty, and
   administrators to assess a course. Unfortunately, even questions
   composed with the best of intentions have the potential to bias the
   results. In this article, we evaluate the global rating question used at
   our university and show that it introduces bias into the measure by
   cuing extraneous considerations. It artificially inflates the number of
   negative reactions to the course by leading students to think about its
   required status and their initial level of enthusiasm rather than their
   level of accomplishment and its value as a learning experience. By
   locating our results in the course evaluation and framing literature, we
   suggest an approach to evaluating overall rating questions that can be
   adapted for use at other institutions.},

Abstract = {In this paper we seek to carry out a diagnosis of the links between
   India and Argentina in the context of the strategy of approach of the
   Asian country towards the Latin American region. The focus will be set
   on the political-diplomatic and trade aspects and in the challenges and
   potentialities that the emergence of this new actor can present to
   Argentina. First, it will be analyzed India's actions in Latin America;
   then the characteristics of the bilateral relations, with special
   emphasis on Argentina's foreign policy towards India; and an
   introduction to the main characteristics of trade relations, analyzing
   its implications to Argentina. We arrive to the conclusion that, two of
   Argentina's main challenges are to diversify its export offer and to set
   technological and energetic cooperation schemes.},

Abstract = {Shortly after the attacks carried out by the Al Qaeda in Madrid on March
   11, 2004 various photographers documented the facts. The photographs
   were an important part of the so-called ``spontaneous shrines{''} that
   emerged in the crime scenes. This article gives an iconographic and
   chronological view about different types of photographs: relief, injured
   in waiting rooms, the trains, offerings, mergers, demonstrations,
   authorities and monuments.
   It shows as well how the civic movement that emerged spontaneously and
   December 15 2004 speech read by an association of victims in the
   Congress of Deputies poses a challenge to the political practices
   carried out by the investigation Commission and claims a high connection
   between institutionalized political life and citizenship.},

Abstract = {In this article I critically examine the concept of the ``left{''} that
   is employed in the book The Resurgence of the Latin American Left, by
   Steven Levitsky y Kenneth Roberts. The critique can be seen as part of a
   long academic conversation concerning the meaning and implications of
   the re-emergence of a ``new left{''} in Latin America. I object to their
   definition not only as a consequence of the political and economic
   content that they associate with the idea of the ``left{''}, but also as
   a result of the programatic objectives that they relate to leftist
   governments. By the end of the text, I offer an alternative definition
   of the term, which is based on the ideals of economic and political
   democracy.},

Journal = {SECURITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {383-405},
Abstract = {The Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe
   reflected in its Decalogue the centrality of the territorial settlement
   to public order in Europe. It also reflected the hope that human rights
   would become more deeply entrenched across all States Parties to the
   Act. The intertwining of territorial provisions and human rights was not
   mere coincidence; it was at the heart of the compromise which enabled
   the parties to agree to the text as eventually adopted. The events of
   2014-in particular the forcible seizure of Ukrainian territory-raise
   questions as to the continuing vitality of the compromise that had been
   reached in 1975 and long maintained. The new foreign policy of the
   Russian Federation, embracing a potentially far-ranging irredentism,
   places the territorial idea of the Final Act under stress.
   Simultaneously, a new domestic policy rejects not only the
   enforceability of human rights at the international level but also the
   applicability of human rights obligations in the national legal order.
   The new foreign and domestic policies in Russia have emerged in tandem.
   Their relation to one another needs to be considered if their effect on
   public order is to be understood.},

Abstract = {In the article the main trends of the modern interpretation of theories
   of the origin of state arisen in social sciences on the boundary of
   XX-XXI centuries are investigated. The author pays a great attention to
   the process of overcoming of various historical myths and false
   interpretations in the beginning of XXI century accompanying long since
   the scientific theories of evolution of state in different epochs.
   Special attention is paid also to the new classifications of states
   winning recognition in the modern social science, first of all, the
   conception represented in the book of Douglass C. North, John J. Wallis
   and Barry R. Weingast ``Violence and Social Orders{''}. Critical notes
   are directed against both the postmodernist classification of
   statesmanship in the work of Martin van Creveld ``The Rise and Decline
   of the State{''} and some domestic `revisionist tendencies' in history
   and political science.},

Abstract = {Al-Qaeda's attempts to attack Western countries have often been enabled
   through the co-optation of existing jihadist organizations and their
   external support networks. This article examines this phenomenon through
   a case study of al-Qaeda's failed attempt to co-opt elements of Jemaah
   Islamiyah (JI) for an attack in Australia. The article first examines
   the emergence of JI and its Australian-based support network Mantiqi IV.
   It then analyzes al-Qaeda's unsuccessful attempt to utilize Mantiqi IV
   for an attack during the 2000 Sydney Olympics, identifying key factors
   that both enabled and hindered the plot.},

Abstract = {Addressing (the question of) a new diplomacy for the 21st century, Alan
   Henrikson reflects philosophically and historically upon a shift that
   may be occurring from the sovereign State, with ambassadors serving as
   formal representatives of entire nations, to the autonomous Self, with
   individual persons, employing social media, being able to represent
   themselves, and their group concerns, to the world. Will the Leviathan
   of Thomas Hobbes be replaced by the Facebook social graph as the pattern
   for the next world order? The traditional institutions of diplomacy-and
   professional diplomats-are being challenged, are now adapting, and are
   still vital to the making and carrying out of the international
   agreements needed if global issues are to be resolved.},

   the quality of decentralized governance is highly variable across

   has three goals: first, we critique existing academic research on the
   quality of governance in light of work on decentralized governance in
   Africa; second, we provide a conceptual map of how to theorize
   subnational variation in the quality of governance in settings
   characterized by considerable dependence on higher authorities for
   revenues; and third, we outline a series of data initiatives that offer
   the opportunity to study local and regional politics in new and exciting
   ways across the region. We conclude with great optimism about the
   prospects for innovative work on decentralized governance within
   countries across the region.},

Number = {6},
Pages = {71-82},
Abstract = {In the article analyzing profund changes that occured in the global
   economy since the second half of the 19th century, Professor Vladislav
   L. Inozemtsev argues that current economic trends decrease the
   importance of huge continental landmasses, shift the focus of
   international trade from land- to the searoutes, and thus signify the
   emergence of a complex sea-shore economy never seen in previous
   centuries. He investigates the developments in land and maritime
   transportation, the patterns of development of both oceanic and
   landlocked countries and from this point takes on the possible future of
   the post-Soviet area. Here he points out on a very different paths of
   landlocked CIS nations and those who possess direct access to the high
   seas. No one of the latter (Baltic states, Ukraine, Georgia) never
   expressed any interest in siding with Russia it its efforts to restore
   the USSR-like political structures in Eurasia, while the landlocked
   countries (Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgizia and Tajikistan) were
   among the Eurasian Union's supporters. Therefore, the author concludes,
   one may say that current Eurasian integration looks like an attempt to
   impose Russia's domination on those nations that are highly dependent on
   Moscow in economic terms. At the same time the author argues that at the
   era of seaborne economies the expansion into the biggest landlocked
   territory in the world - i.e. Mackinder's ``Heartland{''} - will not
   yield any economic benefits and will only strengthen the commodity
   nature of Russia's economy. He also suggest to rethink the importance of
   the continental ({''}New Silk Road{''}, Transsiberian, etc.) transit
   since it appears to be extremely costly and cannot assist Russia's
   economic development. The overall conclusion reads that the eastward
   direction of Russia's integration projects is unproductive and will end
   in restoring economically ineffective and politically outdated
   Soviet-like structures that may crumble as the new downside trend in
   commodity prices takes place.},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {43-61},
Abstract = {This article explores the value of scholarship on state terrorism for
   the critical study of terrorist violences. The article begins by
   identifying four primary contributions of this scholarship: first, a
   rethinking of the status and significance of terrorism; second, an
   unsettling of broader assumptions within International Relations (IR)
   and terrorism research; third, an ability to locate state violences
   within pertinent, but potentially camouflaged, contexts; and, fourth, a
   prioritisation of critique as a responsibility of scholarship. The
   article's second section then argues that the purchase of this work
   could be further extended by greater conceptual engagement with the
   state itself. In particular, we point to the value of contemporary
   approaches to the state as a terrain and outcome of social and political
   struggle, rather than as a singular actor of unitary purpose. Rethinking
   the state in this way has value, we argue, first, for moving research
   beyond the identification and typologising of state terrorisms; and,
   second, for circumventing the perennial problem of identifying
   intentionality in efforts to designate violences as (state) terrorism.},

   emphasis will be placed on the position awarded to Eurasia in their

   Russian political discourse wherein a renewed Eurasianist version has
   gained unprecedented preeminence. With the renaissance of its ideas, it
   gets proven that the return of geography and Mackinder's Heartland

Title = {Building States and Identities in Post-Conflict States: Symbolic

Journal = {CIVIL WARS},

Volume = {16},

Abstract = {An integral part of state formation processes is identity-building:
   `making one out of many' as Walzer puts it. This is also true in terms
   of contemporary, internationally led statebuilding projects. This
   dimension of international statebuilding is important, as fundamental
   questions pertaining to belonging are as important to successful
   post-conflict process as institutional arrangements; in fact,
   assumptions about identities and group boundaries guide the technical
   decisions on institutional and governance structures. The central aim of
   this paper is to reflect upon identity-construction as a part of
   post-conflict statebuilding through exploring how historical and more
   recently invented symbols are deployed to construct a specific sense of
   belonging. The analysis finds a multiplicity of identity-building
   projects that advance different visions of community and belonging. The
   outcome is politicised and contentious visual, everyday landscape that
   legitimises competing local statebuilding projects (grounded in the
   distinctions between Bosnian peoples), while undermining peacebuilding
   and reconciliation. Yet, rather than indicating a primordial antagonisms
   or incompatible `liberal' and `local' norms, the conflicts over symbols
   (and ultimately, identities) between international and local agents are
   indicative of wider disagreements over how the Bosnian state ought to be
   organised and are fuelled by the institutional structures of the country
   and the weaknesses in the international statebuilding mission.},

Abstract = {Administrations increasingly use the internet to improve citizens'
   participation in political processes. While research on online political
   communication and e-democracy is growing, we still have little empirical
   evidence on the quality of online participation and deliberation
   processes. This paper focuses on an online local deliberation process,
   the 2011 Zurich City Debate, and seeks to investigate the specific
   quality of such online public communication. By building an index of a
   quality of understanding (IQU), the authors analyse 1.991 postings that
   participants have contributed in five thematic debates on local
   political issues. Five indicators were defined: statement of reasons,
   proposals for solutions, respect, doubts, and reciprocity. The authors
   conclude that participants have respectfully voiced opinions, that in
   two fora half of the postings were reciprocal, i.e. people exchanged
   views and commented on each other: However; the data gives the
   impression of a polite and reciprocal debate, but without much
   argumentation, propositions or doubts.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship argues that how members of Congress respond to an
   ongoing war significantly influences the president's strategic
   calculations. However, the literature is comparably silent on the
   factors influencing the public positions members take during the course
   of a military venture. Accounting for both national and local electoral
   incentives, we develop a theory positing that partisanship conditions
   congressional responses to casualties in the aggregate, but that all
   members respond to casualties in their constituency by increasingly
   criticizing the war. Analyzing an original database of more than 7,500
   content-coded House floor speeches on the Iraq War, we find strong
   support for both hypotheses. We also find that Democrats from
   high-casualty constituencies were significantly more likely to cast
   antiwar roll-call votes than their peers. Finally, we show that this
   significant variation in congressional antiwar position taking strongly
   correlates with geographic differences in public support for war.},

Abstract = {The terror attacks in Norway in July 2011 led to massive popular
   mobilisation as particularly expressed in thousands of memory messages
   displayed at spontaneous memorial sites. This article is based on a
   review and analysis of all messages, collected in Oslo and in the area
   around Utoya Island, using the concepts `critical event', `national
   identity dynamic', `depoliticisation' and `domestic alien'. Results show
   that the predominant theme in the messages of peace and compassion is
   partly made possible by subordinate themes of depoliticisation and of
   alienating the perpetrator from majority, national community, thus
   contributing to the ongoing construction of a Norwegian, national
   identity.},

Abstract = {American higher education is a highly developed system marked by
   flexibility and comprehensiveness. Although there is a great deal worth
   learning from the American university system, China should also
   recognize clearly the essence of American universities, and the function
   they perform. Only in this way can China chart a correct course for the
   reform of university education. American universities are a key part of
   the national ideological apparatus, allowing important sectors of the
   bourgeoisie to exercise cultural leadership. The governance structure
   and mechanisms of American universities aid it in effectively performing
   a range of hidden functions. The American university is also a vital
   institution permitting financial monopoly capital to implement its
   strategies of cultural imperialism and cultural hegemony.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRANSFORMATION STUDIES},

Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Pages = {47-59},
Abstract = {European countries which have nuclear power plants use various tools for
   information distribution, communication and involvement of stakeholders
   in nuclear projects. This diversity is connected with many factors,
   among which are: the democratisation level of the state, social
   expectations about the commitment level, energy culture, political
   culture, the experience of the countries in nuclear projects
   implementation or stakeholder involvement and decision-making phase.
   France is a good example of the country which has applied an extensive
   system of informing the society about nuclear energy. The French system
   with its High Committee for Transparency and Information on Nuclear
   Safety (HCTISN) and the institution of public debates is considered
   comprehensive in this regard.
   This article attempts to present the French model of social
   communication in nuclear energy. It presents institutions operating in
   this area with the emphasis on the purpose, tools and methods of
   information distribution and communication in French society. An attempt
   was made to evaluate the effectiveness of the ``French model{''}. The
   Flamanville 3 project was referred to.},

Abstract = {The main aim of this article is to develop a perspective on the universe
   of measures for group representation that goes beyond a narrow focus on
   gender and ethnicity. The article employs an inductive approach by
   analysing and comparing the formal and informal party quotas and rules
   applied by political parties in candidate selection processes for the
   German federal elections using a mixed-method design of qualitative
   interviews, content analysis and participant observation. The analysis
   reveals that parties in Germany adopt a broad range of party rules to
   guarantee group representation, which differ systematically by party
   type and ideology. Overall, there is a predominance of informal, yet
   highly institutionalised, quotas and rules. Also, there are clear
   conflicts as to the relative ranking of specific quotas and rules,
   leading to interaction effects between them. Based on this
   neo-institutionalist perspective, the article then attempts to develop a
   typology of quotas.},

   presence, and a virtual campaign team of participants separated by large
   geographical distances, the internet; in particular e-campaigning; was
   not a priority for use within the campaign. In fact, although the

   organization led to negative bureaucratic impacts at the local campaign

Abstract = {In this chapter, California's Proposition 8 is analyzed using the
   theoretical concepts of homonormativity and homonationalism as tools for
   exposing the workings of biopower and governmentality. I discuss how the
   No on 8 campaign revealed a mainstream, lesbian and gay politics tied to
   a politics of recognition and inclusion through normalcy. I also examine
   how the omnipresent African American civil rights analogy folds
   homonationalism in through the narrative of American exceptionalism, and
   reproduces the representational and material whiteness of the LGBT
   community. All of this builds an analysis of how blood logics and
   heterosexual reproduction construct not just a white citizenry, but a
   straight one as well. This is most evident in the naturalized linkages
   between marriage and procreation.},

Abstract = {In its long development the Italian cooperative movement went through
   slow and steady transformations, that have generally sheltered it from
   radical discontinuities. The different trends and political traditions
   that have become intertwined with the history of the cooperative
   movement highlight the flexibility of the cooperative principles which
   have been adapted on the basis of different situations, without being
   modified in their abstract outlines. In this paper we argue that the
   Italian cooperative movement on the one hand seems to have absorbed the
   principles of market economy through the adoption of organization of
   productions and functional structures similar to those of many
   capitalist companies. On the other hand Italian cooperative movement
   have developed a peculiar form of social action based on the
   institutionalization of postulates such as the mutual aid and
   solidarity. In short the cooperative form has historically constituted
   and continues to be shaped as a peculiar pattern in which
   undercapitalization requires a wider-ranging fluidity of the working
   relationships. These have been raised to the ranks of moral values in
   social action.},

Abstract = {This article establishes an interdisciplinary dialogue between several
   disciplines, including journalism, philosophy and psychoanalysis. The
   case analysis proposes the existence in individuals of a feared
   unconscious phantasy in which, under certain conditions, the individual
   seeks to avoid deep anxieties generated by contact with dead internal
   objects. The authors explore how submission to an authority of
   tyrannical characteristics may become a way of escaping these anxieties.
   Hannah Arendt's concept of the banality of evil is presented and
   analyzed as a means of understanding this mental process, leading to the
   notion that not thinking allows the avoidance of catastrophic emotions
   that have already been experienced in a traumatic infancy.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE PEACE \& SECURITY},

Volume = {26},

Pages = {233-250},
Abstract = {The traditional arms control approach is slow in dismantling nuclear
   arsenals. It is also a statecentered approach, and does not enthuse
   public opinion as it is rather technical and complex. The recent
   interest in the so-called humanitarian approach of nuclear disarmament
   can be explained by a growing frustration with traditional arms control.
   The humanitarian approach points to the consequences of the use of
   nuclear weapons for individual human beings, and recommends forbidding
   nuclear weapons. The step-by-step approach is replaced by a principled
   approach, which holds that nuclear weapons are too destructive to be
   used, just like chemical and biological weapons. A ban on nuclear
   weapons will turn the tables. The burden of proof will shift from the
   non-nuclear weapon states to the nuclear weapon states. Those nuclear
   weapon states that are not eager to eliminate their nuclear weapons will
   come under growing pressure from worldwide public opinion as well as
   their own public opinion. It is this stigmatizing effect of nuclear
   weapons as inhumane and therefore unusable that may bring all states to
   pursue Global Zero.},

Pages = {137-167},
Abstract = {Political expression often revolves around ethnic, religious, or
   cultural group identities. I develop a game-theoretic model explaining
   how group identities interact with citizens' social environments to
   induce political behavior designed to express group identity. Citizens
   make political choices before engaging in social interactions which may
   involve members of the individual's ingroup or outgroup. The strength of
   an individual's group identity is private information and affects
   payoffs from political behavior and from cooperative behavior in social
   interactions. Therefore, symbolic political behavior informs social
   interactions by revealing information about the group identity of the
   participant. Furthermore, cross-cutting pressures from ingroup and
   outgroup interactions govern the intensity with which individuals pursue
   symbolic political behavior. Symbolic political behavior is more common
   in segregated communities and among members of large majority groups. I
   illustrate the broad importance of the theory through applications to
   anti-immigrant activism.},

Abstract = {Explanations of the switch from majoritarian (MR) to proportional
   representation (PR) at the beginning of the 20th century focus on
   parties' expected gains of seats. But these gains had actually been
   achieved even under MR, via local-level electoral alliances. Moreover,
   the underlying assumption of major parties of the time as unitary actors
   appears inaccurate. Rather, PR proved attractive for leaders of
   established parties whose struggle for control over backbencher behavior
   was exacerbated by increasing alliance diversity and the rise of modern
   mass parties. This rise, incarnated in the socialist parties, thus
   threatened legislative, not electoral majorities of established parties.
   Using encompassing datasets on alliances and parliamentary voting
   behavior for Germany in the period 1890-1918, we show this argument to
   hold empirically.},

Abstract = {Unlike the massive literature about US Supreme Court confirmation
   battles, little has been written about lower federal court confirmation
   fights. However, in the past 20 years much has been written about the
   lower federal court confirmation process. Here, we take stock of the
   political science literature in this area and highlight where scholarly
   interest appears to be going. Believing a contemporary assessment of the
   state of the field should be of interest and use to scholars of American
   politics, we dissect the recent empirical literature and offer
   suggestions for future research. Most importantly, we offer a one-stop
   shop for recent literature for scholars interested in this topic.},

Abstract = {We address the Magdalene Laundries. On the one hand this institution was
   constituted as a compassionate response to managing troubled young
   women; on the other hand it was seen as a disciplinary apparatus
   imposing total institutional life on its inmates. The antinomy of views
   about the institution is evident in the analysis we make of 116 comments
   by 66 commenters on an online newspaper article about the Magdalene
   Laundries. We analyse these comments in the context of broader concerns
   about contemporary approaches to the topic of organizational compassion.
   We argue that organizational compassion is a complex social process
   embedded within power relations that can be disciplinary in nature and
   create ambivalent rather than wholly positive outcomes.},

Abstract = {``Interteach{''} is a method of guided discussion and feedback developed
   by Thomas Boyce and Philip Hineline in 2002. This method, primarily used
   in the psychology classroom, encourages greater student engagement and
   responsibility for learning by requiring extensive student preparation,
   peer-to-peer instruction, and peer evaluation. How can this method be
   used and modified for the political science classroom to increase
   students' engagement and to improve students' ability to synthesize
   complex arguments? In this article, we describe how to use the
   interteach method in political science and demonstrate its effectiveness
   in multiple classroom scenarios. The research is based on evidence from
   five different political science courses, ranging from the
   introductory-level to seminar-style classes.},

Abstract = {In the Languedoc, the intersections between rugby, wine and socialism
   give telling insights into the value and significance of regional
   identity. At the end of the 1970s, the Languedoc's wine industry and
   rugby were facing up to the challenges of modernisation; the responses
   which emerged drew upon the principles of regional identity drawn from
   the `banal nationalism' of wine-drinking, left-voting rugby players in
   local administrations and at the head of powerful trade unions. The
   cross-over between board-room and locker-room helped to accent regional
   responses to change and modernization, ensuring that regional heritage
   remained potent and ready to be communicated.},

Journal = {RETHINKING MARXISM-A JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS CULTURE \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {26},

Pages = {398-413},
Abstract = {One criticism of Louis Althusser is that his theory of ideology and his
   conception of history as a process without a subject together
   underestimate the question of the subject and undermine any attempt
   toward a critical subjectivity. Althusser's work, however, from his
   emphasis on the conjuncture as a singular condensation of overdetermined
   contradictions to his later writings on lasting encounters, brings
   forward the open question of political agency. This article stresses the
   complexity of Althusser's theorization of political practices. It also
   attempts to criticize recent arguments favoring a return to the
   theorization of critical subjectivity. Finally, it discusses the
   possibility of a militant and critical nonsubjectivist conception of
   political agency and mass intellectuality based on the Althusserian
   tradition, on Lenin's, Gramsci's, and Mao's conception of the political
   party as a collective process of knowledge production, and on the

   armed conflict in the region. From the start of the First Chechnya War
   in 1994 to the current Caucasus Emirate-led insurgency, this chapter
   allows the reader to grasp the particular historical, geo-political, and
   socio-cuitural conditions which have led to the birth and proliferation

Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},

Volume = {23},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {26-42},
Abstract = {Unlike national elections, subnational levels of politics have rarely
   been the subject of research. The small number of investigations stem
   from the field of psephology. While these have supported the assumption
   that the national level exerts a time-dependent impact on regional
   voting behaviour, election campaigning's time-dependency has yet to be
   investigated. Against this backdrop, this article offers a unique
   longitudinal and quantitative investigation of election campaigns in
   Germany's federal states. Using campaign managers' perceptions as a
   basis, it discusses time-relevant effects on electoral campaigning with
   regard to the degree of regionalisation, emotionalisation, and
   personalisation.},

   unique challenges (both methodologically and theoretically) that face
   evaluators in the context of evaluating terrorism risk reduction
   initiatives. Additionally, the appendices of this work contain both a
   process checklist for conducting an impact analysis of such initiatives,
   and an evaluation self-assessment tool.},

   is possible to introduce a lot of various interdisciplinary fields, when
   different sciences may play a leading role to represent the context. It
   is shown that historical disciplines play an important role within

Abstract = {This article examines executive responses to economic decline in Ontario
   and Michigan from 2003 to 2012, when the two governments struggled to
   adjust to a severe manufacturing crisis which greatly worsened during
   the Great Recession in 2008-2009. Sharing an international border, these
   cases offer control over an unusually large number of economic, social
   and political factors, permitting a focused analysis of the impact of
   divided government and fiscal decentralization on executive policy
   making. The research finds that greater fiscal decentralization in
   Canada and unified government in Ontario allowed the province to develop
   a more rapid and more robust response to the economic crisis in
   comparison to the State of Michigan. Budgetary constraints and a
   partisan veto at the state level forced Michigan's governor to redirect
   her efforts to the federal venue.},

Abstract = {Veto override attempts offer an ideal opportunity to study the
   president's influence in Congress. A bill's content is identical during
   final passage and veto override votes, yet some members of Congress vote
   differently on these two roll-calls. This article focuses on those
   members of Congress who switch their votes to join, or defect from, the
   president's coalition during veto override votes. The empirical analysis
   investigates veto override attempts from 1973 to 2011 to determine which
   members of Congress are most likely to change their votes during veto
   overrides. I find that the president's ability to win, or keep, members'
   support on veto override votes is determined in part by members'
   electoral incentives and the president's strength in members'
   constituencies. In particular, the president's strength in members'
   constituencies makes presidential party members more likely to join the
   president's veto override coalition and also makes opposition party
   members more likely to defect from the president's veto override
   coalition. Accounting for the influence of constituencies and electoral
   incentives augments party-based and ideology-based theories of
   congressional behavior and thus helps build richer, more comprehensive,
   and more accurate theories of member behavior},

Abstract = {Rather than looking at coalition formation as a single-shot game, this
   article attempts a more dynamic analysis by exploring the interactive
   processes between different experiments over time. Comparing coalition
   experiments since 1996, it finds that there is an inbuilt tension in the
   nature of the coalition formations in India. India's federalized party
   system created a distinctive coalition formation pattern in which
   territory played a significant part. Its coalitions primarily involved
   the coming together of two types of parties, polity-wide and
   single-state parties. The organizational logic of the two categories of
   parties is different and consequently the incentives that drive them
   vary. While their coming together in a coalition does help fulfil some
   `mutual needs' there is also an element of competition about issues
   including how much and whose needs are being fulfilled. While
   polity-wide parties would prefer to govern alone or have a system in
   which the role of the coalitionable is negligible, this article argues
   that the combined effect of both federalization of the party system and
   an institutionalization of a coalitional system has decreased the
   possibility of single-party governments in the short run. The article
   also notes that incongruent majorities in the two houses, the need to
   get policy passed and the changing composition of the Rajya Sabha during
   the tenure of the Lok Sabha will encourage the formation of large
   coalitions and/or surplus coalitions.},

Abstract = {Studies on retrospective voting argue that voters under presidentialism
   tend to assign co-responsibility for the president's performance to her
   party in congressional elections. However, it is not uncommon for
   presidential parties to distance themselves from an unpopular president
   or for opposition parties to cooperate with a popular president. In
   doing so, parties can signal to voters that they side with a popular (or
   against an unpopular) president. Yet little is known about whether this
   strategic behavior has electoral payoffs. This study proposes a
   popularity-response model, where parties' electoral outcomes are a
   product of how they respond to public opinion on the president. I
   hypothesize that parties defecting from an unpopular president (or
   cooperating with a popular president) minimize electoral losses and
   obtain a further electoral boost. Analysis using an original dataset
   coding issue congruence between presidents and parties prior to 35
   elections in 18 Latin American countries supports this claim.},

Abstract = {This article examines the lessons that can be drawn from social
   protection programs in Mexico at both the national and sub-national
   scales for the Social Protection Floor (SPF) initiative for the
   implementation of the Global Social Floor proposal in Mexico. Mexico's
   federal anti-poverty program, Progresa/Oportunidades, was a pioneer in
   the application of a social investment paradigm to the provision of
   social benefits to the extreme poor, and the targeting of benefits. At
   the same time, the left-leaning Partido de la Revolucion Democratica
   (PRD) governments of the Federal District have introduced an ambitious
   new series of social programs at the municipal scale. PRD governments
   have directly criticized the targeting and surveillance involved in the
   Oportunidades program. Instead, the PRD has advocated more
   universalistic approaches to social policy, based on principles of
   social rights. This article examines the areas of congruence and
   dissonance between these Mexican innovations in social policy and the
   SPF initiative.},

Journal = {GLOBAL SOCIAL POLICY},

Volume = {14},

Pages = {389-405},

Abstract = {Japan and South Korea have always taken what may be called a social
   investment approach to their social and economic development policies.
   They were able to achieve a high level of economic growth, in part,
   because of their targeted social spending that supported and protected
   the productive sectors of the society. Since the 1990s, however, there
   has been a marked shift in the targets of social investment, from
   predominantly skilled, male, industrial core workers to more peripheral,
   marginalized, and vulnerable population groups, such as women, children,
   and the elderly. Moreover, this new policy focus is now increasingly put
   forward from the perspective of inclusive welfare and the discourse of
   social inclusion, thus breaking from the earlier productivist thinking.
   Indeed, recent social investment policy debates in the two countries are
   often framed in terms of intergenerational equity, social and economic
   sustainability, and economic democracy. What are these `new social
   investments', and why the shifts? This article looks at the new social
   investment policies in Japan and South Korea to understand factors
   behind the changes, and assess how `new' are these new social
   investments.},

Abstract = {Contemporary political scientists have observed a democratic paradox
   that has crystallized around the disconnection between how citizens
   imagine their democracy and how politics is practiced. Citizens continue
   to believe in the values of liberal democracy but are increasingly
   disillusioned with how their political systems work and the politics
   that are practiced in the name of democracy. This article revisits the
   root causes of political alienation to better understand this democratic
   paradox. It provides both a conceptual understanding of political
   alienation and its domain of action and insights into how the concept
   can be operationalized and measured in empirical research. It argues
   that while democracy itself may not be in crisis, the politics on which
   its operation rests is in peril.},

Abstract = {Even though elections in Turkey are generally considered ``free and
   fair{''} by the international community, there are procedures that cast
   a shadow of doubt. This is particularly the case regarding some
   practices of the Supreme Election Board (YSK) - the body responsible for
   the elections. At a time of dramatic political polarization, as well as
   three approaching elections, this article draws attention to the
   potential for election fraud in Turkey.},

Abstract = {This article uses the case New York City to examine why certain
   immigrant groups participated in the 2006 protest wave more than others
   and why the city mobilized less compared with other major immigrant
   metropolises. The findings indicate that certain immigrant groups
   participated more than others because of how the issue of illegal
   immigration was racialized and framed by the media, and because of the
   disproportionate impact the proposed legislation would have had on them.
   The data presented illustrate how the city's heterogeneous population
   served to diminish its capacity to produce the magnitude of mobilization
   found in other large immigrant cities.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {503-525},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article examines one widespread but widely overlooked informal
   party practice to access state resources indirectly: the `taxing' of MP
   salaries, which obliges candidates who win elected office on a party
   ticket to regularly donate a fixed share of their private income to
   party coffers. Linking Duverger's classical approach on party
   organization that stresses the importance of party-society relations
   with the more recent, highly influential cartel party theory that argues
   that parties are shaped by their relationship with the state, we specify
   factors that shape the acceptability of this informal practice and thus
   parties' capacity to extract rent from their MPs. The analysis of an
   original dataset covering parties across a wide range of advanced
   democracies reveals that demanding salary transfers from national MPs to
   their parties are not only more common in leftist parties as argued by
   Duverger but also in systems in which the penetration of the state
   apparatus by political parties is intense as argued by the cartel party
   approach. Linking the two perspectives further reveals that ideological
   differences between parties shape their relative capacity to collect
   higher payments from MPs in systems where parties and the state are less
   intertwined.},

Abstract = {This year, even fewer translations from Russian reached the Germanophone
   book market than in 2013, perhaps a result of the deterioration in
   political relations. Two-thirds of the titles are first translations. Of
   these, only the books by Arkady Babchenko and Alisa Ganieva as well as
   Andrei Kurkov's Ukrainian Diaries deal with the immediate present. Elena
   Katishonok's strong novel ends with the collapse of the Soviet Union.
   Rid Grachev's fantastic short prose exudes the spirit of ``thaw{''}
   period. The artistic power of the titles from the early the 20th century
   translated for the first time (Hippius, Teffi, Gazdanov, Mayakovsky) is
   impressive. The new translations are based on current critical editions
   of the Russian original texts (Babel, Khodasevich, Ginzburg), make a
   point of falling back on previous versions (Bunin), follow new
   translation principles (Bulgakov), or offer new arrangements of texts
   (Yuriev).},

Abstract = {Past research has impressively shown that the physical attractiveness of
   politicians influences their electoral success. A large part of the
   existing literature analyses single-member constituencies in
   parliamentary elections, presidential elections and open lists in
   proportional representation systems. In contrast, relatively little is
   known about the effects of the physical attractiveness of front-runners
   in multiple member constituencies. This paper fills the research gap.
   Taking the 2004 European Parliament elections as an example, it analyses
   the influence of frontrunners' physical attractiveness on the electoral
   success of their respective parties and combined lists. Voter behaviour
   is captured by real-life election results in the 64 constituencies of
   the 2004 European Parliament elections. The attractiveness of the front-
   runners is estimated according to the Truth-of-Consensus Method.
   Twentyfour students were shown portrait photographs of the candidates
   and were asked to rate each candidate's attractiveness. The
   attractiveness score of a candidate is then computed by averaging the
   different ratings he or she has received. Multilevel analyses show that
   front- runners' attractiveness substantially influences election
   results.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes whether Europe-specific attitudes can contribute
   to the explanation of non-voting (at the individual level) and the level
   of voter turnout (at the national level) in European elections. The
   results for all elections between 1979 and 2009 show that voters' level
   of dissatisfaction with their country's membership in the EU has a
   negative effect on turnout in European elections at the national level.
   Individual dissatisfaction with the EU also leads to a lower likelihood
   of voter turnout at the individual level. However, Europe-specific
   attitudes are just one explanatory factor among many. Classical
   determinants of voter turnout such as interest in politics or strength
   of party identification are clearly much stronger predictors of
   participation in European elections.},

Abstract = {Contrary to most other OECD countries, the German labour market remained
   almost unaffected by the consequences of the global financial crisis and
   experienced a strong and steady recovery. Thus, after their victory in
   the elections of 2009, the economic conditions for the bourgeois parties
   to shape labour market policy according to their preferences were rather
   favourable. After exploring the causes of the German `employment
   miracle', this article summarises the relevant labour market policies
   introduced by the black-yellow coalition. We argue that, apart from some
   important exceptions, the second Merkel government did not pursue a
   decidedly market-liberal policy agenda. Instead, primarily due to the
   low problem load, the government mainly readjusted some of the existing
   policy instruments. Therefore, German labour market policy between 2009
   and 2013 can rather be described as an administration of the inherited
   `employment miracle' than an active pursuit of a discrete policy agenda.},

Abstract = {This article assesses religion and voting in Australia since 1987 and
   examines how Tony Abbott's status as Liberal leader corresponded with
   changes in leader evaluations and voting, and with significant changes
   in Australian parties and the electorate. Religious attendance became
   associated more strongly with Liberal voting in 2010. Catholics voted
   Liberal significantly more from 2010, in significantly higher numbers
   they viewed the Liberal leader more positively in 2013, and they viewed
   the Labor leader significantly less so. Evaluations of Abbott were
   structured by attitudes about abortion and same-sex marriage, whereas
   evaluations of Kevin Rudd were not. The article discusses how these
   results are not unique to Australia, but fit patterns observed with
   centre-right parties in other western democracies.},

Abstract = {Oh, the lowly interest group scorecard. Although it has fallen from
   favor with political scientists in recent decades, we contend scorecards
   still offer considerable potential for those engaged in interest group
   research. By aggregating scores across sectors of interests, we can
   determine under what conditions different types of groups are satisfied
   with Congress. In our analysis, we aggregate 105 893 ratings of US
   senators issued by 249 different organizations from the 106th through
   the 111th Congresses. By `flipping' congressional scorecards on their
   heads, we find that public interest organizations show the lowest levels
   of satisfaction, regardless of which party controls the Senate. Business
   and professional trade associations tend to show higher levels of
   satisfaction with senators, except during the robust Democratic majority
   of the 111th Congress. And labor unions produce higher evaluations
   during Democratic majorities. The typical layperson may assume that
   groups with popular missions (those representing large populations) and
   lots of money or those who spend considerable amounts on political
   activities (for example, campaigning and lobbying) may be more satisfied
   with Congress. However, this study finds no relationship between group
   satisfaction and those factors.},

Journal = {PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {67},

Abstract = {First-past-the-post (FPTP) electoral rules usually produce legislative
   majorities. But minority governments appear to be an increasingly common
   electoral outcome in political systems operating under those rules.
   What, then, drives citizens views about minority governments? The
   Canadian case is instructive; it operates under FPTP rules and has
   recently experienced three minority governments in a row. This
   investigation proposes three explanations for why citizens might support
   minority governments and these explanations are empirically tested using
   Canadian Election Study data. The analysis indicates that people support
   minority government outcomes mostly for partisan strategic reasons.
   Pragmatic considerations are important but, surprisingly, principled
   motivations have quite modest effect.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to reconstruct the particular concept of revolution
   contained in the statements of the Chilean Popular Unity. In this sense,
   it is argued that the concept of revolution, particularly in the Popular
   Unity, is the result of constant friction between the Chilean Socialist
   Party and the Communist Party since the creation of the Popular Front in
   1956. Differences between both parties are expressed mainly on three
   issues: the dichotomy around the policy of alliances which should follow
   the conglomerate; The discussion of the influence of the Cuban
   revolution in revolutionary practices at national and continental
   levels; and the role of democracy in the development of revolution.},

   effectiveness of British Prime Ministers from 1902 to 2004},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {1},
Number = {3},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {What role do the Leadership Trait Analysis (LTA) criteria projected by a
   British Prime Minister (PM) have on the perceived effectiveness of their
   time in office? In this paper, the analysis of 20th-century British PMs
   utilized automated at-a-distance content analysis and the LTA coding
   system to determine the conceptual complexity, ability to control
   events, and need for power scores projected by PMs. The impact these
   traits had on the perceived effectiveness of the totality of the PMs'
   tenure in office, as measured by the 2004 MORI/University of Leeds
   survey, was then examined via one-tailed ordinary least squares
   regression.
   This project provides evidence that British PMs who project traits
   associated with the LTA measure regarding strong power motivation are
   significantly viewed as more effective while in office. These findings
   provide more than a novel historical profile of British PMs. The
   relationship between effective leadership and LTA traits could be
   utilized by political campaigns, especially given the introduction of
   prime ministerial debates, to portray a prime ministerial candidate as
   more politically effective than his/her competition.},

Abstract = {Most states and Congress allow only one version of a bill to be reported
   out of a conference committee. Because of their control over the
   conference membership, party leaders may use conferences to produce
   nonmedian outcomes. However, in three states the rules allow a minority
   to propose its own competing conference report. A formal model
   demonstrates that this institutional design produces more moderate
   legislative outcomes despite the preferences of the majority coalition.
   The model's predictions are tested using coalition sizes on conference
   report votes in the states. Controlling for other factors, chambers
   which allow the minority to propose a competing conference report have
   larger coalitions, on average, though this effect is mitigated by
   interchamber distance. Further, rejection of the conference bill is also
   much less likely because the majority cannot propose extreme bills. The
   article demonstrates that conference committee proposal rules are an
   important source of majority coalition power.},

Abstract = {Despite the ever-growing literature on various aspects of the Kurdish
   question in Turkey, there are practically no normative discussions of
   Kurdish demands for the public recognition of their identities. This is
   all the more startling given the ascendancy of philosophical accounts in
   the literature on minority rights. This article will try to redress the
   balance by proposing a normative framework that could be used to justify
   Kurdish demands for recognition, drawing on the broader debates that
   revolve around Charles Taylor's seminal conceptualization of ``the
   politics of recognition{''}. In this context, I will identify
   nationalism, a strategy used both by the state to suppress demands for
   recognition and by the minorities to put forward these demands, as the
   most serious hurdle in the way of the democratic resolution of the
   ``Kurdish question{''} in Turkey and promote a form of recognition-based
   multiculturalism that (a) respects the basic rights of all citizens, not
   only those in whose name the said claims are made, but also those of the
   members of the majority against which the claims are voiced; (b) leaves
   room for alternative values or conceptions of the good life.},

Abstract = {In response to growing demographic diversity, European countries have
   selectively implemented political multiculturalism, a set of policies
   that seek to redefine prevailing conceptions of national identity. We
   explore the consequences of such policies for mass political support.
   Applying multi-level modeling to the 2002 and 2010 waves of the European
   Social Survey and analyzing multiple dependent variables including trust
   in regime institutions and assessments of the government of the day and
   the political system's performance, we show that the extensive adoption
   of multicultural policies magnifies the degree to which hostility to
   immigration is negatively associated with political support. This
   finding, robust to multiple specifications, is corroborated using
   European Values Survey data. It underscores how policies that challenge
   citizens' conceptions of national identity strengthen the link between
   opposition to immigration and political discontent, furnishing ongoing
   opportunities for rightist fringe parties to capitalize on
   anti-immigrant sentiment among the politically alienated.},

Abstract = {There is an often-noted gap between political scientists and
   policymakers. This article examines the related but less investigated
   gap between political scientists and the engaged public. Reasons for the
   gap are explored by making inferences about public preferences through
   an examination of New York Times non-fiction bestsellers on politics
   from 1985 to 2009. The analysis suggests that although non-fiction
   readers have an interest in a wide range of political issues, political
   scientists often fail to reach the engaged public for several reasons,
   such as due to the public's increasing consumption of books of a
   partisan or ideological nature versus the norm of objectivity in
   academic research. On the basis of an examination of bestsellers on
   politics, this study explores the nature of the engaged public -
   political science divide and considers ways of potentially bridging the
   gap.},

Abstract = {In this study, we evaluate how voter polarization and the level of
   partisanship influence electoral outcomes. We show that when the level
   of partisanship is low, the polarization of voter preferences translates
   into popular support for extreme parties. In contrast, longstanding
   attachments to mainstream (moderate) parties dampen the relationship
   between voter polarization and support for extreme parties. The
   implication of these findings is that the lack of voter attachment to
   parties contributes to extreme party competition, while strong
   attachment can help reduce party extremism even if electorates are
   polarized.},

Abstract = {There is a debate about the extent of the Senate majority party's
   influence and the conditions under which it is used. This article
   demonstrates that the majority party influences legislative outcomes to
   meet electoral goals and protect its reputation by manipulating the
   consideration of the dozen annual appropriations bills. The majority
   party limits amendments and eases passage of the budget when it abandons
   the ``regular order{''} and creates an omnibus appropriations bill. It
   is more likely to abandon the regular order when it is ideologically
   divided, has a small margin of control, or is distant from the minority.},

Abstract = {In 1953, on the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the Famine of
   1932-1933 in Ukraine, emigres from eastern and central Ukraine published
   in Toronto an English-language collection titled The Black Deeds of the
   Kremlin: A White Book. The volume contained largely memoirs and
   testimonies on policies and actions taken by Soviet authorities that
   Raphael Lemkin had identified that same year as constituting the
   Ukrainian Genocide. A second volume, published in 1955, was dedicated to
   the collectivization and famine. The two, however, went virtually
   unnoticed by the scholarly community until the appearance of Robert
   Conquest's The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivization and the
   Terror-Famine (1986). At that time, Conquest was attacked for using
   emigre sources, characterized by some critics as Cold War products,
   biased and unreliable. Despite shortcomings, the publication of the two
   volumes marked an admirable effort by the emigres to tell their stories
   of repression and persecution under Stalinist rule in Ukraine.},

Abstract = {While the role played by ministries in the process of coalition
   government has been investigated from multiple angles, there is a clear
   lack of knowledge about which specific ministry features party leaders
   actually value as they assess different government posts. This paper
   aims at discovering whether, next to office considerations, the policy
   influence resting with a ministry does affect its value. A new survey of
   party leaders in the German states enables us to estimate the relative
   importance of specific office (e.g. public standing) and policy
   considerations (e.g. influence via legislation) for ministries' values
   as well as to directly investigate differences between parties. The
   results show that both office and policy considerations matter for
   ministry evaluation generally, but also that different aspects have
   different weights. Furthermore, while all parties value the policy
   influence of a ministry, there is variation as to which type of policy
   influence (cross-sectional vs. within-jurisdictional) parties emphasise.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an explanation for the breakdown of dominant party
   systems. In contrast to previous works that examine how ruling parties
   lose their dominant position as a result of interparty competition, this
   paper focuses on how they are undermined from within by factional
   conflict. Through an overview of dominant party systems in the postwar
   world, we show that most of the ruling parties suffered from major
   splits that significantly reduced their electoral strengths before their
   final electoral defeat. In order to explain why large groups of
   politicians decide to leave dominant parties that are likely to remain
   in power, we develop simple game-theoretic models of intraparty
   bargaining between party factions over the distribution of benefits from
   office. Our results suggest two mechanisms through which dominant
   parties break up. First, factional defections from dominant parties are
   likely to occur when they are experiencing a significant decline in
   public support. Second, factional defections are likely to occur when a
   non-mainstream faction is rapidly losing its bargaining power against
   the party leadership. Importantly, our results show that under certain
   conditions, dominant parties will break up even when their electoral
   prospects are much better than the opposition. We briefly discuss how
   these mechanisms can be applied to actual cases of dominant party
   systems.},

Abstract = {This paper explores some of connections between bodies and slavery in
   the antislavery discourses of the late eighteenth and the early
   twenty-first centuries. It focuses on representations of violence and
   cruelty, and on the discourses of blood, sweat and tears in the
   eighteenth century to interrogate the bases of the humanitarianism
   discourses and what it meant to `compassionate' the suffering of others.
   It argues that the connections between slavery, the body and citizenship
   lie in the socialization of sentience, the `complicated stings' of
   social death and the idea of having a secure property in the person.
   Some of these connections were broken by the de-historicizing move
   towards focusing on the vulnerability of the slave and the power of the
   consumer. Using the slave sugar boycotts of 1791-1792 as a particular
   example, the paper argues that these more complicated stories are
   `leached out' by discourses that treat slaves only as bodies, moralize
   consumption and rely on a neat split between public and private at the
   expense of a layered understanding of citizenship and empire, and of
   inequality, subordination, marginalization and social conflict. The
   article then traces some of the ways in which this emphasis on moralized
   consumption and disposable bodies resurfaces in current antislavery
   campaigns in the twenty-first century in the rhetoric of ethical
   consumption, risking the same `leaching out' of political analysis,
   hollowing out our understanding of the link between slavery and
   citizenship.},

Abstract = {In January 2010, hundreds of illegal migrants took to the streets of
   Rosarno in Italy for a violent protest against the acts of racism which
   they had routinely suffered. A collective subject, considered invisible,
   dared to revolt. These migrants are an anomaly in the social, legal, and
   political senses. Their revolt is an example of rebellions who
   constitute a litmus test for the discourse of citizenship; it reveals
   itself as a form of political subjectivity and highlights the
   corporeality of the conflict. Understanding the revolt also troubles the
   boundary between body discourses and traditional political theory. In
   this paper, I analyse the revolt through categories of contemporary
   political theory such as the `bare life' of Giorgio Agamben, and the
   `disagreement' of Jacques Ranciere. I show how these categories only
   partially help to interpret the phenomenon of this uprising. However,
   the Spinozist concept of indignatio is a more useful intellectual tool
   to interpret and understand the phenomenon of the revolt of Rosarno.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses international response to the Croatian military
   operation Maslenica in January 1993. Based on media comments and
   reactions of key international mediators in the war in Croatia and
   Bosnia and Herzegovina, particularly the United Nations, France and
   Chairman of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, it
   seeks to answer the question of what the reaction was, how in reality it
   was in accordance with the proclaimed policies and how it fit into the
   overall international policy towards the war in Croatia and Bosnia and
   Herzegovina. The paper is based on the documents of the United Nations,
   the analysis of several newspapers and reports of the Croatian Ministry
   of Foreign Affairs. It situates behaviour of the main participants
   within the context of ``carrots and sticks{''} strategy. The Maslenica
   operation had shown that international community would not prevent
   military interventions against the self-declared Republic of Srpska
   Krajina by Croatian forces. It thus announced what subsequently happened
   in 1995 with the decisive Operation Storm.},

Abstract = {This article provides a review of the method and approach of a study
   done on a research topic in the field of Political Science, namely the
   impact of organised criminal groups on social control by the state.
   Research can be regarded as the production of knowledge and the research
   process is the roadmap or guide used in order to produce knowledge about
   a specific topic under consideration. As a result of the sensitive
   nature of the research subject, particular care was taken in designing
   the research process that guided the study. This article offers an
   explanation of the specific research design and research methodology
   selected in order to analyse the features of the relationship between
   local governance, societies and organised criminal groups. The following
   elements are discussed: the case study research design, the qualitative
   research methodology, the field research process and research
   techniques, research ethics and, finally, basic safety while doing
   fieldwork.},

Abstract = {Gender quotas traditionally focus on the underrepresentation of women.
   Conceiving of quotas in this way perpetuates the status of men as the
   norm and women as the ``other.{''} Women are subject to heavy scrutiny
   of their qualifications and competence, whereas men's credentials go
   unchallenged. This article calls for a normative shift in the problem of
   overrepresentation, arguing that the quality of representation is
   negatively affected by having too large a group drawn from too narrow a
   talent pool. Curbing overrepresentation through ceiling quotas for men
   offers three core benefits. First, it promotes meritocracy by ensuring
   the proper scrutiny of politicians of both sexes. Second, it provides an
   impetus for improving the criteria used to select and evaluate
   politicians. Third, neutralizing the overly masculinized environment
   within parliaments might facilitate better substantive and symbolic
   representation of both men and women. All citizens would benefit from
   these measures to increase the quality of representation.},

Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},

Volume = {42},
Number = {4},
Pages = {468-489},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In recent work, Martha Nussbaum has exposed an important ambiguity in
   the standard conception of political liberalism. The ambiguity centers
   on the notion of reasonableness as it applies to comprehensive doctrines
   and to persons. As Nussbaum observes, the notion of reasonableness in
   political liberalism can be construed in a purely ethical sense or in a
   sense that combines ethical and epistemic elements. The ambiguity bears
   crucially on the respect for persons norma key norm that helps to
   distinguish political from perfectionist versions of liberalism.
   Nussbaum contends that when political liberals affirm a construal of
   reasonableness that includes epistemic elements they run into trouble in
   formulating an account of their view that sharply distinguishes it from
   perfectionist liberalism. She contends further that perfectionist
   versions of liberalism should be rejected since they fail to offer an
   account of respect for persons. This paper responds to Nussbaum's
   challenge. It argues that an adequate account of respect for persons
   must make reference to epistemic elements. This being the case not only
   explains why political liberals were correct to incorporate epistemic
   elements into their accounts of reasonableness but also why it is a
   mistake to think that perfectionist liberals themselves cannot present
   an appealing account of respect for persons. Nussbaum's challenge merits
   careful study since it both sheds light on the nature of political
   liberalism and highlights an important faultline in its structure.},

Abstract = {Policy has been traditionally seen as a male activity. In the last
   times, and as the political rights of women had been extended, these
   have gained power positions, that until not long ago, were difficult to
   conceive. Despite this positive irruption, empirical evidence has shown
   that, there are marked asymmetries in the access to power, and the
   exercise of the same. Considering this, it's a question to consider:
   What are the factors that explain women are arriving less than men
   legislative seats?; Are there differences between men and women of the
   legislative elite?; What are the profiles of the male and female
   Mexicans deputies? The present paper examines the gender differences in
   the Mexican legislative elite, based on a construction of the profiles
   of the male and female deputies in the country from a number of
   socio-demographic and political socialization indicators.},

Abstract = {After the shooting down of a passenger aircraft from Malaysian Airlines
   over eastern Ukraine in mid-July 2014, the European Union imposed an
   embargo on arms and oil technology against Russia. This is supposed to
   force Moscow to abandon its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine.
   Even if the embargo affects Russia more than the previously decided
   freezing of accounts and travel restrictions for government officials,
   it constrains the Russian political leadership's room for manoeuver only
   a little. Russia is not very vulnerable, economically and especially
   politically. Nonetheless, the sanctions have a significant demonstration
   effect.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {No factor appears more powerful in explaining how individuals evaluate
   political information and form political preferences than partisanship.
   Yet, virtually all work on the effects of partisanship on preference
   formation neglects the crucial role of social settings. In this study, I
   examine how social settings can fundamentally change the influence of
   partisanship on preferences. I demonstrate that, in fact, social
   settings exert an independent influence over preference formation-one
   that is even larger than the influence of partisan ambivalence. The
   central implication of these findings is that, going forward, we cannot
   fully explore how citizens apply their partisanship in evaluating
   political information without also accounting for the social settings in
   which individuals find themselves.},

Abstract = {The goal of this research is to analyze how, since the Organic Law on
   Contentious Administrative Jurisdiction went into effect in June, 2010,
   the mechanisms of precautionary protection that this new legal
   instrument makes available have been applied on the level of Supreme
   Court jurisprudence. The research is considered analytical and
   descriptive, reviewing and making a record of verdicts pronounced in the
   matter of precautionary measures by the Political and Administrative
   Court, in order to construct a content analysis matrix that compares the
   fundamental variables and to determine the reprehensible performance
   that, until May, 2013, produces a very high level of denials for
   precautionary protection in favor of private citizens nd contrasted with
   a very high level of acceptance for requests by public entities.
   Conclusions are that judges with contentious administrative competence
   should take control of the precautionary power that the law gives them
   and move forward in a constitutional interpretation of the standards
   that regulate it, moderating the excessive forms and demands for
   probatory accreditation, in order to achieve full and efficacious
   validity for the constitutional guarantee of effective judicial
   protection in Venezuela.},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is primarily to analyze the relations
   between state and civil society based on the new meanings of citizen
   participation generated in Venezuela through promulgation of the 1999
   Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic, resulting in the approval of a
   series of mechanisms and administrative bodies that strive to promote
   participatory practices in public affairs with a view to finding
   solutions for collective problems. The methodology is qualitative, seen
   from the perspective of a hermeneutical approach, considering that this
   redefinition is a dialectical and intersubjective construction of
   values, actions and rules in the political environment that tries to
   explain how participatory democracy is made viable in Venezuela,
   considering citizen participation as a key element to strengthen the
   democratic political system, mainly based on local government.
   Specifically, the research studies the administrative and operational
   space the system has as one of its functions to channel, include and
   guide various associative forms in their interaction with the State. The
   conclusion is that the horizontal model of participative exercise in
   political matters has not been consolidated and presents serious
   weaknesses.},

Abstract = {The author discusses the existing relationship between the traditions
   and the expressions in the area of intangible cultural heritage, and
   popular storytelling as one of its forms. In particular, the article
   analyzes the arguments in terms of the affiliation of popular
   storytelling to literature and oral traditions, determining the general
   characteristics and differences of the two genres. In doing so, it
   establishes the fundaments of the genesis and background of popular
   storytelling with regard to those genres. The analysis of the situation
   of impoverishment and decline of oral literature in Latin America, in
   view of the process of diffusion of cultural forms and models stemming
   from national and international centers of economic power as the
   fundamental cause, has also affected popular storytelling. In addition,
   the article-based on the importance of this situation for the process of
   cultural identity-shows the need for the preservation of popular
   storytelling as a major cultural challenge in the current age. This
   leads to the claim that the links between these processes are cultural
   and social. Cultural because of the intrinsic nature and belonging of
   both processes to the sphere of culture; social because of the fact that
   there is a direct relationship between one and the other in terms of the
   existing socio-economic structures.},

Abstract = {What motivates split-ticket voting in mixed electoral systems? These
   systems allocate seats in single-member districts (SMDs) and by
   proportional representation (PR) to the same legislative house and have
   proliferated in Asia as well as globally. Using public opinion data from
   South Korea's 2012 National Assembly election, this article identifies
   that supporters of smaller parties are more likely to split their
   tickets. This is consistent with the ``best of both worlds{''} thesis
   that presumes two-party competition in SMDs and multiparty competition
   under PR. The results suggest that despite scholarly claims of an Asian
   divergence in electoral outputs, the South Korean case appears
   consistent with theoretical expectations from outside the region.},

Abstract = {Vladimir Putin's United Russia and Nursultan Nazabayev's Nur Otan
   represent a distinctive type of dominant party due to their personalist
   nature and dependence on their presidential patrons. Such personalism
   deprives these parties of the agency to perform key roles in
   authoritarian reproduction typically expected of dominant parties, such
   as resource distribution, policy-making and mobilizing mass support for
   the regime. Instead United Russia and Nur Otan have contributed to
   authoritarian consolidation by securing the president's legislative
   agenda, stabilizing elites to ensure their patron's hold on power, and
   assisting in perpetuating a discourse around the national leader.
   However, because these parties lack the agency to reproduce themselves,
   to entrench their position, and to play more than a supportive role in
   regime consolidation, the lifespan of such personalist dominant parties
   is likely to be significantly shorter than that of dominant parties.},

Title = {Getting things straight: The effects of ballot design and electoral
   structure on voter participation},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {34},
Pages = {119-130},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper considers the implications of the straight-party voting
   option (STVO) on participation in judicial elections. Voters using
   straight-party options (by definition) do not vote for candidates in
   nonpartisan elections. Consequently, ballot roll-off in these elections
   is more likely to occur when people are given the chance to vote the
   party ticket and complete the voting process quickly. This is the case
   because nonpartisan judicial elections are considerably less salient
   than statewide and federal partisan elections. This article separates
   out the effects of the institutional structure of the election on
   political participation with the effects of ballot design. We find that
   in nonpartisan elections, the straight-party option decreases voter
   participation since voters who utilize the straight-ticket option may
   erroneously believe that they have voted for these nonpartisan offices,
   or simply ignore them. However, in nonpartisan elections without
   straight-ticket voting, participation is increased compared to
   nonpartisan elections with straight-ticket voting. Additionally, both
   forms of nonpartisan elections have less participation than partisan
   elections, all of which have the straight-ticket option. Thus, voter
   participation is affected not only by the type of election, but the type
   of voting rules in the election. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {This research note examines feminist theory from socialist feminism
   through the post-structural turn associated with thinkers like Foucault,
   Derrida and Butler to neomaterialism, this last noted for its emphasis
   on the body's materiality as opposed to the subject as a socially
   constructed or merely linguistic practice. Tracing these theoretical
   developments is contextualized with respect to theories and concepts
   such as feminist standpoint theories of epistemology, historical
   materialism and Baumann's ``liquid modernity{''}. I ask: have we lost
   sight of the strength of feminist structuralism particularly the effects
   of capital - in order to accommodate multiple and complex
   subjectifications associated with gender? Mary O'Brien's reproductive
   consciousness, her argument that women's consciousness is fundamentally
   shaped through the different moments related to reproduction, is
   re-examined in light of recent developments in egg donation and
   surrogacy. This is not intended as an exercise in romantic longing for
   some sort of utopian society where femininity is venerated. Rather, it
   is an exploration of the potential for reproductive consciousness to
   guide political responses to contemporary problems raised by new
   reproductive technologies that combine capital and gender in a single
   dialectic.},

Abstract = {There is an emerging scholarship on the emotional bases of political
   opinion and behaviour and, in particular, the contrasting implications
   of two distinct negative emotions - anger and anxiety. I apply the
   insights in this literature to the previously unresearched realm of the
   emotional bases of voting in EU referendums. I hypothesise that anxious
   voters rely on substantive EU issues and angry voters rely on
   second-order factors relating to domestic politics (partisanship and
   satisfaction with government). Focusing on the case of Irish voting in
   the Fiscal Compact referendum, and using data from a representative
   sample of voters, I find support for the hypotheses and discuss the
   implications of the findings for our understanding of the emotional
   conditionality of EU referendum voting.},

Abstract = {This article argues that democracy is on life support in the United
   States. Throughout the social order, the forces of predatory capitalism
   are on the march-dismantling the welfare state, corrupting politics with
   outside money, defunding higher education, expanding the
   corporate-surveillance-military state, widening inequalities in wealth
   and income, and waging a war on low income and poor minorities. As
   market mentalities and moralities tighten their grip on all aspects of
   society, democratic institutions and public spheres are being downsized,
   if not altogether disappearing. As these institutions vanish-from higher
   education to health care centers-there is also a serious erosion of the
   discourses of community, justice, equality, public values, and the
   common good. This article argues that given this current crisis,
   educators, artists, intellectuals, youth, and workers need a new
   political and pedagogical language centered around the notion of radical
   democracy in order to address the changing contexts and issues facing a
   world in which capital draws upon an unprecedented convergence of
   resources-financial, cultural, political, economic, scientific,
   military, and technological-to exercise powerful and diverse forms of
   control.},

Volume = {20},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {On 4 June 2008 Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced his
   `vision for an Asia Pacific community' (APC). Though failing to win
   support among Asian countries, the initiative offers a useful case
   study. This article does not focus on the motives and interests of the
   various governments responding to the proposal but rather on the
   different (and sometimes conflicting) understandings of regionalism that
   underpinned those responses. In its diplomatic advocacy of the APC, the
   Australian government stressed `practical regionalism' - emphasizing the
   capacity of such a new `community' to deal with security, economic,
   environmental and other challenges faced in recent times in the
   Asia-Pacific region. The Australian campaign gave little attention,
   however, to the influence of cognitive and emotive factors in community
   planning: it neglected `identity' regionalism. In particular, it did not
   seem to take seriously the possible role of non-Western perspectives in
   shaping the development of post-colonial inter-state relations. Through
   the investigation of key Asian-language terms - relating to the English
   terms for `region' and `community' - this article seeks to demonstrate
   the importance of the identity dimension in both policy development and
   academic analysis. It argues for an analytic and diplomatic skillset
   that goes beyond the disciplines of international relations and
   economics and draws upon expertise in linguistics and regional political
   cultures.},

Abstract = {The news media that refers to human trafficking is merely the result of
   the coincidence of a speech that lives and reproduces systematically
   from the state, the media and the public, in a vicious cycle that
   prevents to achieve a firm visibility of the problem as a public
   priority and a combination of complex social, cultural and economic
   structural problems of the victim's sending, receiving and transit
   countries such as Ecuador. Today, we face a media that, as a direct
   interlocutor of social knowledge, is able to construct and deconstruct
   the social imaginary around human trafficking based on an incidental
   perspective given by poor news' coverage characterized by a restricted
   comprehension of such a complex reality.},

Abstract = {The study goal is to identify key elements for the peace building in the
   Basque Country from the visions of the citizenship. Following this
   objective, the paper presents a psycho-social approach to the building
   of peace in the Basque Country from meanings socially constructed. The
   study was developed on the basis of 60 interviews made to people of
   different sectors from the Basque society, and analyzed from a
   qualitative analysis. The results aim at 7 central elements for the
   construction of peace in the Basque Country: the ETA end; changes on
   antiterrorist and penitentiary policy of the Spanish State; to repair of
   integral way to the victims of human rights violations committed by ETA
   and compatible groups, the terrorism of tardo-francoist groups, and the
   Spanish state; dialogue, negotiation and agreements; the paper of the
   civil society for peace; the work by memory; psycho-social changes.
   Finally, this concludes about the needs to approach the construction of
   peace in the Basque Country being followed a complex optics and
   considering the social, political and psycho-social dimensions.},

Abstract = {Recent waves of social protests have brought a renewed interest in the
   notion of political legitimacy. The increasing adoption of party
   regulation as a means to secure legitimacy, however, leads to several
   paradoxes. One such paradox is the fact that those who establish the
   rules about political parties are representatives of the political
   parties themselves. Despite this existing contention, the relationship
   between political legitimacy and party regulation has received little
   scholarly attention. Addressing this relationship, our special issue
   brings together articles that seek to answer questions about the
   potential and actual effects of legal rules. Drawing on rich empirical
   evidence, the underlying message of the contributions is that while
   rules are important, they do not give the whole story. After presenting
   the research included in the volume, we emphasise that regulation in
   itself does not necessarily promote political legitimacy. Therefore the
   adoption of additional rules, whether to constrain or liberate party
   behaviour, is not sufficient to legitimise those in power. Rather, we
   argue that the more important factor to consider is that of
   implementation.},

Abstract = {The EU's foreign policy response(s) to the unfolding Ukraine crisis has
   further illustrated its difficulty in making effective foreign policy
   decisions. Using a neoclassical realist analytical framework, this paper
   argues that although the EU did have tangible collective interests in
   pursuing its Ukraine foreign policy, it was unable to adequately filter
   these through its domestic setting. Three key constraints to the EU's
   Ukrainian foreign policy were identified: decision-makers'
   miscalculations; rigid normative demands; and a reliance on consensus
   politics. Ultimately, the Ukraine crisis illustrated that the EU, in
   current incarnation, cannot translate interests into effective foreign
   policies, even when making policy for their direct neighbourhood.},

Abstract = {In The Children of Light and the Children of Darkness of 1944, not only
   was Reinhold Niebuhr (1892-1971) implementing a harsh criticism against
   the traditional defense of democracy offered by the liberal thought but
   he also formulated a justification of it starting from the Christian
   tradition. However, as is evident in many others of his writings, the
   Protestant theologian did not aim to identify Christianity as a
   necessary foundation of this political regime. This article analyzes his
   attempt to demystify and desacralise democracy. Niebuhr wants to propose
   a more realistic and secular perspective to better understand the method
   and the ethos of democracy, through the rediscovery of the Christian
   view of human nature and history.},

Pages = {391-402},

Abstract = {The literature is still undecided on whether sub-state elections conform
   more to a national or regional logic of voting. In this article, I argue
   that the impact of national politics on regional elections is contingent
   upon the level of decentralization. I hypothesize that the greater the
   number of policy areas and resources in the hands of regional
   governments, the lesser the influence of national coat-tails on regional
   elections. Using the electoral results of the Spanish Socialist Party in
   national and regional elections from 1979 to 2009, the empirical
   analysis shows that regional politicians' electoral performance is
   correlated to that of their national counterparts. However, this
   correlation has weakened as regional governments have gained greater
   decision-making and financing powers. This has been particularly evident
   in elections when the regional branch of the party rules a single-party
   government and competes against strong regionalist parties.},

Abstract = {The article offers a systematic analysis of the comparative trajectory
   of international democratic change. In particular, it focuses on the
   resulting convergence or divergence of political systems, borrowing from
   the literatures on institutional change and policy convergence. To this
   end, political-institutional data in line with Arend Lijphart's (1999,
   2012) empirical theory of democracy for 24 developed democracies between
   1945 and 2010 are analyzed. Heteroscedastic multilevel models allow for
   directly modeling the development of the variance of types of democracy
   over time, revealing information about convergence, and adding
   substantial explanations. The findings indicate that there has been a
   trend away from extreme types of democracy in single cases, but no
   unconditional trend of convergence can be observed. However, there are
   conditional processes of convergence. In particular, economic
   globalization and the domestic veto structure interactively influence
   democratic convergence.},

   means, how it differs from interpersonal reconciliation and to what

   facilitate national reconciliation processes in South Africa, Rwanda and
   Burundi. Rather than normatively prescribing what governments should be
   doing, this article seeks to examine what governments are doing as a
   starting point to understanding what national reconciliation is.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {76},
Number = {2},
Pages = {479-491},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Transparency has been hailed as the key to better governance, yet
   political actors have many reasons to resist transparency. This article
   studies one prominent transparency policy, Freedom of Information (FOI)
   laws, which have been passed by over 80 countries. By institutionalizing
   transparency, FOI laws increase the costs for political actors to use
   public office-and public information-for private gain. Why have so many
   states passed FOI laws despite this? I argue that, in competitive
   political environments, FOI laws can create benefits for political
   actors as well as costs. Uncertainty over future control creates
   incentives for incumbents to pass FOI laws in order to ensure their own
   future access to government information and to credibly commit to future
   transparency. Event-history-model results show that FOI law passage is
   more likely when opposition parties pose more credible challenges to
   incumbents and when recent turnover in executive office has been
   frequent.},
