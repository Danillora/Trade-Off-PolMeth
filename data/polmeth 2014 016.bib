Title = {Protest Through Presence: Spatial Citizenship and Identity Formation in
   Contestations of Neoliberal Crises},
Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Pages = {309-327},
Abstract = {We live in a contested, crisis-prone era, indicative of ongoing
   processes of neoliberalization. The most recent global financial and
   food crises have disproportionately impacted those already marginalized
   in society: people of colour and the working classes. The spatial
   expressions of this disproportionality are especially acute, evidenced
   by the uneven distribution of the basic necessities of food and home.
   Activists in the USA are responding with forms of spatial citizenship,
   namely exercising their right to peaceably assemble and reclaiming
   public spaces. During the creation of spaces of dissent, we observe the
   fluid formation of a collective spatialized identity among social
   movement actors, contingent on political identities and ideology. We use
   two cases based in Florida to highlight these processes. The first case
   is a local iteration of the Occupy Wall Street protests, Occupy
   Gainesville, which has occupied the city's most central public gathering
   place, the Bo Diddley Community Plaza. The second case involves Food Not
   Bombs in the city of Orlando where attempts were made to ban the group
   from distributing food in public parks to the homeless and working poor.
   First, these cases highlight the spatiotemporal relationships between
   unjust economic systems and the state surveillance and policing
   apparatus and those resisting such systems. Second, they reveal how
   collective identity influences and in turn is influenced by space. Our
   article furthers a processual, dynamic understanding of activist
   mobilizations to reduce the uneven burdens of neoliberalization and
   argues for greater attention to the spatialities of contentious
   politics.},

Series = {Contributions to Political Science},
Year = {2014},
Pages = {77-102},
Abstract = {The chapter on research design begins with an outline of the practical
   methodology used to tackle this amorphous and diverse issue, the
   discourse on the Armenian Genocide. The approach taken here is an
   analysis of arguments, specifically of those arguments rejecting the
   genocide allegations. It is assumed that it is by recourse to such more
   or less explicit arguments that the conflict about the right version of
   history is carried out. The idea behind this approach is that it would
   thus facilitate a deeper look into the premises and consequences
   ingrained in each of the arguments, and thereby in the different
   versions of history offered by different historical narratives. These
   arguments were extracted empirically from various written texts
   published on the homepage of the Turkish Foreign Ministry. Finally, the
   chapter briefly touches upon some of the most flagrant points which this
   work could therefore not address, such as a more encompassing evaluation
   of the entire discourse beyond argumentation alone, or a similar
   assessment of those arguments which are made in support of the genocide
   allegations.},

Abstract = {The article documents the development of life satisfaction in four
   transitional Central European countries since 1991, in comparison with
   Germany and Austria. After presentation of data sources and the overview
   of the literature regarding the effect of transition on life
   satisfaction, surveys of European Values Study 1991, 1999 and 2008 are
   analysed together with macroeconomic data. First, satisfaction levels
   are correlated with GDP and then, individual characteristics of income,
   gender, education and family status are regressed to as explanatory
   variables of life satisfaction. While the explanatory power of GDP is
   found as very weak for the entire period, the effect of objective
   characteristics has peaked in 1999 and the effect of subjective
   perceptions in 2008. The survey information on trends after 2008 differs
   but no dramatic change of the life satisfaction due to the economic
   recession has so far appeared.},

Abstract = {In this article, we develop and test an economic theory of Supreme Court
   news. We hypothesize that information about the Third Branch is
   newsworthy when it has lower production costs and qualities attractive
   to the audiences and advertisers desired by news organizations. We
   examine Supreme Court news in elite newspapers, television news
   broadcasts, and online news sources during the October 2008 and 2010
   terms. The results of our quantitative analyses indicate that all three
   types of news outlets are more likely to provide content about Supreme
   Court decisions with substantive importance but vary in their responses
   to costs and qualities appealing to the lay audience. We conclude by
   discussing the similarities and differences among news outlets with
   regard to their selection of Supreme Court information as news content.},

Abstract = {This chapter discusses the role of purchasing in ensuring right price
   for the material purchased and its contribution to profitability given
   the fact that more than 50 \% budget of any organization is spent by its
   purchasing department. Efficient purchasing also aims at making vendors
   perform contract on time and delivery of quality material. Various
   strategies of ensuring right price are listed purchase price analysis,
   prepurchased research, competitive bidding, and price negotiations. A
   two-step bidding - technical bid followed by price bid - is now a common
   practice. Negotiation is very common practice in nongovernmental
   purchases. Thorough preparations help in successfully negotiating which
   includes SWOT analysis and game theoretic approach. The concept of
   Purchasing Chessboard is briefly outlined in evolving dynamic purchasing
   policies with 4 purchasing strategies and 16 levers leading to 64
   feasible options depending upon the demand power and supply power.
   Benefits of centralization of purchasing function are listed, and
   conditions where decentralization may help are identified.},

Abstract = {This chapter deals with the progressive political mobilisation of
   peasantry in Poland, its institutionalisation, mainly in inter-war
   period, and its political appropriation by the Communist regime after
   1945, when State socialism needed to ground itself in Polish national
   history and political traditions. These various mobilisations could be
   labelled as `populist' because of their peasantist components and
   ideological trends, but the chapter considers them rather as a political
   form of representation, which political uses by actors fluctuate
   according historical contexts. The first part analyses the emergence of
   peasant movement and the success of peasant political parties in
   pre-1939 Poland. The second part shows how formers activists of these
   parties tried to produce themselves as the only historical heirs of the
   peasant movement, in opposition to the new, Leninist, peasant party of
   the Communist Poland. In the third and last part, the chapter analyses
   how the Communist official peasant party, the ZSL, invented new
   political traditions, mainly by historicising strategies, in the aim to
   encapsulate the peasant form of representation in its identity.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates whether preference-based (empirical) power
   indices differ significantly from their preference-free (theoretical)
   counterparts. Drawing on the most comprehensive sample of EU Council
   votes to date (1993-2011), we use item-response models to estimate the
   EU27 member states' preferences (ideal points) in a one-dimensional
   policy space. Their posterior distributions are then used for the
   calculation of empirical versions of the Banzhaf and the Shapley-Shubik
   index, invoking the concepts of connected coalitions and bloc voting.
   Our ideal point estimates indicate significant differences between
   member states' preferences, which often translate into significant
   differences between empirical and theoretical power under individual
   voting. However, the formation of voting blocs appears to offset
   differences in countries' ideal points as the bloc size grows. This
   result does not hold up for the Shapley-Shubik index, whose empirical
   variants differ from the theoretical one, both under individual and bloc
   voting. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesI explore whether the tendency of English-language news
   broadcasts to favor negative coverage of the president contrasts with
   Spanish-language news coverage of the president, especially because a
   Latino news audience should prefer more positive stories of a Democratic
   president. I also examine whether presidential speeches and the
   political environment influence the tone of presidential news coverage.
   MethodsI describe the tone of presidential news coverage and use
   ordinary least squares regression to explain influences on the tone of
   Spanish- and English-language presidential news coverage for 85
   broadcast days and over 50 stories each in early 2011.
   ResultsNBC Nightly News is more negative than Noticiero Telemundo is in
   its coverage of the U.S. president. Although higher presidential
   approval ratings offer the president more positive news coverage on both
   networks, Latino support for President Obama does not encourage mostly
   positive coverage of immigration coverage on Spanish-language news.
   ConclusionPresidents can expect less negative coverage on
   Spanish-language news, but not necessarily on immigration policy, an
   issue of central importance to the Latino community.},

Abstract = {This paper asks empirically the question about potential nonlinearities
   in the relationship between political competition and economic growth in
   global perspective. Kernel estimation is employed to analyze this link
   using cross-sectional data for the time span 1988-2007. To take into
   account the mix of categorical and continuous data types encountered
   here, I apply the generalized product kernel approach. Across various
   measures of political competition, the findings do suggest the presence
   of nonlinearities, and indicate a differential impact on growth for the
   various components of political competition. (C) 2014 Published by

Abstract = {In response to the Current economic crisis, many countries around the
   world adopted large fiscal stimuli, thus reviving the question of fiscal
   multipliers. This paper is a first attempt for a systematic analysis of
   the behaviour of fiscal multipliers in the Eurozone countries. Using
   Panel Vector Auto Regressive (PVAR) estimations for quarterly data on
   fiscal variables for the 1999-2012 period, we unveil several interesting
   results. First, tax multipliers are little affected by being a Eurozone
   country or not, or by experiencing the Eurozone crisis. Second, on the
   contrary, spending multipliers exhibit major differences depending on
   the considered group of countries; in particular, being part of the
   Eurozone or expecting to adopt the Euro in the future makes the response
   of output to expenditure shocks more Keynesian, as this is also the case
   in the group of Eurozone countries affected by the crisis.},

Abstract = {Recent world events have highlighted the democratic potential of
   information and communication technologies. This article draws upon the
   democracy literature to develop a multilevel conceptual framework that
   links country-level Internet penetration and individual-level Internet
   use to citizen attitudes about governance in 34 developing countries. In
   doing so, it deconstructs Internet penetration into three
   dimensionshardware (e.g., computers), users, and broadbandto provide
   greater theoretical specificity about how Internet diffusion leads
   citizens to adopt democratic attitudes. Results from multilevel analyses
   indicate that individual Internet use and the diffusion of Internet
   hardware shape citizens' perceptions of the supply of democracy in their
   countries, and individual Internet use and diffusion of broadband lead
   citizens to adopt stronger democratic preferences. Theoretical and
   normative implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {The impact of the fragmentation of executive and legislative bodies on
   the level and composition of government expenditure is a feature of
   politics that has attracted considerable attention from economists.
   However, previous authors have abstracted from two important concepts:
   ideology and intra-party politics. In this paper, we account for these
   two phenomena explicitly, and make two main contributions. First, we
   show that both intra- and inter-party ideological dispersion matter in
   explaining the level of sub-national public spending. Therefore, it is
   improper to consider parties as monolithic entities. We also show that
   ideological dispersion matters especially for current expenditures, and
   not so much for investment expenditures. To do so, we construct a panel
   database (2003-2010) comprising data from a survey that quantifies the
   policy preferences of party members who were candidates in Swiss
   elections.},

Abstract = {After decades of debate, a void still exists in the literature and
   socio-political dialog related to the unrestricted and unbiased
   inclusion of women in the military. The issue remains so highly charged
   that a fresh theoretical framework is necessary to accurately align the
   physical and social constraints in which military women serve. Offered
   here are findings of an exploratory study framed within a synthesis of
   evolutionary psychological and sociological theory. Distinction between
   the word equivalent as opposed to equal is critical in recognizing the
   physicality, skills, and talents both males and females bring to their
   Marine Corps experience. Qualitative data obtained from 67 female Marine
   Staff Non-commissioned Officers, Warrant Officers, and commissioned
   officers describe tactics to achieve levels of operational competency,
   respect, trust, and success in the Marine Corps. An achievable goal, the
   successful woman must manage her physicality, sexuality, and femininity
   adeptly to achieve the trust and confidence of her male as well as
   female colleagues.},

Abstract = {Hydro-political dependencies between countries are widely regarded as
   having important implications for international water cooperation and
   conflict. Quantitative ex-post empirical research on the subject so far
   uses very simple characterizations of international river geography to
   proxy for such dependencies, though. The authors developed a new
   geo-spatial dataset for water catchments worldwide. This dataset
   combines elevation models, flow accumulation approaches, hydrological
   data, and data on international boundaries to generate more precise and
   nuanced measures of hydro-political dependencies among riparian
   countries. The paper discusses these measurement concepts, illustrates
   how dependencies are distributed worldwide, and revisits three prominent
   quantitative studies on the issue to show how using improved data
   affects empirical findings. In contrast to a very popular presumption,
   upstream downstream dependencies turn out to have a very small to
   insignificant effect on international water cooperation or conflict. (C)

Title = {Support for Repealing Prohibition: An Analysis of State-Wide Referenda
   on Ratifying the 21st Amendment},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {95},
Number = {3},
Pages = {636-651},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objectives. The 21st Amendment to the U. S. Constitution repealing
   national prohibition is the only amendment ratified by state conventions
   rather than state legislatures. The referenda held to select delegates
   for these conventions offer a promising source of data for identifying
   determinants of support for prohibition repeal. Methods. We use various
   proxy measures to determine the importance of economic, political, and
   demographic forces in motivating support for electing pro-repeal
   delegate slates to state ratifying conventions. Results. Urbanization,
   per-capita income, percentage of Catholics, and support for the
   Democratic Party were correlated with support for prohibition repeal.
   Neither the percentage of evangelical denominations, gender
   distribution, nor foreign-born population appeared to significantly
   influence referenda returns. Conclusions. This study confirms the
   conventional understanding regarding Catholic opposition to prohibition
   and higher income areas' support for repeal. The findings also indicate
   that congressional backers of repeal were correct in calculating that
   submitting the 21st Amendment to popularly elected state conventions,
   rather than rural-dominated state legislatures, would improve the
   chances of ratification. Moreover, support for repeal among-Democratic
   congress members and party leaders appears to have extended to
   rank-and-file Democratic voters as well.},

Abstract = {We show that actively stabilizing economic activity plays a more
   prominent role in the conduct of monetary policy when potential output
   is subject to hysteresis. We augment a basic New Keynesian model by
   hysteresis in potential output and contrast simulation outcomes of this
   extended model to the standard model. We find that considering
   hysteresis allows for a more realistic amplification of macroeconomic
   shocks and persistent movements in output after monetary shocks. Our
   central policy implication of active output gap stabilization arises
   from stability analyses and welfare considerations.},

Abstract = {This paper decomposes movements of real GDP and unemployment rate
   between permanent shocks and transitory shocks. We use a bivariate
   unobserved components model on four big European countries (Germany,
   France, Italy and United Kingdom) with quarterly data since 1970. Our
   model allows for explicit correlation between transitory and permanents
   shocks and structural breaks in the permanent components of real GDP and
   unemployment. The results show that movements in real GDP and
   unemployment rate are explained by permanent movements rather than
   transitory movements. Conversely, we find that transitory movements
   explain overall fluctuations in Germany.},

Abstract = {According to recently influential conceptions of public reasoning,
   citizens have the right to demand of each other public justifications'
   for controversial political action. On this view, only arguments that
   all reasonable citizens can affirm from within their diverse ethical
   standpoints can count as legitimate justifications for political action.
   Both proponents and critics often assume that the case for this
   expectation derives from the special justificatory burden created by the
   systematically coercive character of political action. This paper
   challenges that assumption. While conceding that citizens who propose to
   deploy the coercive apparatus of the state to enforce controversial
   legislation owe their fellows a justification that overcomes the strong
   presumption against coercing agents, it denies that this consideration
   can explain why public justifications are also required. Having argued
   that the public justification requirement is not among the justification
   conditions for public coercion, the paper then proposes an alternative
   rationale for the expectation that political action be publicly
   justified. On this alternative, the case for the public justification
   requirement depends on democratic citizens' standing as legislative
   co-authors, and not on considerations having to do with their liability
   as private individuals to coercion at the hands of the state.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the interplay between public education expenditure
   and economic growth in a twe-sector model with manufactured goods and
   services. When public education is financed by sectoral taxes, the
   education policy maximizing the growth rate differs from that obtained
   by the standard unisectoral tax. The reasons for this are twofold.
   First, because agents' preferences for services, human capital and
   savings become a major determinant of the relationship between growth
   and public education expenditure. Second, because education spending is
   a service and hence sectoral taxation creates a distortion by affecting
   its relative price. Finally, we reveal that a sectoral tax may perform
   better than a standard aggregate production tax in terms of long-term
   growth.},

Abstract = {Retrospective questions from recent surveys let us estimate rates of
   church attendance among children and their parents in ten Western
   democracies throughout most of the 20th century. We combine these time
   series with standard sources to test competing theories of religious
   change. Although our attendance estimates affirm the prevalence of
   religious decline, our statistical tests offer no support for
   traditional theories of secularization (which link decline to changes in
   income, education, industrialization, urbanization, and family life).
   Nor can we attribute much of the observed decline to growth in the
   welfare state. But increased school spending by governments does reduce
   church attendance, and this effect is not the result of greater
   educational attainment. In shaping the content of schooling, governments
   may strongly influence long-run religious trends.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the link between the diffusion of news and spending
   decisions. We exploit a dataset of Italian Regions from 1984 to 2008,
   approximate the spread of information with the diffusion of newspapers,
   and estimate the effect of the news before and after 1995. In fact, in
   the mid-90s two reforms introduced the direct election of the governor,
   autonomous taxing powers and incentives for fiscal discipline at the
   regional level in Italy. We test the following hypotheses, derived from
   the theoretical literature: 1) the diffusion of newspapers affects
   public expenditures close to elections; 2) the more newspapers are
   diffused, the larger is the reduction of the electoral cycle; 3) before
   the reform were implemented, the diffusion of newspapers constrained the
   increased size of expenditures by reducing the positive variation of
   capital expenditures; 4) after the reform were implemented, the
   diffusion of newspapers leaves unaffected the size of expenditures by
   reducing both the positive variation of capital expenditures and the
   negative variation of current expenditures. The empirical analysis
   confirms the expectations; the results, moreover, are robust to
   alternative categorizations of the press and indicate a larger
   effectiveness of the diffusion of local press. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {The level of competence that voters attribute to different candidates is
   an important determinant of election results. In addition, it is
   observed that some candidates tend to be more ambiguous in their
   campaigns regarding future plans, while others commit to specific
   policies. We offer a model where politicians who vary in their level of
   competence compete by making costly campaign declarations. We show that
   a separating equilibrium exists in which the ambiguity of a candidate's
   campaign declaration reveals her level of competence. The model explains
   how politicians may use an ``issue{''}-based campaign to create a
   competent image, and provides an additional explanation for different
   levels of campaign ambiguity.},

   are unlikely to be pivotal; hence, their expressive utility, even if

Journal = {EUROPEAN HISTORY QUARTERLY},

Volume = {44},

Abstract = {Although historians of modern literacy acknowledge the presence of
   scribes', they leave several questions unanswered: Who had recourse to
   scribes'? For what specific purposes did delegated writing take place?
   Who were the scribes'? What was their relationship with authors? In
   offering some answers, I draw on what we already know about delegated
   writing in nineteenth and early twentieth-century Europe, supplemented
   by original research on the writing of ordinary people in the First
   World War and in the age of mass migration. In identifying the main
   types of delegated writing - namely, the local notable, the family
   member or close colleague and the professional writer - I stress the
   power of the writer. Delegated writing was not a mechanical process of
   dictation, but a collaborative project, in which the scribe' deployed
   stock phrases, censored and gave advice. Calling on a scribe' inevitably
   implied a partial surrender of authorial autonomy. In conclusion, I
   outline ways in which the scribe' has made a comeback since the late
   twentieth century.},

Abstract = {In three experiments, participants completed an Information-Choice
   Questionnaire (ICQ) in which the aggregation level of information about
   the consequences of two policy options was manipulated. The results
   indicate that evaluations of consequences are more extreme when
   consequences are split into separately to be evaluated components rather
   than presented as one whole. The aggregation level further affects
   overall evaluations of options and choices between options. Aggregation
   level effects are observed for both conventional rating scales
   (Experiment 1) and magnitude estimation scales (Experiment 2). The
   effects are strongest when consequences are lengthy and multifaceted,
   but also occur for short and simple consequences (Experiment 3). We

Abstract = {A descriptive norm is a behavioral rule that individuals follow when
   their empirical expectations of others following the same rule are met.
   We aim to provide an account of the emergence of descriptive norms by
   first looking at a simple case, that of the standing ovation. We examine
   the structure of a standing ovation, and show it can be generalized to
   describe the emergence of a wide range of descriptive norms.},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {18},
Pages = {547-568},
Abstract = {This chapter reviews the major lines of research on five prominent
   concepts of political communication research linked to the cognitive
   effects of political mass media: Knowledge gains and gaps, cultivation,
   agenda setting, priming, and framing. Basic ideas, typical
   methodologies, key findings and the cognitive processes behind the
   concepts are discussed in detail, common conceptual roots are
   identified, and key methodological challenges are highlighted. Finally,
   some of the overlaps and differences between the approaches are
   discussed in order to take a step toward a more integrative and coherent
   view of cognitive media effects in political communication. The chapter
   argues that both empirical and theoretical advances are needed to get to
   a better and less fragmented understanding of cognitive media effects in
   political communication.},

Abstract = {The law in a liberal state is often a violent instrument. So said Robert
   Cover. Among those communities to which the law has been particular
   cruel are Native Americans. Indeed, the traditions and practices of
   Native American tribes have spawned rich and fascinating narratives.
   Each tribe has created its own ``nomos - its own normative universe{''}
   - with a distinct set of rules, expectations, and tenets. Even still,
   the state and federal governments have historically challenged Native
   American traditions and culture with various legal and judicial
   policies. Insofar as the state-imposed law is blunt and imprecise,
   certain Native American narratives are thus threatened. Over the past
   decade, several judicial cases have highlighted the clash between the
   state's imperial authority and Native American narratives. Our chapter
   explores these court cases with an eye to the inevitable conflicts that
   emerge when law exists uneasily in a liberal state.},

Abstract = {US state and local public employee retirement systems (PERS) utilise
   various models of contract with distinctive features in their form and
   substantive content in relation to industry norms. These models differ
   between states, within states, and even between PERS within major
   metropolitan areas. Diversity goes against expectations to the effect
   that the sector relies upon commonly accepted investment management
   agreements (IMAs), given the similarities between state and local PERS
   as to the nature of pension benefits. One goal of this paper is to
   account for apparent commonalities and differences. Another goal of the
   paper is to explain the nature and significance of the pre-contract
   screening of potential suppliers to the sector, suggesting that requests
   for proposals tend to `sterilise' contracts for investment management
   services. We provide a comparison of the categories and items evident in
   model IMAs with reference to selected states, in particular Illinois and
   the Chicago-area PERS. We also briefly note relevant provisions of
   pending legislation establishing the Oregon Investment Corporation,
   emphasising provisions which would enable the fund to make contracts
   like its private sector peers. The paper concludes that it is important
   to focus on the process of contracting in the US state and local PERS as
   well as the form of contract.},

Abstract = {This chapter explores how scholars have conceptualized the relationship
   between Latin American populism and democracy. It analyzes different
   approaches to populism such as modernization and dependency theory, and
   current approaches that focus on discourse analysis and/or political
   strategies. The chapter focuses on the current wave of radical populism
   to explore the continuities and differences between ``classical{''}
   populism of leaders such as Juan Peron, the ``neopopulism{''} of Alberto
   Fujimori, and the radical populism of Hugo Chavez, Evo Morales, and

Booktitle = {FOUCAULT ON THE POLITICS OF PARRHESIA},
Series = {Palgrave Pivot},
Year = {2014},
Pages = {84-101},
Abstract = {Parrhesia is instrumental to sustain the autonomy of politics by
   bracketing religious dogma, social stratification and expert knowledge
   as the basis for decision-making by setting up a pact that binds the
   individual to his/her statement and the authorities to the community to
   assure their accountability and trustworthiness. The idea that underpins
   the autonomy of politics and democracy is that truth and a meritocratic
   principle of ascendency are two sides of the same coin. Democracy and
   parrhesia condition each other, but democracy might be undermined by the
   negative parrhesia of flattery and manipulation, which undermines
   democratic governing, as political power no longer unfolds in agonistic
   encounters. Hence, the tightrope balance between good and bad parrhesia
   illustrates the ambitious but fragile nature of democracy.},

Abstract = {This note offers reflections on qualified market access (QMA)-the
   practice of linking trade agreements to values such as human rights,
   labour standards, or environmental protection. This idea has been
   suggested by political theorists as a way of fulfilling our duties to
   the global poor and of making the global economic system more just, and
   it has influenced a number of concrete policies, such as European Union
   (EU) trade policies. Yet, in order to assess its merits tout court,
   different perspectives and disciplines need to be brought together, such
   as international law, economics, political science, and philosophy. It
   is also worth reflecting on existing practices, such as those of the EU.
   This note summarises some insights about QMA by drawing such research
   together and considers the areas in which further research is needed,
   whilst reflecting also on the merits of interdisciplinary exchanges on
   such topics.},

Abstract = {Spiral-of-silence theory assumes that a monolithic stream of messages
   from mainstream media, leaving little ability for audiences to seek
   ideologically congruent news, affects people's perceptions of the
   distribution of opinion in society. While these assumptions may have
   been valid when Noelle-Neumann developed her theory forty years ago, the
   new media landscape, characterized by the proliferation of ideological
   media outlets, makes them seem outdated. Do audiences of
   conservative-leaning media perceive a conservative opinion climate while
   audiences of liberal-leaning media perceive a more liberal distribution
   of opinion? And if so, what are the consequences? We examine these
   questions using two data sets collected in extremely different contexts
   (Study 1 in the context of the 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza, n =
   519; Study 2, in the context of the 2004 U.S. presidential elections
   using the National Annenberg Election Survey, n = 9,058). In both
   studies, selective exposure to ideological media outlets was associated
   with opinion climate perceptions that were biased in the direction of
   the media outlets' ideologies. In Study 2, we also demonstrated that
   partisan selective exposure indirectly contributes to political
   polarization, and that this effect is mediated by opinion climate
   perceptions.},

Abstract = {When do parties take over the media's issue attention in parliament?
   Scholarly work has shown that the mass media's influence over the
   political agenda is conditional, yet only recently scholars started to
   consider the active role of parties and their strategic incentives in
   responding to the media. This article argues that parties only respond
   to media attention if the issue is framed in the party's terms, as the
   right framing helps the party attain its policy goals. This argument is
   supported by pooled time-series analyses of the issue of European
   integration and the issue of immigration in Sweden and the Netherlands
   over the period 1995 to 2010. Altogether, the study contributes to our
   understanding of the strategic incentives and options parties have in
   responding to the media, as well as to our knowledge of the role of
   framing in political competition.},

Abstract = {The study of new media use by transnational social movements is central
   to contemporary investigations of social contention. In order to shed
   light on the terrain in which the most recent examples of online
   mobilization have grown and developed, this paper combines the interest
   in the transnational dynamics of social contention and the exploration
   of the use of new information and communication technologies (ICTs) for
   protest action. In specific terms, the study investigates how early
   twenty-first century social movement coalitions used Internet tools to
   build symbolically transnational collective identities. By applying a
   hyperlink network analysis approach, the study focuses on a website
   network generated by local chapters of the World Social Forum (WSF), one
   of the earliest social movement coalitions for global justice. The
   sample network, selected through snowball sampling, is composed of 222
   social forum websites from around the world. The study specifically
   looks at hyperlinks among social forum websites as signs of belonging
   and potential means of alliance. The analysis uses network measures,
   namely of cohesion, centrality, structural equivalence and homophily, to
   test dynamics of symbolic collective identification underlying the WSF
   coalition. The findings show that in early twenty-first century
   transnational contention, culture and place still played a central role
   in the emergence of transnational movement networks.},

Abstract = {Against the backdrop of the international political and economic
   system's increasing fragmentation, this article attempts to analyse the
   geopolitical ambitions of the EU. Currently, the EU strives to become an
   independent global power. For this purpose, the EU tries to establish
   greater independence from the US and, to a certain degree, from its
   Member states. This is closely linked to (a) the emergence of the Euro
   as a currency competing with the US dollar for the status of the `global
   reserve currency' and (b) the construction of a common foreign and
   `security' policy. Taking the German literature on the political economy
   of the state and on the European Integration, insights from
   neo-Gramscian International Political Economy, and the `scale debate' in
   Anglophone geography as point of departure, I analyse the European
   ensemble of state apparatuses and demonstrate that these ambitions have
   failed, due to the status quo of a fragmented Europe.},

Abstract = {Do district incumbents in an election have an advantage, and if so, do
   these advantages depend on which party is in government? We estimate the
   incumbency effect for the direct district candidates in German federal
   and state elections using a regression discontinuity design (RDD). When
   studying the heterogeneity in these effects, we find that incumbents
   from both large parties, the center-right CDU and the center-left SPD,
   have an advantage only if the SPD is in government. This effect is
   robust and shows even in state elections that are unrelated to federal
   elections. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the efficiency of equilibria in a multilateral
   bargaining game in which a legislature divides its budget among
   collective and particularistic goods. In order to disentangle the causes
   of inefficiency, we extend the model of Volden and Wiseman (Am Polit Sci
   Rev 101:79-92, 2007) by considering quasi-linear utility functions, and
   consensus requirements ranging from simple majority to unanimity.
   Although unanimous agreements can be reached under weaker consensus
   requirements, we show that (Pareto) inefficiency is associated with
   non-unanimous consent. We also study how (i) the endogenous selection of
   the legislature's size or (ii) a sequential choice of collective and
   particularistic spending eliminates or attenuates the inefficiency
   problem.},

Abstract = {Objectives. This article examines the extent to which individual-level
   determinants of environmental concern in underdeveloped economies differ
   from those in advanced economies. Methods. To measure environmental
   concern, I use survey responses to environmental questions asked in 40
   countries from the 2005-2008 wave of the World Values Survey. My
   econometric analysis tests the extent to which individual-level
   determinants of environmental concern are conditional upon the level of
   national economic development. Results. I find that proxies for
   objective environmental problems do not explain environmental concern at
   any level of development. Furthermore, in both advanced and
   underdeveloped economies, environmental concern is determined by
   subjective value orientations, but the effect is stronger in the
   advanced economies. Conclusions. The findings reinforce the notion that
   environmentalism is value driven and support a generalized
   interpretation of postmaterialism in which the relevance of subjective
   values for explaining environmental concern increases as countries
   develop.},

Abstract = {Climate change is projected to have very severe impacts on future
   generations. Given this, any adequate response to it has to consider the
   nature of our obligations to future generations. This paper seeks to do
   that and to relate this to the way that inter-generational justice is
   often framed by economic analyses of climate change. To do this the
   paper considers three kinds of considerations that, it has been argued,
   should guide the kinds of actions that one generation should take if it
   is to treat both current and future people equitably. In particular it
   examines the case for what has been termed pure time discounting, growth
   discounting and opportunity cost discounting; and it assesses their
   implications for climate policy. It argues that none of these support
   the claims of those who think they give us reason to delay aggressive
   mitigation policies. It also finds, however, that the second kind of
   argument can, in certain circumstances, provide support for passing on
   some of the costs of mitigation to future generations.},

Title = {Conflicting messages? The IPCC on conflict and human security},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {43},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {82-90},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Violence seems to be on a long-term decline in the international system.
   The possibility that climate change would create more violent conflict
   was mentioned in scattered places in the Third and Fourth Assessment
   Reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),
   published in 2001 and 2007 respectively. The empirical literature
   testing for relationships between climate change and various forms of
   conflict has undergone a major expansion since then. The report from
   Working Group II of the Fifth Assessment Report contains a much more
   careful assessment of the climate change-conflict nexus. The Human
   security chapter reports high agreement and robust evidence that human
   security will be progressively threatened as the climate changes. But as
   far as the impact on armed conflict is concerned, it paints a balanced
   picture, concluding that while individual studies vary in their
   conclusions, `collectively the research does not conclude that there is
   a strong positive relationship between warming and armed conflict'. The
   chapter also argues that climate change is likely to have an influence
   on some known drivers of conflict, and this point is reiterated in other
   chapters as well as the Technical summary and the Summary for
   policymakers. A chapter on `Emergent trends ...' has a somewhat more
   dramatic conclusion regarding a climate-conflict link, as does the
   Africa chapter, while a methods chapter on `Detection and attribution'
   dismisses the climate-change-to-violence link. The entire report is
   suffused with terms like `may', `has the potential to', and other
   formulations without any indication of a level of probability. Overall,
   the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC does not support the view that
   climate change is an important threat to the long-term waning of war.
   Still, the report opens up for conflicting interpretations and overly
   alarmist media translations. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Climate change has been successfully represented as a security concern
   to such an extent that it is firmly established on the political agenda,
   even though the implementation of concrete policies is disputed. In this
   paper, we develop an analytical framework to better trace the process of
   securitising climate change and assess its normative implications. We
   establish a typology of six climate security discourses on the basis of
   two dimensions: three levels of referent objects and two logics of
   securitisation, one that corresponds to the original Copenhagen School
   framework and one where the threat takes the form of the invocation of
   risk. We find that there are significant differences in the relative
   importance of the resulting climate security discourses in Germany and
   the US, but that normatively, all discourses come with their own
   problems, which calls for more detailed scrutiny and assessment of
   climate security discourses and their political effects.},

Abstract = {This article offers a sustained examination of how the vicissitudes of
   the Cold War shaped changing interpretations of the Spanish Civil War in
   Britain. Considering the perspectives of participants and historians, it
   focuses on the diverse strands of the Left that frequently drew on the
   civil war to attack each other and to make wider arguments about the
   global Cold War. First, with the aim of criticizing Communist take-overs
   in Eastern Europe in the late 1940s, the article analyzes retrospective
   assaults on Communist party tactics and Soviet foreign policy in Spain.
   Second, in order to argue that the Soviet Union took a
   counter-revolutionary line after 1956, it investigates the re-emergence
   of debates over the Spanish revolution. Third, to express disapproval of
   the United States, it examines the increasing use of the civil war as an
   analogy in Cold War international affairs from the 1960s. Fourth, in
   support of non-Soviet Left-of-Centre collaboration, most notably
   Eurocommunism in the 1970s and opposition to Margaret Thatcher's
   Conservative government in the 1980s, it considers the renewed emphasis
   on the popular front. The trajectories of these debates reveal that,
   over time, the weight of the Left's criticism moved from the Soviet
   Union towards the United States.},

Abstract = {We study the interdependence between campaign contributions, the
   candidates' positions, and electoral outcomes. In our model, a candidate
   who moves away from his firmly established position towards a more risky
   one generates costs for the voters. Campaign contributions allow the
   candidates to reduce these mobility costs. We show that if donations
   were prohibited, then a unique equilibrium regarding the position
   choices of candidates would exist. With unrestricted financing of
   political campaigns, two equilibria emerge, depending on whether a
   majority of interest groups runs to support the leftist or rightist
   candidate. Interest groups may finance candidates whose position is far
   away from their own ideal point. The equilibria generate a variety of
   new features of campaign games, and may help identify the objective
   functions of candidates empirically.},

Abstract = {Shame has been heavily relied on as a political tool in the modern world
   and yet it is still a much under-historicised emotion. Using the
   examples of early twentieth-century Britain and Ireland, I examine how
   women opposed to the campaign for female suffrage used shame
   instrumentally in their writing. Exploring the versatility of this
   political device, I find that shame was used with the oppositional
   intentions of binding and excluding. Whereas British conservatives used
   it to protect an already well-established imagined community of good
   imperial women, Irish radicals drew on it to invite women to take part
   in the construction of a new nationalist sisterhood. This paper further
   problematizes claims that as an emotion that plays on a sense of the
   communal, shame has had no place in a highly individualistic modern
   world.},

Abstract = {Religion is becoming an increasingly important factor for theorists and
   policy makers alike in the consideration of United States foreign
   policy. In recent years a new school of faith-based diplomacy advocacy
   has emerged and begun to resonate with foreign policy practitioners.
   This article examines the efficacy of such faith-based approaches to
   foreign policy problems with a religious component and argues that such
   an approach is inherently flawed. The article argues that a combination
   of a distinct military culture, which feels itself morally superior to
   its civilian leadership and the activism of conservative evangelicals in
   the chaplaincy and military leadership makes such faith-based approaches
   unrealistic. While acknowledging a role for pluralist religious actors
   in foreign policy the article rejects a faith-based advocacy approach
   which can exacerbate rather than resolve foreign policy problems.},

Abstract = {Objective. The relationship between beliefs about the cause of
   homosexuality, political and religious ideology, and attitudes toward
   same-sex unions in the United States is unclear. This study aims to
   examine the mediating influence and socially embedded nature of
   attribution beliefs at a time when attitudes toward same-sex unions are
   undergoing substantial changes in the American public. Method. This
   study employs simultaneous equation path models and a recent national,
   random sample of American adults (Baylor Religion Survey 2010) to test
   each hypothesis. Results. Results reveal that constructed opinions about
   the origin and controllability of homosexuality significantly influence
   support for same-sex unions. However, these opinions are socially
   embedded, especially within particular political and religious
   ideologies. Conclusion. These findings highlight that while widespread
   changes in beliefs about the cause of homosexuality may presage shifts
   in support for same-sex unions, many will be able to resist those shifts
   toward support, possibly leading to their further marginalization within
   society.},

Abstract = {Empirical research reports conflicting conclusions about whether primary
   election voters strategically account for candidates' general election
   prospects when casting their votes. We model the strategic calculations
   of office-seeking candidates facing two-stage elections beginning with a
   primary, and we compare candidates' policy strategies in situations
   where primary voters strategically support the most viable general
   election candidate against candidate strategies when voters expressively
   support their preferred primary candidate regardless of electability.
   Our analyses-in which the candidates' appeal is based on their policy
   positions and their campaigning skills-suggest a surprising conclusion:
   namely, that strategic and expressive primary voting typically support
   identical equilibrium configurations in candidate strategies. Our
   conclusions are relevant to candidates facing contested primaries, and
   also to political parties facing the strategic decision about whether or
   not to use primary elections to select their candidates-a common dilemma
   for Latin American (and some European) parties.},

Abstract = {This paper contrasts empirically two possible explanations for the party
   decision to use primaries: desire to improve political selection
   (selection effect), or desire to increase political competition-and
   incentives-among candidates (incentive effect). Using a simple model of
   endogenous primaries, I show that each explanation implies a different
   relation between primary adoption and the strength of partisan support.
   I estimate this relation using the case of Latin American presidential
   primaries and find robust evidence that the incentive effect dominates
   the selection effect.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveWe advance social disorganization theory by examining homicides
   disaggregated by motive and gang relation and by using data from El
   Paso, Texasa predominantly Latino city with high levels of immigration
   and poverty.
   MethodsWe analyze homicide data from the El Paso Police Department's
   detective logs, 1985-1995, as well as data from the 1990 U.S. Decennial
   Census.
   ResultsKey measures of social disorganization tend to be associated with
   homicide but these relationships vary across type of homicide.
   Immigration and percent African American show no connection with any
   homicide measure, while percent Latino is only positively associated
   with gang-related homicides.
   ConclusionOverall, social disorganization is useful in understanding
   homicide in El Paso, but race/ethnicity and immigration do not operate
   as predicted. These results add important knowledge to a growing
   literature regarding the neighborhood-level associations between
   immigration, Latinos, and crime.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {34},
Pages = {206-221},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We apply a procedurally fair rule to a situation where people disagree
   about the value of three alternatives in the way captured by the voting
   paradox. The rule allows people to select a final collective ranking by
   submitting a bid vector with six components (the six possible rankings
   of the three alternatives). We test experimentally the robustness of the
   rule to subsidies and taxes as well as to tie-breaking assumptions. We
   have two main results. First, the most frequently chosen ranking is the
   socially efficient one when ties are broken in favor of the alternative
   generating the highest social welfare, but not when ties are broken
   randomly. Second, subsidies slightly enhance overbidding. Furthermore,
   an analysis of individual bid vectors reveals interesting behavioral
   regularities that result from selfishness, other-regarding preferences,
   and indifference. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The limits of tax and expenditure limits: TEL implementation as a
   principal-agent problem},
Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {159},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {485-501},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Previous scholarship has shown that Tax and Expenditure Limits (TELs)
   often fail to constrain government growth. This paper views the
   implementation of TELs as a principal-agent problem. Agency theory
   predicts that delegation is affected by the preferences of agents and
   the costs of monitoring those agents. Using panel data for the US states
   from 1970 through 2008, I conduct an empirical test of the validity of
   the principal-agent model for TELs. I find that state spending
   limitations are only effective at cutting the growth of state and local
   spending under the direction of agents who have a preference for limited
   government. Additionally, state property tax limitations are only
   effective when monitoring does not require costly coordinated action.
   These findings contradict an alternative theory of TEL implementation
   that looks towards the policy's origin. My research suggests that the
   arrangements of delegation determine when and under what conditions TELs
   effectively reduce government growth.},

Title = {``Characteristically Generous{''}? Australian Responses to Refugees
   Prior to 1951},

Abstract = {When Australia pledged to accept 15,000 Jewish refugees from Europe in
   1938, it was applauded by the London Times as a characteristically
   generous contribution and an example for others. Australia's reputation
   for generous humanitarianism was solidified after the war when it
   absorbed more than 180,000 of Europe's Displaced Persons and committed
   to international human rights instruments designed to protect refugees
   and asylum seekers. This reputation has been used to both defend and
   critique the nation's contemporary responses to asylum seekers. Recent
   Australian Prime Ministers have invoked Australia's proud record of
   refugee resettlement to deflect criticism of their tough border control
   policies, policies which critics charge repudiate the nation's
   humanitarian traditions. This article critically reviews the history of
   Australia's responses to refugees and asylum seekers prior to 1951 and
   demonstrates that contemporary border control policies are neither a
   deviation from, nor defence of, a proud humanitarian record. Rather,
   they embody the migration management approach to refugees that provided
   impetus for Federation in 1901, governed Australia's response to the
   Jewish refugee crisis in the 1930s, and shaped its conditional
   acceptance of the Displaced Persons and the position it adopted in the
   drafting of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of
   Refugees in 1951.},

Abstract = {We examine the constitutional design required for democratic societies
   to overcome poverty traps. Restricting agenda setting by ensuring
   subsistence levels of consumption and applying simple majority voting as
   a decision rule will not enable a society to overcome poverty. We show
   that a combination of suitable constitutional rules can, however,
   overcome poverty and induce economic well-being. Besides majority
   voting, these rules include rotating agenda setting, agenda repetition,
   and tax-protection rules. We thus highlight the crucial role of
   democratic institutions for economic development.},

Abstract = {The success of Spain's transformation from a dictatorship to a stable
   democracy has triggered a lively discussion about the factors which
   contributed to the process. The question of civic participation in
   Spain's political transformation has proved highly controversial and I
   suggest that observing professional domains and their implications for
   citizen formation processes provides a new way to evaluate the civic
   contribution to Spain's democratization. Spanish teachers mobilized in
   the 1970s around two main issues: their working conditions and
   pedagogical methods. This article focuses on the implications of their
   common struggle to articulate, construct and disseminate democratic
   citizenship. It shows how they contributed to free deliberation, civic
   involvement and citizen empowerment, aspiring to supplement the concept
   of citizenship with those of active participation in community
   organizations, knowledge of governmental procedures, critical assessment
   of social, political and economic structures and addressing areas of
   injustice.},

Abstract = {This note amends the model of informational lobbying presented in
   Potters and van Winden (Public Choice 74:269-292, 1992). In the original
   article, the authors find that only separating and pooling equilibria

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {33},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We analyze the effect of ``milestones{''} on reaching a long-term
   target, which if missed implies dramatic payoff risks. In our
   experiment, a cumulative threshold public goods game, milestones are
   captured by intermediate contribution targets on the way to the final
   target. Missing the final target leads to a probabilistic total loss for
   all players, and missing intermediate targets may lead to the same
   consequences even earlier. The additional intermediate targets feature
   environmental protection as a process rather than a contest for reaching
   a final target. The regulating agency is Nature, although political
   agencies might implement a similar regulation. We test milestone effects
   by varying the size of milestones in addition to changing the marginal
   productivity of individual contributions and the payoff risk. Although
   we observe some milestone effects, additional regulation by milestones
   on its own does not guarantee that targets are reached. (C) 2013

Abstract = {This article considers how much outside influence matters to the
   constitutional analysis of state politics. It defends the political
   community principle applied in Bluman v. Federal Election Comm'n as an
   exception to the otherwise universal speaker-neutrality rule of Citizens
   United v. Federal Election Comm'n. It draws parallels between efforts to
   police national and state boundaries in politics, and the competing
   rights claims of outsiders to cross those boundaries and participate
   fully in domestic politics. The article suggests that the structural
   constitutional principle of political community supports certain state
   regulations of outside influence across a range of political activities.
   Part I reviews the structural and historical basis for the
   constitutional concern about outside influence. Part II considers the
   gnarled doctrinal roots of Bluman, and how they might help support
   state, as well as national, safeguards against outside influence. Part
   III proposes an important state interest in regulating, but not
   excluding, outside influence in state and local politics, and suggests
   some applications of the principle to outside influence in several
   spheres of political activity.},

Abstract = {The aim of the paper is to study the impact of emotions on monetary
   donation to pro-environmental causes and more precisely whether emotions
   could reinforce intrinsic motivations. We design a three-stage
   laboratory experiment. Firstly, participants have the possibility to get
   an endowment from an effort game. Secondly, emotions are induced to the
   participants. Thirdly, participants play a dictator game where the
   recipient is an environmental Non-Governmental Organization (NGO). In
   line. with the functional theory in psychology, we show that two
   positive emotions with similar valence but of different sort
   ({''}Amusement{''} and ``Awe{''}) impact significantly pro-environmental
   behavior in opposite ways regarding individuals' generosity towards
   environmental NGOs. Moreover, we show that ``Awe{''} reinforces
   intrinsic motivations.},

Abstract = {Political actors today seek to influence labor mobility via education
   just as they have for centuries. Landowners in countries with large
   industrial sectors attempt to suppress education levels to maintain
   their labor supply, as educated workers are able to move into industrial
   work more easily than uneducated workers. However, the relationship
   between large landowners and education is more complex than has been
   previously theorized. Using a specific-factors model, I show that large
   landowners in countries with little economic development actually have
   an incentive to increase education levels. They realize the returns of
   an educated workforce without fearing their mobility because competing
   industrial opportunities for the workers do not exist. In either case,
   the ability of landowners to achieve their political goals is a function
   of their ability to overcome the collective action problem and
   effectively influence the state's provision of education. Powerful
   landowners successfully deny education in industrialized countries and
   provide it in agricultural countries. An analysis of panel data covering
   77 countries from 1975 to 2000 confirms the conditional nature of the
   relationship.},

Abstract = {Condorcet's paradox occurs when there is no alternative that beats every
   other alternative by majority. The paradox may pose real problems to
   democratic decision making such as decision deadlocks and democratic
   paralysis. However, its relevance has been discussed again and again
   since the celebrated works of Arrow (Social choice and individual
   values, 1963) and Black (The theory of committees and elections, 1958).
   The discussion varies from one extreme to the other: from very relevant
   to practically irrelevant. This paper tries to bring more clarity to the
   discussion by reviewing the literature on the empirical relevance of
   Condorcet's paradox. Since a definition of the paradox for even numbers
   of voters and alternatives, and for weak voter preferences is missing in
   the literature, we first define the paradox clearly and simply. Then,
   three topics are investigated, namely domain conditions, culture and the
   likelihood of the paradox, and the empirical detection of the paradox.
   Domain conditions express regularities in voter-preference profiles that
   prevent the paradox. Frequent observations of these domain conditions
   would make Condorcet's paradox empirically less important. Cultures
   define probability distributions over the set of voter preferences.
   Observation of cultures might be a first step to indicate the relevance
   of the paradox. The empirical detection of the paradox speaks for
   itself; we will try to identify the number of observations of the
   paradox so far. The overall conclusion is that the empirical relevance
   of Condorcet's paradox is still unsettled.},

Abstract = {The secession of prosperous regions may negatively affect the
   redistributive scheme of an established state. As a consequence, the
   capacity of its welfare system to support the inhabitants of poorer
   regions may be significantly reduced. Some authors assert that affluent
   groups who opt for full political independence violate duties of
   solidarity. This objection to the secession of prosperous regions can be
   based on different views of distributive justice. Here, following a
   distinction that has been introduced by Allen Buchanan, subject centred'
   and justice as reciprocity' theories are explored. It is argued that
   both theories fail to support the case against the secession of wealthy
   groups. Subject centred' theories cannot explain special duties toward
   compatriots, whereas justice as reciprocity' theories cannot justify
   restrictions on exit rights. However, this does not mean that
   separatists have no moral duties vis-a-vis their (former) fellow
   citizens. They are obliged to dissolve the political union in a fair
   way, e.g., by accepting responsibility for some share of the public
   debts.},

Abstract = {Critical geopolitics is the dominant school of geopolitics in
   contemporary geography. Critical geopolitics is a body of radical
   scholarship that emerged in the 1980s that attempts to move beyond
   classic geopolitics. In order to resuscitate geopolitics, critical
   geopoliticians had to distance themselves from the imperialist, racist,
   and environmentally determinist geopolitics of the 1940s. In doing so,
   however, critical geopoliticians created a body of scholarship that
   omits important explanatory variables necessary to understand post-Cold
   War geopolitics. We argue that critical geopolitics unnecessarily limits
   the wider application of geopolitics because it is: 1) anti-geopolitics;
   2) anti-cartographic; and 3) anti-environmental.},

Abstract = {The interconnections within food, biofuel and fossil fuel markets are
   first described in the context of biofuels technologies and economic
   policy framework. Consequently, the econometric analysis consisting of
   Johansen cointegration, error correction model, vector autoregression
   and Granger causality is applied to price series of 12 biofuel related
   commodities. While a number of equilibrium relationships are found
   across the examined markets suggesting their interconnection, we do not
   obtain a persuasive confirmation of the thesis that biofuels clearly
   lead to food shortages via the increase in prices of basic food
   commodities used in the production of biofuels.},

Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the complex nature of access to the state for
   environmental movement organisations (EMOs) and adopts an interactionist
   approach to explore inter-organisational networking between EMOs and
   state actors. The paper supports existing evidence that proximate
   political opportunities are in part contingent on the interests, claims
   and frames of policy actors. The main theoretical contribution of this
   paper is to illustrate that EMOs strategically adapt to existing
   opportunity environments and actively seek to engage state actors that
   are most receptive to their demands, as opposed to those that have most
   influence in the domain, and that new modes of governance facilitate
   such access. Using evidence from forest activism in Indonesia shows that
   lobbying less powerful but more receptive actors is a strategy that EMOs
   use to overcome limited political opportunities and that
   semi-independent multi-actor forums expand access of EMOs to potential
   state actor allies. The paper also shows that within the Indonesian
   context, these multi-stakeholders forums are actively supported by
   international organisations which therefore directly contribute to
   expanding opportunities for EMOs.},

Abstract = {The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is the foremost international
   body responsible for the maintenance of international peace and
   security. Members vote on issues of global importance and consequently
   receive perks-election to the UNSC predicts, for instance, World Bank
   and IMF loans. But who gets elected to the UNSC? Addressing this
   question empirically is not straightforward as it requires a model that
   allows for discrete choices at the regional and international levels;
   the former nominates candidates while the latter ratifies them. Using an
   original multiple discrete choice model to analyze a dataset of 180
   elections from 1970 to 2005, we find that UNSC election appears to
   derive from a compromise between the demands of populous countries to
   win election more frequently and a norm of giving each country its turn.
   We also find evidence that richer countries from the developing world
   win election more often, while involvement in warfare lowers election
   probability. By contrast, development aid does not predict election.},

Abstract = {This article draws on extensive research in the Paris Revolutionary
   Tribunal archives in order to explore the relationship between local and
   national political, administrative and legal structures in the
   implementation of `revolutionary justice' during the Terror in the
   French Revolution. It highlights the extent to which the Paris Tribunal
   relied on preliminary investigations in the provinces - at the
   administrative levels of department, district and commune - for both
   information regarding counter-revolutionary activity and a substantial
   proportion of its caseload. In so doing, this article offers a
   reassessment of Donald Greer's seminal work on the geographical
   incidence of the Terror, and challenges the stereotype of the Terror as
   a web of secret denunciation, private investigation and summary
   injustice. Furthermore, it concludes that a national perspective is
   vital to any analysis of the work of the Paris Tribunal itself, with the
   wider system of revolutionary justice regularly impacting on
   investigations, prosecutions and judgements in the capital.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the role of news media in (re)producing geopolitical
   narratives of food insecurity in relation to the 2007-2008 global food
   price spike. News content and textual analysis suggests that the media's
   representation of the food price spike is partly framed by Western
   geopolitical anxieties of the threatening rise of Asia', and features
   fast growing' Asian appetites among the main culprits of the crisis.
   Seeking to explain the widespread circulation of such representation,
   this paper analyses media-source relationship within the context of
   market-driven journalism, and suggests that the changing role of news
   media has in turn contributed to a rapid and uncritical circulation of
   elite-based interpretation of, and neoliberal geopolitical approach to,
   food security. The paper points at the importance of critical enquiries
   into geopolitical representations of food insecurity and of opening
   media space for a counter-geopolitics of food security'.},

Abstract = {This chapter reviews literature on the role of individual and mass
   communication in social transformation and revolution. The authors argue
   that many functions crucial to sweeping social transformation have
   always been dependent upon communications. Based on a lifecycle model of
   social movements, the chapter reflects upon how social change advocates
   develop communications strategies, build movements dedicated to enacting
   change, promote their political program, organize action among
   supporters during periods of public contention, and maintain advocacy
   organizations during periods of retrenchment. Moreover, the authors show
   that new technologies have been rapidly incorporated into communications
   strategies by both advocates for and opponents of social transformation.
   However, the ultimate impact of these and future changes worldwide on
   advocacy for social change is unknowable but certain to be profound.},

   Credibility Through Social Media},

Pages = {368-382},
Abstract = {The last two election cycles have seen an exponential rise in the number
   of political campaigns integrating some form of social media into their
   communication plans. As candidates and campaigns increase their social
   media communications, political communication scholars have become
   increasingly interested in the process through which voters assess
   political candidates' credibility through social networking sites. Using
   experimental data, this study examines the mediating role of attitude
   homophily in establishing political candidates' source credibility among
   Facebook users. A multiple mediation model outlines a process wherein
   attitude homophily mediates the relationship between political cues and
   evaluations of source credibility. Theoretical and practical
   implications of the results for political social media campaigns are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Despite the growing academic literature on the World Social Forum
   process, few scholars have attempted to systematically analyze the
   social, cultural, and political impact of the forums. This has to do in
   part with the inherent difficulties of assessing movement consequences,
   which is particularly complicated for an activity geared toward creating
   `open spaces.' This article presents an analytic framework for
   evaluating the impact of the social forums through an analysis of the
   2010 United States Social Forum (USSF) in Detroit from the perspective
   of a local Boston-based delegation called the Boston Freedom Rides. We
   then use that framework to consider the impact of the 2010 USSF,
   bridging the academic literature on movement outcomes with activist
   perspectives. We make two related claims. First, the social forums, and
   the USSF in particular, should be viewed and their impact assessed in
   light of their generativity as `movement-building machines':
   infrastructures designed for the production of social capital, networks,
   solidarities, meanings, frames, identities, knowledges, strategies,
   skills, and repertoires. Second, with respect to the Freedom Rides, the
   2010 USSF contributed to movement building on multiple levels, but more
   so within rather than across movement sectors. Our goal is less to make
   a definitive argument about the impact of the 2010 USSF than to provide
   a helpful way of thinking about movement building as a social movement
   outcome, which can be applied and refined through further comparative
   and longitudinal research. We thus favor breadth over depth in outlining
   a broad framework for future inquiry.},

Abstract = {This aim of the article is to determine the optimal tax policy horizon,
   and thus its strongest impact on economic growth in OECD countries. From
   a methodological point of view, the empirical analysis is based on a
   dynamic panel model, in which the data for the OECD countries in the
   period of 2000-2011 are used. The results confirm the economic theory
   about the negative impact of taxes on growth and show that the tax
   policy influences the growth the strongest with the 2-3 years lag. The
   analysis also confirms that permanent tax changes in sense of increased
   taxation may not be as negative for growth if they are accompanied by
   effective tax collection and increase of tax revenues.},

Abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of research on the relevance of
   entertaining and emotional aspects of political media coverage. Based on
   a discussion of the normative preference for information apparent in
   most work on political communication, the authors reflect on how and why
   emotional and entertaining message components nevertheless matter. They
   argue that investigating the political relevance of those elements has
   become important because of the rise of new formats of political
   information and changes of traditional news (e.g., late-night talks,
   tabloidization, softening of news). More specifically, the chapter
   reviews the state of the art in research on the presence and effects of
   humor, visuals, negativity, and fear in political coverage. The authors
   conclude that the effects of those elements may not necessarily be
   entertaining. Rather, politically significant repercussions on political
   knowledge, attitudes, and participation can result from such ostensibly
   nonpolitical content.},

Abstract = {This chapter begins with an account for the presence of a revolutionary
   situation that needed only a `spark' to ignite it in Tunisia and Egypt.
   It then goes on to examine the post-revolutionary timetable of elections
   in these two countries leading to the establishment of a constitutional
   assembly obligated to create an entirely new structure for the practice
   of a representative and plural politics. It underlines not only the
   somewhat different paths taken in Egypt and Tunisia as they progress
   towards the same general goal, but also the passage of lessons and
   political experience of both, including what appear to be obvious
   mistakes. While the Arab world in general made use of examples taken
   from a global and historical repertoire of revolutionary change going
   back to the influence of both the American and French revolutions of the
   late eighteenth century, the mutual influences exercised in the
   Egyptian-Tunisian case remains something extra special in their
   intensity and effect.},

Abstract = {In the context of the new period of mobilization begun in Spain with the
   rise of the indignados in May 2011, protests against home evictions are
   today at the center of local and international discussions. This article
   seeks to make an initial examination of these mobilizations and their
   relationship with routine politics in Spain. After a brief historical
   introduction the article looks at the different kinds of action, both
   contentious and conventional, employed by the movement against the
   evictions, as well as the various scale shift mechanisms that have
   diversified the number and range of actors involved in this particular
   case of contentious politics. The conclusions look at the question of as
   to what point recent developments have broken with the deep-rooted
   tendency toward a lack of interaction between protest movements and
   institutional actors.},

Booktitle = {UNITED STATES IN DECLINE},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {26},
Pages = {107-145},
Abstract = {This chapter argues that aspiring hegemons face a wide array of complex
   and distinct military challenges. Managing scarce military resources
   requires a subtle and complex global strategy that is likely to generate
   cognitive overload for the political system. As a result of cognitive
   overload, aspiring hegemons are likely to flail around, rapidly shifting
   from one global strategy to another. Such strategic flailing will occur
   independently of whether or not the economy is in crisis, though clearly
   economic crisis will exacerbate the tendency towards strategic
   incoherence. The chapter examines U.S. global strategy since the end of
   the Cold War, looking at the focus on ``rogue regimes,{''} a growing
   concern with `` global chaos,{''} worry about the rise of a peer
   competitor (China), and the debates about the root causes of, and best
   strategies to mitigate, terrorism. The chapter concludes with a
   discussion of the role of culture and notions of national identity and
   their role in the formulation of grand strategy.},

Title = {Beyond the Activist Ghetto: A Deductive Blockmodelling Approach to
   Understanding the Relationship between Contact with Environmental
   Organisations and Public Attitudes and Behaviour},

Abstract = {Current research on the behavioural impacts of social movements tends to
   focus on their influence on those most intensely involved. Consequently
   it overlooks the impacts that social movement organisations might have
   on those outside the activist ghetto. To begin to address this gap in
   the literature, this article examines the relationship between contact
   with environmental organisations and public attitudes and behaviour.
   Monitoring the electricity use of 72 households has facilitated analysis
   of its association with their environmental attitudes and contact with
   environmental organisations. Although standard statistical approaches
   fail to uncover a relationship between contact with environmental
   organisations and attitudes and behaviour, a deductive blockmodelling
   approach tells a different story. Low household electricity use is
   associated with households sharing pro-environmental attitudes and
   contact with environmental organisations. High energy use is associated
   with households not sharing any of these; and moderate energy use is
   associated with a moderate degree of sharing. Our findings reveal the
   need for systematic studies of environmental movement organisations'
   impact on the public's pro-environmental behaviours.},

Abstract = {This chapter integrates literature on both expectations toward and
   perceptions of media. The author argues that those expectations and
   perceptions are important explanatory variables for the selection and
   effects of media. The chapter brings together ideas from the
   uses-and-gratifications tradition, from research on hostile media and
   third person perceptions, and from media credibility research in a model
   of the uses and perceptions of media. In the model audience perceptions
   are introduced as important antecedents of media use as well as of
   future expectations toward media. The chapter emphasizes the importance
   of media perceptions as their effects are not limited to an attitudinal
   level, but also regard political participation, voting and other
   behavioral responses. The chapter concludes with a call for more
   scholarly efforts linking uses and perceptions of media in political
   communication research.},

   Big Data in Public Management Reform},
Journal = {POLICY AND INTERNET},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {393-417},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Citizens and governments live increasingly digital lives, leaving trails
   of digital data that have the potential to support unprecedented levels
   of mutual government-citizen understanding, and in turn, vast
   improvements to public policies and services. Open data and open
   government initiatives promise to ``open up{''} government operations to
   citizens. New forms of ``big data{''} analysis can be used by government
   itself to understand citizens' behavior and reveal the strengths and
   weaknesses of policy and service delivery. In practice, however, open
   data emerges as a reform development directed to a range of goals,
   including the stimulation of economic development, and not strictly
   transparency or public service improvement. Meanwhile, governments have
   been slow to capitalize on the potential of big data, while the largest
   data they do collect remain ``closed{''} and under-exploited within the
   confines of intelligence agencies. Drawing on interviews with civil
   servants and researchers in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United
   States between 2011 and 2014, this article argues that a big data
   approach could offer the greatest potential as a vehicle for improving
   mutual government-citizen understanding, thus embodying the core tenets
   of Digital Era Governance, argued by some authors to be the most viable
   public management model for the digital age (Dunleavy, Margetts, Bastow,
   \& Tinkler, 2005, 2006; Margetts \& Dunleavy, 2013).},

   identify a stable and sizable electoral cycle in water tariffs. Tariff
   increases are both less frequent and less strong before elections. The
   cycle effect is, however, not constant: Small increases are not affected
   by elections or even more likely. This is consistent with advances from
   prospect theory suggesting that visibility may depend on the size of a
   policy. Consequently, small tariff changes may not be salient,
   particularly if they are below inflation as a reference threshold. (C)

Abstract = {ObjectivesOne possible source for the gap in media coverage between
   female and male subjects is the political affiliation of the media
   source. The objective of this present study was to test whether there is
   a difference between more liberal and more conservative newspapers in
   coverage rates of female subjects.
   MethodsWe used computational methods to analyze a unique large-scale
   data set (complied by the Lydia Text Analysis System) and compared the
   2010 female coverage rates in 168 newspapers.
   ResultsContrary to our expectations, we found that conservative media
   tend to cover female subjects no less (and even slightly more) than
   liberal media. However, the difference was no longer significant once we
   controlled for newspaper distribution.
   ConclusionThe common view that liberal newspapers are more likely to
   cover female subjects was not supported by this study. Both conservative
   and liberal newspapers are much more likely to cover males.},

Title = {A vote at the opera? The political economy of public theaters and
   orchestras in the German states},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},
Pages = {254-273},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Policymakers generally have powerful incentives to attract votes by
   strategically manipulating public policies, for instance by increasing
   public spending during election periods or by implementing ideologically
   valued policies for their electoral base. At first sight, public
   theaters and orchestras appear an unlikely domain for such tactics.
   Highbrow culture is elitist and provides few jobs to artists as voters
   (patronage). However, we argue that policymakers indirectly target a
   larger highbrow culture-consuming voting public, as this public is more
   likely to go voting, to actively engage in politics, and to influence
   other voters' political behavior through political and sociological
   multiplier effects. We find evidence of such manipulation tactics in
   Germany, 1993-2010. Artist numbers increase during state-level, and even
   more during municipal-level, election years (electioneering). More
   tentatively, leftwing party power increases cultural subsidies and jobs
   in Eastern states. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Understanding the formation of individual trade policy preferences is a
   fundamental input into the modeling of trade policy outcomes.
   Surprisingly, past studies have found mixed evidence that various labor
   market and industry attributes of workers affect their trade policy
   preferences, even though recent studies have found that trade policy can
   have substantial impacts on workers' incomes. This paper provides the
   first analysis of the extent to which task routineness affects trade
   policy preferences using survey data from the American National Election
   Studies. We find significant evidence that greater task routineness
   leads workers to be much more supportive of import restrictions,
   consistent with recent evidence on how trade openness puts downward
   pressure on employment and wages for workers whose occupations involve
   routine tasks. In fact, other than education levels, task routineness is
   the only labor market attribute that displays a robust correlation with
   individuals' stated trade policy preferences. We also provide evidence
   that there are some interactions between the economic and non-economic
   factors in our study. For example, women's trade policy views are much
   more invariant to their labor market attributes than men, suggesting
   that women's views on this issue are driven more by personal and
   ideological beliefs than men.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the main determinants of individual attitudes
   towards immigration in Europe. Our results suggest that both economic
   and non-economic variables shape attitudes towards immigration, but the
   relative importance of these factors depends crucially on the
   race/ethnicity of the arriving immigrants. While fears over labour
   market competition are more likely to shape attitudes towards the
   arrival of same race immigrants, more exposure to immigrants reduces
   opposition towards the arrival of different race immigrants. These
   findings persist after controlling for socioeconomic characteristics,
   and after exploiting the data to allow for cohort-specific effects.},

Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},

Abstract = {Many motivations exist that cause legislators to behave strategically
   when voting. These include logrolling, towing the party line, or
   political favor trading. However, it has proven difficult in the
   existing literature to uncover the magnitude of the interaction among
   politicians. This paper takes a ``spatial{''} approach to the problem,
   using a spatial autoregressive model to not only uncover the magnitude
   of interactions, but also the direction of the interactions. In contrast
   to most applications of spatial econometrics, I allow the elements of
   the spatial weights matrix to be estimated as parameters. The political
   spatial weights matrix is calculated for 96 senators in the 110th U.S.
   Congress. Furthermore, in a marginal effects simulation, I calculate the
   overall effect on voting from ``flipping{''} a senator's vote, allowing
   flipped votes to have a cascading effect. I apply these measures to
   study political fundraising, mildly suggesting that political interest
   groups direct donations to senators with the most influence.},

Abstract = {In the Polish city of Krakow, successive regimes have (re)named the
   streetscape to advance their influence and ideologies. This paper
   examines changes in street names under three different governmental
   powers - Nazi, Soviet and Polish - on five maps of the city centre (from
   1934, 1943, 1964, 1985 and 1996). The work extends the current
   literature on toponymy by providing a temporal analysis of the street
   name changes to one bounded area over time, which demonstrates how a
   politics of memory is inculcated into streetscapes to reaffirm political
   control. By reference to one space, I show how the name changes proffer
   an intriguing insight into how two foreign regimes viewed their
   occupations and, in addition, how all three sought to strengthen their
   influence by using names that reinforced past examples of their power
   and alleged cultural superiority in the landscape. Crown Copyright (C)

Abstract = {Objective. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of day
   laborer worker centers on the hourly wages earned by day laborers.
   Methods. Using data from the National Day Labor Survey, a two-step
   method was estimated to measure the wage impacts of day labor worker
   centers, and to control for endogeneity and selection bias. Estimated
   wages were compared across hiring sites to determine whether or not a
   wage premium was earned by workers who participate in day labor worker
   centers. Results. We find a modest, but statistically significant, wage
   premium earned by workers who participate in day labor worker centers,
   as well as evidence suggestive of the capacity of worker centers to
   mitigate market advantages associated with informal hiring sites.
   Conclusions. We argue that while worker centers remain the most
   effective means through which day labor markets can be regulated and
   workers' wages improved, increasing the regulatory capacity of these
   labor market intermediaries will require a significant ``scaling up,{''}
   so that they can more fully influence the larger political, economic,
   and social contexts in which the day labor economy is embedded.},

Abstract = {Evidence from the International Crime Victimization Survey and the World
   Business Environment Survey suggests that actual corruption experience
   is a weak predictor of reported corruption perception, and that some of
   the factors commonly found to reduce corruption, such as economic
   development, democratic institutions or Protestant traditions,
   systematically bias corruption perception indices downward from
   corruption experience. In addition, perception indices are influenced by
   absolute (as opposed to relative) levels of corruption, which tends to
   penalize large countries, and they exhibit diminishing sensitivity to
   both absolute and relative corruption, indicating that they may better
   capture differences among countries with low levels of corruption than
   among highly corrupt ones. Individual characteristics such as education,
   age, or employment status, and firm-level characteristics such as the
   number of competitors are also found to influence corruption perceptions
   holding experience constant.},

Abstract = {Immigration control-related audits and their resulting sanctions are not
   solely determined by impartial enforcement of laws and regulations. They
   are also determined by the incentives faced by vote-maximizing
   politicians, agents acting on their behalf, and workers likely to
   compete with immigrants in the local labor market. In this paper, we use
   a unique data set to test the extent to which congressional oversight
   determines the bureaucratic immigration enforcement process. We examine
   the decisions made at each stage of enforcement from over 40,000 audits
   from 1990 to 2000. This includes analysis of (1) whether a firm is found
   in violation, (2) whether a fine is issued, (3) the size of the fine
   issued, and (4) how much of a dollar reduction fined employers were able
   to negotiate. We find that the number of audits conducted increases with
   local unemployment. We also find that a congressman's party affiliation
   and its interaction with committee membership and party majority status,
   as well as firm size and local union membership, correlate to decisions
   made at every stage of enforcement.},

Abstract = {We develop a theoretical framework-to analyze the choice between
   secrecy, patent and open access. We consider a firm that can use a basic
   innovation to develop an application. The basic innovation can also lead
   another firm to develop a different application. We determine the
   incentives for the, basic innovator to give open access to the basic
   innovation or to keep it secret. We show that open access emerges more
   often if the company that owns the basic innovation has the option to
   protect it by a patent.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {34},
Pages = {126-141},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper uses detailed data on election day rainfall from more than
   3000 weather stations as an instrument to estimate the causal effect of
   turnout on electoral results in Spanish General Elections. The first
   stage results show that rainfall on election day decreases turnout.
   Second stage results show that conservatives are greatly hurt by higher
   turnout. Surprisingly, I find that the main leftwing party is not the
   beneficiary of higher turnout, but rather other smaller parties. In both
   stages, I control for local economic conditions and find that higher
   unemployment increases turnout, and that increases in unemployment
   benefit the conservative party at the expense of leftwing parties. In
   combination, the results point to turnout having two components, a more
   volatile one, which is affected by weather, and a more structural one,
   which depends on economic conditions such as unemployment. (C) 2014

Abstract = {The global financial crisis has caused controversial discussions about
   the capital base of the banking industry in Europe. Dividend cuts and
   omissions have been suggested as one possibility to improve the
   financial strength of banks by retaining earnings. However, there are
   fears that investors could interpret a reduction of dividends as a sign
   for future problems. The dividend signalling and dividend smoothing
   hypotheses quite clearly are the theoretical basis for these worries.
   The basic idea of this study is that without empirical evidence
   supporting the hypothesis dividends did matter in the past, banks should
   not fear dividend cuts or even dividend omissions. The empirical
   evidence from the European banking industry reported here does not
   indicate that dividend signalling and dividend smoothing are relevant
   economic phenomena. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates empirically the link between the prospects of
   upward mobility and preferences for redistribution using data for a
   large number of countries from the Life in Transition Survey. The survey
   is unique in that it provides a detailed account of expected future
   mobility, and makes it possible to differentiate respondents by their
   degree of risk aversion - both key pillars of the POUM model. The
   results from the pooled sample, and those for the EU member states
   confirm the theoretical predictions of Benabou and Ok (2001) -
   individuals' expectations of upward mobility reduce their preference for
   redistribution, but only when the degree of risk aversion is low. The
   POUM hypothesis is not borne out by the data in the non-EU countries.

Abstract = {The Christian Right is a long-standing social movement with a reputation
   for mobilization and activism at all levels of American politics. The
   Christian Progressive movement is a manifestation of religiously
   motivated political activity largely opposed to the policy goals of the
   Christian Right. Some have questioned, however, whether Christian
   Progressives have the internal cohesion to mobilize voters, activists,
   and movement organizations toward their policy goals. In this article, I
   update an existing measure of Christian Right influence and introduce a
   parallel measure for Christian Progressives. Analyses of these indices
   show that the Christian Progressive movement is visible and active in
   many states, though not the engine of influence that the Christian Right
   remains.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {34},
Pages = {52-67},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this paper, I examine how the two dimensions of income inequality and
   ethnic diversity affect the formation of political coalitions and the
   reallocation of income. I construct a legislative bargaining model to
   analyze when coalitions form along the income dimension and when it
   forms along the ethnic dimension. The results of the model suggest that
   the agenda setter selects a partner with a lower aggregate income: a
   smaller population size and a lower income level. Further, I extend the
   model from a one-round to a two-round game. The extended model shows
   that forming an oversized coalition is a possible equilibrium outcome
   and is consistent with the empirical findings. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Lessons from the European economic and financial great crisis: A survey},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {34},
Number = {S, SI},
Pages = {S9-S24},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper discusses several key issues regarding the current European
   economic and financial Great Crisis, which essentially is a twin
   sovereign debt and banking crisis. The shift of the recent world
   financial crisis into a European sovereign debt crisis is tackled by
   analyzing how via the banking system the financial contagion was
   extended from the US to Europe. The explanation focuses on the
   imbalances of European Monetary Union (EMU) countries
   balance-of-payments. The European crisis has shown that it can spread
   quickly among closely integrated economies, either through the trade
   channel or the financial channel, or both. In this context, TARGET2
   payment system of EMU countries became crucial, reflecting funding
   stress in the banking systems of crisis-hit European countries. The
   paper concludes that, in the medium term, a successful crisis resolution
   requires more political integration, Which should include a fiscal union
   and a banking union. However, in the short run, a prompt recovery is
   essential to get out of trouble, and this requires that surplus
   countries (particularly Germany) expand aggregate demand and let
   domestic wages and the ensuing inflation rate increase. (C) 2013

Abstract = {This paper provides a simple theoretical model of capital tax
   competition between countries that differ in spatial location, and where
   cross-border investment costs are proportional to distance (a gravity
   model). We model EU membership as a reduction in `distance' between
   countries. Precise predictions about reaction functions' intercepts and
   slopes are derived. In particular we find that joining the Union lowers
   the intercept and that all countries react more to member countries than
   they do to non-members. These predictions are largely confirmed using a
   panel data set of statutory corporate tax rates on Western European
   countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {ELECTION LAW JOURNAL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {322-335},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This essay attacks the narrow view of congressional authority to
   regulate voter qualifications adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court in
   Shelby County v.Holder and Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council, and argues
   that Congress has significant authority over voter qualifications under
   Article I, Section 5, which allows it to judge the elections of its
   members. Although Congress exercises its authority under this provision
   after the election has taken place, it remains a source of authority
   that the Court should have considered in its attempt to craft competing
   paradigms of state and congressional power over elections in these
   decisions. By examining election contests from the 47th Congress, the
   argument herein sheds light on the scope of congressional authority over
   elections by analyzing Congress's willingness to intervene in state
   level disputes over congressional seats. A review of the historical
   record reveals that the House of Representatives often overturned
   elections in which state or federal law was not complied with in
   determining the winner, even in disputes that dealt primarily with the
   qualifications of electors. Both Shelby County and Arizona Inter Tribal
   tell a woefully incomplete story about congressional authority over
   elections, ignoring that the House's authority to resolve election
   contests under state and federal law can be just as powerful as the
   state's authority to determine the qualifications of electors ex ante.},

Abstract = {American Presidential elections are indirect, reflecting popular support
   for the candidates through the institution of the Electoral College to
   choose the President. In common with other plurality-based electoral
   systems, the College tends to exaggerate the apparent mandate received
   by the winner of the popular vote but, on occasion, can deliver victory
   to the second-placed candidate. Despite a sizeable literature on its
   operation and vagaries, however, relatively little attention has been
   paid to the question of systematic bias in the College: does one party
   receive a consistent advantage over the other from the College's
   operation? The paper examines the evidence for such a bias in each
   Presidential election since 1960. Although biases have occurred and in
   some cases were substantial, neither major party is a consistent
   beneficiary; the prime source of bias is to be found in the relative
   effectiveness of parties' own vote-winning strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {This paper shows why a majority of legislators may vote for a policy
   that benefits a firm but harms all legislators. The firm may induce
   legislators to support the policy by suggesting that it is more likely
   to invest in a district where voters or their representative support the
   policy. In equilibrium, no one vote may be decisive, so each legislator
   who seeks the firm's investment votes for the policy, though all
   legislators would be better off if they all voted against the policy.
   And when votes reveal information about the district, the firm's
   implicit promise or threat can be credible. Unlike influence mechanisms
   based on contributions or bribes, the behavior considered is time
   consistent and in line with the low campaign contributions by special
   interests.},

Abstract = {Meetings of shareholders, societies, and clubs often require a minimal
   participation quorum. In the absence of a quorum, no valid decisions can
   be made; thus, decisions are postponed to a later meeting. This paper
   examines the effect of such quorum constraints on both individual
   behavior and collective outcomes in a model of costly meetings. We show
   that when a binding quorum constraint delivers an immediate decision, it
   also induces a welfare loss with respect to the outcome that prevails
   when no quorum applies, potentially including policy distortions. When
   the quorum requirement is high and causes the decision to be postponed,
   the number of participants in the (second) meeting may decrease with
   respect to the zero-quorum rule.},

Title = {DOES SAYING `YES' TO CAPITAL INFLOWS NECESSARILY MEAN GOOD BUSINESS? THE

   CARIBBEAN ECONOMIES},
Journal = {ECONOMICS \& POLITICS},

Abstract = {This study explores the level of compliance and the subsequent economic
   performance of states in the context of anti-money laundering (AML)
   regulations. Following Holmstrom and Tirole (1997) and Obstfeld and
   Rogoff (1998), we examine why countries admit illicit flows of money and
   the economic costs of these transactions. Analyzing 36 Latin American
   and Caribbean jurisdictions between 1960 and 2010, we find that poor
   institutional performance by a jurisdiction (AML ratings, blacklists
   with non-cooperator countries, and corruption indicators) affects
   negatively the investment ratio to GDP, the FDI ratio to GDP, and
   financial development (ratio of credit markets to GDP). These findings
   are novel in the literature, offering an important contribution to the
   debate on financial regulatory convergence.},

Volume = {60},

Abstract = {Presentations of the history of Australian democracy inevitably dwell on
   the innovative and early democratic practices of the colonies and,
   later, the nation. Compulsory voting is typically placed in this frame.
   This article challenges three key pillars of the accepted narrative of
   the Australian adoption of compulsory voting by placing
   nineteenth-century debates over the mandatory franchise in the
   Australian colonies in the context of other similar democracies in North
   America. It shows that compulsory voting debates in the colonies were
   contentious, protracted and motivated by negative experiences of
   democracy and a desire to limit or order democracy to ensure that
   engaged minorities did not overwhelm an apathetic majority.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a social choice analysis, using simulated data based
   on English general elections from 1992 through 2010, of the properties
   of three voting rules: First-Past-the-Post, the Alternative Vote, and
   the Coombs Rule. More specifically, the paper examines (1) the
   plurality, anti-plurality, and Condorcet status of candidates in each
   election and the interrelationships among these statuses, (2) the
   effects of strict and partial single-peakedness of voter preferences,
   and (3) the identity of winners, Condorcet efficiency, and the
   relationship between votes and seats under the three voting rules. The
   analysis considers only the case of three candidates and, in the manner
   of basic social choice theory, the set of candidates and voter
   preferences over them are taken to be fixed.},

   Ongoing Rebellion of the Poor: The Balfour Insurrections},
Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {204-221},
Abstract = {Since 2004, South Africa has experienced thousands of local protests,
   many of them popular insurrections, which, taken together, represent a
   rebellion of the poor. Lack of service delivery has been the main issue,
   but protesting communities have also demanded the removal of corrupt
   officials, re-demarcation of political boundaries and employment. In
   terms of endurance and geographical spread, the movement is
   unprecedented. The article presents findings from a case study
   undertaken in Balfour, a small town outside Johannesburg. It argues for
   bridging studies of social class and social movements, justifies the
   concept `rebellion of the poor' and proposes that the divide between
   employed workers and `the poor' is best understood in terms of different
   relationships to the means and ends of protest.},

   resiliency of the Islamic Republic since its inception in 1979 in face
   of formidable external threats, internal obstacles, and the challenges

Abstract = {This study examines the role of online networking in a grassroots
   movement in China. Drawing on Manuel Castells's theory of communication
   power in the network society, we argue that microblogs can facilitate
   China's mass self-communication in a network environment, even under
   authoritarian control, and are able to challenge the power of agenda
   setting, which has been mainly dominated by the state and the state
   media. We study a grassroots movement in China and examine the ways in
   which messages were communicated and people were connected into a
   network. Thus we investigate the role of online communication in
   reconfiguring the balance of power between the authority and Chinese
   citizens. Using systematic data collection and social network analysis,
   we characterize the microbloggers who contributed to the process, the
   network configuration, and the interplays between different
   stakeholders.},

Title = {TO BE A QUEEN IN CONSTITUTIONAL SPAIN: SYMBOLIC LEGITIMATIZATION AND
   DELEGITIMATIZATION OF THE NATIONAL MONARCHY},
Journal = {HISTORIA Y POLITICA},
Year = {2014},
Number = {31},
Pages = {139-166},
Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {Monarchy suffered a process of transformation throughout the 19th
   century in order to find its place into constitutional regimes. The
   sources of legitimization changed, so that apart from traditional and
   dynastic legitimacy, there were added other instruments derived from its
   function of symbolic representation, also from social cohesion and from
   national identity, which were grounded on new models of royal conduct.
   In the monarchic nineteenth-century the narrative figure of the queen,
   regnant or consort, becomes the central image of the royal family and
   the expression of gender and family stereotypes of bourgeois stamp: i.e.
   the ``lady of the house{''} and the models of pious, charitable and
   virtuous mother and wife. This study is based on a compared analysis of
   two queens who succeeded one another, Isabel II and M.(a) Victoria de
   Saboya, and reports how some of the mechanisms that intervene in the
   symbolic construction of monarchic constitutional legitimacy operated.
   In both cases an instrumentalisation of the charismatic legitimacy in
   successive propaganda campaigns is observed. Nevertheless, none of these
   queens managed to construct an irreproachable image as a feminine model
   of their time. Furthermore, they did not either manage to reinforce the
   symbolic legitimacy of the institution in order to consolidate their
   permaneney on the throne.},

Abstract = {Are elections in autocracies a curse for incumbents? Using panel data
   from village elections in China, the OLS regression shows that
   introducing competitive elections has a relatively small effect on the
   removal of autocratic incumbents. However, the effect becomes much
   larger when the endogenous timing is instrumented with the passage of
   provincial election laws and village-specific election cycles.
   Additional evidence also suggests that removing incumbents through
   competitive elections enhances local governance. I interpret these
   results as suggesting that political selection matters in electoral
   autocracies.},

Abstract = {The article deals with a problem of changes in inventories, its
   variability and its synchronization with changing savings and import in
   the Czech Republic in 1999-2012. In theoretical part both macroeconomic
   and microeconomic aspects of changes in inventories are discussed in the
   context of expected and unexpected demand shocks. In empirical part
   sources of GDP variability are analyzed using trend and cyclical data.
   Trend variability of changes in inventories is less important for trend
   GDP variability than in case of cyclical variability and vice versa for
   cyclical GDP and changes in inventories. Parameters of VAR model of
   cyclical changes in inventories, savings and import are also estimated.
   The results show that change in savings is a source of unexpected demand
   shock with impact on inventories. Reaction of import confirms that
   savings influence more domestic products consumption than imported
   products which are more driven by exports.},

Abstract = {Even as diverse bordering processes have proliferated well beyond the
   edges of contemporary states, local understandings of international
   borders have aligned with national expectations. Historically borderland
   residents were often granted leeway in their cross-border activities and
   this provided an initial acceptance of the concept of national borders
   that continued even as boundaries became more rigid. Among the
   indigenous Tohono O'odham varying interpretations on the effective
   extent of the US-Mexico border co-existed for well over a century. Where
   the geopolitical border and the understanding of local communities
   differed, the latter was generally of greater importance in defining
   effective limits. National and international dynamics gradually reversed
   this, however, merging diverse border interpretations. External forces
   built upon local distinctions to achieve acceptance of the concept of a
   border among a group that initially had no vested interest in such a
   division and then narrowed that flexible interpretation to one more
   accommodating to national priorities premised on a strict linear
   conception of the extent of sovereignty. The coalescing of multiple
   layers of distinction in the vicinity of national boundaries sheds light
   on scale-based conflict over bordering and points to the overwhelming
   priority given to homogenizing forces and uniformity of control in the
   modern state.},

Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {62},
Number = {2},
Pages = {216-231},
Abstract = {The goal of this paper is to develop the theoretical framework of the
   public goods provision. This theoretic contribution is based on the
   critical analysis of mainstream economics theories dealing with public
   goods as market failure (neoclassical economics and neoliberalism) and
   on the results of own economic experiment examining the
   ``free-riding{''} behaviour in the voluntary provision of public goods.
   The ``free rider{''} problem is one of the main reasons for government
   intervention in the market. However, there is an inefficiency of public
   decision making on public provision and financing of selected goods
   because of the estimating goods values (ex-post consumer utility)
   problem. Moreover, the results of economic experiments do not support
   the pure ``free rider{''} theory. However, the economic experiment
   simulates the real public good consumption that is why this paper
   contains also the survey of consumers' willingness to pay for specific
   public goods (public library services) in real terms based on the
   methodology of contingent valuation method.},

Abstract = {This article applies the homophily thesis to public diplomacy and offers
   an empirical examination of a country's success in its mediated public
   diplomacy efforts. It analyzes international frame building, the process
   of creating or changing media frames in the international communications
   arena, by applying it to the case of Israeli mediated public diplomacy
   efforts during the war in Gaza in the winter of 2008-2009. The article
   claims that one way to use the homophily thesis in empirical analyses of
   international frame-building campaigns in conflicts is to measure the
   political and value proximity of a country promoting frames to other
   countries. Yet, proximity should be measured relatively rather than in
   absolute terms. Therefore, one should look not only at the dyadic
   proximity between two actors (i.e., Country A that attempts to promote
   its frames to Country C), but at the relative proximity between
   Countries A and C considering the proximity between the rival Country B
   and the target Country C. The study proposes a model and a method to
   facilitate empirical analysis of this claim. Using sophisticated
   computerized content analysis, our analyses demonstrate that relative
   proximity is related to successful international frame building in the
   hypothesized direction: The closer the relative proximity between Israel
   and a foreign country, the greater the acceptance of Israel's views.},

   and populism with regards to their definitions, main goals, types of

   of political freedoms, rights, and political inclusiveness. In contrast,
   the spontaneous actions of populism appeal to popular agendas and often
   use disfranchised populations to achieve political goals.},

Abstract = {This chapter argues that despite the proverbial claim that populism is
   ill-defined and has too broad a conceptual net, the literature on the
   subject tends to converge toward four core elements of populism that
   provides a conceptual and analytical unity. Furthermore, the conceptual
   core of populism explains why the concept has been able to encompass a
   wide range of populist manifestations without becoming an empty
   analytical shell. Also, the conceptual cores have helped provide the
   empirical basis that has given rise to a diverse and innovative
   literature that seeks to measure and compare cross-nationally populism.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the method of construction of symmetric time
   input-output tables under conditions of the Czech Republic. It is
   completely new approach to the description and evaluation of the Czech
   economy even though the effort to include the factor of time in this
   evaluation is abroad for quite long. In the Czech Republic are these
   efforts at the beginning. The method used to achieve the goal is based
   on the Supply and use tables expressed in time units, which is compiled
   using relevant data sources. The described results inform about the
   achieving of this goal. The method leads to the compilation of the
   symmetric time input-output tables. Some problems are discussed and have
   to be solved before the derivation of the input-output models from the
   time input-output tables.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesContributions to candidates from the parties' congressional
   campaign committees are thought to have a multiplier effect in terms of
   generating contributions from political action committees.
   MethodUsing structural equation modeling and timed direct contribution
   data from the 1992 to 2012 general election cycles, I uncover a complex
   system of relationships within each party network.
   ResultsAfter controlling for the competitiveness of the race, I find
   party contributions to challengers and open-seat contestants early in
   the election cycle positively and significantly predict political action
   committee contributions to those candidates in the period after Labor
   Day, both in the era preceding the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform
   Act and the era after reform; however, the strength of the relationship
   declines in the postreform era and differences between the party
   networks also arise.
   ConclusionsI attribute these developments to changes in campaign finance
   law that created new hurdles for parties and increased the influence of
   interest groups.},

Title = {Senate Responsiveness to Minority Constituencies: Latino Electoral
   Strength and Representation},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {95},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1172-1188},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objective. While most research on minority representation in Congress
   finds that the African-American constituency size influences
   representation of the group's interests, most recent studies examining
   Latinos find no such relationship. We argue that the failure to find a
   relationship stems from the focus of prior research on the proportion of
   the Latino population in the total geographic constituency rather than
   the proportion of Latinos in the electoral constituency, what we term
   ``Latino electoral strength{''} (LES). Methods. Using data on Latino
   turnout at the state level, we examine the effect of LES on
   representation of Latino interests in the U. S. Senate. We use ordinary
   least squares (OLS) regression that accounts for the time serial,
   cross-sectional (TSCS) nature of our data. Results. Consistent with
   other studies, we find no influence of Latino population size on Latino
   representation. However, LES has a significant, negative effect on
   Latino representation. Conclusions. Our results suggest that greater LES
   leads to worse representation of their interests, and that this
   relationship increases as LES grows. This is consistent with existing
   studies of racial threat theory.},

   participators and multinomial logistic regression to compare the policy
   preferences of these participator types.
   ResultsVoters who also engage in additional online and/or offline
   political acts have policy preferences that differ in a number of
   meaningful ways from those who only vote.
   ConclusionThe findings indicate that prior research has overlooked
   important evidence on the connection between citizen participation and
   political outcomes due to a primary focus on the act of voting. This
   study suggests how future research can assess the impact of citizens'
   broader patterns of political participation.},

Abstract = {Do international labor flows influence the prospects for democratization
   both in the countries that export their excess workers and in the
   countries that import them? This paper argues that emigration should
   have a positive effect on political liberalization in net source
   countries because it decreases the amount of redistribution that would
   occur in a more democratic regime. Conversely, immigration should have a
   negative effect on political liberalization in net destination countries
   through the same causal channel: by increasing the amount of
   redistribution that would occur in a more democratic regime. South Korea
   and Singapore are considered as illustrative examples, and the paper
   provides statistical evidence to support the hypothesis that emigration
   (immigration) has been positively (negatively) related to future
   political liberalization.},

Abstract = {Given freshwater is crucial to sustaining life and forecasted to decline
   in relative abundance under most climate change scenarios, there is
   concern changing precipitation patterns will be a cause of future
   interstate conflict. In theorizing the impact of climate change for
   interstate conflict, we distinguish between trends (long-term means)
   that may affect the baseline probability of conflict, and triggers
   (short-term deviations) that may affect the probability of conflict in
   the short run. We jointly model the effects of mean precipitation
   scarcity and variability (trends) and year-to-year changes in
   precipitation (triggers) on militarized interstate disputes between
   states. We find higher long-run variability in precipitation and lower
   mean levels of precipitation in dyads are associated with the outbreak
   of militarized interstate disputes (MIDs). Contra neo-Malthusian
   expectations, however, we find joint precipitation scarcity defined as
   both countries experiencing below mean rainfall in the same year has a
   conflict-dampening effect. These findings push the literature in a
   direction that more closely aligns our modeling of human impacts with
   our understanding of the physical impacts of climate change. (C) 2014

Title = {THE POLITICS OF CAPITAL FLIGHT IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS},
Journal = {ECONOMICS \& POLITICS},

Abstract = {This paper studies the effects of economic governance and political
   institutions on portfolio investment during the Global Economic Crisis
   of 2008-2009. Leveraging a unique cross-national dataset on portfolio
   flows immediately following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September
   2008, it shows that countries with better institutions - those with more
   (or less) democratic, more (or less) constrained or more accountable
   political systems - were no less vulnerable to portfolio outflows than
   countries with worse institutions. However, countries with better
   governance prior to the crisis - those with better regulatory
   apparatuses, rule of law, property rights, and those considered less
   politically risky - experienced lower net portfolio capital outflows
   after Lehman. Governance is in fact the strongest predictor of portfolio
   capital flows during the global flight to liquidity, while political
   institutions perform poorly. The findings shed light onto the political
   factors that mediated how the collapse of Lehman affected national
   financial markets the world over, and have implications for literatures
   on the political economy of foreign investment, as well as for broader
   topics of institutions, governance, and economic performance.},

Abstract = {We transpose the concept of systemic risk measurement used in the
   financial literature to the sovereign debt crisis. We construct our
   analysis on two systemic risk measures, the Marginal Expected Shortfall
   (MES) and the Component Expected Shortfall ICES), that are estimated by
   a Dynamic Conditional Correlation model (DCC) and by non parametric
   techniques. We use daily data on government bonds yields 10Y and
   quarterly sovereign debts over the period 2001-2013 for eleven Eurozone
   countries. Our results allow us to identify the countries that have the
   highest contribution to systemic risk and to perform comparisons in
   terms of countries' riskiness within the Eurozone.},

Volume = {95},

Pages = {852-867},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objective. We examine the effects of neighborhood walkability on house
   values. Recent research claims that walkability makes homes more
   valuable, ceteris paribus. We contend that some studies report a
   spurious effect of walkability because of differences between areas with
   high and low walkability. Methods. We replicate the positive effect of
   walkability on prices for single-family homes and condominiums in Miami,
   Florida, using a unique data set of house values and characteristics. We
   employ a fixed effects regression model instead of a traditional
   ordinary least squares regression model to account for the unobserved
   heterogeneity of neighborhoods. Results. We find that walkability's
   impact on housing value becomes statistically insignificant at the
   margin after controlling for heteroscedasticity and neighborhood fixed
   effects. Conclusions. The significant impact of the fixed effects
   suggests that something other than walkability is affecting prices and
   that better specified models are needed to discern the real price
   effects of walkability.},

Abstract = {In this paper we theoretically analyse effects of corruption in public
   procurements within a scoring-auction framework. A corrupt politician,
   who acts on behalf of the public sector, receives a kickback from the
   winning bidder. The politician selects the scoring rule. The paper shows
   that such corruption always leads to lower quality and lower price.
   Given a level of corruption, a higher bargaining power of the politician
   in extracting bribes does not affect the quality but leads to higher
   price. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {ELECTION LAW JOURNAL},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Laws that regulate the financing of campaigns are one attempt to
   attenuate the role of money in politics in hopes that citizens' opinions
   will receive more equal consideration when elected officials make policy
   decisions. Do states with stricter campaign finance laws actually
   display more egalitarian patterns of representation? Using public
   opinion measures from the National Annenberg Election Surveys and data
   on state policies, I first demonstrate that state policy decisions are
   consistently more proximate to the opinions of citizens with higher
   incomes. I then evaluate the relationship between the strictness of
   state campaign finance laws and political equality and find evidence
   that states with more stringent campaign finance disclosure requirements
   weigh citizens' opinions more equally in the policymaking process.
   However, I find no statistical relationship between the strictness of
   contribution limits or the presence of a public financing system and the
   equality of political representation.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the formation of transregional families through a
   case study on the attempts by a Maltese nobleman, Giovanni Pio de Piro,
   to establish his household in the Kingdom of Sicily in the eighteenth
   century and what the consequences were for his heirs. Drawing on recent
   perspectives on transregional and transnational families, this paper
   considers the evolution of inheritance and marriage strategies directed
   towards migration in the broader context of eighteenth-century Malta and
   Sicily. In doing so it discusses how those features of kinship most
   commonly associated with the rootedness' of noble households were also
   adapted towards transregional mobility.},

Abstract = {British mathematician Charles Babbage (1791-1871) spent immense energy
   to build mechanical calculating engines. Hoping that it might help him
   in designing and building his engines, he visited numerous workshops and
   factories in both England and Continental Europe. One of the
   consequences of these visits was his On the Economy of Machinery and
   Manufactures, published in 1832. Through his observations, Babbage
   grasped the advantages of machinery and economies of scale. In micro
   terms, he acknowledged the cost-reducing features of economies of
   location, vertical integration, and division of labor - beyond Adam
   Smith's analysis - as well as the efficacy of clustering. He also
   pointed out the relationship between firm size, economic crisis, and
   innovation.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a new method for finding causal relationships in
   spatiotemporal event data with potential applications in conflict
   research, criminology, and epidemiology. The method analyzes how
   different types of interventions affect subsequent levels of reactive
   events. Sliding spatiotemporal windows and statistical matching are used
   for robust and clean causal inference. Thereby, two well-described
   empirical problems in establishing causal relationships in event data
   analysis are resolved: the modifiable areal unit problem and selection
   bias. The paper presents the method formally and demonstrates its
   effectiveness in Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical example by
   showing how instances of civilian assistance to US forces changed in
   response to indiscriminate insurgent violence in Iraq. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Can bottom-up relief efforts lead to recovery after disasters?
   Conventional wisdom and contemporary public policy suggest that major
   crises require centralized authority to provide disaster relief goods.
   Using a novel set of comprehensive donation and expenditure data
   collected from archival records, this paper examines a bottom-up relief
   effort following one of the most devastating natural disasters of the
   nineteenth century: the Chicago Fire of 1871. Findings show that while
   there was no central government relief agency present, individuals,
   businesses, corporate entities and municipal governments were able to
   finance the relief effort though donations. The Chicago Relief and Aid
   Society, a voluntary association of agents with a stake in relief
   outcomes, leveraged organizational assets and constitutional rules to
   administer aid.},

   newspaper coverage also affects parliament. A more detailed analysis
   shows that in Spain, the newspaper that is close to the government is
   ignored by the opposition as a source for parliamentary questions, while
   this newspaper also ignores the attention the opposition pays to
   negative economic developments in its parliamentary questions. In the
   Netherlands, we do not find any differences across newspapers. These
   findings reflect the differences in political and media systems and
   specifically the differences in the levels of consensus-orientation and
   political parallelism between the two countries.},

Title = {Strategic redistribution: The political economy of populism in Latin
   America},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {34},
Pages = {39-51},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Why do some countries in Latin America redistribute too much
   ({''}left-wing populism{''}), while others allow high levels of
   inequality to persist or even increase over time
   ({''}neo-liberalism{''})? We argue that when a group's political
   influence is increasing in its wealth, there is a strategic motive for
   redistribution: by taking money away from a group, its ability to
   influence future policy is reduced. Populism arises when the poor
   respond to this strategic motive, while neo-liberalism results when the
   rich use their wealth to limit redistribution. Assuming that wealth
   increases political influence because it enables a group to stage a
   coup, we find that populism is both more likely and more extreme when
   the military is biased in favor of the rich. We conclude by discussing
   the policies of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and Alberto Fujimori in Peru in
   light of our findings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Islam has emerged as the focus of immigration and diversity debates in
   Europe, especially in relation to the incorporation of Islam within
   political democracy. Using the least-liked group approach, the present
   study investigates political tolerance among Sunni and Alevi Muslims of
   Turkish origin living in Germany and the Netherlands. A relatively low
   level of political tolerance was found with higher intolerance of Alevis
   compared to Sunnis which was due to Alevis' strong rejection of
   religious fundamentalists. For both Muslim subgroups and in both
   countries, stronger religious group identification was associated with
   higher tolerance. Political tolerance was also found to be lower in
   Germany than in the Netherlands and in the latter country tolerance was
   positively associated with host national identification. The findings
   show that Islamic belief, Muslim group identification and the host
   national context are important for political tolerance.},

Abstract = {The offshore islands of Taiwan (Republic of China) are dynamic examples
   of contested metageographies, island spaces caught in between competing
   and opposing interpretations of their identities, relativities, notions
   of sustainability and futures. Three cases - (1) population growth, land
   use conflict, a switch from a military to a tourism economy, and ever
   closer links between mainland China and Kinmen Island; (2) the rejection
   of a move to establish a casino economy on the Penghu archipelago; and
   (3) protests against the storage of spent nuclear waste on Orchid Island
   - are presented as illustrative of such changing topographies,
   themselves reflective of a transition to a more democratic and pluralist
   society in Taiwan. The paper hints at an evolving shift in both vertical
   (top/down) and horizontal (island-to-island) relations in the
   construction of development paths and futures for Taiwan's de facto
   archipelago. This reterritorialization offers a fresh, archipelagic
   repivoting of political geography for and beyond Taiwan. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Several recent studies suggest that transfers from central to regional
   governments are motivated by political considerations. In this paper we
   examine if this is also the case for transfers from regional to central
   governments in the context of the German fiscal equalization system. We
   examine the factors that contribute to differences in tax revenues
   across German states. The evidence indicates that both fiscal incentives
   and political factors can explain these differences, although in Germany
   the former are more important. Moreover, accounting for fiscal
   institutions has important consequences for the empirical assessment of
   political influences on taxation. Overall we find that the political
   affiliation of the state governor is an important factor in explaining
   differences in state tax revenues. Thus, the right-wing party (CDU/CSU)
   is effective in relaxing the tax burden at the state level. In contrast,
   partisan alignment between the state government and the federal
   government loses its importance once fiscal conditions enter the
   empirical model.},

Abstract = {Historically, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have relied on
   mainstream news media to expose human-rights violations and encourage
   governments to pressure the perpetrators. Thanks to the Internet, NGOs
   are crafting new strategies for conducting information politics. Despite
   the obvious democratization of access to the means of communication,
   however, the new media may in fact represent a more challenging
   environment in which to be heard for some groups seeking global
   attention. We draw on agenda-setting research to develop a theory of
   global attention bottlenecks and use it to explain the success of 257
   transnational human-rights groups at generating attention in both
   international mainstream news media and social media outlets. We
   conclude that most NGOs lack the organizational resources to compete
   effectively for either traditional news coverage or for public attention
   and that the Internet is unlikely to resolve the problem of global
   communication.},

Abstract = {This article applies a combination of an input-output content analysis
   and in-depth interviews with nongovernmental organization (NGO)
   communication professionals to determine whether the growing
   incorporation of press releases in editorial print content could be a
   new public forum through which international political actors, such as
   NGOs, could gain wider news access by serving as emerging key players in
   global civil society. The study indicates that Belgian news coverage of
   international aid issues is more often based on NGO press releases than
   government press releases. We also found that the agenda-building
   capacities of NGOs and government institutions are enhanced as
   journalists present information subsidies as original journalistic work
   in most cases. Nonetheless, we must tone down prevailing one-sided
   conclusions, as most press releases are not just copy-pasted. Instead,
   most are supplemented with additional sources and information. The data,
   moreover, identify different journalistic roles of NGOs according to
   their objectives. While some issue press releases to raise short-term
   public awareness and donations for humanitarian crises (mobilization),
   others have developed into established expert news source organizations
   that provide background information and reliable eyewitness accounts to
   journalists.},

Abstract = {The literature on social movements-national and transnational-and social
   media has tended to focus on cases from the global North rather than the
   South, raising questions about its applicability to countries with low
   Internet penetration rates and weak civil societies. To remedy this
   deficit, this article presents the case of the Mexican Stop
   Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) network. In 2010-11, a
   network of about a dozen underfunded copyright and Internet activists
   convinced the Mexican Senate to reject-unanimously-the ACTA, a U.S.-led
   plurilateral treaty that critics claimed would strengthen international
   intellectual property rights at the cost of fundamental Mexican
   Constitutional and human rights. This article argues that this victory
   was the result of activists' use of social media in a way that
   recognized the limits and possibilities within existing Mexican
   political arrangements. While Stop ACTA's success suggests social
   media's utility for social movements in other developing countries, it
   leaves open the question as to whether it can make up for weak civil
   society institutions over the long-term.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the convergence of campaign finance law and
   lobbying law that began in earnest under the Honest Leadership and Open
   Government Act (HLOGA) of 2007. Though the laws governing the field of
   campaign finance have historically been quite distinct from the laws
   governing lobbyingthe former focused on regulating behavior, while the
   latter emphasized disclosure-the two have begun to merge in some key
   areas following the ethics and lobbying scandals associated with the
   Jack Abramoff era. The manuscript documents the history and nature of
   HLOGA, analyzes where HLOGA merged campaign financing with lobbying
   regulation, shows the impact of the Citizens United decision, and
   measures the law's successes and failures in this effort. The study
   reveals some notable accomplishments but also finds several egregious
   shortcomings in the implementation of the law. It concludes with noting
   where and how HLOGA needs to be revisited.},

Title = {The king yields to the village? A micropolitics of statemaking in
   Northwest Vietnam},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {39},
Pages = {1-10},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The village in Vietnam has long been subject of scholarly inquiry and
   site of state power. Too often held apart, these two observations
   together inform this investigation of statemaking in the Northwest
   highlands and micropolitical relations between agencies and villages.
   Essentialized village and state ideas are idioms of power in and around
   socially diverse communities of Dien Bien Phu. Embedding these
   communities in ruling relations locates ideological dimensions of
   statemaking, such as abstract notions of village and state, in their
   generative contexts. Tracing idioms back to conflicted power relations
   engages modern forms of governmentality to reconceptualize political
   tactics, strategies, and technologies as ideologically generative
   practices. Demarcation, for example, is a state tactic that produces
   multiple ethnic, sovereign, and spatial boundaries-ideological forms
   that pose hazards for researchers and subaltern subjects alike. Drawing
   on ethnographic data, I explore my access to and denial from village
   field sites to position the researcher amidst the same power relations
   under study. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {I distinguish four different interpretations of equality of
   opportunity.' We get four interpretations because a neglected ambiguity
   in opportunity' intersects a well-known ambiguity in equality.' The
   neglected ambiguity holds between substantive and non-substantive
   conceptions of opportunity' and the well-known ambiguity holds between
   comparative and non-comparative conceptions of equality.' Among other
   things, distinguishing these four interpretations reveals how misleading
   equal opportunity for advantage' formulations of luck egalitarianism can
   be. These formulations are misleading in so far as they obscure the
   difference between two separate claims about which inequalities are
   consistent with true equality. Luck egalitarianism claims that
   inequalities that have been chosen in some suitable sense are consistent
   with true equality, while the traditional ideal of equality of
   opportunity only claims that inevitable inequalities that have been
   determined through fair competitions are consistent with true equality.
   Obscuring the difference between these two claims therefore serves both
   to arrogate the rhetorical advantages of the traditional ideal to luck
   egalitarianism and to cover over a limitation to luck egalitarianism's
   ambition to provide a comprehensive principle of distributive justice.},

Abstract = {The boundary between Spain and Portugal is supposed to be one of the
   most - if not the most - fixed and stable borders in the world, with
   some authors stating that it has a history of almost a thousand years.
   However, this paper demonstrates that this is not the case by arguing
   that it has a mobile nature. After formulating a theoretical framework
   on borders and border studies, this contribution focuses on the raia
   between Galicia and Portugal as a specific section of the international
   Spanish-Portuguese border; several questions elucidating the mobile
   nature of the raia are answered, embracing historic, geographic, social,
   cultural, linguistic and economic issues. The paper finishes by
   considering the effects of the new period of European integration and by
   providing some concluding remarks.},

Title = {First steps toward a nonideal theory of justice},
Journal = {ETHICS \& GLOBAL POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {95-117},
Abstract = {Theorists have long debated whether John Rawls' conception of justice as
   fairness can be extended to nonideal (i.e. unjust) social and political
   conditions, and if so, what the proper way of extending it is. This
   paper argues that in order to properly extend justice as fairness to
   nonideal conditions, Rawls' most famous innovation{*} the original
   position{*} must be reconceived in the form of a `nonideal original
   position'. I begin by providing a new analysis of the ideal/nonideal
   theory distinction within Rawls' theoretical framework. I then
   systematically construct a nonideal original position, showing that
   although its parties must have Rawls' principles of ideal justice and
   priority relations as background aims, the parties should be entirely
   free to weigh those aims against whatever burdens and benefits they
   might face under nonideal conditions. Next, I show that the parties
   ought to aim to secure for themselves a special class of nonideal
   primary goods: all-purpose goods similar to Rawls' original primary
   goods, but which in this case are all-purpose goods individuals might
   use to (a) promote Rawlsian ideals under nonideal conditions, (b) weigh
   Rawls' principles of ideal justice and priority relations against
   whatever burdens and benefits they might face under nonideal conditions,
   and (c) effectively pursue their most favored weighting thereof.
   Finally, I defend a provisional list of nonideal primary goods, and
   briefly speculate on how the parties to the nonideal original position
   might deliberate to principles of nonideal justice for distributing
   them.},

Title = {Micro-Geopolitics: Capitalising Security in Laos's Golden Quadrangle},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {377-405},
Abstract = {Enclosure, dispossession and displacement loom large in current debates
   about the recent boom in transnational farmland deals, and about Chinese
   agribusiness for export in particular. Often under-examined, however,
   are the ways that legacies of geopolitical conflict shape the inevitably
   uneven distribution of enclosure, dispossession and displacement. This
   paper constructs a case of these micro-geopolitical' legacies by
   examining a Chinese rubber planting promotion' project in northwestern
   Laos's emerging Golden Quadrangle' development region. It argues that
   longstanding concerns about security inform the ways that local
   authorities deploy investment projects that are otherwise seen as
   examples of foreign' land grabbing. Further, it shows that while the
   geographical aims of foreign agribusiness mesh with state-mediated
   resettlement efforts (a darker spin on the narrative of win-win'
   cooperation), these activities often precede current land deals rather
   than result from them. Chinese agribusiness in Laos's upland interior
   thus appears less as a driver of displacement than a means for
   attempting to secure in place a particular (if precarious) configuration
   of population and security.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the spatial relationship between national and
   European regional policies. Spatial coherence of these two types of
   policies in two CEE countries - in the Czech Republic and Slovakia is
   discussed. Our findings point at a higher spatial coherence of national
   and European regional policy in Slovakia. Thus, there is a higher
   financial allocation per 1 inhabitant in the nationally delimitated
   areas of special interest in Slovakia compared with the Czech Republic.
   Three aspects are discussed in this regard. First, different strategies
   of the delimitation of the areas of special interest in the both
   countries are emphasised. Second, different strategies of the
   implementation of the areas of special interest in programming documents
   in the both countries are upheld. Third, the factor of territorial
   absorption capacity is mentioned. We claim that the three aspects should
   be considered in achieving a higher spatial coherence of national and
   European regional policies.},

Abstract = {This article examines the dialectics of wrongful life and wrongful birth
   claims in Israel from 1986 until 2012. In May 2012 Israeli Supreme Court
   declared that while wrongful birth claims were still permitted, wrongful
   life claims were no longer accepted in a court of law. The article
   examines the conditions that allowed for and supported the expansion of
   wrongful life/birth claims until 2012. The article identifies two
   parallel dynamics of expansion: a broadening of the scope of negligent
   conduct and a view of milder forms of disabilities as damage that merits
   compensation. The article further suggests four explanations for such
   doctrinal evolution, two of which emanate from doctrinal ambiguities and
   the other two are rooted in social factors that have shaped the meaning
   of disability as a tragedy and state of inferiority. While recent
   developments seem promising, the article concludes with a word of
   caution. Such changes may reproduce past injustices mainly because the
   compensation mechanism has remained an individual-torts based one, which
   may run counter to the broader struggle for social change for disabled
   people.},

Title = {Geopolitical Maize: Peasant Seeds, Everyday Practices, and Food Security
   in Mexico},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},

Pages = {406-430},
Abstract = {This paper draws from research on small-scale maize production in
   Mexico's Central Highland region to discuss the geopolitical
   implications of everyday agricultural practices. An overwhelming
   majority of maize farmers in this region, as well as in the country more
   broadly, continue to cultivate locally adapted maize varieties they have
   bred themselves - criollo maize is the vernacular term - despite decades
   of concerted government attempts to effect the widespread adoption of
   commercially bred and licensed hybrid varieties. This state effort to
   restructure agricultural systems and food security according to
   nationalist and capitalist priorities is one tactic in a long and
   violent struggle for control over peasant land and labour in Mexico. By
   integrating feminist scholarship in geopolitics and in political
   ecology, I am following the lead of geographers who regard the
   materialities of everyday life as a foundation for political tensions
   and conflicts that are constantly unfolding along intersecting lines of
   difference. Though geopolitics has rarely turned its attention directly
   to theories of intimate socio-ecological relations, I argue that the
   field has much analytical and political leverage to gain by engaging
   with political ecology, and that feminist geographic imaginaries provide
   a crucial space in which to do so. This approach allows for an analysis
   of how a dominant geopolitics of land and agriculture is being
   undermined through the routine production of criollo maize, revealing
   new potential for creating broad political alliances with social
   movements that are currently working toward alternative visions of
   agriculture and food security.},

Abstract = {Using data from the 2008 and 2009 Current Population Survey (CPS)
   conducted by the United States Census Bureau, this article assesses the
   year-over-year change in the civic engagement of citizens in America's
   largest metropolitan areas. Of special interest are Denver and Seattle,
   where the Rocky Mountain News and Seattle Post-Intelligencer closed
   during the intervening year. The data from the CPS indicate that civic
   engagement in Seattle and Denver dropped significantly from 2008 to
   2009-a decline that is not consistently replicated over the same time
   period in other major American cities that did not lose a newspaper. The
   analysis suggests that this decline may plausibly be attributed to the
   newspaper closures in Seattle and Denver. This short-term negative
   effect is concerning, and whether it lasts warrants future attention.},

Abstract = {This chapter examines the reaction of the Israeli political-military
   elite to the Arab spring. Israel has always presented itself as an
   island of democracy in a sea of authoritarianism. One would have
   therefore expected Israel to welcome the pro-democracy movements that
   began to sweep through the region in early 2011. In fact, the reaction
   has been negative at all levels of Israeli society. Two main factors are
   put forward to explain this negative reaction. The first factor has to
   do with the politics of identity. Israelis think that their values and
   their culture make them part of Europe and they have no desire to become
   part of the Middle East. The second factor is the fear that the
   transition from dictatorship to democracy will generate instability and
   undermine Israel's security. The article focuses more specifically on
   the impact of the Arab Spring on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It
   shows how turmoil around its borders has led Israel to stiffen further
   its terms for a settlement with the Palestinians. It concludes that the
   Arab Spring has widened the gulf between Israel and its Arab neighbours
   and deepened its conflict with the Palestinians.},

Abstract = {Static inventory models pertaining to optimal order quantity for the
   single relevant period have been developed in this chapter. These
   problems become particularly challenging if the item is expensive and
   the demand during the period is probabilistic. A number of situations
   where these models are applicable have been outlined. Models for items
   procured for consumption such as insurance spares to be ordered along
   with the ordering of main equipment have been developed with or without
   salvage value. MTBF-based approach using cumulative Poisson probability
   is proposed if data on probability of demand is not easily available. In
   the case of items stocked for sale to maximize the total expected
   profit, the model has been presented as a kind of famous ``Newsboy{''}
   Problem. For normal distribution of demand, a simpler approach employing
   normal distribution tables has been shown to be very handy. For
   multi-item problems with budget or space constraint, a model based on
   the method of Lagrange multipliers has been presented with an iterative
   solution methodology. The value of Lagrange multiplier is shown to be
   the shadow price per unit of resource constraint and can be very
   insightful for rationally addressing the issue of adding extra budget or
   increasing storage space.},

Abstract = {Objective. Many social policies and academic studies assume that
   education is ``the great equalizer{''} that is capable of counteracting
   the unequal social resources of different demographic groups. This study
   aims to determine whether non-Hispanic whites and racial/ethnic
   minorities indeed experience comparable health benefits with greater
   educational attainment. Methods. Data from the National Health Interview
   Survey 1997-2012 were used to conduct ordered logistic models comparing
   the self-rated health of 518,288 non-Hispanic whites and racial/ethnic
   minorities aged 30-65 across the full spectrum of educational
   attainment. Results. Educational attainment was found to affect the
   health of whites more than minorities, even with the inclusion of a wide
   range of potential sociodemographic, behavioral, and economic mediators.
   Conclusion. We discuss the possibility that unmeasured variables, such
   as childhood environment and other individual characteristics, are
   responsible for the stronger effect of education for whites than
   minorities, and what the implications are for future policy and
   research.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {36},
Pages = {209-227},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Can multinational firms exert more power than national firms by
   influencing politics through lobbying? To answer this question, we
   analyze the extent of national environmental regulation when policy is
   determined in a lobbying game between a government and a firm. We
   compare the resulting equilibrium regulation levels, outputs and welfare
   in a game with a multinational firm with those in an otherwise identical
   game with a national firm. For low transportation costs, output and
   pollution of a national firm are always as least as high as for a
   multinational; this changes for high transportation costs and
   intermediate damage parameters. When there is no lobbying, welfare
   levels. are always higher with multinationals than with national firms.
   However, the existence of lobbying may reverse this ordering. (C) 2014

Abstract = {This paper examines the role that political factors play in the
   investment location decisions of multinational enterprises. It has been
   found that foreign direct investors shy away from countries with
   excessive government spending, especially when this spending is directed
   towards the military. They also seem to have a slight preference for
   leftist executives and be negatively predisposed toward situations in
   which the ruling party has held power for prolonged periods of time.
   Ceteris paribus, more FDI flows to countries that have presidential
   systems, established political parties and where the party of the
   executive controls all houses with lawmaking powers. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper uses inter-country panel data from 1990 through 2010 to
   examine how the occurrence of natural disasters affects corruption
   within the public sector. For a closer analysis, disaster is classified
   into various categories, including general floods, other floods,
   tropical storms, other storms, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and
   landslides. Furthermore, this paper explores whether natural disasters
   have different impacts on corruption levels in developed and developing
   countries. The study reveals a number of novel findings. (1) Natural
   disasters that cause substantial damage increase public sector
   corruption in both developing and developed countries. (2) Natural
   disasters have a greater impact on public sector corruption in developed
   countries than in developing countries. (3) In developed countries,
   natural disaster frequency has a significant impact on the level of
   corruption. Hence, foreseeable disasters increase corruption in general.
   In developed countries, an incentive may exist to live within
   disaster-prone areas because of the potential for disaster compensation
   payments.},

Abstract = {Recent studies discuss the link between climate change and violent
   conflict, especially for East Africa. While there is extensive
   literature on the question whether climate change increase the risk of
   violent conflict onset, not much is known about where a climate-conflict
   link is most likely to be found. We address this question by analyzing
   the spatial distribution of the factors commonly associated with a high
   exposure and vulnerability to climate change, and a high risk of violent
   conflict onset in Kenya and Uganda. Drawing on recent literature and
   quantitative data for the period 1998-2008, we develop various
   specifications of a composite risk index (CRI) with a spatial resolution
   of half a degree for Kenya and Uganda in the year 2008. A quantitative
   comparison with conflict data for the year 2008 provides support for the
   composite risk index. Finally, the composite risk index is contrasted
   with the findings of three qualitative case studies, which provide mixed
   support for the index and help to identify its strengths and weaknesses
   as well as conceptual needs for further quantitative studies on climate
   change and violent conflict. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The cross-country correlation between social trust and income equality
   is well documented, but few studies examine the direction of causality.
   We show theoretically that by facilitating cooperation, trust may lead
   to more equal outcomes, while the feedback from inequality to trust is
   ambiguous. Using a structural equation model estimated on a large
   country sample, we find that trust has a positive effect on both market
   and net income equality. Larger welfare states lead to higher net
   equality but neither net income equality nor welfare state size seems to
   have a causal effect on trust. We conclude that while trust facilitates
   welfare state policies that may reduce net inequality, this decrease in
   inequality does not increase trust. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {In 1967 the Church of Scientology's tax-exempt status was revoked on the
   basis that it failed to meet the criteria outlined in section 501(c)(3)
   of the Internal Revenue Service. Between its loss, and eventual
   reacquisition in 1993, the Church of Scientology employed a number of
   political based tactics in an attempt to legitimize itself to the public
   sector. This article explores these tactics in relation to the
   religion's use of perception management. The article argues that the
   processes of both legal recognition and legitimization draw upon each
   other in a new faith's transition to mainstream theology. In this, the
   Church employed perception management in attempt to influence both
   processes. In exploring this, the paper contributes to our understanding
   of role that public legitimacy plays in a new faith's development.},

Abstract = {The reaction to the law legalising same-sex marriage in France shocked
   the nation and the world in 2013. Opposition to the law seemed to join
   forces with a plethora of new right-wing activist groups, leading to
   mass demonstrations, violence in the streets of Paris and even to a
   death in the cathedral of Notre Dame. The social unrest can be explained
   in part by the increasing pressures of economic recession and the
   emergence of the far right as a mainstream but divisive political force;
   still, the level of passion that the law unleashed seems puzzling. A
   more profound explanation of that passion is that the law opened a deep
   faultline that has divided France throughout its modern history the
   concept of its national identity. Contemporary France is troubled by
   frequent comparisons to the political ferment and disastrous turmoil of
   the 1930s. Diametrically opposed moral visions of national identity seem
   to recall, above all, the annees noires, the dark years of German
   Occupation when the Vichy regime attempted to regenerate France though
   its National Revolution while also pursuing a policy of collaboration.
   Social reform in France, particularly any reform relating to perceptions
   of national identity, is still today overshadowed by the legacy of
   Vichy's moral vision and its attempt to create a New Man for a New
   Order. This paper will explore that legacy.},

Abstract = {Using data from a 2013 telephone survey in Hong Kong (N = 850), we
   investigate how interpersonal and imagined contact with gays and
   lesbians affects attitudes toward gay people and gay rights. We also
   study the demographic correlates of interpersonal contact with gays and
   lesbians, as well as the correlates of attitudes toward gay people and
   gay rights. For all demographic groups, we found strong associations
   between interpersonal contact and favorable attitudes. Using a split
   ballot experiment, we found that asking respondents to imagine contact
   with a same-sex couple produced more favorable attitudes among
   respondents who had no prior interpersonal contact with gay people. For
   individuals who had prior interpersonal contact with gay people,
   imagined contact had no effect.},

Title = {Predicting violence within genocide: A model of elite competition and
   ethnic segregation from Rwanda},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {34-45},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Can we predict when and where violence will likely break out within
   cases of genocide? I present a theoretical model to help identify areas
   susceptible and resistant to violence during genocide. The model
   conceptualizes violence onset as a function of elite competition for
   control of the state from above and the ethnic segregation of society
   from below. First, in areas where extremist elite control is weak,
   violence is delayed or averted because a contest for control between
   pro-violence elites and anti-violence moderates arises and the
   competition takes time to resolve. Where control is strong, violence is
   immediate or early because extremists face little competition and can
   rapidly deploy the states coercive resources against targeted groups.
   Second, in areas where the integration of ethnic groups is high,
   violence is delayed because it takes time to break existing interethnic
   bonds and destroy bridging social capital. Cohesive communities resist
   elite attempts to divide them through interethnic trust and cooperation.
   I test the model by examining sub-national variation in genocide onset
   across Rwanda's 145 communes using new data and duration analysis. I
   additionally explore causal mechanisms by within-case analyses comparing
   early and late onset in two communes. The findings have implications for
   international policy makers as they respond to genocides and
   strategically prioritize limited intervention resources. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {Kaldor's 1970 paper `The Case for Regional Policies' was republished in
   the 60th anniversary volume of the Scottish Journal of Political
   Economy. This article reflects on the model after more than 40 years,
   and argues that although it has been criticized for its deterministic
   nature, it has lost none of its relevance. It predates the ideas of
   so-called `new' growth theory, and the new economic geography of
   Krugman, and provides at least a partial explanation of why growth rates
   and levels of per capita income between regions and between countries
   can continue to persist and even widen in contrast to the predictions of
   orthodox equilibrium theory.},

Abstract = {This paper studies empirically the voting outcomes of Egypt's first
   parliamentary elections after the Arab Spring. In light of the strong
   Islamist success at the polls, we explore the main determinants of
   Islamist versus secular voting. We identify two dimensions that affect
   voting outcomes at the constituency level: socioeconomic profile and the
   electoral institutional framework. Our results show that education is
   negatively associated with Islamist voting. Interestingly, we find
   significant evidence suggesting that higher poverty levels are
   associated with a lower vote share for Islamist parties. Exploiting the
   sequential voting setup, we show that later voting stages have not
   resulted in stronger support for the already winning Islamist parties
   (i.e., there is no bandwagon effect).},

Journal = {EUROPEAN HISTORY QUARTERLY},

Volume = {44},
Number = {3},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Among the vast network of POW camps established in Germany during the
   Second World War were two quite extraordinary camps known as holiday
   camps, Ferienlager. One of them was for Other Ranks and was located in
   Genshagen just outside Berlin; the other, for officers, was in Steinburg
   in Bavaria. This article investigates the origins and development of
   these camps, which offered their prisoners short-term respite from the
   rigours of life in work detachments or from the tedium of POW life. It
   uses the history of these camps, established and run solely for British
   and Commonwealth POWs, to consider the place of Britain in German
   strategic thinking during the war. Beyond that, it relates the history
   of the camps to the changing dynamics of the Third Reich and its
   polycratic' power structures, in particular the competition among the
   security agencies, the Wehrmacht, and the German Foreign Office for
   influence in POW matters. Finally, the article seeks to assess the role
   of the camps in German efforts to win British POWs for the
   anti-Bolshevik cause, and it offers explanations for the failure to
   achieve that goal.},

Abstract = {The Woolwich attack in May 2013 has led to a spate of hate crimes
   committed against Muslim communities in the United Kindom. These
   incidents include Muslim women being targeted for wearing the headscarf
   and mosques being vandalized. While street level Islamophobia remains an
   important area of investigation, an equally disturbing picture is
   emerging with the rise in online anti-Muslim abuse. This article argues
   that online Islamophobia must be given the same level of attention as
   street level Islamophobia. It examines 500 tweets from 100 different
   Twitter users to examine how Muslims are being viewed and targeted by
   perpetrators of online abuse via the Twitter search engine, and offers a
   typology of offender characteristics.},

Volume = {60},

Abstract = {The role of advertising in the production of political campaigns
   deserves more consideration than it has previously received. My study
   examines advertising agencies associated with election campaigns in the
   1970s and 1980s, investigating their decisions to accept or reject
   political accounts. Focusing on Britain and Australia, and using a range
   of primary sources including the industry press, interviews and memoirs,
   I demonstrate that an agency's decision to accept a political account is
   always complex, contested and highly contingent. Accepting a political
   account may alienate clients and agency staff who support another party.
   Campaigns are labour-intensive and may detract from an agency's core
   business. Involvement in a losing campaign can damage an agency's
   reputation, just as association with a successful one may attract
   clients. Agencies are often unsure how to approach political advertising
   where traditional techniques may not be suitable. Such concerns about
   accepting a political account will likely be put aside where an agency
   principal has close personal ties to a party or leader.},

Title = {``Where is the border?{''} Villagers, environmental consultants and the
   `work' of the Thai-Burma border},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {40},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article examines how Thai Burma border residents are enrolled and
   engaged in remaking the political border through their knowledge
   practices and performances, or their own ``borderwork{''}. Border
   residents do not perform this work alone, but in connection with other
   actors including environmental consultants. In order to highlight this
   co-production of the political border, I bring together border studies
   scholarship that see borders as process and performance with work in
   science studies that has highlighted the way that knowledge and order
   are co-produced. The importance of this approach is that it facilitates
   an understanding of the multifaceted and contradictory work to remake
   the border by multiple actors, a way to study ``borders from the bottom
   up{''} that illustrates how the border is continually enacted. While
   this article puts forth the notion that the border represents an
   important site and process of struggle and negotiation in which
   marginalized communities invest, it also questions the assumption that
   because residents are engaged in remaking the border, the border is
   necessarily more `democratic'. The discussion and empirical data
   presented in this article also speak to broader debates in political
   geography about how borders are remade through practice and performance.

   committee headed by Lord Justice Brian Leveson in Britain. It is argued
   that the existing situation in Britain is far from satisfactory, and
   that the press should advance more elaborate mechanisms of self-control,
   establishing a new regulatory body called Public and Press Council that
   will be anchored in law, and funded by organizations that are
   independent from government and the media. The new independent regulator
   should be empowered with greater and unprecedented authority, and with
   substantive sanctioning abilities.},

Abstract = {This study examines whether news is more or less homogeneous online than
   in print across agenda-setting news outlets in the United States,
   Denmark, and France. Examining similarities and differences in the
   genres, topics, and authors of news in each country's leading
   newspapers, it finds little evidence of greater online homogeneity in
   any country. U.S. news outlets are more differentiated online than in
   print, while French news outlets have similar levels of print and online
   differentiation. Online data for Denmark reveal no consistent pattern in
   the direction of either homogeneity or differentiation. These findings
   suggest that the differentiating effects of the online environment are
   strongest in countries (e.g., the United States) where media markets are
   being restructured to include more direct competition between
   agenda-setting news outlets at the national level. By contrast,
   countries (e.g., France and, to a lesser degree, Denmark) with high
   levels of print differentiation have similarly high levels online due to
   the path-dependent effects of their national media systems.},
