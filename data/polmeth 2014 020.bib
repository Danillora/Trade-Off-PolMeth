Abstract = {Ultimately, Obama's decision on escalation tried to square a circle -
   authorizing a rapid and large troop `surge' that would be closely
   followed by a drawdown and withdrawal. With the US public tiring of
   open-ended commitments, the war in Afghanistan would now be tied to
   Washington's clock. As the limitations of counterinsurgency in
   Afghanistan became clear, the US strategy reverted to its original aim
   of simply keeping the United States safe. The rise of targeted killings
   by drones meant that knowing the Afghan landscape outside of airborne
   cameras and target lists became less and less important. Mirroring the
   Iraq withdrawal, Obama declared that it was time to begin
   `nation-building at home', ensuring that large-scale intervention with
   troops would not become emblematic of Obama's approach to intervention.},

Title = {Bleak Prospects? Varieties of Europessimism and their Application to the
   Eurozone Debt Crisis and the Future of Integration},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Pages = {393-408},
Abstract = {This article argues that pessimistic analyses of integration constitute
   a distinct category of critique separate from euro-scepticism or the
   democratic deficit literature. Drawing on an interdisciplinary analysis
   of law, political science, and international relations theory, three
   strands of europessimism are identified: realist, federalist, and
   social-democratic. The analysis of these varieties examines how the
   grounds for europessimism differ and how these can be applied to
   understand the causes and consequences of the Eurozone sovereign debt
   crisis. This application reveals how europessimism finds its vindication
   whilst also exposing evolution in how pessimistic each analytical
   tradition is. Indeed, whereas realism has never been optimistic about
   integration the article shows how federalism and social democracy are
   associated with optimistic or transformative visions of integration.
   Yet, the analysis concludes by showing the increasing pessimism of the
   social democratic tradition alongside the enduring optimism of
   federalism. By extension, the conceptual analysis of europessimism
   promises to have applications for the study of other research questions
   in European integration.},

Title = {The absence of political constitutionalism in the EU: three models for
   enhancing constitutional agency},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {21},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1163-1180},
Abstract = {This article argues that EU constitutionalization has taken place in the
   absence of political constitutionalism. This concept is defined as the
   ability of citizens and member states to act as ongoing constitutional
   agents in determining the evolution of individual rights and national
   prerogatives. A historical comparison with Swiss and American
   constitutional development is used to show the development of two forms
   of political constitutionalism: respectively, direct democracy and
   presidentialization. These mechanisms allowed territorial units and
   citizens to influence major constitutional debate outside parliamentary
   channels. However, attempts to replicate these forms of political
   constitutionalism in the EU are impractical and undesirable because they

Title = {The Role of Emotions in Discriminatory Ethno-Religious Politics: An
   Experimental Study of Anti-Muslim Politics in the United States},
Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {583-603},
Abstract = {There is consensus among scholars of ethno-religious conflict that
   elites play a pivotal role in either starting or exacerbating intergroup
   conflicts by evoking negative emotions such as fear, resentment, anger,
   and rage in the masses. However, scholars have long based these
   assertions on evidence from elite actions alone. Moreover, despite
   insights from research on nationalism about the role that positive
   emotions play in the process of mobilization, current research on
   ethno-religious conflict has focused exclusively on negative emotions.
   The current study addresses these gaps. Building upon symbolic politics
   theory and psychological theories of transformational leadership, I
   posit that to gain support for aggressive policies against rival groups,
   leaders must simultaneously evoke negative emotions associated with
   dislike for the rival group and positive emotions such as confidence,
   pride, optimism, and feeling energized. I tested this theory with an
   experiment that randomly exposed participants to different anti-Muslim
   appeals that culminated in the proposal of an array of discriminatory
   policies. The results suggest a causal chain. Upon hearing any
   anti-Muslim frame, those already holding negative attitudes about
   Muslims were more likely to view Muslims as a threat and experience a
   positive emotional response, which then led to support for
   discriminatory policies against Muslims. These findings suggest the way
   nationalist appeals are framed are much less important than pre-existing
   attitudes.},

Abstract = {In this article I examine and discuss development of the security
   concept in the High North from the turn of the millennium to 2010.
   Norway's ambitious political undertaking in 2005, now known as the High
   North Initiative, and activation of discursive processes whereby
   security of the High North attracted greater attention became intrinsic
   to a widening array of policy issues. My objective is to show how
   current security perceptions are coloured by the past, and that
   conceptions and understandings of security are relational and open to
   continual change. The analysis is based on empirical data derived from
   Norwegian primary texts and Norwegian media through a large data set of
   1,133 newspaper articles. Analytically, the article combines a
   Foucauldian discourse analysis with elements of the Copenhagen School's
   securitization theory.},

Abstract = {The outbreak of a wave of people power revolts, starting in Tunisia in
   December 2010 and spreading quickly throughout the Middle East and North
   Africa, caused unprecedented instability in a politically sensitive
   region. Like a sudden volcanic eruption, the conflagration was as
   stunning as it was surprising, triggering major societal upheavals from
   Libya and Egypt to Yemen, Bahrain and Syria, apart from leading to
   political changes in other regional states such as Kuwait, Jordan,
   Morocco, Kuwait, Lebanon and Oman. The revolts or the Arab Spring, as
   they are popularly referred to in the media, are in effect the Arab
   Revolution and one of modern history's unexpected political phenomena.
   They also put to severe test the United Nations' experiment in the
   fledgling international relations doctrine known as the Responsibility
   to Protect (R2P), adopted by the world body just 5 years earlier in
   2005. R2P was designed to bridge the gulf between naked unilateral
   international intervention as in the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, on
   the one hand, and international helplessness in the face of mass
   atrocity crimes within the borders of sovereign states, on the other.
   R2P would permit and justify international intervention only as a last
   resort-when states fail, are unwilling, or are even breaching their
   responsibility to protect their own people through state-induced mass
   atrocity crimes. R2P was invoked for the first time by the UN during the
   Arab Uprisings, but quickly became controversial for leading to regime
   change in Libya. The subsequent backlash against R2P saw many countries
   opposed to its application in Syria and is widely seen as the key cause
   of the current political stalemate in the UN. Attempts to unblock the
   diplomatic logjam at the UN has given rise to a new initiative known as
   `responsibility while protecting' (RWP). But is RWP a counter-response
   to roll back R2P, or is it a move to better implement R2P as the new
   doctrine to resolve the international community's dilemma over human
   suffering?},

Abstract = {The wave of Arab revolts in the Middle East and North Africa since
   December 2010 is the most significant outbreaks of inter-related
   uprisings at the dawn of the twenty-first century. Popularly known as
   the Arab Spring, the Arab Uprisings as it should be more appropriately
   called, have engulfed the wider international community in the most
   intense diplomatic wars in the modern era. Global concerns over the
   outbreak of atrocities and the destabilising effects of the revolts have
   led to high-level realpolitik pitting two major camps-those who are
   pushing for international intervention to protect civilian populations
   led largely by the West and industrialised North versus those who are
   resisting this push in the name of state sovereignty and the principle
   of non-interference led mainly by Russia, China and the developing
   South. For the first time, the Arab world has been openly split, as Arab
   brethrens are forced to take sides against Arab brethrens, even
   advocating intervention in Libya and Syria and finding themselves as
   bedfellows with the Western powers. The revolt of the masses in the
   Middle East-or West Asia as some would prefer to call the region-is yet
   to come to an end. But the intense power politics in the UN suggest that
   the future of the Middle East will be defined more by the Permanent Five
   than the Arab world itself.},

Abstract = {The strategic culture of the Republic of Korea (ROK or South Korea) is
   based on three pillars: attaining prosperity and strength as an enduring
   national purpose and objective; countering the existential North Korean
   threat; and maintaining a strong alliance with the United States. This
   strategic culture is grounded in history, especially in Koreans' sense
   of themselves as an ancient and homogeneous people, the minjok, and in a
   constructed martial heritage. Keepers of strategic culture include the
   national security establishment, the National Assembly, the media, the
   public, and the United States, but the most important keeper is the
   president, who ultimately defines South Korea's strategic interests and
   how they should be attained or guarded. Contemporary illustrations of
   South Korean strategic culture in action include defence reform
   measures, shifts in the American alliance, and the `crisis of 2013',
   which included a North Korean nuclear test and extreme threats of war.
   This article reinforces the view that while strategic culture may be a
   universal concept, in its operationalized and practised form, the true
   value of the concept is that the unique and particularistic
   characteristics that define each specific strategic cultural tradition
   are placed at the centre of analysis. South Korea's strategic culture is
   unique, but if there is an aspect that can be applied to other nations
   it is that shared historical memory and public historiography are
   crucial factors that inform that nation's strategic culture.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},

Pages = {101-115},
Abstract = {An increasing complexity and heavy reliance on research in the
   formulation of public policy is the backdrop to the ongoing
   politicization of science. Issues and problems around the accessibility,
   credibility, legitimacy and accountability of expertise are greatly
   aggravated in supranational policy arenas. While antidemocratic dangers
   have traditionally been emphasized with regard to technocratic
   policy-making, such dangers coexist with the perils of scientific
   irresponsibility - or irrelevance - and an unprecedented level and scope
   of expertise-backed lobbying in policy-making across both the domestic
   and supranational arenas. A dramatic example of these perils is the
   battle over climate change policy agendas. The large number of think
   tanks and think tank networks involved in climate change policy
   skepticism can be considered central in this regard. Such networks are
   designed to promote or to disrupt political discourse. Although many
   individual think tanks and network relationships do not give cause for
   particular concern, the combination of powerful expert, consulting and
   lobby/advocacy capacities that rely on organized think tank
   infrastructures implies a growing need for closer attention to think
   tank models in public policy analysis. A new approach to think tank
   network studies will be useful to develop an agenda for a second
   generation of cooperative transnational think tank studies capable of
   engaging with the cross-border dimensions of the knowledge-interest
   nexus of ideas and orientations.},

Abstract = {As evident from the studies of international organizations, several
   factors can potentially influence the process of policy innovation and
   claim causality. The collective or individual interest and power of
   member states, leadership and preferences of staff members, need for
   resource mobilization, or the intersubjective quality of norms as an
   intervening mechanism may influence the process of policymaking and
   change policies. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the potential
   causes of policy innovation based on core assumptions of the theories of
   international relations in order to develop a framework for the analysis
   of the UNDP's engagement with the private sector. The section on
   constructivism in particular conceptualizes the significance of
   intersubjectivity and CSR norms in shaping international organizations'
   policies and strategies.},

Title = {Leadership styles: relationship with conflict management styles},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {214-225},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship
   between leadership styles and conflict management styles among managers,
   while handling interpersonal conflict (mangers and subordinates).
   Design/methodology/approach - Middle-level managers (N = 150) from
   different private sector manufacturing industries were included in the
   study to seek responses through questionnaire based on instruments for
   conflict management and leadership styles.
   Findings - Managers who perceived to exhibit more on transformational
   leadership style adopted integrating and obliging style of conflict
   management. Those who perceived to exhibit more on transactional style
   opted for compromising style of conflict management. Whereas, managers
   perceived to exhibit laissez-faire leadership style adopted avoiding
   style to manage conflicts with subordinates.
   Originality/value - Despite the universal acceptance of leadership
   importance in corporate settings, research so far investigated
   leadership styles as determinants of conflict management styles are
   population-specific, including nursing managers (Hendel, 2005),
   university academic staff (Paul, 2006) and healthcare professionals
   (Saeed, 2008). Furthermore, the findings in the referred studies are not
   consistent, and this issue seems to be at an exploratory phase that
   requires further investigation to establish the relationship. Blake and
   Mouton (1964) and Rahim (1992) tried to measure the strategies in which
   individuals typically deal with the conflicts. This approach treated
   conflict styles as individual disposition, stable over time and across
   situations. It is argued and supported by literature that leadership
   styles or behaviors remain stable over time and are expected to be
   significantly related to conflict management styles (Hendel, 2005).},

Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3},
Pages = {286-302},
Abstract = {A physical and psychological separation between intent and outcome of
   aid programmes in Afghanistan makes aid and development increasingly at
   risk of capture by alternative interests and less tied to actual
   outcomes. Physical risk mitigation has led to a partial insulation from
   a surrounding perceived threat but consequently also from recipient
   communities. In many cases, it has become doing things `to' and `at',
   rather than `with' and `for' - in other words output over outcome.
   Building on extensive fieldwork in Afghanistan, this article seeks to
   explain how remoteness develops in the Afghan aid context and highlight
   some of its implications. The primary problem is the creation of
   `demonitored space' - a section of the operational environment that
   contains the illusion of monitoring and control but that in reality has
   been surrendered to alternative interests. This space requires closing
   with context-specific solutions and increased contact with the point of
   implementation - not increased isolation and remoteness.},

Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE POLITICA INTERNACIONAL},

Volume = {57},

Pages = {77-97},
Abstract = {Brazil's rapprochement with Africa during the last decade has been
   mostly explained as an attempt to improve political dialogue, raise
   economic interactions, and provide technical cooperation assistance.
   This article, however, argues that such framework does not sufficiently
   account for the use of Brazilian material resources in order to attain
   harder strategic goals towards the continent. By focusing on defense
   cooperation ties, it highlights an important niche in South-South
   relations that has also grown exponentially, with important consequences
   on how Brazil exerts power across the Atlantic.},

Abstract = {This paper examines foreign policy change, identifying structural
   parameters of domestic and international origins that bring about major
   foreign policy shifts. Domestic structural parameters comprise the
   politico-institutional setting and advocacy groups in support of
   alternative foreign policy options. International structural parameters
   refer on the one hand to systemic changes that may bring about foreign
   policy realignment and, on the other hand, to the country's role in the
   international system and its interactions with other countries that may
   activate foreign policy changes. We posit that this eclectic approach is
   necessary to account for major, multidimensional and complex, foreign
   policy decisions. We use this analytical framework to examine the
   Israeli re-orientation that enabled the signing of the Oslo Peace
   Agreement in the early 1990s.},

Abstract = {While politicians are often seen as being motivated by narrow
   self-interest, this article offers an alternative view. The relationship
   between two pro-social dimensions - Commitment to the Public Interest
   (CPI) and User Orientation (UO) - and behavioural outcomes among local
   councillors is analyzed. The raison d'etre for the local councils is to
   define the public interest. In line with this, CPI, which is directed
   towards doing good for the public interest, is associated with working
   hours and political influence; this is much less so for UO, which is
   directed towards doing good for individual citizens. Behavioural
   outcomes are thus greater if there is a fit between the personal
   motivation and the organizational environment. This has implications for
   democracy, as a fit could lead to a race to the top. The data are based
   on a survey of local councillors in Denmark in 2009.},

Abstract = {Gradual transformative policy change has attracted increasing attention
   in recent times. However, existing explanations for the evolvement of
   the various modes of such change do not account for the direction and
   content of change and also have difficulty with more complex policy
   change processes in which several modes are employed. Ideational
   analysis can fill this gap, albeit most ideational research does not
   address gradual policy and ideational changes. Based on a process
   tracing of two cases from Israeli immigration policy, this article
   argues that a low level of discretion and a strong status quo bias are
   conditions that enable institutional conversion through layering.
   Ideational change in policy solution and problem definition ideas, and
   the interaction between the two, can explain this pattern and its
   direction. The article not only expands our knowledge of gradual
   transformative change, but also moves ideational research a step beyond
   punctuated equilibrium.},

Abstract = {Critically inclined International Relations (IR) scholars have recently
   turned to examining the issue of time and its implications for world
   politics. However, there has yet to be a thorough account of how a focus
   on temporality deepens our understanding of one of the field's core
   concepts: subjectivity. Drawing upon insights from psychoanalytic
   theory, this paper argues that the discursive decentering of
   subjectivity (long a focus in poststructuralist IR) is bound to the
   subject's temporal decentering. Moreover, conceptualizing these together
   helps to account for the underexplored role of desire in subject
   formation. The paper thus draws together insights regarding discourse,
   desire, and identity to offer a more comprehensive theory of the subject
   in IR and a richer account of the social construction process in
   general. The empirical import of these ideas is illustrated with regard
   to the function of temporality and desire in the politics of the US-led
   war on terror.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the effect that leveraging civilian defense force
   militias has on the dynamics of violence in civil war. We argue that the
   delegation of security and combat roles to local civilians shifts the
   primary targets of insurgent violence toward civilians, in an attempt to
   deter future defections, and re-establish control over the local
   population. This argument is assessed through an analysis of the Sunni
   Awakening and ancillary Sons of Iraq paramilitary program. The results
   suggest that at least in the Al-Anbar province of Iraq, the utilization
   of the civilian population in counterinsurgent roles had significant
   implications for the targets of insurgent violence.},

Abstract = {This article examines Carr's work in The Twenty Years' Crisis and
   Conditions of Peace in the light of an analogy that Carr draws between
   his work and that of the American pragmatist philosopher, William James.
   The article argues that one gains a greater understanding of the
   internal workings of Carr's most important IR works if one understands
   him as operating within the pragmatist tradition (as James understood
   it). A further aim of the paper is to investigate the evolution in
   Carr's ethical commitment to peace in The Twenty Years' Crisis and
   Conditions of Peace as a product of a pragmatist perspective on global
   politics. The article concludes with a section on how pragmatist Realist
   ethics complements existing theories of Realist ethics in IR by
   reference to Richard Ned Lebow's The Tragic Vision of Politics and
   Michael C. Williams' The Realist Tradition and the Limits of
   International Relations.},

Abstract = {The conflicts that have plagued the Great Lakes Region during the last
   20 years are domestic and regional at the same time, with considerable
   inputs and outputs across national borders. As elsewhere in Africa and
   the world, borders unite as much as they divide. State weakness in the
   Democratic Republic of the Congo and border porosity enable non-state
   armed groups, neighbouring governments' armies and private entrepreneurs
   of instability to freely operate on Congolese soil. As most analyses
   tend to focus on the macro-level structures and patterns of economic
   control, they do not take into account the dynamic processes of
   renegotiation of the existing local political, social and economic
   space. This article attempts to bring together hitherto scattered
   micro-level field data and analyses produced by other scholars and UN
   experts, which it organises in five themes: regulatory activities,
   including taxation; the straddling of public and private spheres; the
   struggles for control; the transnational nature of activities and,
   closely linked, profound regional integration; and non-state groups
   acting as proxies for states. In addition to addressing the greed versus
   grievance debate, the cases presented here challenge a recent strand in
   research that sees criminal activities and forms of `hybrid governance'
   as potential processes towards state formation.},

Abstract = {This article argues that scholars overestimate the ability of a
   methodologically pluralistic' political science to gain impact in
   policymaking, which in Britain is increasingly positivist', privileging
   quantitative evidence. This relevance gap' between pluralistic political
   science and positivistic policymaking means that political scientists
   are disadvantaged in achieving impact' compared to disciplines like
   behavioural economics. The article proposes two solutions to bridge this
   gap': improving the accessibility' of research and stimulating
   interaction' between researchers and policymakers through methodological
   workshops.},

Abstract = {In response to growing popular dissatisfaction with politics and
   politicians there has been a marked increase in academic work about
   anti-politics and depoliticization with numerous scholars seeking to
   defend politics by restating why it matters. However, these efforts have
   largely glossed over the related question of why politicians also
   matter. To fill this gap I propose a typology that captures how the
   different intellectual perspectives in this debate see the role of
   politicians - identifying six in particular: procedural, legitimacy,
   values, authority, persuasion and dissimulation. In doing so I review
   each contribution and highlight synergies and disagreements between them
   that in-turn reveal important insights and new lines of inquiry.},

Abstract = {In an interconnected world, higher education systems, the institutions
   that comprise them, educational policy makers, quality assurance
   agencies are all supposed to interact simultaneously in a global,
   national, and local, or glonacal, context. Like some other Asian
   nations, Taiwan has been developing its glonacal quality assurance
   framework. At the same time, it attempted to give more institutional
   autonomy to universities by awarding them a self-accreditation status.
   The main purpose of the paper is to examine transformation of QA systems
   in Taiwan's higher education under the glonacal context and to analyze
   the new development of self-accreditation. (C) 2014 Policy and Society

Abstract = {Both countries and subnational governments commonly engage in
   competition for mobile capital, offering generous incentives to attract
   investment. Existing economics research has suggested that these tax
   incentives have a limited ability to affect investment patterns and are
   often excessively costly when measured against the amount of investment
   and jobs created. In this paper, we argue instead that the competition
   for capital can be politically beneficial to incumbent politicians.
   Building off work on electoral pandering, we argue that incentives allow
   politicians to take credit for firms' investment decisions. We test the
   empirical implications of this theory using a nationwide Internet
   survey, which employs a randomized experiment to test how voters
   evaluate the performance of incumbent US governors. Our findings
   illustrate a critical political benefit of offering such incentives.
   Politicians can use these incentives to take credit for investment
   flowing into their districts and to minimize the political fallout when
   investors choose to locate elsewhere.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes Russia's presidential discourses and emotions of the
   West from March 2008 to December 2012. By studying the languages of
   inclusiveness and exclusiveness in annual addresses to the Federation
   Council and public statements, I have identified several distinct stages
   in the Kremlin's emotional evolution from fear to hope to frustration:
   the initial fear (March 2008 June 2009), hope (September 2009 the late
   2010), and frustration (since the early 2011). The Russia's emotional
   shifts are shaped by the country's historically established social
   relations with the West and are not to be reduced to the dynamics of
   power and prestige/status. Russia's deep emotional connection to the
   West as well as Russia's own concept of national honor are the two
   factors that drive the nation's leaders' complex actions, feelings, and
   rhetoric. Russia displays emotions of hope each time it feels that its
   honor is being respected and those of frustration, fear and anger when
   in the eyes of Kremlin its identity/honor as not recognized. (C) 2014

Abstract = {A large body of work points to diverging civil-military views on the
   initial decision to use force, yet there is little sense if similar
   differences hold over appropriate conduct in the midst of armed
   conflict. The rise of international laws governing behavior during war
   has similarly raised the question of whether these rules can shape the
   beliefs of various domestic actors. This paper seeks to address both
   gaps in the literature by leveraging the use of experiments embedded in
   a pair of US national surveys to examine the impact of international law
   and military experience on individual attitudes toward torture. The
   results show veterans are significantly more likely to support torture
   compared to civilians without any prior military background.
   International law further reduces civilian support for torture, while
   veterans are largely unaffected by general legal appeals. However, when
   facing highly precise rules, or where the threat of punishment is
   delegated to third parties, more legalized agreements can significantly
   reduce veteran support for torture. The results have implications for
   the study of institutional design, the differential effects of legal
   norms on nonstate actors, and the potential for greater awareness of the
   laws of war to influence attitudes toward wartime violence.},

Abstract = {Building on contemporary research on social cognition and psychology,
   trust, political representation and accountability, and candidate
   evaluation, this article proposes to decompose political trust into two
   cognitively distinct but related components for examination: competence
   versus intention evaluations. This article further argues that people's
   evaluations of their government's competence and intention in governance
   can have distinct bases due to the varying accessibility of pertinent
   information. Using valid instruments from a unique sampling survey in
   two Chinese cities in 2005, this article tests the validity of this
   cognitive scheme. Empirical evidence shows that (1) the surveyed Chinese
   urban residents effectively differentiated between their central
   government's competence and intention in governance: on average, they
   had a quite positive assessment of the central government's intention to
   serve its people, despite their relatively pessimistic views of its
   competence to deliver good governance; (2) the Chinese urbanites did
   consult different sources of information and heuristics when evaluating
   their central government's competence and intention, respectively.},

Abstract = {South Sudan obtained independence in July 2011 as a kleptocracy - a
   militarized, corrupt neo-patrimonial system of governance. By the time
   of independence, the South Sudanese ``political marketplace{''} was so
   expensive that the country's comparatively copious revenue was consumed
   by the military-political patronage system, with almost nothing left for
   public services, development or institution building. The efforts of
   national technocrats and foreign donors produced bubbles of
   institutional integrity but the system as a whole was entirely resistant
   to reform. The January 2012 shutdown of oil production bankrupted the
   system. Even an experienced and talented political business manager
   would have struggled, and President Salva Kiir did not display the
   required skills. No sooner had shots been fired than the compact holding
   the SPLA together fell apart and civil war ensued. Drawing upon
   long-term observation of elite politics in South Sudan, this article
   explains both the roots of kleptocratic government and its dire
   consequences.},

Abstract = {Multi-level governance, network governance, and, more recently,
   experimentalist governance are important analytical frameworks through
   which to understand democratic governance in the EU. However, these
   analytical frameworks carry normative assumptions that build on
   functionalist roots and undervalue political dynamics. This can result
   in a lack of understanding of the challenges that democratic governance
   faces in practice. This article proposes the analysis of democratic
   governance from the perspective of multiple political rationalities to
   correct such assumptions. It analyses the implementation of the Water
   Framework Directive in the Netherlands as a paradigmatic case study by
   showing how governmental, instrumental, and deliberative rationalities
   are at work in each of the governance elements that it introduces. The
   article concludes by discussing the implications of a perspective of
   multiple political rationalities for the understanding and promotion of
   democratic governance in practice.},

Abstract = {Contemporary political economy has emphasized the importance of studying
   the processes of institutional change as determinants of political and
   economic success and failure of different countries. This paper provides
   a theoretically grounded approach to the process of the Spanish
   institutional change from Francoism to the present, showing the change
   of institutional equilibrium generated by the establishment of democracy
   in Spain and studying how the current economic crisis is affecting the
   equilibrium through the growing political dissatisfaction.
   The institutional dynamics of Spanish society was an experience of
   success in the second half of the twentieth century. During this period,
   the Spanish institutions evolved from a predatory State model into a
   contractual State in the Northian sense, and institutional change
   implied the strengthening of economic markets, the political transition
   to democracy, the modernization of public policies and the incorporation
   into the European Union, leading to levels of institutional stability
   and economic development that the country had not reached along its
   history. Thus, the country established a stable and more efficient
   equilibrium than the institutional equilibrium of the dictatorship,
   although the model of the Spanish democracy has maintained several
   institutional weaknesses in comparative terms.
   This article provides an institutional analysis of the change of rules
   in Spanish society, and it analyzes how the international economic
   crisis has affected most acutely in Spain since 2008, generating an
   unprecedented increase in the level of political dissatisfaction in the
   citizenship. In particular, the high increase of unemployment in the
   Spanish economy, which has exceeded the threshold of 25\%, largely
   explains the growing political dissatisfaction that characterizes the
   institutional framework of the Spanish society after the Great
   Recession.},

Abstract = {Two decades after the introduction of the punctuated equilibrium model,
   information processing theory now offers one of the most comprehensive
   analytical perspectives on decision making in public administration and
   policy research. This article applies information processing analysis to
   the decision making process in the European Union (EU). Towards this
   end, the article inquires into the organizational foundations of
   information processing at successive levels of administrative and
   legislative decision making and shows how this analytical perspective
   can be used to gain a better understanding of policy dynamics at the
   supranational level. The article argues that information processing in
   the EU is likely to produce distinct policy dynamics in key respects. It
   identifies promising avenues for future research and discusses some of
   the issues this evolving theoretical framework should address in order
   to allow for a more comprehensive exploration of this analytical
   perspective in the context of the EU.},

Abstract = {This article offers a critical analysis of how narratives of a
   generalised withdrawal from radical politics and activism circulate
   within contemporary political theory. In so doing, I use the term
   `narrations of apoliticality' to highlight how such narratives have a
   fictive and performative dimension: they have, I argue, congealed into a
   widely held common sense (often buttressed by affects of pessimism,
   gloom and despair) and become curiously resistant to sustained empirical
   or theoretical scrutiny. Against this backdrop, the article has four
   specific aims. First, it maps the general contours of narrations of
   apoliticality; second, it highlights why narrations of apoliticality are
   potentially problematic; third - drawing on Lacanian notions of fantasy
   and Sara Ahmed's account of affect - it explores how the affectivity of
   such claims renders them sticky and intransigent; and finally, it offers
   some thoughts on how we might decentre narrations of apoliticality in
   our analyses of political activism.},

Abstract = {Empirical research in the New Institutional Economics tradition has
   concentrated on the degree to which institutional constraints on rulers
   protect property rights and foster growth through private investment.
   This view of institutions is overly narrow, neglecting the role of state
   capacity in particular. Both state authority and constraints on rulers
   matter for economic performance, but the relative strength of these
   effects depends upon a country's distance from the frontier of the world
   economy. Tests using a panel data set that covers up to 84 countries
   from the period 1960 to 2005 reveal that, in countries that have low
   Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, constraints on rulers in the
   form of checks and balances affect neither the rate of productivity
   growth nor the growth of capital stock per worker. Basic state
   authority, however, has a strong, positive effect on both of these
   outcomes. The story is different for advanced industrial economies,
   where the effects of checks are positive, especially with respect to
   productivity growth. Institutional checks on rulers are thus not an
   agent of investment-based growth but support continued growth based upon
   innovation at the leading edge.},

Abstract = {As a key feature of the contemporary political landscape, populism
   stands as one of the most contentious concepts in political science.
   This article presents a critique of dominant conceptions of populism -
   as ideology, logic, discourse and strategy/organisation - and introduces
   the category of `political style' as a new compelling way of thinking
   about the phenomenon. We argue that this new category captures an
   important dimension of contemporary populism that is missed by rival
   approaches. In doing so, we put forward an inductive model of populism
   as a political style and contextualise it within the increasingly
   stylised and mediatised milieu of contemporary politics by focusing on
   its performative features. We conclude by considering how this concept
   allows us to understand how populism appears across the political
   spectrum, how it translates into the political mainstream and its
   implications for democratic politics.},

Abstract = {Preferential trade agreements (PTAs) have rapidly proliferated in Latin
   America since the 2000s; this paper examines the factors which have
   facilitated or hampered their diffusion. The paper argues that the
   diffusion of PTAs, and resistance against them, has resulted in two
   alternative trade-integration models. On one hand, there is diffusion of
   US-led neoliberal North-South PTAs in Central American and Latin
   American countries (LACs) on the Pacific Basin. On the other hand, the
   reinforcement of post-liberal regionalism led by Brazil and MERCOSUR
   countries has acted as a firewall of resistance to the diffusion of
   US-led PTAs and their neoliberal policies. This paper first discusses
   how the competitive diffusion of US-led PTAs started in Latin America.
   It then analyzes two intertwined dynamics (international-regional and
   institutional-domestic) that explain why US-led PTAs have proliferated
   in the region. The third section explores MERCOSUR's reactions to the US
   competitive PTA diffusion and also how Brazilian leadership has evolved
   in the South American subregion to encircle US diffusion of PTAs,
   leading to an outcome of two different patterns of integration in Latin
   America.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the primary international firewall in place against
   the diffusion of nuclear weapons and related equipment, materials, and
   knowledge. It links the transformative moments of the nuclear
   non-proliferation regime to select events. It posits these shocks either
   (i) revealed the presence of, or (ii) instigated fears about new or
   accelerated diffusion flows, with clear implications for nuclearization.
   By recasting the regime's evolution in this manner, the paper provides
   newfound insight as to the timing and character of change. It also
   reveals the considerable impact of diffusion processes beyond outcomes
   of diffusion and non-diffusion, adding definition to the firewall
   concept.},

Abstract = {Military-first politics has been at the heart of the unexpected regime
   stability in North Korea under Kim Jong-il and his son Jong-un. This
   article analyzes Kim Jong-il's military-first politics as a strategic
   choice for regime survival, in which the locus of political power
   switched from the party to the military. At the same time, Kim Jong-il
   formulated a complex system of circumventing the possibility of the
   armed forces' political domination, including personalistic control
   using sticks and carrots, fortifying security and surveillance
   institutions, and compartmentalizing the security institutions for
   intra- and inter-organizational checks and balances to prevent the
   emergence of organized opposition to the regime. Although an effective
   short-term solution, military-first politics could never be a long-term
   strategy for building gangseongdaeguk (a powerful and prosperous
   nation). The current Kim Jong-un regime needs to conduct sweeping
   reforms to address dire economic difficulties, which might result in a
   departure from his father's legacy and downgrade the military's power.
   In this process, the current regime's (in)stability will depend on how
   it maintains a balance between revoking military-first politics and
   preserving the armed forces' allegiance. (C) 2014 The Regents of the

Title = {PUBLIC RESPONSIBILITY AND INEQUALITY IN HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE: AN
   EXAMINATION OF AMERICAN STATE HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {92},
Number = {2},
Pages = {422-439},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article examines the effect of the three publicness dimensions on
   inequality in health insurance coverage across 50 American state-level
   health care systems. The analysis validates a Gini-coefficient measure
   of Americans' unequal distribution of health insurance coverage across
   nine income groups and compares public ownership, financing, and control
   of health care systems across all 50 states from 2002 to 2010. There is
   a significant and negative relationship between public ownership and
   inequality in health insurance coverage, although the substantive impact
   of ownership is relatively small. Both public financing and control
   substantially reduce inequality in health insurance coverage across
   income groups. However, both of these must be present in order to be
   effective at reducing inequality. This article expands our understanding
   of the link between different institutional arrangements and inequality
   in health insurance coverage in hybrid health care systems.},

Abstract = {This article looks at the European Communities' efforts against

   improve European legal integration, the attempts to develop an
   antiterrorism agreement were quite obviously a failure. Although the
   Dublin Agreement was adopted in 1979 after cumbersome and lengthy
   negotiations, it fell short of showing the member states' unity and
   resolve to fight terrorism, and it never entered into force. The tedious
   negotiations drained the member states' energy and willingness to such
   an extent that no other steps toward judicial integration or
   antiterrorism treaties were taken.},

Abstract = {Policy scientists and public policymakers are continuously struggling
   with the troublesome relationship between knowledge and policy. On the
   one hand, policy and policy processes are generally recognized as having
   a political nature because they prioritize the generation of will rather
   than knowledge. On the other hand, it is difficult to accept that
   knowledge is being wasted or used strategically. One of the main
   challenges for public policymakers is to reconcile the political
   rationality of policy processes with the scientific rationality of
   knowledge and research, for instance by intelligent organization of
   knowledge generation and knowledge use. This article aims to contribute
   to the debate on this topic by comparing three policy implementation
   processes in which knowledge played an authoritative role. On the basis
   of this analysis of these three white ravens,' lessons are drawn
   regarding the conditions under which knowledge becomes authoritative in
   policy implementation practices.},

Abstract = {The religious foundations of American opinion towards climate change are
   analysed by means of a panel survey of voting-age citizens, interviewed
   in February and October 2008. It shows that religion's influence is
   multifaceted. Biblically literalist beliefs and to a lesser extent
   attendance at religious services, but not nominal religious
   affiliations, led Americans to view climate change as mostly natural and
   to express less concern over its consequences. Yet evangelical
   Protestants reporting frequent service attendance were distinctively
   more concerned about the effects of climate change.},

Title = {Anti-Semitism on Trial: The Case of Eligiusz Niewiadomski},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Pages = {411-439},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {On 30 December 1922, Eligiusz Niewiadomski, the murderer of Poland's
   first president, Gabriel Narutowicz, was tried and sentenced to death.
   The execution was duly carried out on 31 January 1923. The trial of
   Niewiadomski was one of the most important and galvanizing judicial
   proceedings in the history of the Second Republic. According to the
   historiography, Niewiadomski was universally perceived as a
   ``lunatic{''} or ``madman{''} and his actions were a political setback
   and embarrassment for the Polish radical right. During the trial,
   Niewiadomski evinced no contrition for his crime and claimed that his
   deed was the expression of ``the conscience and offended dignity of the
   nation.{''} In this article, I will present the argument that shortly
   after his trial, the right wing publicists' and politicians' judgment of
   Niewiadomski underwent a profound transformation. Far from being
   condemned as a ``madman{''} or ``murderer,{''} Niewiadomski assumed the
   position of a ``tragic hero{''} who may have broken the letter of the
   law but who had done so in the name of just principles, which deserved
   recognition and approval. The pivotal event in this transformation was
   the rabidly anti-Semitic speech delivered by Niewiadomski during his
   trial. The paper analyzes the coverage of the trial and execution in the
   press in order to arrive at an understanding of precisely how the Polish
   right was able to reclaim Niewiadomski as one of its own so quickly
   despite his grave crime. It also analyzes the meaning of this
   transformation and its significance for understanding the nationalist
   right in Poland and, more broadly, interwar Polish politics as a whole.},

Abstract = {Recent spikes in commodity prices, the growing appetite for primary
   commodities among emerging economies, growing interest in biofuels and
   speculations over future returns to land and its products have led to a
   renewed interest in farmland in the global South. With highly publicized
   risks and polarized win-lose narratives, so-called land grabbing has
   become an important focus of transnational governance activity. In
   juxtaposition to those seeing large-scale land acquisitions as
   inherently risky or undesirable, some argue for the potential
   opportunities they engenderprovided risks can be mitigated through
   improved governance. This paper explores this argument through a
   systematic analysis of the formal features of the multi-sited governance
   mechanisms in place to guide agricultural investment and govern its
   social and environmental effects. The intent is not to discount the
   importance of informal norms and practices or the so-called lived
   experience of governance, nor the argument that such land acquisitions
   are inherently flawed irrespective of the discipline imposed on them.
   Rather, the paper aims to explore the merits of the arguments advanced
   by the pro-investment camp, and to explore the extent to which the
   emerging global governance architecture is set up to deliver on the
   purported benefits of large-scale agricultural investment. Results
   suggest that serious weaknesses in the substantive scope, reach and/or
   implementation mechanisms in all of the reviewed governance mechanisms
   pose a serious risk to the likely effectiveness of the emerging
   governance architecture in minimizing risks and leveraging benefits.
   Addressing these weaknesses is an obvious first step for bolstering the
   credibility of those advocating that governance is the solution.},

Abstract = {Study of the role of English use in the lives of two undocumented
   indigenous Honduran immigrants to the southwestern United States reveals
   that the label illegal applied to undocumented immigrants influences
   their integration into U.S. society. Participants in the study used
   social/cultural capital to intervene in their underclass status. English
   proficiency served as a credentialed skill that allowed them social
   mobility, and the cultural value of being of service enabled them to

Abstract = {Academic journals may especially influence the development of an
   emerging field; early editors of public policy journals were explicit
   about that goal. Two leading journalsthe Journal of Policy Analysis and
   Management and the Policy Studies Journalwere compared for changes
   between the early 1980s and 2007-2010. Over time, both journals
   published far fewer research articles by practitioners, and the
   non-university share of both editorial boards also declined. The
   journals continued to focus largely on the United States. Both showed a
   dramatic increase in the proportion of co-authored articles. Over time,
   JPAM became far more likely to publish studies by economists and far
   less likely to publish political scientists while PSJ increasingly
   published political scientists. JPAM authors now primarily reference
   economics journals. PSJ authors often cite political science, public
   administration, and other public policy journals. Both journals moved
   away from broad policy essays, with JPAM heavily trending to
   multivariate (essentially econometric) secondary analyses of large data
   sets and PSJ including a broader range of methodologies. Contrary to
   early predictions of a progressively more interdisciplinary field, the
   opposite trendstronger alignments with specific disciplinesreflects
   public policy's ongoing challenge in transcending long-standing academic
   legacies and boundaries.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {What rights in particular does the United States seek to promote in the
   Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), and what countries does the
   United States single out for sanction in the MDBs for their record on
   human rights? The present article examines these questions through an
   analysis of the US voting record in the MDBs. In 2004, the US Treasury
   Department began publishing the US voting record in the MDBs along with
   an explanation for why the United States votes against certain
   proposals. This article analyzes those votes specifically regarding
   human rights. Overall, the United States pursues a variety of human
   rights issues in the MDBs against a variety of countries with poor human
   rights records. More specifically, the two most prominent trends
   revealed in the data are the United States consistently voting against
   proposals from China for human rights reasons and the United States
   voting against proposals from countries that are alleged to be hiding
   war criminals.},

Abstract = {In the legislation in force on Slovenian territory, public institutes as
   a legal form of carrying out statutory utilities have a colourful
   history. Initially, they became very widespread in the 1950's, when they
   were being established as independently financed institutes in many
   public service fields. With the introduction of a new constitutional and
   social-political system after 1991, the legislator introduced a special
   organisational model for the provision of non-profit activities, namely
   both for those that were to be performed in the public sector - as
   statutory utilities, as well as for those that were to be performed in
   the private sector - as non-profit activities. For the public sector, a
   form of public institutes was asserted, and a form of private institutes
   for the private sector. The purpose of this text is to display the legal
   status, assets, management and financing of public institutes in
   Slovenian legislation.},

Journal = {SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {We analyse the gender training gap (i.e. the disadvantage of women in
   receiving work-related continuing training) based on individual data
   from the first wave of the Adult Education Survey (AES). The interaction
   of gender and education, we argue, has been overlooked in previous work.
   For only one of 22 European countries do we find a statistically
   significant training gap for women with a university degree-but in six
   countries, we find a statistically significant and sizeable training gap
   for women without a university degree. Multilevel analysis supports the
   results and shows that institutions are linked to the chances of
   training. In particular, a system of vocational education and training
   geared towards firm-specific skills enhances the female training gap.
   Overall, our paper shows that the widespread perception of a
   disappearing gender training gap is premature.},

Title = {The anatomy of Intergroups - network governance in the political engine

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},

Abstract = {Intergroups are key components in the European Parliament's modus
   operandi, allowing members from different political groups to focus on
   specific political topics. Hitherto, the defining characteristics of
   Intergroups have not received much attention in academic literature.
   This article remedies this lack by conducting a study of Intergroups
   coached by network theory. It is shown that there are considerable
   variations between them. Though it is only parliamentarians who can be
   formal members, Intergroups may comprise a variety of different actors,
   and interaction is characterised by interests, non-hierarchical
   negotiations, easy communication lines and trust. Some Intergroups are
   targeted by interest groups to such an extent that a fusion nearly
   happens, whereas others do not receive any attention at all. Intergroups
   can have considerable impact by moulding ideas for new `wise' policies.
   Finally, the analysis compares the function of Intergroups to that of
   the US Congress Caucuses and demonstrates that Intergroups bear
   resemblance in the way that they allow Members of the European
   Parliament to signal their preferences, exchange information and
   coordinate legislative initiatives.},

Abstract = {Do governments lean on researchers who evaluate their policies to try to
   get them to produce politically useful results? Do researchers buckle
   under such pressure? This article, based on a survey of 205 academics
   who have recently completed commissioned research for government, looks
   at the degree to which British government departments seek to produce
   research that is designed to provide political ammunition', above all
   making them look good' or minimizing criticism of their policies.
   Looking at different stages in the research process - from deciding
   which policies to evaluate, shaping the nature and conduct of inquiry,
   and writing the results - the article finds evidence of government
   sponsors making significant efforts to produce politically congenial
   results. For the most part, researchers appear to resist these efforts,
   though the evidence base (researchers' own accounts of their work)
   suggests that this conclusion be treated with some caution.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {62},
Number = {1},
Pages = {2-20},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Gender equality in elected office has become a commitment of national
   governments and international organizations around the globe. To date,
   much of the discussion has revolved around electoral gender quotas -
   policies that set aside seats in political assemblies for women or
   require that political parties nominate a certain percentage of female
   candidates. Focusing exclusively on quotas, however, obscures the
   broader range of efforts around the world to bring more women into
   political office. This article surveys non-quota strategies used
   globally, developing an analytic framework for theorizing potential
   interventions into candidate selection and election processes. Whether
   used in conjunction with, or as an alternative to, quotas, the diversity
   of these measures points to a wide array of creative solutions, engaging
   a variety of actors, which might be pursued to enhance women's political
   representation. Future research should focus on evaluating the effects
   of these policies, both alongside and separately from quota policies.},

Abstract = {In 2011, Canadian Members of Parliament refused to transfer a regulatory
   initiative taken from Argentina that would have required an analysis of
   potential harm to export markets before authorizing the sale of any new
   genetically modified seed. This was the purpose of Bill C-474, which was
   defeated in the House of Commons. After exploring Argentina's regulatory
   framework as a source of transfer, this paper combines a multilevel
   analysis with a typology of policy transfer mechanisms in order to
   address the complexities underlying this unsuccessful attempt. We
   explore how the mechanisms of competition and coercion might have
   impeded the transfer of such an initiative at the international and the
   macro-state levels. Moreover, while a policy transfer network in support
   of the bill called on previous experiences with genetically modified
   seeds, their efforts appear to have been outweighed by another network
   using arguments based on the mechanisms of competition, coercion, and
   mimicry.},

Abstract = {The distinction between uncertainty and risk, originally drawn by Frank
   Knight and John Maynard Keynes in the 1920s, remains fundamentally
   important today. In the presence of uncertainty, market actors and
   economic policy-makers substitute other methods of decision making for
   rational calculationspecifically, actors' decisions are rooted in social
   conventions. Drawing from innovations in financial markets and
   deliberations among top American monetary authorities in the years
   before the 2008 crisis, we show how economic actors and policy-makers
   live in worlds of risk and uncertainty. In that world social conventions
   deserve much greater attention than conventional IPE analyses accords
   them. Such conventions must be part of our toolkit as we seek to
   understand the preferences and strategies of economic and political
   actors.},

Abstract = {This article studies the factors that affect the likelihood of radical
   policy changes. Radical policy changes are defined here as acts in which
   political leaders choose a policy that is contradictory to policies they
   have committed to during elections and on whose basis they have formed
   coalitions. The reason for such changes is that quandaries change the
   policy space that shapes elections and initial coalitions. This change
   creates incentives for political players to re-bargain over existing
   coalitions. As the bargaining process decreases the leaders' survival
   prospects, the likelihood of leaders to opt for the wrong side' of the
   policy space will increase. I validate this claim using a case study and
   a large-N quantitative analysis of 51 cases from 34 countries.},

Abstract = {We address the consequences of corruption within a state on the extent
   to which populations have shortened life expectancy due to political
   corruption. Using three variables to estimate corruption, the results
   support the expectation that corruption increases average disability
   shortened life years (DALY). The results persist when estimating the
   model including measures of deaths from civil war and the number of
   bordering states experiencing civil war, both previously shown to have
   an effect on DALY, although these two variables are not statistically
   significant in our models. While the estimated effects of the corruption
   variables continue to capture much of the variation in DALY for a global
   group of nations, they completely fail to explain any variation in
   Sub-Saharan African states, probably because of the devastating effects
   of AIDS and malaria in that region. Finally, we discuss why this failure
   occurs and discuss the implications of our results.},

Abstract = {Innovations in European Union (EU) policy making have produced a
   distinctive, novel mode of policy that combines components of
   participatory and multi-level governance for policy implementation. In
   this manuscript we provide a conceptualization of what we term the EU's
   mandated participatory planning' (MPP) approach. This approach is
   increasingly used to implement EU directives, mandating the explicit
   formulation of certain plans or programmes on mostly subnational or
   cross-national levels. Drawing on three empirical examples from (mostly)
   environmental policy, we argue that analysing MPP as such is useful to
   help identify challenges and possibilities for EU policy making. Our
   framework provides a means to organize inquiry and compare disparate
   policies, and to more broadly understand the integration of policy,
   planning and implementation. This perspective, in turn, sheds fresh
   light on familiar concepts at the intersections of multi-level
   governance, policy implementation and participatory governance, namely
   multilayer implementation, participatory implementation and polycentric
   governance.},

Abstract = {Globalizing policy fields can contain institutional voids in which
   effective regulatory frameworks and the corrective counterbalance of
   civil society are equally absent. With the inherently incomplete
   regulation of global finance on the one hand and the evident dearth of
   civil society institutions on the other, a central governance question
   emerges: under what conditions could civil society help to recapture the
   financial system by embedding it in a wider social and economic policy,
   and thereby reversing the erosion of confidence in market capitalism and
   liberal democracy? For this purpose, this article proposes the
   systematic development of a transnational civil society infrastructure
   in terms of organizational capacity and expertise for accountability
   enforcement, policy review, performance oversight and advocacy. The goal
   of this infrastructure is to fill the institutional void and form a
   counterveiling force against the unchecked might of global finance.},

Abstract = {Migration theories often ignore the role that states play in stimulating
   migration through public assistance policies. Using the case of Mexico,
   this article explores the role of the state as a migrant-producing actor
   by examining the relationship between migration and social assistance
   policies in the form of monetary cash transfers. It argues that direct,
   unconditional cash transfers, like those provided by agricultural
   programs such as Procampo, rather than providing the incentives needed
   to retain individuals in their home country, may instead be providing
   the resources needed to migrate, particularly if the amount of the
   transfer is insufficient to spur investment. Instead of discouraging
   migration by enhancing economic opportunities and reducing poverty, such
   policies can actually make it easier and more appealing for its
   beneficiaries to migrate.},

Title = {Four Models of Interest Mediation in Global Environmental Governance},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {10-22},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Negotiating global environmental agreements involves aggregating and
   mediating divergent interests. In multiparty electoral systems, the
   process begins at the subnational level where interests aggregated by
   business associations, trade unions and civil society organizations are
   represented to political parties and governments in an effort to secure
   better (from their perspective) policy outcomes. How domestic political
   systems aggregate, represent and mediate diverse competing interests is
   a key question within comparative politics with some analysts favouring
   pluralism and others defending corporatist and policy network
   arrangements. This rich domestic literature has no global equivalent,
   due to the dominance until recently of intergovernmental forms of
   interest mediation at the global level. The rise of sector-specific
   global governance organizations such as the Forest Stewardship Council
   suggests it is timely to investigate the different arrangements being
   used to mediate global interests and derive some hypotheses about how
   these shape global politics and policy. Using a grounded theory
   approach, this article compares and contrasts four different global
   interest mediation arrangements: intergovernmental (UN Forum on Forests
   (UNFF)), single-interest (Responsible Care (RC)), multistakeholder
   (Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)) and corporatist (Forest Stewardship
   Council (FSC)).},

   case of the development of shale gas, by comparing the regulatory
   context that facilitated the diffusion of shale gas techniques (in the
   United States) with the responses to its potential development in
   different European settings (the national cases of Britain, France,
   Germany, the Netherlands and Poland and the EU institutions). The US
   regime has favoured its development, transforming the energy economy but
   raising concerns about environmental impacts. In Europe, different
   economic and political contexts have resulted in divergent responses
   amongst the countries examined, making an effective EU response
   difficult to achieve.},

Abstract = {Policy coherence for development (PCD) - the integration of the needs of
   developing countries into all policy areas - is now an EU policy goal.
   This article focuses on how far this ambitious goal has been addressed
   in a policy procedure - impact assessment (IA) - established to support
   such cross-cutting goals. Drawing on an analysis of the 2006 and 2013
   reforms of the EU's sugar policy, it finds that while IA offered a new
   venue in which to debate PCD, in practice it reproduced the same
   disagreements that previously frustrated agricultural reform. The
   article shows how IA was shaped during its implementation, so instead of
   functioning as a bureaucratic procedure to pursue policy coherence, it
   simply buttressed the power of dominant groups. Advocates of policy
   coherence in general and PCD in particular should therefore be mindful
   that the toolbox of implementing instruments in the EU may be more
   limited than sometimes assumed.},

   emphasizing cooperation and alliance between state and armed, non-state
   actors. Rather than struggling in vain to build strong states to
   eliminate armed non-state actors and establish a monopoly over the use
   of force, averting genocide might necessitate recruiting and
   strengthening the power of indigenous, armed non-state actors.},

   Strengthened Role in Economic Governance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},

Volume = {36},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {213-229},
Abstract = {Since the latest financial and economic crisis took hold of the European
   Union (EU), its economic governance architecture has been undergoing
   crucial changes. Research into the institutional consequences of these
   reforms is still fragmented - especially with regard to the function of
   the European Commission. This article seeks to fill this void by
   analysing the supranational executive's role in the four areas that have
   witnessed the most important changes: financial stability support,
   economic policy surveillance, coordination of national polices and
   supervision of the financial sector. The empirical evidence suggests
   that the Commission continues to be a powerful player in EU economic
   governance, but its primary role is changing. While its agenda-setting
   power is decreasing, most decisions in economic governance depend on the
   Commission to make them work. With more and stronger implementation
   competences, it may be less visible. But it is not less important. This
   finding qualifies the degree of intergovernmentalism in economic
   governance.},

Abstract = {In this article, we compare the European Union's (EU's) voting cohesion
   in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) to other regional
   organizations like the African Union, the Arab League, the Association
   of Southeast Asian Nations, the Caribbean Community, the Economic
   Community of West African States and the Mercado Comun del Sur by using
   a novel index of voting cohesion. The analysis confirms previous
   findings that the EU member states vote, at first glance, surprisingly
   incoherent. However, we are able to show that the EU is the only
   regional organization that can increase its level of voting cohesion in
   contested votes. We argue that this is a better indicator for the EU's
   successful vote co-ordination in the UNGA than the average level of
   voting cohesion, which is commonly used in studies on voting behaviour.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},

Volume = {35},

Pages = {187-210},
Abstract = {This article draws on fourth generation strategic culture debates to
   show the gap between the rhetoric of Australian defence and the more
   modest reality. Our analysis shows that these limits derive from
   tensions between national strategic culture and organizational strategic
   subcultures. There are serious debates in the nation regarding the
   preferred course of the Australian military and security policy. This
   article frames these debates by examining the `keepers' of Australia's
   national strategic culture, the existence of several competing strategic
   subcultures, and the importance of norm entrepreneurs in changing
   defence and national security thinking. Strategic subcultures foster
   compartmentalization, constraints, and bureaucratic silos that narrow
   national conceptions of security threats and opportunities, and impinge
   on the formation of coherent foreign and defence policy in relation to
   the Asia-Pacific region. This analysis shows that a distinct national
   strategic culture and organizational strategic subcultures endure beyond
   individual governments, placing potential limits on Australia's
   interface with other Asia-Pacific strategic cultures in the future.},

Abstract = {One of the major global challenges that the EU currently faces is the
   establishment of a multipolar world order with Emerging Powers-Brazil,
   Russia India, China and South Africa-as prospective cooperation
   partners. News media is the key information gatekeeper. Therefore, this
   research probes the EU's place in the emerging world order by
   scrutinizing the visibility and framings of the EU's dyadic relations
   with China, India and Russia in the daily coverage of leading press in
   these three `rising powers'. We investigate the importance newsmakers
   ascribe to the EU's dyadic interactions at the time of the Euro debt
   crisis in terms of volume, intensity and evaluation of EU
   representations and link this analysis to issue areas reported
   (political, economic, social, environmental or developmental). The
   results are discussed in the context of the importance of external
   perceptions studies for informed dialogue between modern-day `Great
   Powers'.},

Title = {Explaining Low Turnout in European Elections: The Role of Issue Salience
   and Institutional Perceptions in Elections to the European Parliament},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Pages = {339-356},
Abstract = {Elections to the European Parliament have been unable to capture the
   public's interest-turnout remains far lower than most national elections
   and many who do vote appear more concerned with sending messages of
   approval to national political parties than electing representatives at
   the EU level. This paper seeks to explain why the public does not take
   these elections seriously. A common explanation is that the public
   simply does not care about EU politics. In addition to this
   `issue-based' argument, this article considers where a lack of trust in
   the European Parliament itself may lead many individuals to abstain from
   EP elections. Using pre and post-election survey data, results suggest
   that perceptions of the EP indeed have a significant effect on the
   decision to vote in EP elections.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},

Abstract = {This article analyses whether and how public opinion towards the
   European Union (EU) in Greece has changed in the context of the current
   Eurozone crisis. It provides the first detailed treatment of how the
   crisis has affected citizens' views in a traditionally pro-European
   member state. It examines whether public opinion has become more
   Eurosceptic and which societal groups have changed their views and in
   what direction. It uses data from Eurobarometer surveys conducted before
   and during the current crisis. Unsurprisingly, the findings show that
   negative sentiment towards the EU has increased across all social groups
   in recent years. However, we find a paradox of a decline in general
   support for the EU and an increase in support for the Euro. In a country
   seen as traditionally pro-European, Greek public opinion has fallen out
   of love with the EU, but it clearly does not want to leave the Eurozone
   or renounce membership altogether.},

Abstract = {This article is a detailed case study examining Abdulhakim Mujahid
   Muhammad (born Carlos Bledsoe), a lone wolf jihadist who carried out a
   fatal shooting at a joint Army-Navy recruiting center in Little Rock,
   Arkansas, on June 1, 2009. The article explores his early life,
   including involvement in violent and criminal activities that caused
   Muhammad to get into trouble with authorities, after which he decided to
   explore religion as an alternative that could keep him out of trouble.
   Muhammad found that he was attracted to the Islamic faith, and converted
   at the age of nineteen. The article explores Muhammad's subsequent turn
   toward Salafism, and chronicles his increasing extremism with reference
   to academic debates about the concept of radicalization and the role of
   religious ideas. Finally, the article explains Muhammad's attack on the
   recruiting center, and the manner in which he was able to continue his
   jihad even while imprisoned.},

Abstract = {The role of national identity is such that any group that can
   authoritatively claim to `own' the national identity can assert the
   legitimacy of their vision for the state; persuading other sectors of
   society to support their cause. The Northern Irish Civil Rights
   Association was unable to bridge the divide between themselves and
   Northern Irish security forces or their Protestant neighbors. The role
   that divided identity has played in Northern Ireland since its inception
   has increased structural impediments to bridging the gap between
   protesters and security forces, leading to a resurgent IRA and the
   outbreak of the Troubles.},

Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {100-117},
Abstract = {The importance of considering media and communication processes
   generally in the study of conflict formation and escalation has been
   widely recognised and researched. Extrapolating from their relevance for
   those processes, there exists a widespread conviction that communication
   also bears similar potential to contribute to conflict transformation
   and peacebuilding. This kind of assertion, however, as of yet, rests
   mainly on argumentation in analogy to their role in conflict escalation
   processes, and therefore largely leaves implicit the what and how of
   such assumed constructive contributions as well as the underlying
   conceptualisation of peace and communication. Together, this makes for a
   thoroughly fragmented `field' of research from distinct, but still
   largely insulated disciplines, which carries nonetheless the seeds of a
   more comprehensive understanding of what is here tentatively termed
   `communication for peace' (C4P) that could provide cross- pollination
   and contribute to a more thorough engagement with what is an important
   and increasingly vibrant area of activities. The present article
   therefore seeks to examine what could be the groundwork to build a
   framework for C4P on, to identify the major areas of relevant research
   that exist, lacunae in this body of work and fruitful intersections
   between different disciplines.},

Abstract = {In Cyprus, the EU cleavage has never gained a prominent position in
   domestic party competition, at least hitherto. However, the EU could
   become politicized as a result of recent economic developments. The
   article analyses party responses to the EU and suggests that Cyprus
   party politics towards the EU are largely determined by: (a) strategic
   factors relating to party competition and governmentability, (b) the
   country's specific circumstances, i.e. the unresolved Cyprus problem and
   (c) public opinion. Nonetheless, a turn to the economy is already
   evident in most recent times.},

   amount of knowledge has been gathered and the field of global
   environmental politics is now firmly established as one of the main
   subfields of political science and/or international relations, it cannot
   really be said that a concomitant amount of progress has been made in
   defining effective pathways for designing international networks
   ameliorating environmental degradation or in offering solutions to the
   policy community on how to resolve major global environmental problems.},

Abstract = {How should a new state relate to the world around it? This was one of
   the questions which arose early during the constitutional assembly at
   Eidsvoll in 184, and which caused substantial debate, splitting the
   assembly in two. The unionist party wanted to discuss the relationship
   with other states, whereas the independence party preferred to leave
   such matters to the prince regent. This article presents the debate of
   184 as part of a longer trajectory in the history of ideas. The
   emergence of foreign policy is here seen as closely related to a gradual
   differentiation in the concept of politics and boundary-drawing between
   state and society Foreign policy is thus seen as that which separates
   not only the inside of the state from the outside, but also state from
   society The debate of 184 provides a snapshot of this development, with
   absolutist ideas as well as ideas of popular participation},

Abstract = {Starting from the premise that the linguistic vitality of Andean
   languages in the Peruvian context is intimately related to the evolution
   of Andean Spanish and to its diffusion within Peru, the present paper
   analyzes the apparent incongruence between the reported vitality of
   Quechua as it is presented in the UNESCO Atlas of Endangered Languages,
   and what is reported from research on Spanish in contact with Quechua
   and Peruvian Andean Spanish. Through an analysis of the criteria
   presented by UNESCO as relevant to determining the vitality of a
   language, it is proposed that these criteria only include institutional
   criteria that give a top-down perspective of the vitality of a language.
   A set of additional criteria is proposed, using the Peruvian case as an
   example, as relevant to a missing bottom-up perspective; which would
   make visible, what the present instruments leave as invisible.},

Abstract = {Rape and sexual violence loom large in the study of civil war in Africa.
   Sierra Leone has been one of the most prominent cases for establishing
   rape as a `weapon of war', yet little is known about how sexual violence
   was understood by commanders or combatants within the Revolutionary
   United Front (RUF). Mainstream analyses of armed groups and civil war
   rarely engage with gender dynamics, despite their centrality to war
   making, power, and violence; and research that does focus on sexual
   violence tends to overlook the complex internal dynamics of the groups
   responsible. This article examines the internal gender dynamics of the
   RUF from the perspective of male and female members in seeking to
   understand the perpetration of sexual violence. It shows that both
   formal and informal laws and power structures existed to regulate gender
   relations and control sexual behaviour within the group. It identifies
   four categories of women - non-wives, unprotected wives, protected
   wives, and senior women - and shows that women's interests and
   experiences of sexual violence were not homogeneous, but were instead
   shaped by their status within the group. In this way, sexual violence,
   examined in social context, provides an entry point for understanding
   how power, protection, and access to resources are brokered in
   rebellion.},

Journal = {SOUTH EUROPEAN SOCIETY AND POLITICS},

Pages = {309-330},
Abstract = {The article studies pension reforms in Greece, Italy, Portugal, and
   Spain between 1990 and 2013, focusing on three dimensions of change:
   multi-pillarisation, institutional harmonisation, and spending trends
   (cost-containment/expansion). The pension evolution of these countries
   is reassessed throughout the period of crisis and austerity. All
   countries encouraged the spread of private pensions and harmonised their
   fragmented public schemes. Cost containment was massive, putting future
   adequacy at risk. While international actors, especially the European
   Union, acquired a stronger role, that of organised labour declined.
   Spiralling between crisis and austerity, these systems changed and
   adapted, but still face old and new problems: inequality, risk
   individualisation, and increasing vulnerability to external shocks.},

   Paralysis?},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},

Volume = {37},

Pages = {806-814},
Abstract = {The historic significance of the Good Friday Agreement and its role in
   ending organized political violence is acknowledged at the outset. The
   article then goes on to probe the roots of the political paralysis built
   into the architecture of the Agreement that are predicated on a
   misplaced political and cultural symmetry between the ``two
   communities.{''} It is suggested that the institutionalized relationship
   between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U. K. facilitates a
   cross-party, populist, socio-economic consensus among the nationalist
   and unionist political parties on the welfare state, taxation and
   maintaining the massive British subvention to the region. This in turn
   allows them to concentrate on a divisive culturalist politics, i.e., on
   antagonistic forms of cultural and identity politics over such issues as
   flags, parades, and the legacy of the ``Troubles{''} which spills over
   into gridlock into many areas of regional administration. The article
   argues for a much broader understanding of culture and identity rooted
   in the different, if overlapping and interdependent, material realities
   of both communities while challenging the idea of two
   cultures/identities as fixed, mutually exclusive, non-negotiable and
   mutually antagonistic. It then focuses on the importance of Belfast as a
   key arena which will determine the long-term prospects of an alternative
   and more constructive form of politics, and enable a fuller recognition
   of the fundamental asymmetries and inter-dependence between the ``two
   communities.{''} In the long run, this involves re-defining and
   reconstructing what is meant by the ``Union{''} and a ``United
   Ireland.{''}},

Abstract = {Populist radical right (PRR) parties have recently enjoyed significant
   electoral results in Central and Eastern Europe. Ataka in Bulgaria,
   Jobbik in Hungary, and the Slovak National Party in Slovakia frame the
   PRR ideology according to the idiosyncrasies of their context and
   directly address issues such as ethnic minorities, corruption. and the
   European Union. This contribution provides insights into the electoral
   performance of these parties by combining demand-side and supply-side
   elements. Ultimately, this article suggests that interactions over
   minority issues and corruption could help explain the electoral
   performance of these parties.},

Abstract = {This article challenges the widely held belief that that the United
   States `won the war but lost the peace' following the war with Iraq in
   1991. Fears of a resurgent Iraq grew throughout the decade, despite
   abundant evidence that Iraq was becoming desperately weak and was no
   longer a threat to regional security. In fact, the United States won the
   war as well as the peace by any meaningful definition of the term. The
   article also discusses the reasons why US policymakers and observers
   convinced themselves that they had lost. The final section considers
   implications for strategy and policy in wars of limited objectives.},

Abstract = {Successful social movements gain an inside voice and reshape the larger
   system from within. Knowing the extent to which the Tea Party movement
   has gained a voice within the Republican Party is vital to understanding
   the current state of party politics in America. This study analyzes the
   presence of the goals contained within the Tea Party movement's Contract
   from America in the Republican platform, finding that each plank of the
   contract was represented in the 2012 Republican national platform.
   Increased emphasis on the constitution and fiscal responsibility did not
   come at the expense of the inclusion of social conservatism or religion.
   Placing fiscal conservatism within a context of morality and
   responsibility to God, the 2012 platform reveals a move toward the
   fusionism popularized by Reagan. The incorporation of Contract from
   America goals indicates assimilation of Tea Party ideology within the
   GOP, potentially precipitating the movement's decline. By adopting Tea
   Party movement compatible ideology, the Republican Party shifted further
   right, possibly alienating moderate voters in the 2012 election.},

Abstract = {This article examines the normative aspirations of the umma in
   international relations (IR). It is not the intention of this article to
   provide the blueprint of a `Muslim EU', rather, in comparing the
   articulation of the European Union (EU) and the umma in IR, the article
   shows the way in which the EU represents a (limited) `European umma',
   and charts the difficulties faced by both assemblies in being analysed
   in IR, by virtue of their shared transnational character. However, the
   Muslim umma assembly is shown to face more problems than its erstwhile
   EU counterpart due to the religious nature of the umma. The article
   charts the use of constructivism in IR to explain the creation of norms
   and identity in the international system, accounting for the EU's
   supranational presence in international politics. The application of
   constructivism to the umma, however, is shown to be more problematic due
   to the secular bias in IR and, perhaps more importantly, the Islamic
   resurgence being insufficiently concerned with the constitutive elements
   within it.},

Abstract = {The possible peacebuilding role of ex-combatants has been acknowledged
   in literature and established through various peacebuilding processes in
   post-conflict societies. One such process involves the participation of
   ex-combatants in dialogues with young people, with the purpose of
   demystifying war experiences as well as restoring the damaged social
   fabric and facilitating the social reintegration of ex-combatants. This
   article investigates the potential for a constructive use of war
   experiences through conversations between ex-combatants and youth. It
   provides a description and analysis of a case study, a pilot project
   called Dialogues, run by Novi Sad based out of the `Centre for War
   Trauma' in Serbia since 2009. This project brings ex-combatants into
   Serbian high schools to meet with youth, share their war experiences and
   answer any questions young people may have in relation to their
   participation in an armed conflict. The article evaluates the project
   and suggests that ex-combatants' efforts to engage in peacebuilding
   processes in Serbia should be acknowledged and supported by the Serbian
   government. It suggests that the narratives of ex-combatants provide a
   unique opportunity for young people to reflect on and explore the
   complexities of recent conflict.},

Title = {BARGAINING OVER BITS, ARBITRATING AWARDS The Regime for Protection and
   Promotion of International Investment},

Volume = {66},

Abstract = {The regime for international investment is extraordinary in public
   international law and controversial in many regions of the world. This
   article explores two aspects of this set of rules: its decentralization
   and the unusual powers it gives to private actors to invoke dispute
   settlement. Decentralization has contributed to a competitive
   environment for ratification of bilateral investment treaties (Bus) and
   has elevated the importance of dyadic bargaining power in the formation
   of the regime. Governments of developing countries are more likely to
   enter into BITS and tie their hands more tightly when they are in a weak
   bargaining position, which in turn is associated with economic downturns
   of the domestic economy. Once committed, investors have sued governments
   with surprising regularity, arguably contributing disproportionately to
   legal awards that favor the private corporate actors who have the power
   to convene the dispute settlement system. States have begun to push
   back, revising their obligations and attempting to annul arbitral
   awards. One of the conclusions is that it is important not only to
   consider whether BITs attract capital-which has been the focus of nearly
   all the empirical research on BIT effects-but also to investigate the
   governance consequences of the international investment regime
   generally.},

Abstract = {When Barack Obama became U.S. President in 2009, one of his main goals
   was to strengthen U.S. climate policy, but five years later this goal
   has still to be realized. Here, we explore the significance of this lack
   of achievement: First, we analyse the strategies of Democratic leaders
   in building winning coalitions in the U.S. Congress to overcome
   long-established conflicts concerning climate change policy in the
   United States. We find that it was close to impossible for the Senate
   leadership to come up with compromises that would mobilize sufficient
   support for climate legislation. Second, we investigate how three major
   events served to reinforce conflicts in the legislative climate debate:
   the establishment of the Tea Party movement, the oil disaster in the
   Gulf of Mexico and the financial crisis. Finally, we discuss
   implications of the Obama administration's failure to realize its
   climate policy ambitions in regard to prospects for U.S. participation
   in an international climate agreement. U.S. participation in
   international cooperation greatly depends on domestic policies. The deep
   conflicts in this issue area imply that U.S. participation in an
   international climate agreement in the near future is highly unlikely.},

Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},

Pages = {388-404},
Abstract = {Gender historians have identified the period around 1800 as a crucial
   time for the transforming of elite masculinities in Europe. This article
   contributes to scholarship on the intersection of masculinities and
   states by centring on the formation of a new, partially independent,
   Norway around 184, when the Norwegian constitution was crafted. I use
   the analysis of Norway as an entry to exploring broader European trends
   at that time. As this article shows, Norwegian ideals of masculinity
   suitable for state office are a good illustration of more general
   interpretations of elite manhood in northern Europe. Norwegian
   constructions did offer a twist, however, as they idealized the
   Norwegian elite male as rough, unsophisticated and natural. In contrast
   to other forms of elite state-bearing European masculinity, which
   emphasized advancement and cultivation, Norwegian masculinity was
   celebrated for its lack of refinement.},

Abstract = {The 2014 European Parliament elections saw an unprecedented surge of
   support for Eurosceptic parties. This article provides an overview of
   the ideologically highly diverse Eurosceptic camp in the European
   Parliament and addresses the causes and consequences of the Eurosceptic
   vote. Based on an analysis of aggregate election results and
   opinion-poll data, it argues that the electoral success of Eurosceptic
   parties cannot be dismissed as a mere protest vote against unpopular
   governments. Instead, fundamental worries about the effects of European
   Union (EU) policies and dissatisfaction with mainstream politics lie at
   the heart of the Eurosceptic success. The selection of Jean-Claude
   Juncker as President of the Commission, backed by overwhelming
   majorities in the European Council and the European Parliament, suggests
   that Eurosceptics, despite their considerable electoral support, will
   continue to be excluded from the EU's corridors of power. This strategy
   of exclusion provides the ideal breeding ground for an even stronger
   Eurosceptic backlash in five years' time.},

Abstract = {Illegal organizations, like mafia syndicates, gangs, and insurgencies,
   are often highly cohesive and hostile toward the outside world. Such
   groups cultivate a particular form of ``anti-social{''} capital, which
   relies on ingroup bonding and limits outgroup bridging for the purpose
   of commissioning illicit acts. We argue that experiences within the
   group leave members with varying intensities of anti-social capital, and
   that higher intensities lead to significantly weaker relationships with
   political institutions and civil society, even many years after they
   exit the group. We test this theory using survey data from 1,485 former
   members of insurgent and paramilitary groups in Colombia, along with
   insights from 68 qualitative interviews. We find strong evidence that
   anti-social capital has individually varying and sticky effects on
   former members. These effects are pervasive and intense, and exhibit
   surprising and counterintuitive properties: former members of pro-state
   militia with higher levels of anti-social capital are systematically
   less likely to trust political institutions, while members of
   peasant-based insurgent groups with high levels of anti-social capital
   are less likely to participate in their communities.},

Abstract = {In a recent article, Michael Laver has explained `Why Vote-Seeking
   Parties May Make Voters Miserable'. His model shows that, while
   ideological convergence may boost congruence between governments and the
   median voter, it can reduce congruence between the party system and the
   electorate as a whole. Specifically, convergence can increase the mean
   distance between voters and their nearest party. In this article we show
   that this captures the reality of today's British party system. Policy
   scale placements in British Election Studies from 1987 to 2010 confirm
   that the pronounced convergence during the past decade has left the
   Conservatives and Labour closer together than would be optimal in terms
   of minimising the policy distance between the average voter and the
   nearest major party. We go on to demonstrate that this comes at a cost.
   Respondents who perceive themselves as further away from one of the
   major parties in the system tend to score lower on satisfaction with
   democracy. In short, vote-seeking parties have left the British party
   system less representative of the ideological diversity in the
   electorate, and thus made at least some British voters miserable.},

Abstract = {In this article I explore the theoretical and policy implications of

   means to addressing institutional gender injustice. I consider the work
   of three prominent thinkers on affirmative action and institutional
   injustice, Ronald Dworkin, Anne Phillips and Iris Marion Young, and
   present an argument in favour of a specific form of state-administered
   female quota model which I shall call the Critical Mass Marker approach.
   I argue that this is a more refined and effective approach to
   institutional gender injustice than current affirmative action models.},

Abstract = {This article investigates whether vote-buying and the instigation of
   violence in the disputed 2007 Kenyan elections were strategically
   motivated and whether those affected by vote-buying or post-electoral
   violence changed their views toward ethnopolitics and the use of
   violence. To answer these questions, a panel survey conducted before and
   after the elections is combined with external indicators of electoral
   violence. We find that vote-buying was used to mobilize parties' own
   strongholds. Political parties also targeted vote-buying and threats
   toward specific ethnic groups and areas, potentially to weaken the
   support of their political rivals. In addition, we find that the victims
   of post-electoral violence are more likely to identify in ethnic terms
   and support the use of violence. The non-victims of post-electoral
   violence, but who experienced vote-buying after our first survey are
   also more likely to support the use of violence.},

Abstract = {This research note discusses limitations of principal-agent (PA)
   analysis in explaining gradual change in international organisations
   (IOs). It suggests that historical institutionalism (HI) can fill
   important gaps left by the PA approach and identifies scope conditions
   for both approaches. For this purpose, a distinction is made between two
   sources of state power that PA usually treats as synergistic - namely
   the formal control of IO decisions and material power resources. While
   PA analysis is best applicable where reform coalitions of like-minded
   member states control both formal and material resources, in many
   contexts there exist frictions between material and formal power in IOs.
   In these constellations recent HI-inspired works on gradual modes of
   change such as layering' and drift' are of particular relevance. This
   research avenue is illustrated with empirical examples from a variety of
   international organisations.},

Abstract = {A major debate within foreign aid literature is whether civil society
   can be `purchased' through outside assistance. We test this proposition
   by exploring the influence of aid provided by the United States Agency
   for International Development on post-communist civil rights
   environments. A review of research critical of international assistance
   highlights the risk of unsustainability, polarization and dependence
   among recipient civic organizations. We argue that a more effective
   stimulant is socio-economic growth, which stimulates committed
   constituencies, higher citizen expectations and pressure on the state to
   protect civil freedoms. Using cross-sectional, time-series data from 27
   post-communist countries, we find no evidence that aid independently
   promotes stronger civil rights environments but that economic growth
   produces substantial improvements. Further, any aid effectiveness
   appears to be conditional on economic strength. We conclude that
   developmental organizations should reassess how and where civil society
   aid is targeted.},

Abstract = {Numerous studies find modest, consistent gender differences in
   environmental concern within the general publics of North American and
   European countries, but results from the few studies of gender
   differences among politicians are inconsistent. We test if women report
   stronger environmental concern than men across four levels of the
   Swedish polity, utilising three data sets: a representative sample of
   the general public, a survey of all representatives in municipal-level
   and county-level councils, and a survey of members of the Swedish
   Parliament. Results from our multivariate ordered logistic regression
   models reveal a consistent pattern across the lower three levels: women
   report greater environmental concern than men in the general public and
   in municipal and county councils. In the Swedish Parliament, however,
   the apparent effect of gender is largely explained by political
   orientation.},

Abstract = {We develop conceptual understanding of political commitment in two
   approaches to organising municipal responses to climate adaptation. The
   dedicated approach, based on direct political commitment to climate
   adaptation, implies political agenda setting, resource allocation, and
   clear policy objectives which are expected to facilitate rapid
   implementation due to political pressure and new structures. The
   mainstreaming approach is based on indirect political commitment:
   climate adaptation `piggybacks' on the established commitment of policy
   domains in which it is integrated, and institutional entrepreneurs and
   framing are considered necessary to establish policy synergies and to
   mobilise actors and resources. An implication is that implementation may
   be erratic, as entrepreneurs have to pioneer within existing structures.
   The cases of two Dutch cities - Amsterdam and Rotterdam - help to
   illustrate and refine our propositions on the nature and implications of
   political commitment.},

Abstract = {Through a case study of the formulation of the English NHS Plan 2000,
   this article investigates which of two competing models of the British
   policy process-the Differentiated Polity and Asymmetric Power
   Models-better describes the reality of major NHS reform policy making
   under New Labour. The process of developing the Plan showed signs of a
   more open policy process, seemingly closer to the DPM. There was
   contestability of policy advice and limited involvement of the medical
   profession through its representative bodies. However, the process was
   tightly controlled and personally led by the Secretary of State and his
   advisers, with the direct involvement of the Prime Minister throughout.
   Two key moments of interest group involvement-the Modernisation Action
   Teams and the signing of the Plan by health sector organisations-were
   marked by power asymmetries. Overall, the APM better describes the
   reality of major reform policy making under New Labour.},

   many the upheaval in the East the chain of dramatic events that led to
   the accomplishment of what most among us thought to be unthinkable: the
   collapse of communist regimes, the end of a system that seemed destined
   to last forever. The revolutions of 1989 resulted in the rehabilitation
   of individual dignity after decades of dictatorial domination. The
   post-1989 East-Central Europe has been a battlefield between proponents
   of civic-liberal values and supporters of populist, ethnocentric,
   illiberal movements. Pre-communist and Communist legacies continue to
   influence the democratic transitions.},

Abstract = {The receptor approach relies on ethnographic research to identify social
   institutions and cultural values that match international human rights
   obligations. Where these institutions and values fall short, home-grown
   remedies are used to amplify them. The receptor approach provides a
   practical tool to activists and states. In addition, it welcomes culture
   as a potential source of human rights rather than dismissing it as an
   impediment to their protection. Yvonne Donders and Vincent Vleugel's
   position that it is ``old wine in new bags{''} is therefore unfounded.
   The same is true for their argument that it pits ``the West against the
   rest.{''} Research shows that regional values are still notably
   different. States are entitled to take these cultural differences into
   account when implementing their human rights obligations. Denying them
   their right to do so will force Southern states to disengage.},

Abstract = {New ways of looking at texts may help to protect the basis of human
   rights: that all people are recognized as people. This article develops
   an interpretative convention, the ``corporeal mentality,{''} to compel
   consideration of the corporeal nature of human beings when reading human
   rights texts. Attention is paid to the status and history of the
   Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) as well as to an artwork
   that writes this text in human blood: The Book of Blood. By considering
   the meaning of blood as both signifier and index, I argue that blood and
   the body it indexes can inform a new interpretative convention that
   recognizes that all people have something in common: blood and bodies.
   This convention can also be justified by acknowledging that all texts
   are both visual and corporeal. A reading of a single article of the UDHR
   shows how the corporeal mentality functions in practice.},

Abstract = {While it is commonly assumed that the United States uses foreign aid as
   an instrument to combat global terrorism, it is unclear whether it views
   terrorist threats to other countries, particularly its allies, with
   urgency. We show that the relationship between transnational terrorism
   and foreign aid flows is strongly conditional on whether terrorist
   activity based in a potential recipient directly threatens the United
   States. Using data on terrorist attacks and casualties in potential
   recipient countries, we demonstrate that terrorist activity based within
   a state's borders, which targets US interests is a strong determinant of
   both whether that state receives any aid and also how much aid it
   receives. In contrast, the presence of terrorism targeted at non-US
   interests, even if it targets formal allies of the United States, is
   generally unrelated to US aid allocation. These findings suggest that
   the United States' use of foreign aid to fight terrorism and political
   violence is narrowly tailored to assist countries that directly threaten
   its own security, rather than those of other countries, even its allies.},

Abstract = {Researchers from various disciplines have built impressive but distinct
   compendia on climate change; the defining challenge for humanity. In the
   spirit of Lord Dahrendorf, this paper represents the output of
   interdisciplinary collaboration and integrates state-of-the-art academic
   expertise from the fields of philosophy, economics and governance. Our
   focus is on Europe, which is widely perceived as a leader in climate
   change mitigation and adaptation. However, leadership weakness on
   climate over recent years, largely due to recession and political
   vacillation, is eroding this perception. What is needed is a firm
   justification for strong climate action, acknowledgement of the
   available tools, awareness of the reasons for our failures to date, and
   a realistic, but goal-oriented strategy for an integrated climate
   policy. We therefore present current normative insights from climate
   justice research highlighting the need to make institutions responsive
   to those most vulnerable; we discuss the economics of the transition to
   a low-carbon economy, pointing to key policy instruments and post-2020
   climate targets for the EU; we contrast the normative and quantitative
   synoptic principles with the particularistic implementation schemes and
   politics of (not) implementing measures on the ground; and we suggest a
   careful coordination of European climate policies with acute challenges
   that could increase both climate justice and political feasibility.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the different schools of thought on the Good
   Living and tries to answer the question: what are the different schools
   that we can identify within the thought on the Good Living? For this
   aim, we have taken as hypothesis that such thought is divided into
   several schools.
   In order to explore the complexity of the Good Living thought, we have
   created a typology of schools of that thought from the competing
   paradigms approach and we have verified their existence through the
   making and analysis of cognitive map of an author in each school.
   The first approach is that indigenous intellectuals have issued under
   Sumak Kawsay expression. The second one is a variant of the XXI Century
   Socialism, called ``Socialism of Sumak Kawsay{''}, proposed by the
   Government of Ecuador, or ``Andean Communitary Socialism{''}, proposed
   by the Government of Bolivia. And the third one is that which considers
   the Good Living as an ``utopia for (re) construct{''} or an
   ``alternative to development{''} to ``germinate{''}, with an eclectic
   approach.
   After locating the main intellectuals of thought on Good Living (Pablo
   Davalos, Rene Ramirez and Alberto Acosta), we have reviewed their main
   contributions and represented their thought through cognitive maps.
   Through these maps, we identify the three mentioned schools. The
   cognitive map of Davalos shows that his thought corresponds to the
   indigenist school of Good Living. The cognitive map of Ramirez shows
   that his thought corresponds to the socialist school of Good Living. And
   the cognitive map of Acosta shows that his thought corresponds to the
   post-developmentalist school of Good Living.
   At the end, we have concluded that the thought on the Good Living is
   divided into three schools, the indigenist, the socialist and
   post-developmentalist, and those correspond to three different
   epistemological frameworks, the Andean worldview (or ancestral
   indigenous thought), the modernism (or thought of Modernity) and the
   post-modernism (or thought of the Post-modernity). However, these
   schools are variants of a leftist thought on the Good Living.},

Abstract = {This paper intends to build a case for a third alternative that can
   reconcile the two opposing views of democracy, i.e., the consensual vs.
   the adversarial, through a reexamination and reconstruction of Chinese
   traditional theories of political governance. The paper links the rule
   of virtue with consensual politics, and the rule of law with adversary
   politics, By focusing on the roles of virtue and law, and their
   importance to the acquisition and maintenance of original and
   utilitarian dimensions of political legitimacy, the paper proposes a
   hybrid version of democracy that will continue the dualist political
   tradition while enabling necessary political modernization.},

Abstract = {This paper sheds light on the policy coordination concept and explores
   its implications for science, technology, and innovation (STI) policies
   at the regional level. In particular it analyzes whether systemic and
   complex STI policies entail a larger and more complex need for
   coordination. We contribute to the literature by developing a conceptual
   framework that brings together insights from institutional and public
   policy theories with concepts from STI policy and regional innovation
   systems. This model is evidenced in the Basque Country (Spain). The
   paper introduces the concept of ``coordination-mix,{''} which is defined
   as the combination of mechanisms that respond to the coordination
   failures that are derived from a complex policy setting where multiple
   instruments from different domains, levels, and actors coexist. It also
   complements the literature with a third policy dimension, the
   multi-layer, which adds to the multi-level and policy-mix dimensions
   already established in the STI policy realm.},

Abstract = {The literature on economic sanctions has long studied sender countries'
   policymaking as a simple choice between imposing sanctions to extract
   concessions from the targeted country and doing nothing. We depart from
   this simplifying assumption and analyze sanctions as a multifaceted
   foreign policy instrument. We argue that senders design sanction
   policies in response to policy preferences of two domestic
   constituencies. Voters expect a response to an international dispute in
   the form of some policy, such as economic sanctions; hence, the sender's
   policymakers seek to demonstrate their competence in foreign affairs by
   imposing sanctions. Once the policymakers announce the use of sanctions,
   special interest groups that stand to experience economic losses when
   this foreign policy is implemented pressure the policymakers to choose
   sanction measures limiting such losses. As a result, the policymakers
   design sanction policies to include measures that will be less
   detrimental to special interest groups. We test our theoretical argument
   using the Threat and Imposition of Sanctions data and show that, while
   pressures from public opinion increase the likelihood of sanctions,
   special interest groups that benefit from the relationship with the
   target country are associated with a lower probability of the use of
   sanction measures that would impose substantial costs on domestic
   interest groups.},

Abstract = {This article examines the prominent location of offshore financial
   centres (OFCs) among the leading origin and destination points for
   foreign direct investment (FDI) to China. The OFC (characterised as a
   tax haven) frequently has been ignored or assumed out of analyses on
   Chinese FDI as simply servicing tax minimisation practices. This article
   challenges that assumption and emphasises the financial intermediation
   role performed by the Caribbean OFC beyond practices of tax arbitrage.
   Through the use of an international business company (IBC) registered in
   an OFC these jurisdictions perform several functions for investors, to
   include providing access to foreign capital markets, reducing tax
   obligations across multiple jurisdictions and concealing potential
   politically-sensitive beneficial ownership of the investment. This
   assessment for the role of the OFC in circuits of global capital
   involving FDI to China demonstrates that China's relationship with the
   OFC is different from that experienced by Europe and North America.},

Abstract = {The literature expects public service motivation (PSM) to affect
   performance, but most of the existing studies of this relationship use
   subjective performance data and focus on output rather than outcome.
   This article investigates the association between PSM and the
   performance of Danish teachers using an objective outcome measure (the
   students' academic performance in their final examinations). Combining
   survey data and administrative register data in a multilevel data set,
   we are able to control very robustly for the specific characteristics of
   the students (n = 5,631), the schools (n = 85), and other teacher
   characteristics (n = 694) besides PSM. We find that PSM is positively
   associated with examination marks. The result indicates that PSM may be
   relevant for performance improvements.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2014},

Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {417-423},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {There is an extensive literature on acts, events and people in
   international politics that may be described as `evil', but much less
   work specifically focusing on how this idea operates and is used in an
   international context. This has begun to change recently, however, as a
   result of leading international figures - most notably George W. Bush -
   using the term prominently. This special issue seeks to further advance
   scholarship on these issues by moving beyond purely philosophical
   accounts on the nature of evil, and considering: how it has been used to
   frame the identities of actors in international relations (IR); whether
   it works to enable or preclude specific kinds of behaviour; and what
   role it plays as part of our moral and political vocabulary. This
   introduction provides a brief survey of the literature on evil in IR,
   and gives an overview of the contributions to the special issue.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the relationship between strategies to manage
   poverty and the mobilisation of collective action. Focusing on the
   period 1979-93, the paper describes how the British Conservative
   government employed a combination of supportive and punitive
   interventions to manage homelessness in London. In the process, the
   paper finds, the government also effectively managed the mobilisation of
   collective dissent by containing the disruptive effects of visible
   homelessness while channelling opposition into conventional routes of
   political power.The paper integrates recent research on poverty
   management with insights from social movement theory and explores the
   implications of these findings for contemporary homeless politics.},

Abstract = {Successful decentralisation joins public finances and fiscal authority
   with the responsibility for providing services with functions of local
   government. The paper deals with decentralisation of public
   administration in EU countries, focusing on fiscal decentralisation and
   local government expenditures, allocated for financing the requirements
   of local and regional sector. Attention is paid to theoretical aspects,
   reform tendencies, approaches and measuring fiscal decentralisation, but
   also to the role of local budgets when providing for public services.
   The research proper is concentrated on the extent of expenditure
   decentralisation in EU countries over the years 2001-2012 and on mutual
   relations of local government expenditures, seen as \% of general
   government expenditures, and as \% of GDP.},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {This article deals with the impact of the EU's endeavours to achieve
   financial market integration and the free movement of capital on rules
   of the Member States that limit autonomy of public bodies when making
   investment decisions. These rules have direct importance for rules such
   as those applicable in Slovenia which require 1,500 public entities to
   invest their liquid assets exceeding EUR 100,000 solely in securities of
   the Republic of Slovenia and not in securities of other EU Member
   States. In this case, they are obliged to offer their liquid assets
   first to the Ministry of Finance, thereby running the risk that such
   liquid assets would be decommitted and allocated to other public
   purposes. The aim of this article is to develop arguments to the effect
   that, in the light of the freedom of movement of capital as construed by
   the Court of Justice of the EU, especially in the recent case concerning
   Polish open pension funds (OPFs) the investment policy of indirect
   budget spending units should be more open not only from the viewpoint of
   ensuring the EU single market but mainly from the perspective of the
   profitability of public finance. The security of investments can also be
   achieved in ways other than closing the investment market for all public
   entities.},

Title = {Disarming norms: postcolonial agency and the constitution of the
   international},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL THEORY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {372-390},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The aim of this article is to provide a postcolonial reading of norms in
   international politics. Focusing specifically on the question of
   postcolonial agency, the article argues that the constructivist
   literature provides a distinctive spatial and temporal ordering of the
   `international' that on the one hand can be seen to attribute agency to
   the postcolonial subject, while on the other can easily be interpreted
   as denying a presence for this subject. An alternative reading suggests
   that postcolonial agency is not only constituted by the international
   and its normative construction, but is also constituting, having the
   capacity to variously subvert and transform, but within limits. While
   some constructivist thinkers, primary among them being Christian
   Reus-Smit, recognise the normative order of the international as
   historically contested terrain, and where such contestation testifies to
   the role of the postcolonial world, how this role is articulated, and in
   what terms it is understood pose distinct challenges for understandings
   of agency and the constitution of the international. Focusing on Homi
   Bhabha and Franz Fanon, the article looks to how postcolonial thought
   can be mobilised to respond to this challenge, and to point to an
   alternative conception of the transformative potential of postcolonial
   agency. The turn to Bhabha and Fanon reveals such potential in both
   discursive and material terms so that where Bhabha can be said to frame
   agency and the terrain of the international in hybrid ideational terms,
   complementing Reus-Smit's understanding of what can be termed the
   `postcolonial international', Fanon's more radical materialist ontology
   envisages agency in terms of embodied presence. This mobilisation of
   postcolonial thought provides the theoretical tools for conceptualising
   postcolonial subjectivity and articulations of agency in relation to the
   international and its constitution.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a framework for understanding the ways in which
   social processes produce social inequality. Specifically, we focus on a
   particular type of social process that has received limited attention in
   the literature and in which inter-subjective meaning-making is central:
   cultural processes. Much of the literature on inequality has focused on
   the actions of dominant actors and institutions in gaining access to
   material and non-material resources, or on how ecological effects cause
   unequal access to material resources. In contrast, we focus on processes
   that contribute to the production (and reproduction) of inequality
   through the routine and taken-for-granted actions of both dominant and
   subordinate actors. We highlight two types of cultural processes:
   identification and rationalization. We describe and illustrate four
   processes that we consider to be significant analytical exemplars of
   these two types of cultural processes: racialization and stigmatization
   (for identification) and standardization and evaluation (for
   rationalization). We argue that attention to such cultural processes is
   critical and complementary to current explanations of social inequality.},

Abstract = {This study addresses the central question in political economy how the
   objectives of attaining economic growth and restricting income
   inequality are related. Thus far few studies explicitly distinguish
   between effects of income inequality as such and effects of
   redistributing public interventions to equalize incomes on economic
   growth. In fact, most studies rely on data that do not make this
   distinction properly and in which top-coding is applied so that
   enrichment at the top end of the distribution is not adequately
   captured. This study aims to contribute using a pooled time-series
   cross-section design covering 29 countries, using OECD, LIS, and World
   Top Income data. No robust association between inequality and growth or
   redistribution and growth is found. Yet there are signs for a positive
   association between top incomes and growth, although the coefficient is
   small and a causal interpretation does not seem to be warranted.},

Abstract = {Individual basic security is limited in Pakistan as the state is
   institutionally weak. One way to attain basic security is by joining
   groups who provide security and services. Consequently, groups not part
   of the political mainstream, to attract a following, must therefore show
   that they are sufficiently powerful to obtain concessions from
   established actors. Thus, by engaging in violence primarily of a
   sectarian nature, the Pakistani Taliban sustains itself as a unified
   force while also highlighting that it is a powerful group, which in turn
   it hopes would enable it to curve a political space and win concessions
   from the established elite. Using social group identity theory, club
   goods, and the economics of extremism, the article highlights why the
   Pakistani Taliban has increasingly attacked minorities and why more must
   be done to address sectarian violence.},

Abstract = {To understand dynamics within communities of organized interests,
   researchers have primarily studied organizational births and deaths. The
   organizational development of established interest organizations has
   received far less attention. This article claims that the evolution of
   interest groups' organizational features is strongly affected by
   evolving resource dependencies with the state. A life-history case study
   of an environmental interest organization is used to substantiate this
   argument empirically. The findings demonstrate that resource dependence
   relations with state actors critically shape organizational development,
   but that this dependence affects an organization's mission, structure,
   and strategy in different ways. This conclusion highlights the vital
   role of government patronage in the survival and maintenance of interest
   organizations.},

Abstract = {What explains the global variation in laws criminalizing homosexual
   conduct? Recent research has claimed that British colonialism is largely
   responsible for the criminalization of homosexuality around the world.
   This article utilizes a newly constructed dataset that includes
   up-to-date data on 185 countries to assess this claim. We find that
   British colonies are much more likely to have criminalization of
   homosexual conduct laws than other colonies or other states in general.
   This result holds after controlling for other variables that might be
   expected to influence the likelihood of repressive lesbian, gay,
   bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights legislation. However, we also
   find that the evidence in favour of the claim that British imperialism
   `poisoned' societies against homosexuality is weak. British colonies do
   not systematically take longer to decriminalize homosexual conduct than
   other European colonies.},

Abstract = {This paper examines changes in the in the composition of the North
   Korean elite from 1997 to 2012, a particularly tumultuous period in the
   history of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
   Specifically, the paper assesses the changing composition of the
   leadership networks around both Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un, using data
   from the entourages that accompanied the great leaders on their ``on the
   spot guidance{''} inspection tours. The paper finds that there have been
   significant changes in the leadership elite since the succession of Kim
   Jong Un. The paper offers some observations regarding the implications
   these changes have on the receptivity of the regime to a normalization
   of relations with the West and future economic and political reform. (C)

Abstract = {This article surveys and discusses the latest wave of mass protests in
   Ukraine, the Euromaydan. This study situates the Euromaydan within the
   history of the other protests in post-communist Ukraine and makes a
   comparison to the Orange Revolution (the Orange Revolution). The authors
   recognize the importance of international factors, but argue that
   Ukrainian domestic political factors contributed significantly not only
   to the emergence, but also to escalation of the latest conflict in
   Ukraine. This study tests a theory about the role of institutional
   factors versus the role of cultural-historic legacies in the process of
   mass protest formation and conflict development. We argue that
   institutional factors, such as: governmental policies; the composition
   of governmental, opposition, and civil society groups; corruption; and
   timing of legislative activity on most divisive issues in Ukraine have
   contributed to the conflict escalation in Ukraine. (C) 2014 Published by

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to assess if inflation targeting
   post-communist economies performed better, in terms of output growth,
   during the crisis than their non-inflation targeting counterparts. The
   paper also puts the issue in the context of the preconditions of
   inflation targeters to adopt this regime. 26 post-communist economies of
   Central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States
   are analyzed during the ongoing economic crisis. Results suggest that
   inflation targeters of those countries performed worse than
   non-inflation targeters. The growth decline in inflation targeters
   post-communist economies has been estimated to be deeper by about four
   percentage points than that in non-inflation targeters. The study finds
   very limited role of the preconditions for growth decline. Only the
   lower amount of monetary financing of the budget may have contributed in
   inflation-targeting countries to have gone through the crisis better.

Abstract = {This article analyzes the magical realist mode of writing in two novels
   by Polish author Olga Tokarczuk: Primeval and Other Times (1996) and
   House of Day, House of Night (1998). While Tokarczuk herself rejects the
   label ``magical realism,{''} her novels exhibit such key magical realist
   characteristics as disruption of rationally ordered time and space, the
   rejection of dominant historical and cultural narratives, an exploration
   of alternate epistemological forms of inquiry, and literalization of
   language, metaphor, and imagination. In Primeval, Tokarczuk presents a
   world that exists at the intersection between cyclical (mythical) and
   linear times; in House the novel asserts historical order through the
   dominance of space over time. In both novels, Tokarczuk's poetics of the
   Word (Logos) becomes key to establishing a sense of magical realism in
   the texts. By using these and other magical realist narrative
   techniques, Tokarczuk deftly questions dominant discourses of Polish
   history and culture, such as that of the ``Recovered Territories{''} or
   the power of religious faith. The presence of the magical realist mode
   in Tokarczuk's work has important implications for the study of magical
   realism in general and Polish literary studies in particular.},

   findings do not support the contention that municipal reinvention
   decreases the price of municipal governance between mayor-council and
   council-manager cities. However, local conditions have a significant
   effect on the cost of the two forms of governments.},

Abstract = {Amid concerns for a regulatory void in transnational fields, the
   principle of private regulation has become institutionalized. Many
   sectors have seen the emergence of multiple and overlapping standards.
   When comparing the sectors, there is considerable variation in standard
   multiplicity. We build on three institutional perspectives that have
   been put forward to explain the emergence of sustainability standards
   -the economic, idealist and political-institutional perspectives -to
   analyze the phenomenon of standard multiplicity. Each perspective
   reflects a different kind of action logic and is simultaneously present
   and accessible to various parties involved. Based on a cross-sector
   analysis of standards multiplicity in the forestry, coffee and textile
   sectors, this article seeks to make two contributions. First, whereas
   these three perspectives have been presented as competing, we propose
   that they are complementary in offering partial explanations for
   different episodes in the dynamics underlying standards multiplicity in
   different sectors. Second, whereas most studies have analyzed standard
   setting in single sectors and thus have understood it as being an
   intra-sector phenomenon, our cross-sector analysis of the dynamics of
   standard setting suggests that it is propelled by both sector-specific
   contingencies and experiences as well as by the experiences from other
   sectors.},

Title = {Socializing the C-suite: why some big-box retailers are ``greener{''}

Abstract = {Despite a considerable push by policy-makers to incentivize green
   business practices, take-up of environmental initiatives amongst North
   American retailers has been highly uneven. While some ``big-box{''}
   retailers have launched ambitious environmental initiatives, others
   continue to conduct business as usual. This paper asks: why do some
   mega-retailers commit to ambitious environmental agendas while others in
   the same sector do not? And how can the answer to this question improve
   public policy? I investigate these questions using comparative case
   studies of four North American big-box retailers: Wal-Mart, Target,
   Costco and Kroger. My findings suggest that the socialization of senior
   executives through multi-stakeholder sustainability networks is the
   critical variable accounting for progressive environmental practices in
   some corporations and not others. This finding suggests that existing
   public policies that focus on making the business case for
   sustainability are based on incomplete assumptions about why companies
   ``go green.{''} It further suggests that socialization theory can help
   explain broader instances of corporate social responsibility and
   proposes that scholars in this field should devote more attention to the
   composition of socializing groups.},

Abstract = {Third-party conflict management, particularly legal dispute resolution
   (arbitration and adjudication) and mediation, can help improve the
   willingness of disputants to make asymmetric concessions by ameliorating
   commitment problems and providing political cover. In both regards, and
   especially pertaining to commitment problems, mediation has substantial
   limitations when compared to legal dispute resolution. We develop these
   arguments and test the observable implications on the Issue Correlates
   of War data. To get traction on the mechanisms at work, we distinguish
   between challenger concessions and defender concessions, positing that
   challenger concessions face the primary hurdle of political cover while
   defender concessions face the primary hurdle of commitment problems. We
   find that legal dispute resolution strongly increases the propensity for
   concessions by both challengers and targets, even major asymmetric
   concessions. Mediation, on the other hand, only helps increase minor
   challenger concessions. Also consistent with expectations, mediation
   best enables asymmetric challenger concessions in the highly salient
   cases that need the most political cover, and legal dispute resolution
   best enables asymmetric concessions when there has been a history of
   failed conflict management attempts that perpetuate mistrust.},

Abstract = {European Union health policy has long had two faces. One face was its
   most visible: its support for data, networks, agencies and research that
   promoted shared practice and health objectives in fields such as cancer
   and communicable disease control. The impact the first face was striking
   mostly because the budget was so small. A second was long its most
   important: its courts' application of internal market law and regulation
   to health care services in pursuit of an integrated European market and
   freedom of movement of goods, capital, services and people. The impact
   of this face created EU health care politics, but ultimately had limited
   effects on health care systems. Since 2010, though, the reaction to
   financial crisis has given EU health policy a third face: a newly
   rigorous and intimate fiscal governance model in which member state
   policies and budgets will be under continuous review, and countries in
   extreme trouble will face elaborate loan conditions affecting health
   care in detail. The credibility and wisdom of these new policies is yet
   to be seen and will be contested, but in principle they commit member
   states to detailed EU oversight of their health care systems and
   priorities in pursuit of fiscal rigor. (c) 2014 Policy and Society

Abstract = {Developing countries have increasingly opened their economies to trade.
   Research about trade policy in developed countries focuses on a
   bottom-up process by identifying economic preferences of domestic
   groups. We know less about developing countries. We analyze how economic
   and political variables influenced Costa Rican voters in a referendum on
   CAFTA-DR, an international trade agreement. We find little support for
   Stolper-Samuelson models of economic preferences, but more support for
   specific factor models. We also isolate the effects of political parties
   on the referendum, controlling for many economic factors; we document
   how at least one party influenced voters and this made the difference
   for CAFTA-DR passage. Politics, namely parties using their
   organizational strength to cue and frame messages for voters, influenced
   this important trade policy decision. Theories about trade policy need
   to take into account top-down political factors along with economic
   interests.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},

Volume = {51},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article calls into question the efficacy of systemic accounts of
   weak state foreign policy behavior through a case study of Mongolia's
   foreign policy behavior toward China. In particular, it challenges the
   contention within international relations and foreign policy analysis
   literature that weak states' foreign policy is structurally determined.
   Employing James Rosenau's five-part typology of foreign policy, the
   article demonstrates how Mongolia's - a prototypical weak state -
   foreign policy toward China is driven by domestic factors. It also
   considers the case study's implications for both the study of weak
   states and Northeast Asian regional dynamics.},

Abstract = {Romanian anti-communist armed resistance has received relatively little
   attention outside the country, despite its resemblance to other small,
   diffused, headless insurgencies being fought in the first decades of the
   twenty-first century. This article deals with military operations
   mounted against the partisans, with a special focus on tactics such as
   cordoning, checkpoints, patrols, sweeps, ambushes, and informed strikes.
   Based mostly on primary sources, it highlights success and failure
   against determined and elusive guerrillas.},

Abstract = {The paper delves into the concept of Open Government, analysing and
   characterising its participatory dimension. It proposes firstly a
   typology of participatory actions that illustrates the strengthening
   effect that ICT have on the different participation forms. Secondly, it
   presents the ``Participation Schemas{''}, a conceptual tool that
   facilitates the analysis and standardized representation of the most
   important dimensions of participation. Participation Schemas provide
   both a categorization model that deepens our critical understanding of
   participation and a powerful and flexible tool for the evaluation,
   design and communication of diverse kinds of participatory initiatives.},

Abstract = {With the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the European Council has
   become an official institution of the European Union (EU). According to
   the Treaty, it should provide the Union with impetus' and general
   political directions and priorities'. The explicit exclusion of any
   legislative functions seems to demarcate its role clearly from that of
   the European Commission, which retains the formal monopoly over
   legislative initiative. However, Treaty provisions have not prevented
   the European Council and its President from informally setting the
   agenda in a detailed way, often creating tension with the Commission. By
   looking into three high profile cases - the energy climate package,
   economic governance reform and Schengen reform - through the prism of
   two theoretical approaches - the principal agent model and joint agenda
   setting' approach - this article explores patterns of interactions
   between the two institutions in legislative agenda setting and shows
   that the relationship can be best defined in terms of competitive
   cooperation'.},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Mainstream analyses have often understood environmental effectiveness as
   a consequence of the shape of interests and policymaking, and have
   tested their models through statistical techniques. Results have,
   however, proved quite erratic. It is argued that these weaknesses
   reflect a misconception about causality, thus highlighting the need for
   a shift in both model and method. A different model is therefore
   developed that explains effectiveness through policy tools and ideas.
   The model is then applied to the performances of the EU15 member states
   in mid-2000s, and assessed using Qualitative Comparative Analysis. Cases
   are polarised around two classic cleavages (environmentalists' vs.
   productivists', and pro-marketers' vs. protectionists'), but give
   evidence that all the related tool mixes are able to deliver - while the
   relevant difference between leaders and laggards lies in the use of
   evaluation devices.},

Abstract = {This article reports on a recent research project exploring academic
   perspectives on the threat posed by cyberterrorism. The project employed
   a survey method, which returned 118 responses from researchers working
   across 24 different countries. The article begins with a brief review of
   existing literature on this topic, distinguishing between those
   concerned by an imminent threat of cyberterrorism, and other, more
   skeptical, views. Following a discussion on method, the article's
   analysis section then details findings from three research questions:
   (1) Does cyberterrorism constitute a significant threat? If so, against
   whom or what?; (2) Has a cyberterrorism attack ever taken place?; and
   (3) What are the most effective countermeasures against cyberterrorism?
   Are there significant differences to more traditional forms of anti- or
   counterterrorism? The article concludes by reflecting on areas of
   continuity and discontinuity between academic debate on cyberterrorism
   and on terrorism more broadly.},

Abstract = {The Cyprus 2013 presidential elections marked right-wing Democratic
   Rally's return to power after ten years in isolation. The huge economic
   crisis sidelined discussions on the Cyprus problem - arguably for the
   first time in Cyprus' electoral history. The elections verified the
   prevailing trends already apparent in the rest of Southern Europe:
   incumbent punishment in the midst of an unprecedented economic (and
   political) crisis and the parting of politics from society as evident
   from the high abstention rates and declining partisan loyalties. The
   article aims to provide insight into the country-specific
   characteristics of this contest which explain these outcomes. It
   suggests that the electoral result might be explained by Cypriots'
   disappointment regarding the stalemate of the Cyprus problem, their
   unrealistic expectations of a change in government and their
   disappointment in European Union and national political institutions in
   dealing with the economic crisis.},

   field, we propose a new structurationist analytical model to deal with
   that complexity. Our model highlights the practices by which actors
   acquire information of their policy environments, which are
   conceptualised as structures enabling and constraining their actions.
   These practices involve intentions, interests and schemata. In our case
   analyses - the Nord Stream pipeline project and the Sakhalin Island's
   energy politics - we find that profit interests, as part of a wider
   business frame, most centrally guide Russian actors. The often-hyped
   energy superpower frame is found to be ambiguous. It generally does not
   bring the intentions of Russian actors together well, even if such a
   frame resonates with some of Russia's European customers. Energy
   security frames are found to be prevalent among Russia's customers and
   are highly differentiated. Environmental frames are mostly
   instrumentally deployed. Russian energy actors are capable of displaying
   collective intentionality, but are incapable of fully controlling the
   various dimensions of the complex policy environment.},

Abstract = {The human rights approach and the capability approach (CA) are
   significant development strategies. CA proponents devote extensive
   attention to the relationship between human rights and capabilities yet
   give them no significant role in CA theory. While the CA maintains
   rights and capabilities are distinct, it maintains they can reinforce
   each other in advancing human development and human rights. This article
   argues the attention given to human rights by the CA is because the two
   are rival strategies in development space. This rivalry arises out of
   the extensive commonalties of entitlements, norms, vision, and rhetoric
   shared by human rights and capabilities. Their competition as
   development strategies intensified in the first decade of the
   twenty-first century with their increased institutionalization,
   exemplified by the United Nations Development Programme's incorporating
   both approaches in its programs. The assertion they can reinforce each
   other, lacking empirical foundation, can only be seen as a hypothesis. A
   counterhypothesis is proposed that there is little prospect they can
   reinforce each other as they face an unbridgeable political divide
   derived from the experiential foundation of human rights in the realm of
   political power and the philosophical foundation of the CA in the realm
   of public policy. Human rights are practice seeking to be put into
   theory; the CA is theory seeking to be put into practice. The article
   concludes that both hypotheses need to be investigated through empirical
   social science research.},

Title = {The Impact of the Euro Crisis on Citizens' Support for the European
   Union},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},

Volume = {36},

Pages = {231-245},
Abstract = {Our paper investigates the impact of the global and the Euro crisis on
   citizens' attitudes towards the European Union (EU). We measure the
   impact of the Euro crisis on two different levels: First, the crisis
   itself at the contextual level and second, and more importantly, at the
   individual level, referring to citizens' perceptions of the crisis. Our
   main assumption is that during the crisis, economic explanations find
   their way back into the study of EU support. We test our hypotheses with
   27 EU member states using different Eurobarometer surveys and apply
   descriptive statistics as well as multi-level regression analyses. Three
   conclusions emerge from the analysis: First, the impact of the Euro
   crisis is stronger than in the case of the global financial crisis.
   Second, support for the EU depends on both the contextual and the
   individual level although effects of the latter are more prevalent.
   Third, the effect of the individual perception of the crisis on EU
   support is stronger in Euro countries as well as in economically
   powerful countries. Altogether and contrary to major assumptions
   following post-functional arguments, our findings show that in times of
   the crisis economic factors again play a major role in the explanation
   of support for the EU. This leads to a rather critical evaluation for
   the future of the European integration process.},

Abstract = {Twenty years on from the 1994 cease-fires, Northern Ireland is a
   markedly safer place for children and young people to grow up. However,
   for a significant number, growing up in post-conflict Northern Ireland
   has brought with it continued risks and high levels of marginalization.
   Many young people growing up on the sharp edge of the transition have
   continued to experience troubling levels of poverty, lower educational
   attainment, poor standards of childhood health, and sustained exposure
   to risk-laden environments. Reflecting on interdisciplinary research
   carried out since the start of the ``transition{''} to peace, this
   article emphasizes the impact that embedded structural inequalities
   continue to have on the social, physical, mental, and emotional
   well-being of many children and young people. In shining a light on the
   enduring legacy of the conflict, this article moves to argue that
   greater attention needs to be given to the ongoing socioeconomic factors
   that result in limited lifetime opportunities, marginalization, and
   sustained poverty for many young people growing up in ``peacetime{''}

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {305-315},
Abstract = {Research on dating violence has tended to focus on North American
   college students. This study innovates with data collected in
   Switzerland from a sample of 132 school pupils and vocational education
   students aged 14 to 22 using a self-administered questionnaire. The
   study investigates relationships between attitudes and experiences about
   dating violence and the effect of gender. Biases against women were
   common in the sample. Females reported less endorsement of patriarchal
   attitudes about women's roles, but both genders reported similar levels
   of disparagement of women. Participants reported high rates of physical
   violence perpetration (41.9 percent) and victimization (48.8 percent).
   Pro-violence attitudes were related to psychological and physical
   perpetration as well as physical victimization. For female respondents,
   essentialist beliefs about women's innate abilities appear more
   persistent than beliefs about appropriate roles. Male participants
   endorsed both types of gender stereotypes at high rates.
   Male-perpetrated violence was perceived less favorably than
   female-perpetrated violence. Our data suggest that general attitudes
   toward violence are the most consistent predictor of physical and
   psychological aggression within dating relationships. More attention
   needs to be paid to subtypes among attitudes on women and violence,
   which past research assumed were monolithic. This study shows the need
   for prevention programs to address pro-violence attitudes.},

Abstract = {This section summarizes and interprets the findings and identifies open
   research questions. Success and failure are primarily determined via
   complex interactions between structure and agency in both the domestic
   and international spheres. A unified and competitive opposition
   comprising a coalition of parliamentary and non-parliamentary actors led
   by a popular figure and the ability to conduct nationwide campaigning
   are crucial for change. In this situation, the strength and popularity
   of the incumbent leadership and the regime's reaction to popular dissent
   are important for stability. The regime's response includes measures
   towards strengthening popularity, prevention, and coercion. Models of
   diffusion can be employed to explain how the idea of Color Revolutions
   has been adapted by the opposition in many Eurasian countries, and how
   autocratic regimes have prepared for this challenge to stability
   (Counter-Color Revolutions). Research has not yet studied the outcomes
   of successful Color Revolutions in-depth. However, the overall outcomes
   seem not to stand for profound change, but rather for the continuation
   of cycles of patronal presidentialism.},

Abstract = {Protected values of cultural heritage represent a dynamic category, an
   item, which is not intended only for preservation, but also for
   improvement. Based on this fact, it is necessary to set up a starting
   point that immovable cultural heritage has been under the degradation
   process or the process of reducing its value from the day of its origin,
   which can be ``slowed-down{''} by appropriate maintenance. Architectural
   heritage is found in a paradoxical situation where a regulatory system
   of mandatory preservation measures and obligations is being established
   on the one hand, while a poor concern for such heritage is recorded on
   the other hand. The funds invested in renovation of immovable heritage
   do not reach assessed values attributed to individual property. The
   authors address in their work the issue concerning the effectiveness of
   the immovable cultural heritage protection from the aspect of national
   funding systems, as well as from the aspect of interstate funding
   sources and financing programmes.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Abstract = {The German federal system is conventionally understood as highly
   co-ordinated between federal and regional governments and aimed at
   producing a `uniformity' of living conditions. This view has
   increasingly been challenged as new work focuses on innovation and
   diversity at the regional level, and also as a consequence of reforms to
   the federal system that took place in 2006. This contribution attempts
   to establish a more systematic basis for assessing and explaining the
   scope and significance of regional policy variation in Germany. Our
   findings suggest that - despite institutional structures that foster
   intense co-ordination between central and regional governments and
   apparent popular preferences for uniformity of policy outcomes - the
   extent of policy variation in Germany is much greater than
   conventionally understood and driven both by structural factors and
   partisan choices at the regional level.},

Title = {Understanding state responses to secession},
Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {28-44},
Abstract = {The response of states to acts of secession on their territory has been
   subject to relatively little attention in the academic literature.
   Drawing on the examples of Cyprus and the Turkish Republic of Northern
   Cyprus (TRNC), Serbia and Kosovo, and Georgia and South Ossetia and
   Abkhazia, this article posits that there are in fact six reasons why
   states oppose acts of secession. These are: emotional attachment to the
   territory; internally displaced persons; economic factors; historical
   and cultural issues; fear of further secession; and national pride.
   Following on from this, the piece emphasises that subsequent efforts to
   prevent the secessionist territory from being recognised must be seen in
   the context of processes to resolve the situation arising from the act
   of secession. In some cases, this may be reunification. In others, it
   may be an agreed separation. At other times, it may be about leaving the
   door open for a military solution. In other words, opposing secession is
   a response to a tangible grievance. Opposing recognition is about
   shaping the conditions to redress that grievance. A better understanding
   of the specific dynamics of, and interrelationship between, these two
   factors would seem to be crucial for peacemakers.},

Pages = {13-27},
Abstract = {The post-independence history of India contradicts the
   segmental-institutions thesis. Non-ethnic federalism was met with
   popular resistance and segmental institutions emerged because of
   nationalist mobilization. These institutions stabilized India, which has
   remained intact. Central violations of segment-state arrangements have
   been the impetus for violent nation-state crises. The Gorkhaland
   movement in the Darjeeling area of West Bengal in India is used to
   explain the disconnection between India's experience and the
   segmental-institutions thesis. As the thesis predicts, progressively
   more-generous autonomy arrangements have helped regional elites to
   repress political competition in Darjeeling. However, limited political
   competition in Darjeeling curbs demands on the centre because regional
   elites' primary incentive to mobilize ethnic grievances is to outflank
   local political rivals.},

Abstract = {The rise of large developing countries has led to considerable
   discussions of re-balancing global relations and giving greater priority
   to understanding South-South relations. This paper, in exploring the
   central ideas of Chinese and Brazilian foreign policy and the behavior
   of these two rising Southern countries toward Sub-Saharan Africa, argues
   that the English School of International Relations is well suited to
   understanding the intentions and actions that characterize South-South
   relations.},

Abstract = {This paper identifies and analyzes the different types of revisionist
   politics, and its levels, developed by progressive governments in South
   America toward the United States over the past 13 years. For such, it
   uses as starting points concepts that are fundamental for better
   understanding the behavior of South American countries in relation with
   the great power: ``peripheral revisionism,{''} by Cesar Guimaraes, and
   ``autonomous confrontation{''} and ``antagonistic confrontation,{''}
   both by Helio Jaguaribe. From the developments of these concepts, a
   theoretical model was developed with different types of peripheral
   revisionisms, which allowed for fine-tuning the classifications of
   foreign policies in the period.},

Abstract = {Australian neoliberalism and neoconservatism are two distinct
   rationalities, but both are dependent for their existence on US power.
   The fusion of the corporate and security state in Australia is largely
   based on the expansion of the military-industrial-surveillance complex.
   Both corporate and security state are committed to the privatization of

Journal = {SOUTH EUROPEAN SOCIETY AND POLITICS},

Volume = {19},

Pages = {295-307},
Abstract = {South European countries have been hit hardest and longest by the
   post-2008 economic crisis. This has brought their welfare states under
   acute strain. Unmet need has sharply increased while significant welfare
   reforms and (more or less) deep cuts and changes in social spending have
   been prominent in the repertoire of the crisis management solutions
   implemented by the governments (under European Union constraints and the
   strict rescue-deal requirements for Greece and Portugal). This
   introduction briefly reviews reform trends prior to and during the
   crisis in order to highlight convergent and divergent paths among the
   four countries and outline the major questions addressed by the
   contributions to this volume.},

Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {300-322},
Abstract = {Deliberation is increasingly embraced as a mode of policy-making, and
   this paper focuses on how facilitators of deliberative policy processes
   become critical, pragmatic practitioners of their complex craft. We
   analyze how deliberation facilitators learn to do their work through
   ethnographic study of an approach to facilitation known as the Art of
   Hosting and Harvesting Conversations that Matter. We identify three ways
   in which people learning to facilitate transform knowledge so that they
   become skilled facilitators. They do so by metabolizing hosting
   techniques to understand and incorporate or eschew them their
   repertoire; by situating hosting knowledge to apply or adapt it in
   particular contexts; and by coproducing knowledge of hosting with a
   community of practitioners. We demonstrate how these learning processes
   support public policy deliberations through illustrations and discuss
   the potential contributions of the Art of Hosting for enhancing societal
   capacities for deliberative policy-making.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},

Volume = {37},

Pages = {862-880},
Abstract = {Wars like those in Iraq and Afghanistan should be understood as hybrid
   wars, wars in which elements of ethnic or tribal conflict, ideologically
   based insurgency, factional squabbling, and organized crime are
   inextricably intertwined, with the same actors playing multiple and
   partially conflicting roles. Hybrid war is inherently transnational,
   featuring transnational crime networks, migrant warriors, transnational
   diaspora links, legitimate international trade, and foreign
   intervention. It takes place in hybridized states reliant on local
   warlords and other actors whose power prevents effective state-building.
   In this context, while counterinsurgency doctrine prescribes appropriate
   military strategy and tactics, the core problem is more political than
   military. Since a hybridized client state is not likely to be
   politically reformable even if a foreign ally achieves military success,
   outside allies like the United States should generally refrain from
   boots-on-the-ground intervention, pursuing instead a diplomatic
   solution, even though such a deal is likely to be unpalatable.},

Abstract = {Hierarchy is becoming a central topic in recent International Relations
   scholarship, and the historical East Asian hierarchy offers an important
   case study. This article provides a first-cut analysis of the degree
   variation in regional hierarchy. It distinguishes three levels of
   Chinese hierarchy in China's relationships with Korea, Japan and the
   Mongols in `early modern' East Asia (1368-1800). Regional relations
   during this period were on the whole more hierarchic than anarchic, but
   anarchy was also impressive in each of the relationships during certain
   periods. Theoretically, the analysis suggests questioning the
   diametrical assumption of hierarchy/anarchy as the organizing principle
   of international politics. For policy, it notes why a new Chinese
   hierarchy is unlikely to appear in the foreseeable future.},

Title = {Radical Conservative Socialism: Buddhadasa Bhikkhu's Vision of a Perfect
   World Society and its Implication for Thailand's Political Culture},
Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {244-263},
Abstract = {Buddhadasa Bhikkhu (1906-1993) has been regarded as a `modernist' and
   `reformist' both in terms of his rational reinterpretation of the
   teachings of the Buddha for individual life and the consequences of his
   approach towards Buddhism for a renewal of Thai society. This article
   analyses Buddhadasa's political philosophy - highlighted by his concept
   of `Dhammic Socialism' - vis-a-vis the socialist ideas of Pridi
   Banomyong (1900-1983), the ideological father of the Thai revolution of
   1932, and in relation to the confrontational character of Thai politics
   from the downfall of the absolute monarchy until today. It argues that
   both Buddhadasa's concept as well as its secular political counterparts
   in the Thai public sphere could and still can be characterised as
   variations of conservative Theravada Buddhist thought. The `Teaching of
   the Elders' leaves little room for deviation from the absolute and
   comprehensive truth laid down in the sacred Buddhist scriptures.
   Moreover, while competing political groups in Thailand make full use of
   the reservoir of such Buddhist `radical conservatism' by dressing it in
   a secular garb, they too permit little if any compromise.},

Abstract = {Since the turn of the millennium in particular, protest movements have
   often been characterized by Black Bloc tactics of confrontation and
   street fighting between anarchist militants and police forces. This
   article analyses the Black Bloc's philosophy, dynamics, organization,
   praxis, and goals. After discussing the relationship between the Black
   Bloc and violence, the article analyses dynamics within militant
   anarchism that open the way for the formation of autonomous terrorist
   cells, as well as the potential for lone wolf terrorism in the movement.},

Abstract = {Why do multiparty cabinets in parliamentary democracies produce more
   extreme foreign policies than single-party cabinets? Our paper argues
   that particular institutional and psychological dynamics explain this
   difference. We test this argument using a global events data set
   incorporating foreign policy behaviors of numerous multiparty and
   single-party governments. We find that more parties and weak parliaments
   promote extremity in coalitions, but parliamentary strength has the
   opposite effect for single-party governments. This study challenges
   existing expectations about the impact of democratic institutions on
   foreign policy.},

Abstract = {This article examines desertion in civil wars, focusing on the role of
   combatants' hometowns in facilitating desertion. Analyzing data from the
   Spanish Civil War, the article demonstrates that combatants who come
   from hill country are considerably more likely to desert than combatants
   whose hometowns are on flat ground. This is because evasion is easier in
   rough terrain. The finding implies that the cohesion of armed groups
   depends on control, not just positive incentives, and that control of
   territory in civil wars goes beyond rebel-government contestation, and
   consists also of control behind the lines. The article bridges micro and
   macro approaches to civil wars by indicating the multiple uses to which
   individuals can put structural conditions like rough terrain. This helps
   to clarify the macro-level link between rough terrain and civil war. It
   also shows that micro-level research can profitably examine structural
   variables alongside individual characteristics and endogenous conflict
   dynamics.},

Abstract = {Drawing upon ethnographic fieldwork in an English training program
   tailored for rural young Tibetans in West China, this study looks into
   the complexities, dilemma, and possibilities of particularly the
   cultural aspects of citizenship in a context where minority people are
   encountering urban, majority, and global forces as a result of their
   geographic and cultural mobility. In doing so, the theme of flexible
   citizenship (Ong 1999) emerges, which deconstructs the conventional
   conception of citizenship. This deconstruction is achieved through
   unveiling the complexity and complication of citizenship that is in
   particular evidence in the everyday practices of these Tibetan subjects.
   The findings capture a re-consideration of citizenship that is open to
   multiplicity and grows out of practices.},

   shocks and sociopolitical conflict in urban Africa},

Abstract = {While both academics and politicians have long acknowledged the
   connection between food price shocks and so-called food riots', this
   article asks whether rising domestic consumer food prices are a
   contributing cause of sociopolitical unrest, more broadly defined, in
   urban areas of Africa. In order to unravel the complex and circular
   relationship between rising food prices and unrest, an instrumental
   approach with country fixed effects is used to isolate causality at the
   country-month unit of analysis for the period 1990 through 2012. Two
   instrumental variables, changes in international grain commodity prices
   and local rainfall scarcity, are evaluated and used individually and
   jointly as instruments for changes in domestic food prices. The main
   finding is that a sudden increase in domestic food prices in a given
   month significantly increases the probability of urban unrest,
   especially spontaneous events and riots, in that month. Undeniably, more
   fundamental economic and political grievances are also drivers of such
   events and are likely to determine how the unrest ultimately manifests,
   even when triggered by rising food prices. Although more research is
   necessary to determine why people choose particular protest methods and
   targets, the findings of this research provide evidence that
   sociopolitical unrest of different types is driven, or at least
   triggered, by a consumer response to economic pressure from increasing
   food prices regardless of the cause of the increase.},

Abstract = {The sugarcane agro-industry and large-scale mining have generated a
   profound change in traditional economic practices in the upper Cauca of
   Colombia to the detriment of the small-scale farmers and miners of the
   local Afro-descendant population. This has been accompanied by a
   consolidation of the centralized state since the neoliberal opening and
   a weakening of the old regional state supported by the paternalistic
   structure of the agricultural elites. Participative research with two
   community organizations with regard to the dispute over access to land
   and environmental assets reveals that the communities and their social
   organizations have responded to their racialized impoverishment by
   mobilization and the creation of alliances not only as a means of
   resistance but also as a strategy for the construction of their own
   alternative life plans. La agroindustria de cana de azucar y la mineria
   a gran escala han generado un cambio profundo en las practicas
   economicas tradicionales en el Cauca Alto de Colombia, en de-trimento
   los agricultores y los mineros de pequena escala de la poblacion
   afrodescendiente locales. Esto ha sido acompanado por una consolidacion
   del Estado centralizado desde la apertura neoliberal y un debilitamiento
   del viejo Estado regional apoyado por la estructura paternalista de las
   elites agricolas. La investigacion participativa con dos organizaciones
   de la comunidad con respecto a la disputa sobre el acceso a la tierra y
   los bienes medioambientales revela que las comunidades y sus
   organizaciones sociales han respondido a su empobrecimiento racializado
   por la movilizacion y la creacion de alianzas, no solo como medio de
   resistencia, pero tambien como una estrategia para la construccion de
   sus propios proyectos de vida alternativos.},

Abstract = {The nature of chieftaincy has been identified as one of the causes of
   Sierra Leone's civil conflict, but the institution has largely retained
   its pre-war privileges and conflict triggers. Using evidence from
   ethnographic research, this piece investigates the tensions between
   chiefs and NGOs in alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. Chiefs
   perceive NGOs as undercutting their powers and livelihood, resulting in
   strains. Given the entrenched nature of chieftaincy, current attempts by
   NGOs to ensure better judicial outcomes for the poor will produce
   limited success, if the prevailing atmosphere of mistrust persists. A
   trustful and congenial relationship between chiefs and NGOs is proposed.},

Abstract = {The 2010 UN climate conference in Cancun emphasized that `Parties
   should, in all climate change related actions, fully respect human
   rights'. However, so far there is no further guidance. This article
   discusses the relevant legal human rights norms and two case studies
   from the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The first
   case (Bajo Aguan, Honduras) shows that the current absence of any
   international safeguards can lead to registration of highly problematic
   projects. The second case (Olkaria, Kenya) suggests that safeguards,
   introduced here as a side effect of World Bank involvement, can have a
   positive impact, but that it is necessary to have them based on human
   rights. It therefore seems recommendable that the UN climate regime
   develop mandatory human rights safeguards. In addition or alternatively,
   individual buyer countries or groups of countries, such as the European
   Union, could introduce their own additional requirements for CDM
   projects.},

Abstract = {The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) encompasses more than 40
   low-lying and island developing states that are among the most
   vulnerable but also most vocal parties in international climate
   negotiations. Over the years AOSIS's strategies comprised of the
   building of scientific expertise, and leadership by example, but also a
   particular framing that puts emphasis on multilateral processes to deal
   with issues of common concern and established principles of the
   international community. The initial assumption of the paper is that a
   frame alignment of climate change and human rights concerns would
   strengthen the coalition's moral and legal arguments. However, as a
   frame analysis of close to 50 coalition submissions and statements
   reveals, such a linkage is not established. The paper concludes by
   outlining three possible explanatory factors for this observation: the
   nature of the issue area, the character of the coalition and the
   professional background of AOSIS negotiators.},

Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2014},

Abstract = {This paper offers a discussion of positive theories of the public
   enterprise (PE), in the global perspective, i.e. without reference to
   specific country or region, and presents some fresh evidence potentially
   supporting or rejecting alternative theories. It also concludes with
   some policy implications.
   Our research question is: Why do governments still own enterprises, and
   in certain cases even create new ones?
   The dominant answer is that governments keep the control of PE mainly
   for the self-interest of pbliticians, or at least for some inertia. This
   explanation is labelled the ``public choice{''} perspective about the
   positive theory of PE. However, a different explanation is possible: PE
   exist because they play a public mission role that is not performed by
   market mechanism. This is labelled the ``public mission{''} perspective.
   The two explanations are not mutually exclusive, and not entirely
   supported by evidence, but is seems that the importance of the public
   choice interpretation in the real world has been exaggerated, while the
   public mission one has been unduly neglected.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {From Hugo Chavez in Venezuela to Geert Wilders in the Netherlands and
   Sarah Palin in the US, populist leaders claim to offer more power to the
   people'. However, most scholars argue that populism is in fact a
   democratic pathology, because it seeks to build a political system
   devoid of the rule of law. While it is true that populism maintains an
   ambivalent relationship with liberal democracy, little attention has
   been paid to the legitimacy of the questions raised by populist forces.
   Drawing on the work of Robert Dahl, I argue that current manifestations
   of populism are offering specific responses to two dilemmas that do not
   have a clear democratic solution: the boundary problem (how to define
   the people?) and the limits of self-government (how to control the
   controllers?). My article shows that populist forces are posing
   legitimate questions about the current state of democracy in Europe and
   the Americas, although their solutions tend to be more controversial
   than helpful.},

Journal = {WORLD POLITICS},

Volume = {66},
Number = {4},
Pages = {561+},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Why would a national political party that has been competitive for
   decades collapse overnight? In recent years, parties across Latin
   America went from being major contenders for executive office to
   electoral irrelevance over the course of a single electoral cycle. The
   author develops an explanation that highlights the impact of elite
   actions on voter behavior. During the 1980s and 1990s leaders across the
   region implemented policies that were inconsistent with their
   traditional party brand, provoked internal party conflicts, and formed
   strange-bedfellow alliances with traditional rivals. These actions
   diluted the brands of their parties, eroding voters' partisan
   attachments. Without the assured support of partisans, parties become
   more susceptible to retrospective voting. Voters who now had no party
   attachments deserted incumbent parties when they performed poorly. The
   author tests this interactive hypothesis using matched comparisons of
   six party-election cases from Argentina and Venezuela.},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen some fundamental changes in the way the global
   energy sector and its governance function. All of these changes have a
   significant impact on the energy policy choices that are available for
   EU policy makers and should be incorporated in a proactive European
   strategy for the future. Instead, however, we witness a general
   stalemate in the energy policy debate within the EU, and internal
   problems seem to impede any meaningful and coherent external policy. In
   this article, building on a wide literature review, we sketch the
   changing global energy landscape, explaining the current state of
   `unprecedented uncertainty' around a set of major issues. Then we
   describe what we see as the five `cardinal sins' of European energy
   policy and governance, which preclude effective common responses and
   external action. We conclude by outlining possible ways of overcoming
   the challenges that face European energy policy and governance.},

Abstract = {This study challenges existing literature which maintains that
   technology latecomers usually depend on imported technologies to develop
   emerging high-tech sectors. This paper argues that the domestic
   institutional environment in facilitating networking might be more
   important for developing academia-industry (A-I) networks. The
   co-evolution of institutions and the knowledge transfer process in the
   Taiwanese Biopharmaceutical Innovation System (TBPIS) is a case in
   point. Far from relying purely on foreign technologies, several
   important institutional and policy changes, which transform the
   institutional environment from prohibiting A-I intertwining into
   encouraging A-I collaborations, have enabled domestic research
   institutes to influence the acquisition, creation, and diffusion of
   knowledge in the innovation network. Nonetheless, the country continues
   to struggle in commercializing domestic scientific research to step into
   a knowledge-based economy. Therefore, this paper suggests that more
   productive strategies would be helpful to advance domestic academic
   research, sustain A-I networks, and strengthen the innovation system.},

Title = {The dynamics of European regulatory regimes in higher education -
   Challenged prerogatives and evolutionary change},
Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {European higher education has witnessed a substantial growth in
   regulatory arrangements in external quality assurance (EQA) during the
   last couple of decades. This current article describes the central
   characteristics and trajectories of this expansion, and discusses
   drivers of this development drawing on an institutional perspective.
   Empirically, three distinct, although overlapping, stages in the
   building up of a regulatory regime are identified - from formalization
   and agencification of EQA at national level, establishment of common
   standards at a European level, to the current stage of an emerging
   global market-based system. This combination of institutional layering,
   path-dependency, and conversion can be explained by the nature of
   political context and the ambiguities of regulation of quality in higher
   education. In the conclusion it is argued that the development of
   external quality assurance as a regulatory field is an example of how
   the dynamics of an evolving regulatory regime may in an unexpected way
   limit the public control of highly institutionalized fields. (C) 2014

Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Pages = {566-578},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {When does domestic unrest lead to interstate conflict? I present the
   diversionary target theory that argues that domestically troubled states
   are more likely to use military force against some, but not all, states
   because political leaders prefer targets that can evoke their domestic
   audience's fear or greed in order to enjoy rally-round-the-flag effects.
   I suggest that the fear-producing targets are foreign states that
   exhibit rapidly rising power or manifest different identities. The
   greed-producing targets are foreign states occupying disputed territory
   or exercising regional/local hegemony despite declining power. In
   addition, I expect that political leaders prefer fear- or
   greed-producing targets that possess similar powers, because domestic
   audiences may see initiation of military conflicts against too-powerful
   states or too-weak states as excessively risky and unnecessary,
   respectively. From statistical analyses on directed dyad-years from 1920
   to 2001, I find that the presence of a rising power, a territory target,
   or a hegemony target contributes to the correlation between domestic
   unrest and the initiation of interstate conflict in a statistically
   significant way.},

Abstract = {Collaborations between and within sectors are common and crucial to the
   creation and transfer of knowledge. It is often unclear who is involved
   in the collaboration, and with whom and why they are collaborating. I
   studied reasons for collaboration and how capital and institutions
   affect collaboration through a mixed methods analysis of infection and
   immunity research and development collaborations in Vancouver, Canada
   between individuals affiliated with universities, firms, and health-care
   organizations. I found that both capital and institutions were important
   in collaboration decisions. Collaboration worked as a balancing act
   between capital and institutions. Potential collaborators needed to
   offer different capital to the collaboration while supporting the
   dominant institutions of potential collaborators. Participants'
   organizational and sectoral affiliations influenced available capital
   and dominant institutions. These findings help policy makers understand
   collaboration dynamics between sectors and how translation can occur
   between universities, firms, and health-care organizations.},

Title = {Temperature seasonality and violent conflict: The inconsistencies of a
   warming planet},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {51},

Abstract = {Current climate change research suggests that certain seasonal weather
   patterns will be extended and others attenuated as global temperature
   increases. This is important because seasonal temperature change affects
   both the scarcity of resources during certain times of the year and the
   overall mobility of people living in countries that have seasonality.
   Consequently, these seasonal changes have implications for the onset of
   violent conflict, particularly as it relates to distinguishing when,
   where, and how it is most likely to occur. This article evaluates the
   relationship between monthly temperature changes, civil war onset, and
   various, less-organized conflict events, offering theoretical
   expectations for how seasonal changes and climate aberrations are
   related to an increased risk of violence. The results show that
   prolonged periods of stable, warm weather are consistently associated
   with an increased risk of civil war onset and non-state conflict. These
   findings are best explained through the strategic viability mechanism of
   temperature change, which allows actors to resolve their collective
   action problems that are often associated with poor weather conditions,
   while simultaneously increasing their strategic and behavioral
   incentives for engaging in violent conflict. Warm weather generates more
   resources for rebel looting and permits predictability for coordinating
   troop movements and strategy development. These findings are
   particularly salient in areas of the world affected by strong
   seasonality, where prolonged extensions of warm weather conditions would
   be regarded as both peculiar and attractive for participating in violent
   action. Although these findings are notable, even under the most extreme
   climate change scenarios, the substantive effects for these
   relationships are comparatively minor relative to other well-known
   intrastate conflict covariates.},

Abstract = {The role of regulation and the regulatory state in social policy,
   redistribution, and the reforms of the welfare state are increasingly
   important but often underestimated and misunderstood. These problems are
   evident in Majone's highly influential work where the regulatory state
   and the `positive' state stand as two alternative monomorphic forms of
   state. This article offers a polymorphic alternative where the
   regulatory state may come to the rescue of the welfare state, allowing
   independent extension, retrenchment, and stagnation of welfare via
   social regulation. The article extends a regulatory governance
   perspective into the core of the welfare state, clarifies the relations
   between fiscal and regulatory instruments, and demonstrates that the
   boundaries of the regulatory state are wider than are usually
   understood. It turns our understanding of the welfare state on its head,
   highlighting first the less visible regulatory layer, and then the more
   visible layer of fiscal transfers.},

Abstract = {Inside an international institution such as the World Trade Organization
   (wto) where strong asymmetrical relations prevail, the weakest countries
   are generally disadvantaged. However, they can reverse the trend by
   developing coalitions as suggested by the theoretical literature. This
   is the route chosen by many developing countries in the wto. Over time,
   their coalitions have become much more effective in countering the
   claims of the most powerful countries which want to strengthen patent
   law. Coalition of developing countries that mobilized around issues of
   intellectual property and biopiracy countries has shown some success,
   which can be explained by the choice of a form combining strength and
   flexibility.},

Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between the state and society in
   contemporary China by analyzing the lobbying behavior of business
   associations. Particularly, it asks whether and how autonomy and/or
   privileged access exert/s influence on their lobbying frequency. A
   formal model is developed that focuses on the trade-off between lobbying
   intensity and the private provision of collective goods. The hypotheses
   are tested against the original survey data from Zhejiang and Jiangsu
   Provinces. The research finds that self-established associations lobby
   less, and those with consultant status assigned by the government lobby
   the government more often. In contrast, the impact of ``autonomy{''} in
   a narrow sense is weaker than is commonly claimed in the Chinese
   lobbying literature.},

Title = {WHY DO STATES COMMIT TO INTERNATIONAL LABOR STANDARDS? Interdependent
   Ratification of Core ILO Conventions, 1948-2009},
Journal = {WORLD POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Ratifying core conventions adopted by the International Labor
   Organization (ILO) creates legal obligations to improve labor standards
   in the domestic economy, notably with regard to union rights, minimum
   age and discrimination in employment, and forced labor. Why and when do
   states choose to ratify them? Two influential theoretical approaches
   lead to the expectation that states are influenced by the ratification
   behavior of other states. Drawing on rationalist institutionalism, the
   authors expect states to use institutions such as the ILO to improve or
   consolidate their preferred standards domestically while reducing the
   risk of suffering competitive disadvantages in world markets. In this
   view, ILO conventions are devices for the prevention and mitigation of
   regulatory races to the bottom among trade rivals. Drawing on
   sociological institutionalism, they expect states to ratify ILO
   conventions if doing so conforms to a norm of appropriate behavior that
   is prevalent in a state's peer groups. This article develops observable
   implications of these hypotheses and tests them by applying spatial
   regression models to seven core ILO conventions and 187 countries
   between 1948 and 2009. The analysis yields strong evidence in support of
   both hypotheses.},

Abstract = {This article develops a new conceptual framework of `moral power' by
   arguing that the `civilian'/'normative' power Europe paradigms are
   insufficient for understanding the essence of the conflict resolution
   policy of the European Union (EU) in the South Caucasus. Analysing the
   conflicts of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Nagorno-Karabakh, the study
   reveals that until the August 2008 war, the EU was an incoherent actor
   in terms of the interplay among its institutions and member-states. The
   EU's policy has been devoid of a long-term peace-focused strategy,
   making it inconsequential; as a result, the EU has merely dealt with,
   rather than managed, the conflicts. Its rhetoric has been inconsistent
   with practice. Often the EU has subordinated its values to material and
   power-related interests. Moreover, the EU has hardly been normatively
   stable in its approach to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Bypassing
   inclusiveness until the launch of the Geneva talks pertaining to the
   Abkhazian and South Ossetian conflicts, the EU has not enjoyed much
   legitimacy by the de facto states. Whereas the EU has largely failed to
   resolve the South Caucasian conflicts, it has achieved partial success
   by putting a halt to the 2008 hostilities between Russia and Georgia.

Abstract = {Contrary to what is often assumed, norm-internalisation does not always
   lead to compliance. Normative judgements may be simultaneously
   internalised and outwardly rejected. Non-compliance is at times a result
   of hyper-awareness of the particular origin of norms, rather than an
   unwillingness of the would-be-recipients to do `good' deeds, or their
   inability to understand what is `good'. Such is often the case for
   non-Western states, as I demonstrate in this article by utilising the
   sociological concepts of stigma and stigmatisation. In its inability to
   acknowledge this dynamic, which has its roots in the colonial past of
   the international order, the constructivist model of norm-diffusion
   commits two errors. On the one hand, it falls short as a causal
   explanation, conflating internalisation with socialisation, and
   socialisation with compliance. On the other hand, it reproduces existing
   hierarchies in the international system, treating only non-compliance as
   endogenously driven, but compliance as a result of external stimuli. As
   there is a great deal of correlation between noncompliance and political
   geography, such a depiction, coupled with the fact that most norms under
   scrutiny are `good' norms, once again casts non-Western states as having
   agency only when they commit `bad' deeds.},

Title = {Engines and Environments for Innovation in Public Policies},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2014},
Number = {59},
Pages = {5+},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We live in an age of uncertainty and change and, consequently, we are
   asked to be flexible and innovative. Innovation has become a magic
   concept -a key tool for addressing the complex challenges of the new
   millennium. In this context, the paper focuses on the difficult relation
   between innovation and public policies -a complex relationship, because
   public administration has to face, at the same time, the imperatives of
   security and flexibility, of regularity and adaptability. In other
   terms, the public sector is badly equipped for innovation, but,
   simultaneously, innovation is persistently knocking on its door. Public
   administration has been designed for doing the same things in the same
   manner, but, now, we are expecting that public policies would be highly
   innovative and suited for a world in rapid transformation.
   Our work starts from this premises and devotes the initial pages to
   conceptually define the why and what of innovation in public policies.
   Once such bases have been built, the article addresses its central
   question: how can we promote innovation in public policies? This is an
   empirical question that tries to shift the academic debate from theory
   to practice. In order to answer such question, the paper develops two
   hypotheses and presents four cases studies in a summarizing form.
   Hypotheses are used to identify the two principal factors that can
   stimulate innovation in public policies: a) environment (hybrid,
   creative and holistic); and b) the engines (superior, lateral, internal
   and external). The four cases studies refer to innovative public
   policies: the Landscape Catalogue, as public policy which conceives the
   landscape as a key factor for people's quality of life; the
   Neighborhood's Law, a comprehensive policy against urban segregation;
   the Community Centres of Girona, a social cohesion policy based on a
   relational and communitarian approach; and the Super-city blocks in the
   district of Gracia (Barcelona), a mobility policy based on a
   multifaceted approach to the urban public space.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the landscape of policy work conducted by NGOs with
   respect to the social inclusion agenda. Based on a qualitative case
   study of integration policy in a Czech city, the paper focuses on the
   relations between collaborative and critical policy work of NGOs. In
   this case, while the collaborative position is mainly justified by
   apolitical expertise, long-term professional experience and compliance
   with official standards of social work, the latter calls upon
   community-based knowledge and political participation. We argue that
   despite indisputable long-term benefits of collaborative policy work it
   includes risks of paternalism, accountability deficit and exclusiveness.
   These risks become more significant with increasing shared understanding
   and mutual interdependence. In this situation there is a room for the
   episodic external critical capacity to challenge the governance
   structure and enforce the accountability of collaborative networks. (C)

Title = {Compliance with International Humanitarian Law: Democratic Third Parties
   and Civilian Targeting in Interstate War},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {58},
Number = {4},
Pages = {713-740},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article examines compliance with international laws prohibiting the
   intentional targeting of noncombatants in interstate war, specifically
   focusing on the role of third-party states in enforcement. We argue that
   the expectation of third-party coercion, when sufficiently high, can
   induce war participants to comply with this body of law. We identify the
   conditions under which combatant states will anticipate a high
   likelihood of coercion, demonstrating that third-party states are most
   likely to coerce combatants when they have both the willingness and
   opportunity to do so. Democratic third parties that value the rule of
   law and human rights possess the willingness to coerce war participants,
   while strong allies, trade partners, and intergovernmental organization
   (IGO) partners with existing ties to the combatant state have the
   opportunity to engage in coercion by linking combat-ant behavior to the
   provision of benefits or imposition of costs. Based on this logic, we
   hypothesize that war combatants who have ratified the Geneva/Hague
   Conventions prohibiting the intentional targeting of noncombatants
   during war are more likely to comply with the legal obligations included
   in those conventions when they interact with relatively strong
   democratic alliance, trade, and IGO partners. In a series of
   quantitative tests on a data set of all interstate wars from 1900 to
   2003, we find strong statistical and substantive support for the role of
   third parties in inducing compliance with the law.},

Abstract = {In this article, I contend that asylum should at times act as a form of
   reparation for past injustice. This function, I argue, stems from
   states' special obligation to provide asylum to refugees for whose lack
   of state protection they are responsible. After suggesting that the
   development of a theory of asylum as reparation necessitates a
   diachronic approach, I outline the conditions under which asylum should
   function reparatively, and draw on the reparations framework within
   international law to suggest that asylum can provide refugees with
   meaningful restitution, compensation and satisfaction. In particular, I
   seek to identify the conditions under which asylum constitutes the most
   fitting form of reparation for the harm of refugeehood that is available
   to states. Finally, I explore the question of how direct the causal link
   between a state's actions and a refugee's flight must be for the former
   to owe asylum to the latter.},

Abstract = {The UNSC presidency functions under the twin assumptions of neutrality
   and impartiality. However, chairing multilateral negotiations in
   institutionalised bargaining fora always offers substantial
   opportunities to the country in office to pursue its own national
   interests. An important constraint for the presidency is the very short
   duration of the period in office, which does not allow chairs to
   capitalise on the existing informational asymmetries and use them to
   their own advantage. Can this institutional constraint be overcome? We
   address this issue by examining the British one-month presidency in
   January 1992. In a highly turbulent period, with mounting pressures for
   the UNSC to become more representative, the presidency secured the
   transition from the Soviet to the Russian UNSC seat without opening the
   Pandora's box of UNSC reform, in line with British preferences.},

   provides one of the first assessments of how British multi-national and
   English political parties have responded to existing and emergent
   identity tensions in England whilst continuing to defend the concept of
   the post-devolution British union-state.
   extends debates about multi-level party political systems in
   multi-national states which have typically focused on Scotland, Wales
   and, to a lesser extent, Northern Ireland.
   considers the potential that debates about English national identity
   could morph into a party politics of Englishness.
   assesses the potential for nascent English nationalism to encourage
   divergent party political responses to questions of English governance,
   citizenship and nation identity.
   This article assesses how the main British multi-national parties,
   whilst retaining an attachment of one form or another to the concept of
   the Union-state, have responded to existing and emergent identity
   tensions. Through examination of Labour, the Conservatives and the
   Liberal Democrats, with brief discussion of the BNP, UKIP and the
   English Democrats, it will consider the impact of devolution and the
   threat of separatist nationalism on party approaches and policy choices
   concerning English identity construction and governance. It will also
   explore the extent to which devolution has compromised the ability of UK
   politicians to `speak of Britain' (they rarely use the term UK) and the
   four composite nations. By comparing and contrasting the narratives
   articulated by parties at different levels of governance it will ask
   whether a nascent `party politics of Englishness' has emerged which can
   accommodate these challenges.},

Abstract = {Debates over justice for gross human rights violations in active
   conflicts and transitions are often framed as a dilemma that emphasizes
   perceived tensions between human rights and democracy on one side and
   peace and stability on the other. Despite the prominence of the justice
   dilemma in the scholarly literature, little attention has been directed
   to examining its significance for global policy making. Beyond the
   rhetoric, it is unclear whether the dilemma frames the issues for key
   international actors and how it shapes their policies. This article
   addresses this gap by investigating the role of the justice dilemma in
   the foreign policy of the EU. First, it traces the origins of the
   dilemma and highlights important continuities in its framing over time.
   It then demonstrates how in pursuing `democratization' and
   `stabilization' approaches to justice, the EU often reproduces the
   underlying assumptions, perceived tensions and conventional solutions
   that circulate in scholarly and policy discussions. The final section
   examines the implications of the justice dilemma for European policy
   making. The article argues that the EU's preoccupation with the dilemma
   limits its ability to develop effective and innovative policies in this
   important field.},

Title = {The Africana paradigm in Capital: the debts of Karl Marx to

Journal = {REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Number = {140},
Pages = {172-184},

Abstract = {This article will attempt an original interpretation of Capital (Marx,
   K. 1867. Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Vol. 1. Marx/Engels
   Internet Archive, 1995, 1999. http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx) and
   other major works of Karl Marx to demonstrate that people of African
   descent are central to the discourse of Marx, contrary to widespread
   misconceptions by critics who attribute a Eurocentric orientation to
   Marx because of the accident of his birth in Europe and by allies
   because of his scholarly activism in European working-class politics.
   The paper argues that the earlier work of Marx and Engels ({[}1847]
   1969. The Manifesto of the Communist Party in Marx/Engels Selected
   Works, Vol. One, pp. 98-137. Moscow: Progress Publishers), especially
   the Manifesto of the Communist Party, may have misled critics into
   believing that the history of all hitherto existing society alluded to
   by Marx and Engels was exclusively European history. On the contrary,
   there are hundreds of references to the `Negro' in Capital, not as part
   of a peripheral or superficial concern relating to the issue of class
   exploitation in Europe, but as a foundational model for explaining and
   predicting the ending of the exploitation of the working class globally.
   The paper concludes that this reading adds credence to Africana Studies
   paradigms that privilege critical, Africa-centred scholar-activism as an
   important contribution to original theoretical, methodological and
   policy innovations.},

Abstract = {This article critically examines the linkages between the literatures on
   depoliticisation, governance and political participation. To do so, it
   is divided into three substantive sections. The first section critiques
   Flinders and Wood's article which introduces this edited volume.
   Subsequently, the second section examines the links between forms of
   depoliticisation and modes of governance, arguing that a metagovernance
   approach allows the best understanding of the `evidence' for
   depoliticisation. The final section then considers the changing nature
   of political participation, arguing that we are witnessing both
   depoliticisation and repoliticisation, and that it is crucial to
   recognise and respond to each of these processes.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Pages = {407-429},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Though management is theorized as a temporal process, and public
   organizations are understood as generally inertial, most public
   management studies rely upon cross-sectional research designs. As such,
   we have little understanding about how public management matters over
   time. To fill this gap in the literature, this article conducts a
   longitudinal analysis of one of the most established management
   theories: Basss full range of leadership theory. This theory expects
   positive outcomes when managers establish patterns of transactional and
   transformational leadership. To examine Basss theory, this article
   studies US federal government subagencies over a 7-year period in the
   beginning of the 21st century. The findings show that there are
   remarkably strong intra-organizational patterns over time. Nonetheless,
   there is evidence that management matters: improvements in leadership
   are positively associated with follower cooperation, satisfaction, and
   perceptions of work quality. In comparison, as Bass expects,
   transformational leadership is a stronger predictor of improvement.
   Though public management appears to matter over time, the article also
   shows that cross-sectional examinations may overvalue its effect. As
   such, the article closes by arguing for further longitudinal public
   management study.},

Abstract = {Social marketing is an increasingly popular method by which governments
   and public bodies deploy marketing principles and techniques in order to
   achieve `social goods'. This paper examines the close relationship
   between public sector social marketing, a policy mantra focused on
   `behaviour change' and the political agenda of `libertarian
   paternalism'. Drawing on interview data with policy strategists, think
   tank professionals, social marketing advisors and civil servants, the
   paper argues that careful attention needs to be paid to the strategic
   governance issues raised by the use of social marketing tools in public
   policy, with a particular focus on the ethics of behavioural
   segmentation, context shaping and choice. We argue that there are
   serious ethical consequences to a public policy culture, which has
   become preoccupied with cultivating the arts of choosing within a
   methodological and theoretical framework dominated by the language,
   tools and techniques of behaviourism, marketisation and consumerism.},

Abstract = {As implemented by some African States in a non- penal or even extra-
   judiciary approach of justice, post- conflict processes would certainly
   nurish international criminal law, which presents currently a very
   western, individualistic and formal character. In this paper, the author
   summarizes pros and cons of both (penal and not penal) reactions to
   ``the worst crimes{''}, and describes their legal articulation. May
   criminal law recognize its alternatives ?},

Abstract = {Most commentators interpret the messages left by drug traffickersoften
   accompanied by gruesomely disfigured human remainsas simple acts of
   score-settling or claims of territory between rival groups. A case study
   of the narcomedianarcomensajes, narcovideos, and narcomantas in Yucatan
   in 2008, as well as an exploration of contemporary public debates
   relating the narcomedia at the national level over the ensuing years,
   provides some alternative ways to read the narcomedia: in the context of
   the rise of the new media; in terms of networks of relationships between
   new and old media; as interventions into regionally embedded and
   nationally framed political struggles; and as a focal point of struggles
   over media censorship, the public sphere, and counterpublics in
   contemporary Mexico. Mayoria de los comentaristas interpreta los
   mensajes dejados por narcotraficantes, a menudo acompanados por restos

Abstract = {When studying the ever increasing mobilization of territorial
   authorities in the EU context, the literature has used the term
   subnational' as shorthand for very different actors, with the most
   typical distinction made between regional and local government. In this
   article we propose an alternative dichotomy. We suggest that stronger'
   regions actually share much in common with stronger' associations of
   local governments, while weaker' regions exhibit a number of
   similarities with weaker' associations and individual local authorities.
   We illustrate our findings using evidence gathered from a survey of 103
   regional offices in Brussels as well as interview data of 149 officials
   working in five different European countries. We draw on existing
   research in this field, as well as our own data, to take stock of key
   understandings around territorial interest representation and present a
   series of propositions concerning (1) the objectives of subnational
   actors, distinguishing financial from regulatory mobilization, and (2)
   the strategies and representation channels used by these authorities.},

Abstract = {We develop the concept of a policy bubble to capture the notion of
   long-term overinvestment in a policy. In sketching the relation of
   policy bubbles to economic bubbles, we describe how these two concepts
   have similar origins but different trajectories because they are
   filtered by different institutions. We examine in some detail three
   likely instances of ongoing policy bubbles: crime policy, school reform
   (charter schools and private education vouchers), and the contracting
   and privatization of public services. We show how these cases differ
   from the housing bubble of 1997-2007, how they differ from each other,
   and the extent to which they can be considered policy bubbles. Last, we
   suggest this concept can help unify the policy process literature with
   the practice of policy evaluation and outline testable hypotheses for
   future research.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the pro-market rhetoric of the early phase of the
   post-communist transformation in Poland. It looks at one case of such
   rhetoric, that of the Warsaw daily Gazeta Wyborcza, a leading Polish
   paper medium. Gazeta was an unequivocal supporter of the market
   transition and perhaps the country's most important pro-market
   opinion-forming platform. In order to convince its readership, it
   argued, in a vein similar to that of the early nineteenth-century
   classical economists, that this was the only way to achieve an efficient
   economy but that, in the short run, social costs and suffering were
   unavoidable. In its rhetoric, it stressed logic and rationality as
   characteristics of the reform projects, while often using irony in
   reporting differing views. Critical voices it treated as either naive or
   representing the vested interests of those opposing the reforms. The
   Gazeta editors and authors were in favor of rapid reforms, afraid that
   pain and suffering would mobilize resistance. They believed that the
   sooner the economic rebuilding process succeeded, the greater support
   there would be for the reforms. The danger they were most afraid of was
   right-wing, nationalist populism. Ironically, the type of policies they
   advocated, while economically successful, actually contributed to
   marginalization and social exclusion. Thus, as an overview of
   East-Central Europe politics shows, in the longer term they led exactly
   to what Gazeta was most afraid of.},

Title = {From ``And{''} to ``Either/or{''}: Nationhood in Montenegro during the
   Yugoslav Twentieth Century},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The politicized polarization of Montenegrin society around the question
   of Montenegrin statehood in the context of the disintegration of the
   former Yugoslavia, finally leading to Montenegrin independence in 2006,
   is accompanied by a remarkable identity change toward a clear division
   between Serbian and Montenegrin nationhood. I situate this development
   within the long-term interference between Montenegrin and Serbian
   categories of identification in elite articulations of national identity
   in Montenegro during the twentieth century. In the early twentieth
   century, the Montenegrin and Serbian categories were concurrently
   available for national identification in the context of political
   modernization in the country. Reflecting the lasting political and
   broader societal relevance of nationhood during the Yugoslav twentieth
   century, diverging interpretations of the relation between both
   categories of nationhood have continuously substantiated political
   divides in Montenegro. One part of the political spectrum subordinated
   Montenegrin regional identity to Serbian nationhood, the other part
   attached increasingly far-reaching political demands to Montenegrin
   national identity while maintaining a sense of Serbian national identity
   in the domain of culture and ethnicity. In the course of the Yugoslav
   twentieth century, the complementary relation between both categories of
   nationhood was challenged by exclusive definitions of Serbian and
   Montenegrin nationhood, a development which has to be related to the
   continuous questioning of relations between various concurring
   categories of national identity available in Yugoslavia. The current
   institutionalization of Montenegrin nationhood in independent Montenegro
   and the development toward clear-cut Serbian and Montenegrin
   mono-national identities is leading to the regression of multiple
   nationhood among the broader population.},

Abstract = {Party regulation in new democracies in general, and in the Spanish
   political system in particular, has not been a matter of concern until
   very recently. In order to fill this gap, this article explores the way
   political parties have been regulated not only in the Constitution, but
   also in the main laws regulating party foundation, organisation,
   dissolution and, not least, funding: namely, the 1978 and 2002 Political
   Party Laws as well as the 1985 and 2007 Party Funding Laws. The
   empirical part explores the impact such regulation has had on the
   Spanish party system as well as on the life of its party organisations.},

Abstract = {In the context of neoliberalism and the culture of violence in
   Guatemala, the performance art of Regina Jose Galindo uses a language of
   provocation that embodies political struggle. Galindo's art does not
   realistically portray violence; rather, it opens venues for discussion
   on violence against women and possible solutions on both a regional and
   a global level. Performative violence shocks the spectator out of
   his/her normalized insensitivity to daily gender-based violence. The
   privileged physicality of the artist's own body challenges the
   naturalization of violence against women in contemporary Guatemalan
   society.},

Abstract = {This chapter maps the different conditions and strategies in place in
   the four case study countries: political consensus, reduced union
   impact, technical blurring, grand fathering; response to a crisis,
   independent commissions, packaging and existing context. Being able to
   adopt pensionable age reforms appears to require a certain number of
   supportive conditions to be in place, and, in addition, that these
   should be mutually reinforcing. It concludes that when striving for
   success in pension reforms, policy makers should ensure that the
   following boxes are ticked: objectivity, coherence, complexity and
   consensus.},

Title = {Making Sense of Wartime Rape: A Multi-causal and Multi-level Analysis},
Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Pages = {461-482},
Abstract = {Scholars have long sought to explain the causes of wartime rape. While
   mono-causal explanations, focused on power and dominance, are
   increasingly losing ground to more complex, multi-causal explanations, a
   significant gap within the academic literature nevertheless persists:
   namely, the relationship between different causal variables remains
   critically under-explored. The purpose of this article, hence, is
   precisely to develop a multi-causal explanation that integrates, rather
   than merely identifies, a variety of possible causes. It does so by
   adopting a three-pronged, multi-level analysis focused on macro
   (societal), meso (group) and micro (individual) causal factors. While it
   broadly adopts a social constructivist approach, it also argues that
   such an approach over-emphasizes structure at the expense of agency.
   This research accordingly combines social constructivism with an
   emphasis on performance. Specifically, it argues that macro-level
   factors such as patriarchy and nationalism create a `script' for the
   commission of rape, which `actors'-namely groups and
   individuals-interpret and perform. It thereby seeks to develop an
   explanatory framework that balances structure and agency, rather than
   privileging the former over the latter. This article attaches greatest
   importance to the meso, group level. Deconstructing the idea that rape
   constitutes a powerful weapon of war, it seeks to demonstrate that in
   the permissive/enabling environment that macro, societal factors create,
   wartime rape ultimately occurs because of its immense strategic and
   symbolic value to armed groups.},

Abstract = {This chapter considers the ethical aspects of remote killing with drones
   through the just war doctrine, the psychology of distance and killing,
   the role of machines in warfare, and public consent to the covert use of
   force. American counter-terrorism against al Qaeda that includes the
   tactical use of drones generally follows the just war doctrine, but the
   vast distance between combatants and ease of sending in unmanned and
   robotic instruments lends itself to the increasing willingness to use
   force without public or legislative participation in overseas military
   operations. Many also fear the decline of martial virtues with the
   advent of remote controlled warfare and a video game mentality, though
   the current U.S. military practice is strict on the rules of engagement
   and lethal action.},

Pages = {1199-1217},
Abstract = {The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), which envisages stricter
   standards for the transnational enforcement of intellectual property
   rights, received strong support from business groups. Nevertheless, a
   campaign against the agreement that was initiated by a small number of
   citizen groups was successful in stopping its ratification in the
   European Union (EU). This result is puzzling because the anti-ACTA side
   controlled few material resources and should have found it difficult to
   have its voice heard on an issue negotiated at the international level.
   We explain the success of the anti-ACTA campaign by showing how interest
   groups managed to increase the public salience of the issue; how the
   increasing public salience motivated a growing number of interest groups
   to mobilize; and how the resulting dynamic made decision-makers opt
   against ratification of the agreement. The article advances scholarly
   understanding of the interaction between lobbying and public opinion and
   sheds light on the defeat of ACTA.},

   ideational approaches, which can generate differential levels of
   adherence to the regulatory power of the EU, suggesting varied
   interpretations about the nature and reception of European integration

   Languages},
Booktitle = {LENGUA Y POLITICA EN AMERICA LATINA: PERSPECTIVAS ACTUALES},
Year = {2014},
Pages = {67-83},
Abstract = {University scientists engaged in co-operation with indigenous peoples
   and communities in their full-fledged recovery felt somewhat frightened
   and reacted defensively during these last two decades in the presence of
   the plentiful literature proceeding from serious professionals and
   sometimes from not too friendly amateurs as well concerning the
   supposedly unavoidable and imminent decay and death of the vast majority
   of the world's languages: especially those spoken by small, scattered
   non-Western peoples; although, in their opinion, not even Europe's
   minority languages could be saved. Some of us, however, would not
   surrender and so we began to observe the phenomenon from a nearer
   distance, assuming simultaneously our responsibilities in permanent
   interconnection with the affected communities. In Venezuela the results
   of this new approach have been more than surprising. In our country,
   language policies are now favourable, but the political willpower of
   most official institutions has been weak or even nonexistent; though it
   would be unfair to deny the existence of important investments, perhaps
   not very adequately utilized. But what I want to insist upon is the
   positive and each year more proactive reaction of communities themselves
   practically our whole Indian population has now become engaged who are
   claiming official recognition, strengthening of their languages, and the
   revitalization of those most endangered, some of which are now no longer
   employed. This changing state of affairs is being covered by the
   denomination ``linguistic revolution{''}. It would be rather exaggerated
   to contend that all problems have been solved, one of the greatest
   difficulties being, in some cases, the formation of really competent
   fluent speakers for those vanishing languages. Notwithstanding, I dare
   to foretell, with little risk of error, that in Venezuela the former
   tendency prevailing until the 90's towards the gradual weakening of
   these languages is now being reverted. This change will lead probably
   earlier than later to the sustainable recovery of each language and
   culture of our first peoples.},

Abstract = {The synchronized terror attacks on July 22, 2011 was the worst
   politically motivated assault in post-WW2 Norway. To the perpetrator,
   Anders Behring Breivik, 22/7 was a marketing operation, designed to draw
   attention to his compendium, 2083: A European Declaration of
   Independence. While Breivik acted alone, his political philosophy is far
   from unique. Through a detailed analysis of the compendium's content,
   identifying the original authors whose texts Breivik used but did not
   always acknowledge, this essay discusses the political traditions that
   informed the assailant's worldview: Islamophobia (anti-Muslim racism),
   cultural conservative nationalism, antifeminism, and selected elements
   of White Power thought, far Right evangelical theology, and the Knights
   Templar tradition, all permeated by romantic male warrior ideals. The
   stunning violence of July 22 was a hyper-masculine performative act
   aimed at producing a heroic avant-garde of nationalist warriors who will
   rise to purge Europe from the corrupting influence of its internal
   enemies and defeat its external enemies. Through the cleansing fire of
   the civil war, he believes that a reborn Europe will arise to reclaim
   its ordained position of glory as the world's leading civilization. In
   the final analysis, Breivik's political philosophy may thus be
   recognized as a 21st-century articulation of the fascist legacy.},

   national political parties. This analysis empirically demonstrates that
   despite all efforts at institutional engineering, political regionalism
   survived and flourished in the form of regional electoral coalitions
   (blocs) in 2003-2005, which created a crucial obstacle to the
   pro-government party's monopolistic control over regional legislatures.
   While this obstacle was removed during the process of authoritarian
   transformation, recent developments in Russian politics suggest that

Abstract = {Located in the field of the transnational governance of education, the
   article examines international comparative testing through a
   sociological analysis of the knowledge and actors that have become
   central to it. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
   (OECD) has become a dominant policy actor in the governance of European
   education; this was the result of its deliberate and systematic
   mobilization by the European Commission (EC), which found in the OECD
   not only a great resource of data to govern (which it did not have
   before) but also a player who would be pushing the Commission's own
   policy agenda forward, albeit leaving the old subsidiarity rule intact.
   The article discusses the role of experts in this emergent European
   policy field through an examination of `policy mobilization'; using the
   concepts of boundary work and `boundary organization', the article shows
   how the OECD has transformed into a `site of coproduction' of both
   knowledge and social order (St Clair, A. L., 2006. Global poverty: the
   co-production of knowledge and politics.},

Abstract = {Hizb al-Tahrir (the Liberation Party, henceforth HT) is a unique kind of
   islamist organization. Compared with the two major islamist movements -
   Salafism and the Muslim Brothers - it exhibits certain similarities with
   each one but is clearly different from both. While most research to date
   has focused on HT in Europe and Central Asia, this article explores the
   ideology and function of HT in the West Bank, where it was founded in
   1953 and where its leadership comes from today. By analysing Ht in the
   Palestinian context, it becomes apparent how important ideology is for
   the party, as the Palestine question has no pride of place even in the
   Palestinian branch of HT. Instead, it is the global aspiration of
   re-establishing the islamic caliphate that is of paramount importance.
   This very focus on ideology has led the party into relative obscurity in
   the Palestinian Islamist landscape, however. The analysis shows that a
   full understanding of HT must take into consideration the local contexts
   in which it operates; and that it is untenable on both ideological and
   practical grounds to lump different islamist movements together in one

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},

Volume = {36},
Number = {6},
Pages = {567-583},
Abstract = {At the turn of the twentieth century, 191 countries agreed to realize
   the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The European Union (EU) has
   incorporated many of these goals into its development policies. However,
   the effect of the MDGs on the construction of EU development policy has
   not been achieved through a homogenous diffusion of global development
   norms, but through a heterogeneous process: some MDGs have had a greater
   impact on EU policy formation than others. By reconceptualizing the EU
   as a receiver of norms, this paper aims to locate the scope conditions
   of global norm convergence in EU development policy through a comparison
   of disaster risk reduction and urban development in slum dwellings.
   Informed through world society theory, the findings point to the
   importance of norm `theorization' in explaining the scope conditions of
   norm diffusion.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-60},
Abstract = {Since the end of the cold war, democracy promotion has provided moral
   legitimacy to the foreign interventions of Western states. Thus, it has
   constituted a central element of the hegemonic strategy of the US state
   and the Western transnational capitalist class. However, in this
   article, I suggest that democracy promotion itself faces a profound
   crisis of legitimacy. In this article, I challenge the currently
   hegemonic definition of democracy as `polyarchy' and critique the
   foundational justifications for democracy promotion and claims about its
   successes. I then describe the factors combining to generate democracy
   promotion's current legitimacy crisis. I conclude that, linked as it is
   to American state power and neoliberal globalization, the future for
   Western democracy promotion remains deeply uncertain. I also argue that
   it befalls critical scholars to challenge hegemonic definitions and
   practices of democracy and democracy promotion.},

Title = {Integrating rules, disintegrating markets: the end of national
   discretion in European banking?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {21},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1473-1490},
Abstract = {This article examines the integration of prudential banking regulation
   and supervision in the European Union. It demonstrates that incremental
   integration in the two decades preceding the sovereign debt and banking
   crisis produced a regulatory process that afforded member states wide
   discretion when it came to implementing European rules at the national
   level. Decentralized implementation was an aggravating factor in the
   partial disintegration of the Single Market in financial services since
   2008. The recently agreed `Single Rulebook' and `Single Supervisory
   Mechanism' reduce the scope for home bias in the implementation of
   European rules, thereby shifting the regulatory process in banking
   closer towards an idealized `end-point' of outright supranational
   governance. However, change is taking place within an increasingly
   complex regulatory environment that is shaping the outcome of reform.
   One consequence is that national discretion in some important prudential
   areas will persist.},

   the basis for corporatism: the corporate state. The sustainability of
   the system requires the expansion of private power and wealth, economic
   growth, and the profitability of corporate interests. The Australian
   political economy requires free' access to the world's capital, markets

Title = {Expanding the Expansion of International Society: a new approach
   with empirical illustrations from West African and European interaction,
   1400-1883},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {89-111},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to expand upon Hedley Bull and Adam
   Watson's work The Expansion of International Society (1984a), initially
   theoretically and thereafter through empirical illustrations. The
   premise is that Bull and Watson's approach can only take study of the
   expansion so far, as it creates silences that neglect aspects of
   international history that were central to the expansion process. As
   such, I initially focus on three features of Bull and Watson's
   theoretical approach that are thought to create these silences and a
   problematic Euro-centrism: historical periodisation, a neglect of
   non-European regions and the system/society distinction. I thereafter
   argue that the original Expansion's periodisation scheme needs to be
   broadened, that research into non-European regions before European
   contact is necessary and that interaction at the world society level
   should be considered. The benefits of this new approach are then
   illustrated, first in a study of the West African international society
   in its own right, and then in a study of the Afro-European interaction
   that took place in the context of that society. Ultimately, this new
   approach suggests that the expansion process was driven largely by the
   exchange of norms and ideas at the world society level and by the
   emergence of mutually constructed institutions over the course of
   several centuries.},

   Power, as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton commissioned a massive
   study known as the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Defense Review (QDDR),

   Mostly the product of a turf battle between the State Department and its
   development arm, USAID, the QDDR failed to address the State
   Department's failures in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it embraced the
   discredited concept of nation-building at a time when the White House
   and the Defense Department were rejecting it along with the country at
   large. Written under the aegis of an academic, with little or no
   involvement by the Foreign Service, it promoted the notion of the
   withering away of the sovereignty of other states.},

Abstract = {Contractual relations between IOs and the private sector for project
   execution are not a new phenomenon. What is new in the character of IOs'
   engagement with the private sector in recent years is the quality and
   purpose of their partnerships that build upon common objectives for
   poverty reduction and development by promoting CSR and sustainable
   development. As a relatively new area in the study of IOs, theories of
   IR, and development policy, the conceptualization and analysis of these
   changes present some challenges in theoretical, analytical, and
   empirical terms. This introductory chapter highlights these challenges
   and introduces the steps that this research undertakes to conceptualize
   and analyze the case.},

Booktitle = {CYBER-WAR: THE ANATOMY OF THE GLOBAL SECURITY THREAT},
Series = {Palgrave Pivot},
Year = {2014},
Pages = {14-27},
Abstract = {This chapter examines the debates around the changing nature of
   conflict, and the manner in which the cyber element has been presented
   as a new revolution in military affairs. The analysis notes how conflict
   has evolved and mutated under processes of globalisation, particularly
   since the end of the Cold War, whereby asymmetric tactics and strategies
   are increasingly the norm. Cyber methodologies have the potential to
   represent the archetypal modern asymmetric technique, especially when
   wielded against a highly networked nation and military such as those of
   the US. The conclusion is that cyber has both offered modern ways of
   conducting old activities (such as information operations) and, at the
   same time, offered the potential for wholly new ways of conducting
   warfare in the future.},
