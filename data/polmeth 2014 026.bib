Abstract = {New Zealand women gained the vote in 1893, the first women in the world
   to do so. But they could not stand as candidates for Parliament. Early
   twentieth-century party leaders were reluctant to allow women full
   suffrage. This article examines the attitudes and influence of New
   Zealand party leaders from 1935 to 1975 in helping or hindering women
   gain representation in Parliament. It concludes that during those 40
   years the most influential gatekeepers were the party leaders. By 1972,
   however, the Second Wave of Feminism and the changing attitudes of some
   party leaders resulted in women gaining more opportunities to become MPs
   and by 2001 an unprecedented number of women held leadership positions
   in the New Zealand Parliament.},

Title = {A story of mutual adaptation? The interaction between local and

Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {188-201},
Abstract = {This article shows in what ways the lack of cooperation between
   international and local peacebuilding actors can hamper the
   effectiveness of their programmes. In Ituri, a north-eastern district in
   the DR Congo, international peacebuilding actors mainly focused on
   statebuilding while local peacebuilding actors predominantly addressed
   issues of social cohabitation, such as reconciliation between ethnic
   communities and the resolution of land conflicts. Due to a lack of
   cooperation, however, these different priorities were often only
   partially coordinated. On their end, local peacebuilding actors adapted
   international statebuilding programmes to the local context during the
   implementation phase, but were not relevantly involved in strategy
   making. International peacebuilding actors, in turn, have only recently
   started to adapt their programmes to local priorities. However, if they
   do so, they often crowd out and duplicate the work of local
   peacebuilding actors, rather than cooperating with them by implementing
   complementary activities. This ultimately makes both local and
   international actors' programmes less effective.},

   Institutions and the Montenegrin Paradox},
Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Pages = {431-460},
Abstract = {The history of Montenegrin nation-building goes against the expectations
   of many institutionalist theories of nationalism, which generally hold
   that national institutions increase collective sentiments of national
   identity. Although during the period of socialist Yugoslavia, Montenegro
   had an institutional endowment similar to that of other
   republics-including a constitution, parliament, government, flag,
   republican borders, and academy of arts and sciences-the proportion of
   self-identified Montenegrins actually declined from 91\% at the start of
   the socialist period to 44.5\% in the most recent census. This occurred
   despite the fact that Yugoslav elites built up Montenegro's national
   institutions over these decades; it also runs against the expectations
   of many institutionalist theories of nationalism that predict
   constant-or even heightened-national consciousness as a group's
   institutional endowment increases. Municipal-level census data in
   Montenegro are examined over time to show that neither national
   institutions nor elite efforts to mobilize upon them succeeded in
   generating a robust Montenegrin identity. The evidence here provides
   preliminary support for a theory of `situational nationalism', according
   to which the fate of national projects depends on the wider identity
   environment. Despite elite efforts to build nations along certain lines,
   people choose their identities in the context of an ever-changing field
   of political and identity conflicts at the international and domestic
   levels in a fluctuating `marketplace of ideas'. It is concluded that
   identity conflicts in the wider neighborhood place significant
   constraints on the success of any given nation-building project.},

Abstract = {This article proposes an analytical perspective on jihadist
   radicalization that focuses on the immediate social environment from
   which clandestine violent groups emerge, to which they remain socially
   and symbolically connected, and from which they receive some degree of
   support. Based on a detailed analysis of the Sauerland-Group it traces
   relational dynamics shaping individual pathways as well as processes of
   group formation within local Salafist milieus, the wider Salafist
   movement, and radical jihadist networks. It argues that one
   characteristic feature of homegrown jihadist groups is their
   simultaneous connection to and embeddedness in various different social
   contexts as well as the fluid, ad-hoc character of the clandestine group
   and its ambivalent relation with its supportive social environment.},

   Korean Version of Radical Buddhism in the 1980s},
Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},

Pages = {264-282},
Abstract = {This essay provides a historical analysis of the South Korean Minjung
   (Liberation) Buddhist Movement during the turbulent 1980s. Heavily
   indebted to Marxism and other forms of socialism, as well as to
   Christian Liberation Theology, Minjung Buddhists had three major aims:
   anti-dictatorship, anti-imperialism, and reunification. The movement has
   been in decline since the early 1990s for three reasons: the economic
   and political collapse of the Eastern European Communist bloc and the
   Soviet Union; the election of a long-time opposition party leader, Kim
   Yeongsam, to the South Korean presidency in 1992; and the removal of the
   Jogye Order's pro-government and undemocratic administration in 1994.
   Although recent progressive Korean Buddhists do not use the term
   `Minjung Buddhism', they have continued the basic spirit of Minjung
   Buddhism within various forms of Engaged Buddhism. While Minjung
   Buddhists were successful in accomplishing their two primary aims -
   opposing the dictatorship and rejecting the imperialism that supported
   it - they were unsuccessful in their third major goal, the reunification
   of Korea.},

Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},

Pages = {105-121},
Abstract = {This article explores the role of law-making in the securitization of
   ethnic identities in Israel. The article examines the laws passed and
   bills proposed between 2000 and 2011 by the Israeli Knesset. The
   evidence suggests that despite consistent attempts to securitize the
   ethnic identity of the state, they have, for the most part, failed. A
   brief comparison between Israel and other liberal democracies also
   reveals that the banality of securitization, i.e. the use of ordinary
   rather than extraordinary measures in the securitization process, is not
   unique to Israel. This article demonstrates most clearly how the process
   of securitization contributes to the ease with which illiberal practices
   can creep into the democratic system without the need to resort to
   exceptional action.},

   not declining. The Japanese Navy is evolving to combine enhanced
   capabilities to retain sea control in the Sea of Japan and the East
   China Sea with extended operational reach and flexibility, including an
   expeditionary component to meet alliance and diplomatic commitments in
   East Asia and beyond its confines.},

Abstract = {The article examines the evolution of party regulation in Romania and
   identifies a progressive shift from the early 1990s promotion scope of
   party legislation towards a multi-layered prescriptive and rather
   restrictive legislation. The dynamics identified fit the party
   cartelisation idea, although with significant amendments. The mid 90s
   and the 2000s changes were not primarily geared towards controlling
   access to public funding for party politics; beyond the rhetoric
   pleading in favour of a simpler democracy, the various amendments
   testify parties' interest to limit access to privileged state contracts
   and patronage positions.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {340-347},
Abstract = {Despite the economic crisis that hit full force in 2008 in the US and
   Europe, political leaders have made little attempt to rethink the
   neoliberal ideas that are in large part responsible for the boom and
   bust, let alone to come to terms with how immoderate the `Great
   Moderation' really was. Much the contrary, neoliberal ideas seem to
   continue to constitute the ruling ideas. In the financial markets, where
   the crisis began, reregulation remains woefully inadequate, while the
   only ideas in play are neoliberal, either for more `market-enhancing'
   regulation or in favor of greater laissez-faire. The biggest puzzle,
   however, is the response to the crisis by Eurozone countries that have
   embraced `market discipline' through austerity and, in so doing, have
   condemned themselves to slow or no growth. This is in contrast to the
   US, which has posted better economic results, despite being torn between
   Republican fundamentalists advocating austerity and a more pragmatic
   leadership focused on growth.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Abstract = {This article examines whether the empowerment of the European Union's
   (EU) supranational institutions has had an impact on the development of
   EU asylum. By systematically investigating EU asylum law before and
   after `communitarization', it argues that its `policy core' has
   maintained a high degree of continuity. An advocacy coalition under the
   leadership of the interior ministers managed to co-opt pivotal actors in
   the newly empowered European Commission and European Parliament. By
   contenting themselves with changes of secondary order, these EU
   institutions accepted and institutionalized the restrictive and weakly
   integrated core of EU asylum set by the Council in the first negotiation
   round. Their role and decisions were driven not only by the negotiation
   dynamics and political expediency, but also by new inter- and
   intra-institutional norms fostering consensual practices.},

Abstract = {This article argues that distinctive liberal traditions shaped France
   and Germany's Keynesian policy responses to the post-2007 economic
   crisis. In France, statist liberalism privileges an activist state that
   favors macroeconomic intervention and investment. German corporate
   liberalism, by contrast, is more pluralist and emphasizes the powers and
   responsibilities of social and economic groups, who are viewed as the
   fundamental components of the social order. The article argues that
   these traditions shaped elite interpretations of the crisis and played
   central roles in defining policy trajectories. They informed a modest
   French response focused on macroeconomic stimulus that relied on
   existing income support and a larger German effort centered on a
   microeconomic strategy of group subsidization. It concludes that these
   outcomes are inconsistent with traditional institutional accounts and
   highlights the importance of research on the role of ideas in shaping
   national responses to economic crises.},

Abstract = {The sudden collapse of Mali's democracy in 2012 revealed the fragility
   of the state's legitimacy and authority. This article argues that the
   decay of democracy was linked to the weakness of the country's
   legislature. Malian MPs collectively failed to scrutinize an
   increasingly discredited executive and parliamentarians typically
   operated in isolation from the vast majority of citizens. As a result,
   rising levels of popular discontent were rarely channelled into the
   formal political process, and the interests that did enter the political
   arena were largely restricted to the personal support networks and
   electoral constituencies of individual MPs. The prevalence of these
   particularistic interests undermined collective parliamentary scrutiny
   of matters of national interest. By demonstrating the link between these
   failures and the collapse of Mali's democracy, this article contributes
   to the expanding body of literature examining the limited role of
   African parliaments in processes of democratic consolidation. In doing
   so it confirms the challenges that executive dominance poses to
   democratization, while highlighting the importance of representative
   legislatures to Africa's democracies.},

Abstract = {The ideas of non-violence, peace and non-discrimination have been
   systematically developed in Buddhism. Nonetheless, as research has
   shown, Buddhist ideas can also contribute to escalation of conflicts,
   racial belief systems and radical movements. Political theory suggests
   that political actors regularly try to exploit religion in order to
   remain in power or to establish exclusive group identities, and so on.
   From this perspective, religion does not have an independent role;
   rather, the state co-opts a certain form of religion. However, there is
   ample evidence that religious actors further their own objectives and
   strategies, and in extreme cases attempt to take over a political
   system. The development of Buddhism in Sri Lanka in the twentieth and
   twenty-first centuries is presented here as an example of the
   radicalisation and politicisation of Buddhism. This case study deals
   with the role of religious actors in promoting ethno-religious
   nationalism, the exclusion of the minority population and the
   justification of violence.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes whether and to what extent the policy environment
   of civil servants has an impact on their level of Public Service
   Motivation (PSM). It hypothesizes that public employees working in
   different policy domains and stages of the policy cycle are diversely
   motivated by four PSM orientations (Compassion, Commitment to the public
   interest, Self-sacrifice and Attraction to politics). The empirical
   results are based on a survey of 6885 Swiss civil servants. They show
   that those in charge of Welfare State policies are inclined to have
   higher levels of Compassion', whereas those performing core state
   functions report lower levels. Furthermore, employees whose main tasks
   are related to policy formulation display high levels of the Attraction
   to politics' dimension of PSM. This study questions the generalization
   of previous findings on PSM that are based on heterogeneous survey
   populations.},

Abstract = {In representative democracies most public administration is actually
   directed by unelected appointees. These appointees are accountable to
   voters only indirectly through a minister. In Scotland, many decisions
   on healthcare provision are made by regional health boards. The Scottish
   government authorized experimental elections to two of these health
   boards in the hope of democratizing health service administration. Our
   research uncovered many unexpected consequences of holding direct
   elections to health boards, but they did not revolutionize the
   accountability structure in the ways we might have expected. New members
   largely accepted inherited norms which discouraged them from acting as
   conduits for public opinion.},

Abstract = {This article examines the use of performance information by public
   managers. It conceptualizes purposeful data use as a type of extra-role
   behaviour which requires additional effort on the part of the managers
   and which is not extrinsically rewarded. The article sheds light on one
   potential antecedent of performance information use - the motivation of
   the users. It argues that we can observe high levels of data use if
   managers driven by public service motivation (PSM) work under
   transformational leaders. Using a needs-supply perspective on
   supervisors and followers, we suggest that there is a PSM-leadership fit
   which fosters the performance of this extra-role behaviour. The article
   is based on data from German local government and its findings
   contribute to the literatures on PSM as well as on performance
   management.},

Abstract = {In federal systems, governments have the opportunity to learn from the
   policy experiments-and the potential successes-of other governments.
   Whether they seize such opportunities, however, may depend on the
   expertise or past experiences of policymakers. Based on an analysis of
   state-level adoptions of antismoking restrictions targeted towards
   youths, we find that US states are more likely to emulate other states
   that have demonstrated the ability to successfully limit youth smoking.
   In addition, we find that political expertise (as captured by
   legislative professionalism) and policy expertise (as captured by
   previous youth access policy experiments at the local level) enhance the
   likelihood of emulating policy successes found in other states. As such,
   we establish that internal expertise and external learning are
   complements, rather than substitutes.},

Abstract = {Abstract
   The task of coming to a proper appreciation of Clausewitz's thoughts on
   war is to combine a hierarchical structure with that of a floating
   balance. This article examines the relation of purpose, aims and means
   in Clausewitz's theory and highlights that this relation is
   methodologically comparable to the floating balance of Clausewitz's
   trinity. Modern strategic thinking is characterised by the `ends, ways,
   means relationship' and the concept of the `way' as shortest possible
   direct connection between ends and means. If strategy is nothing else
   than the direct way of linking the political purpose with the means,
   understood as combat, this understandings results in `battle-centric'
   warfare. My thesis is that the aim (goal, way) in warfare is not a
   direct link between purpose and means, but rather an indirect,
   intermediary dimension, a mediation (in Hegelian terms) between purpose
   and aims with its own grammar. This article distinguishes (sometimes
   going beyond Clausewitz) between the rationality of the whole process of
   war, the rationality of the separate aspects of purpose, aims and means
   in warfare and finally their conflicting tendencies. This article
   highlights Clausewitz's different concepts of purpose and aims and tries
   to shed at least some light of the strategic implications of this
   difference. This interpretation of Clausewitz leads to the definition of
   strategy as maintaining a floating balance of purpose, aims and means in
   warfare.},

Title = {A Norwegian policy perspective on the relation between school leadership
   and pupils' learning outcomes.},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {35},
Number = {6},
Pages = {576-591},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {This article illuminates and discusses how three contemporary Norwegian
   White papers and the OECD document Improving School Leadership: Policy
   and Practice narrate the relationship between school leadership and
   student learning outcomes. First, the article describes the identified
   dominant policy narrative connecting pupils' learning outcomes to school
   leadership, before the narrative techniques used to make this connection
   are explored in more detail. The analysis shows how a dominant public
   narrative describes the relationship between school leadership and
   pupils' learning outcomes as a hierarchical one-way chain of influence,
   and not as a dialogical and dynamic relationship where the elements are
   interdependent and influence each other. The one-way, hierarchical chain
   of influence constructed by the narrative plot meets the need policy has
   to reduce complexity in order to express governmental goals and
   distribute responsibility. The linearity and causality embedded in the
   policy narrative produces an understanding of the relationship between
   school leadership and learning outcomes that also signals a narrow range
   of options available to school leaders and teachers. By proposing a
   limited range of teacher- and leader practices as significant for the
   fulfilment of the policy goals, the narrative plot also constructs a
   relatively narrow frame for the professional work of school leaders and
   teachers.},

Abstract = {As cities develop climate-change policies, they are likely to engage
   with and produce new science and information. What influences the
   choices cities make about this engagement? Our aim is to understand the
   differences in the ways city governments structure their relationship to
   climate-change science and expertise, and the extent to which these
   choices reflect broader governance orientations towards climate change
   as a policy area. The climate-change policy processes of Delhi and
   Mexico City are used as case studies. The two cities have made different
   choices about the structure and formality of the science-policy
   interface, and demonstrate that policymakers' choices about engaging
   scientific expertise are embedded in broader administrative and
   political systems. Examining the science-policy dynamics in urban
   climate-change policy suggests ways forward for future research, as
   there are likely to be political and policy consequences and trade-offs
   with different approaches to structuring the science-policy interface.},

Abstract = {Does the 2013 United Nations (UN) Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) represent what
   Costa Rica's UN Ambassador called a nascent `Spirit of New York' - a
   change in the rules of the arms control game in favor of humanitarianism
   and human rights? Or does it represent business as usual -the ghost of
   Arms Control past? We are convinced by neither the messianic claims of
   the ATT's most overheated boosters nor the doom-saying of its most
   ardent detractors. Rather we argue here that in both the ATT negotiation
   process and the treaty text, `norm entrepreneurs' like NGOs, Middle
   Powers and small states have created space for global policy making
   based on humanitarian and human rights considerations. However, the
   negotiation and treaty also represent a melding of this `maximalist'
   human security-civil society approach with UN General Assembly concerns
   about small arms proliferation and the `minimalist' strategic and
   commercial interests of the major arms exporters. This hybrid pathway to
   the treaty's adoption offers possibilities for future global policy
   making on disarmament and arms control as well as other humanitarian
   issues.},

Abstract = {Even after twenty years of Lukashenka's rule, Belarusians still have to
   struggle for democracy. However, there has been a modest growth in the
   number of protesters during presidential elections and in the pro-EU
   mood of the Belarusian population. This article analyzes the dynamic of
   this growth through the prism of social movements literature and such
   concepts as framing, political opportunity, and mobilizing structures.
   The argument is that the weakness of the mobilizing structures and
   framing processes at times when political opportunities presented
   themselves in Belarus resulted in an absence of large-scale protests and
   a failure to sustain the development of social movements in the country.
   At the same time, Belarus cannot be considered as being in a static or
   retrogressive state since transnational flows characteristic of a
   globalizing world have exposed people to wider flows of information,
   providing them with counterframes and resulting in a modest growth in
   the numbers of protesters and a change in the preferences of the
   Belarusian population.},

   Re-inventing Protest at the 2012 Serbian Elections},

Abstract = {This article examines the ways in which invalidated electoral ballots
   may be articulated as acts of protest. We argue that some instances of
   ballot invalidation can be understood as protest and as a reaction to
   the broader crises of democracy which have also spurred on movements
   such as Occupy. We focus on Serbia's 2012 elections as a case study,
   given the high increases in invalid ballots and calls for collective
   action calling for ballot invalidation. We discuss protest movements
   which coalesced around this election, calling for electoral ballot
   invalidation and using social media to frame this activity as protest.
   Through our case study, we explore the ways in which the ballot can
   become a tool of contention, and how protest can be expressed through an
   engagement with extant structures and institutions.},

Abstract = {The Jewish origin of Gustaw Herling-Grudziski, one of the greatest
   modern Polish writers, has remained a taboo in Poland for years. The
   Jewish thread was never significantly thematised in his work. The
   strength of dismissal of this matter from his consciousness as a
   writertogether with the panic caused within the Polish literary milieu
   by the confirmation of rumours about his foreign originspeaks for itself
   and indirectly illustrates the attitude to otherness that still prevails
   in mainstream Polish literature. In this article, I would like to
   explore the author's literary/biographical strategy, which is outlined
   in two stories set in the Late Middle Ages. Both of them are based on
   the so-called blood libel in its early variant, which consisted of
   accusing Jews of desecrating the host.},

Abstract = {In the context of a cross-national economic crisis, questions about
   democratic legitimacy are again topical. We explore the question of
   democratic legitimacy in Portugal and Greece by employing the conceptual
   differentiation between diffuse and specific regime support. Our
   findings indicate that while specific support has fallen in both
   countries, only Greece has experienced a precipitous fall in diffuse
   support, suggesting a link between regime performance and support for
   democracy. Individual-level analyses do not reveal any clear patterns
   concerning the impact of long-term societal factors or short-term
   economic considerations. Due to data quality limitations the paper has a
   predominately exploratory nature.},

Abstract = {During the 1990s, a prominent strategy of economic adjustment to the
   challenges of competitiveness and budgetary retrenchment among the
   non-corporatist countries of Europe was the negotiation of social pacts.
   Since the onset of the great recession and the Eurozone crisis, social
   pacts have been conspicuous by their absence. Why have unions not been
   invited into government buildings to negotiate paths of economic
   adjustment in the countries hardest hit by the crisis? Drawing on
   empirical experiences from Ireland and Italy-two cases on which much of
   the social pact literature concentrated-this article attributes the
   exclusion of unions to their declining legitimacy. Unions in the new
   European periphery have lost the capacity either to threaten governments
   with the stick of protest or to seduce policymakers with the carrot of
   problem-solving. They are now seen as a narrow interest group like any
   other.},

Abstract = {Policy transfer features prominently in the policy analysis Literature,
   yet relatively little is known about how government officials seek to
   learn lessons from abroad in practice. This research, based on
   interviews with officials in government institutes in South Korea who
   were involved in a series of study visits to the United Kingdom,
   addresses this knowledge gap using Evans and Davies' policy transfer
   network model and the recently developed notion of `policy tourism'. We
   conclude that policy tourism rarely leads directly to policy change but
   is a valuable part of ongoing processes of policy learning.},

Abstract = {Using as a starting point the close relationship between the concepts of
   governance, control and public auditing, this article puts forward the
   idea of introducing a set of roles and measures in the exercise of
   external performance auditing, one which would raise the efficiency of
   audit control in the field of governance. Specifically, it posits a
   hypothesis regarding how these proposals make a contribution to two
   essential aspects of local public life: citizens' participation and the
   fight against fraud. The work takes Spain as the scene and analyzes its
   deficiencies and opportunities from a reformist viewpoint. The empirical
   analysis takes into account the opinions of the main interest groups in
   local government: internal and external auditors, local politicians,
   public managers and members of the public represented by local
   participatory committees. In this way the writers aim to make a
   contribution to the slim amount of empirical literature existing in this
   field and suggest ways to make improvements in the professional field of
   auditing and its national configuration.},

Abstract = {If professionalism shapes executive behavior significantly, then
   agencies whose executives belong to a particular profession ought to
   manage differently from similarly situated executives who do not, and in
   ways that affect organizational outcomes. Extending theories of
   normative isomorphism to executive management, this study examines the
   effects of executives' professions on their management and their
   agencies' implementation of federal environmental regulations. Examining
   American local government water utilities, I argue that normative
   isomorphism causes executives who are engineers to manage their agencies
   differently from nonengineers. Illustrative case studies show how
   professions shape executive management. Since professional engineers
   were influential in the development of the Safe Drinking Water Act
   (SDWA), its regulations reflect the dominant norms of the engineering
   profession. Analysis of data from a survey of utility executives and the
   Environmental Protection Agency shows that utilities that are headed by
   professional engineers violate the SDWA significantly less frequently
   than do utilities led by nonengineers. Results demonstrate normative
   isomorphism in executive management and highlight the significance of
   professionalism in policy design and implementation.},

Abstract = {A long process of state-institutional change underlay an eventual swift
   restructuring of Northern Ireland on a more equal basis in the 2000s.
   This article shows how change occurred and explains its phasing, arguing
   that it took a threshold form. It gives a distinctive characterisation
   of the recognition', agenda' and implementation' thresholds, and the
   different politics that followed each. This model of state change is of
   interest in three ways: in providing a distinctive characterisation and
   explanation of the process; in addressing the comparative literature on
   exclusion', conflict and settlement by sketching a threshold model of
   change from exclusion' to inclusion'; and in speaking to a pressing
   moral concern - if settlement was possible at all, why was it not
   possible sooner? The article makes use of new evidence in the form of
   over 70 elite interviews with senior British and Irish politicians and
   officials who made, influenced and closely observed the process.},

Abstract = {At the end of World War II, international organizations played a leading
   role in the configuration of the new world order: In this context, the
   UN positioned itself as one of the most influential international
   actors, above all through its peace missions. However, in many cases
   these missions have not been successful, leading many scholars to
   question the work of the organization. The case of the Democratic
   Republic of Congo is a clear example of the failure of humanitarian
   intervention; despite the 14-year presence of the UN, the country
   remains at the top of the ranking of failed states.},

Abstract = {In recent years, courts in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo)
   have produced some of the most progressive judicial decisions against
   perpetrators of gender violence of anywhere in the world. Yet, DR Congo
   is often described as the archetypal collapsed state. This article uses
   a case study of domestic courts in Eastern DR Congo to analyze how and
   why complex functions of domestic governancesuch as the production of
   frequent and high-quality judicial decisions by domestic courtsare able
   to persist, even flourish, in an area where the state is characterized
   by extreme fragility and weakness. I argue that, rather than a
   decoupling of law and practice as previous approaches might predict,
   state fragility in DR Congo has created openings for domestic and
   transnational actors to exert direct influence over judicial processes
   at multiple levels of governance. The involvement of external actors in
   the domestic authority structures of states has resulted in surprisingly
   progressive human rights outcomes in certain issue areas. However, the
   article also documents some of the unintended consequences of human
   rights developments that occur at the very peripheries of broader
   state-building projects.},

Abstract = {The literature on network management is extensive. However, it generally
   explores network structures, neglecting the impact of management
   strategies. In this article we assess the effect of management
   strategies on network outcomes, providing empirical evidence from 119
   urban revitalization networks. We go beyond current work by testing a
   path model for the determinants of network outcomes and considering the
   interactions between the constructs: management strategies, trust,
   complexity, and facilitative leadership. Our results suggest that
   management strategies have a strong effect on network outcomes and that
   they enhance the level of trust. We also found that facilitative
   leadership has a positive impact on network management as well as on
   trust in the network. Our findings also show that complexity has a
   negative impact on trust. A key finding of our research is that managers
   may wield more influence on network dynamics than previously theorized.},

Abstract = {In a representative panel study, citizens of Leipzig (East Germany) were
   interviewed in 1993 and 1996 about their incentives for and
   participation in political protest activities. Conscientiousness,
   neuroticism, agreeableness, openness to experience, and extraversion
   (the Big Five) were measured with 16 bipolar adjectives. The present
   report supplements a previous work of the authors that drew on the
   theories of rational choice and collective action and conceived of
   incentives as proximal causes and personality dispositions as distant
   causes of political protest. Based on structural equation modelling
   (SEM), the present article deals with the respondents' recurrent reports
   on protest incentives and protest acts as indicators of the latent
   construct protest propensity that is according to the predictions
   directly influenced by openness to experience (O+), agreeableness (A-),
   neuroticism (N-), and reciprocity orientation (N{*}E+) with 35\%
   explained variance.},

Abstract = {I argue that `globalization' is not simply a concept describing the
   world but rather an imaginary; a mental practice which renders multiple,
   often competing, social relationships into a meaningful, coherent whole.
   While some scholars have made similar arguments, none has laid out a
   theoretically rigorous understanding of the global imaginary. I first
   draw upon the work of Charles Taylor and Manfred Steger to better
   understand globalization as an imaginary, but find their work unable to
   explain how the global imaginary is produced. To ameliorate this
   deficiency, I turn to the work of Louis Althusser to theorize
   globalization as socially produced within particular material
   apparatuses that organize daily practices. I conclude by applying this
   theory to examine how the apparatus of the US university has transformed
   from an institution designed to produce a national imaginary to one
   producing the global imaginary.},

Abstract = {This paper evaluates the UK Government's e-democracy policy and
   considers what lesson should be learned for future policy and practice.
   Despite some isolated examples of success, we argue that policy
   experimentation in the area has been disappointing overall, especially
   when compared with the ambitious rhetoric that has surrounded it, and
   has failed to culminate in a coherent strategy for using the Internet to
   support democratic citizenship. Our analysis emphasizes the on-going
   importance of online deliberation in achieving inclusive, informed, and
   negotiated policy formation and political decision-making. In the
   absence of inclusive sites and practices of public deliberation, the
   democratic value of non-deliberative experiments with petitioning and
   crowdsourcing and recent government efforts to open up public
   information and data for citizen auditing and evaluation is likely to
   remain limited.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the competing forces driving the development of
   renewable energy in the American states. We formulate a framework of
   state renewable energy politics and develop a set of hypotheses
   regarding the role of politics, policies, and prices in renewable energy
   development. We test these hypotheses with a fixed effect vector
   decomposition model using a panel data set for the U. S. states from
   1990 to 2008. The results indicate that renewable energy development is
   influenced by regulatory institutions, the party affiliations of the
   governor and legislators, and the professionalism of the legislature,
   accompanied by the effects of various policy instruments.},

Journal = {POLICY AND POLITICS},

Abstract = {This article assesses the responses of EU-15 member states to the
   poverty reduction objectives of the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) on
   social inclusion between 2001 and 2006. As a flexible mechanism of
   information sharing between governments, the OMC could not produce
   strong convergence. A thorough analysis of the OMC documents indeed
   points to the enduring power of national institutions and partisan
   politics, for the three dimensions of social inclusion identified by the
   EU (rights, labour market policies, and participation). There was
   however some learning and adaptation around emerging policy ideas like
   activation and the participation of people experiencing poverty.},

Abstract = {Liberal discourse should have a hard time looking for `evil' in
   international relations. Standing on the pillar of rationalism and
   humanitarianism, there seems to be little space for the morally and
   emotionally charged notion of evil to enter considerations. Yet, the
   liberal belief in the freedom of will implies that humans are capable of
   turning against the advice of reason and opt for evil behavior and
   underlying principles. This possibility is epitomized by Kant's
   construction of the `evil enemy'. Since `evil' appears sporadically in
   international relations, with Hitler's Germany as prototype, its
   existence in the real world of international relations cannot be ruled
   out a priori. Designating an `other' as evil is thus a discursive
   possibility. The practice to turn this possibility into reality is
   conceptualized here as `evilization' in analogy to `securitization'.
   There is strong variance among liberal democracies in applying this
   practice, ranging from `pacifism' to `militancy', which often leads to
   dire consequences. Deriving the principles of fallibility and prudence
   from liberal reasoning, this article concludes with the proposition that
   `liberal pacifism' is the preferable option in most conceivable
   circumstances, but that the possibility of confronting political evil is
   rare, but existing.},

Abstract = {The Chinese party-state is currently adapting its governance strategy.
   The recent debate in China on the role of microblogs in the governance
   process, as documented in the reports issued by Chinese research
   institutes and advisory bodies, illustrates the efforts being undertaken
   by China's political elites to integrate microblogs into their new
   public management strategy. Mass protests and large-scale online
   criticismvoiced via microblogsdirectly threaten the regime's survival.
   As a consequence, legitimacy is no longer regarded as being inherent,
   but as something that has instead to be permanently regained and
   reaffirmed. To increase the system's efficiency and to generate a new
   kind of symbolic legitimacy, China's political elites tend to base the
   political decision-making process on strategic calculations intended to
   be reflective of public online opinion. The turn toward a more
   responsive way of governing by the Chinese party-state demonstrates once
   more the adaptability of authoritarian one-party states in the digital
   era.},

Abstract = {States often face immigration control dilemmas between popular pressures
   for tighter immigration controls versus economic pressures for more
   liberal work visa controls. Using a systematic process analysis of
   recent policy developments in Australia, this article argues that the
   Howard government's large expansion of wanted forms of immigration
   hinged upon its ability to control unwanted forms of immigration. The
   concept of control signals is introduced to account for the government's
   success in exiting an immigration control dilemma, which allowed it to
   pursue skilled immigration reforms that would have otherwise proven
   difficult. A research agenda is established for examining the conditions
   under which the use of control signals is likely to be successful and
   for applying the concept to other realms of public policy where states
   face control dilemmas.},

Abstract = {The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is building a
   people-oriented community in Southeast Asia and it has all the hallmarks
   of a Deutschian security community, with its emphasis on
   people-to-people contact and the involvement of civil society
   organisations in the community's creation. In this article the argument
   is made that it is precisely the involvement of the masses that creates
   the peace inertia associated with security communities, and thus ASEAN's
   plural turn is an essential first step in making ASEAN's community a
   security community. Whether ASEAN can actually do this, and indeed
   whether the membership are united in this objective, is not the focus
   for this article. Instead, and contrary to the security community
   literature, which identifies ASEAN as a non-liberal security community
   and has emphasised the practice of self-restraint, this article argues
   that past ASEAN practice has prevented a security community forming in
   Southeast Asia, and using self-restraint as an explanation for why
   security communities create dependable expectations of peaceful change
   for members has resulted in the agency of `community' being neglected.
   Hence, this article argues for the need to bring `community' back.},

Abstract = {In examining the failure of the 2002 peace process between the Sri
   Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), this
   essay argues for the need to go beyond the power dynamics of the local
   actors. The peace process was dismantled and military victory by the Sri
   Lankan government made possible not so much by the Sinhala nationalist
   discourse, which opposed administration of development aid by the LTTE,
   as by the global security discourse associated with geo-strategic
   interests. The EU-led development discourse, which was informed by the
   liberal internationalist ethos, could have facilitated resolution and
   transformation of the conflict. In its place a security-based, realist
   discourse was prioritized in South Asia by the UK and US governments,
   particularly after the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. This was the
   discourse which provided the material basis for the Sinhala nationalists
   to consolidate their power in pursuing a military victory. The post-war
   era is marked by geopoliticization of the human rights discourse,
   deepening the conflict. This essay explores the correlation between the
   liberal peace model, human rights, international relations and
   geopolitics.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {Why do some terrorist groups survive considerably longer than others?
   The literature is just beginning to address this important question in a
   systematic manner. Additionally, and as with most studies of terrorism,
   longevity studies have ignored the possibility of interactions between
   terrorist groups. This article attempts to address these two gaps in the
   literature: the incomplete understanding of terrorist group survival and
   the tendency to assume that terrorist groups act independently. In spite
   of risks associated with cooperation, I argue that it should help
   involved terrorist groups mitigate mobilization concerns. More
   importantly, the impact of cooperation is conditioned by attributes of
   the country in which a terrorist group operates. Using new global data
   on terrorist groups between 1987 and 2005, I show that cooperation has
   the strongest effect on longevity in states where groups should have a
   harder time operatingmore capable states and less democratic states.
   Interestingly, a group's number of relationships is more important than
   to whom the group is connected.},

Abstract = {Between 2002 and 2007, Tsotsil Mayas from San Juan Chamula, Chiapas,
   Mexico, joined the boom of undocumented migration to the United States.
   At the migration's peak, 41 percent of the men 15-34 years of age in a
   sample hamlet of 1,350 had crossed the border, most having borrowed the
   equivalent of US\$1,500-2,000 at 10 percent/month interest to pay for
   the trip. Before most were able to pay back their loans, however, demand
   for their labor declined, finally crashing with the recession of
   2007-2008. The men's prolonged absences, first in the North and then as
   they were forced to depart a second time to try to pay their debts, have
   led to profound changes at home, including the feminization of work and
   shifts in family structure and roles in a community without young men.},

Abstract = {Tourism is regarded as one of Namibia's key economic sectors that can
   diversify the economy and create employment, but due to the apartheid
   legacy the sector is highly dominated by the white minority. Current
   efforts to increase the share of indigenous ownership include Black
   Economic Empowerment (BEE) and Community-Based Tourism (CBT). This
   article analyses the challenges involved in promoting BEE and CBT
   through research material gathered in 16 Namibian tourism enterprises.
   The challenges are related to the prevailing inequality and racial
   prejudices in Namibia, and to the nature of tourism as an economic
   sector that requires special skills and experience.},

Abstract = {Premised on the assumption that depoliticisation is a crucial aspect of
   neo-liberal governmentality, this paper attempts to synergise these two,
   previously disparate, concepts. Borrowing from Foucault's theorisation
   of governmentality and drawing from inclusive definitions of
   politics/the political, this paper argues for a reformulation of our
   understanding of depoliticisation and politicisation. The paper contends
   that depoliticisation is best understood as a technique of governing
   which works to legitimise neo-liberalism as the dominant political
   rationality. As such, we argue that depoliticisation acts as a tool for
   masking the `rolling forward' of the state and the proliferation of new
   forms of neo-liberal governmentality.},

Abstract = {Why do countries deploy nuclear weapons abroad? Since 1945, more than
   twenty states have hosted foreign nuclear weapons on their territory,
   and five countries continue to do so today. These deployments have
   important consequences for international security, yet there is little
   systematic research about the factors that drive them. In this article,
   we develop three broad theoretical frameworks to explain why foreign
   nuclear deployments occur. Using a new data set of foreign nuclear
   deployments between 1945 and 2000, we find that two factors weigh
   heavily in driving these deployments: the protection of allies and the
   projection of military power. Nonproliferation motives, however, appear
   to play little role. The results carry important implications for our
   understanding of the causes of proliferation and the sources of nuclear
   posture.},

Abstract = {Salamon (Salamon, Lester. M. 1995. Partners in public service.
   Baltimore, MD: The John Hopkins Univ. Press) and others have argued that
   government and nonprofit human service organizations work in partnership
   to address poverty, with government funding the efforts of nonprofits
   that provide services to the poor. However, this approach does not
   consider how the racial composition of high-poverty neighborhoods might
   influence governments willingness to support the nonprofit human service
   organizations that locate in them. Using data from a probability sample
   of nonprofit human service organizations in Los Angeles County that were
   surveyed in 2002, I estimate logit models predicting receipt of
   government funding. In neighborhoods with a low percentage of African
   Americans, I find that greater poverty increases the likelihood that the
   organization will receive government funding. As the percentage of
   African Americans increases, however, the relationship between
   government funding and poverty is reversed. Findings suggest that the
   influence of race on the governmentnonprofit partnership in serving poor
   neighborhoods is an important, if overlooked, issue that should take its
   place in scholarship on governmentnonprofit relations and policy
   analysis.},

Abstract = {With some exceptions, scholarship on post-apartheid policing has been
   too preoccupied by continuities with the apartheid era. While this is
   understandable, it has blinded scholars to profound changes. I argue
   that what has changed most since the end of apartheid is the
   relationship between policing and political order. During the late
   apartheid era, the structure and ethos of the South African Police was
   animated by the task of containing an insurgency. In the democratic era,
   policing is increasingly animated by the task of managing conflict in
   the ruling party. The difference is profound and the implications ripple
   right to the edges of the police organization, fashioning the manner in
   which street life is policed and impinging on the functioning and the
   durability of the detective service. The article concludes by arguing
   that instruments used in the past survive only when agents in the
   present find them useful, and that accounts of continuity need to train
   their analytical attention on the politics of the here and now.},

Abstract = {Within the span of three months in 2012/2013, the International Criminal
   Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) handed down three major
   acquittal verdicts: two Croatian Army generals, three members of the
   Kosovo Liberation Army, and a high ranking Serbian army general. This
   article analyzes the political fallout from the acquittals to make three
   principal arguments. First, in the absence of broader transitional
   justice framework in the former Yugoslavia, the ICTY has become the
   principal instrument of both retributive and restorative justice, which
   places undue burdens on an institution with a narrow and technical
   mandate. Second, the ICTY has brought this unrealistic expectation on
   itself by legitimizing its work to hostile domestic publics as a path to
   reconciliation and creation of a historical transcript-promises that a
   court is not equipped to either make or keep. Third, the human rights
   community in the region has relied on the ICTY to be its
   ``forcemultiplier{''} in building transitional justice efforts. This has
   further conflated the role of the international court with homegrown
   transitional justice campaigns and has made the political challenges for
   local efforts much more daunting.},

Abstract = {Recent research examines the influence of trade and capital
   liberalization on states' and private corporations' respect for labor
   rights in developing countries. This literature, however, generally
   overlooks the potential role of development aid on these rights. Herein
   I argue that official development assistance-specifically aid to civil
   society programs and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)-helps improve
   core labor standards. Such aid promotes labor rights through
   strengthening labor organizations, related civil society groups, and
   NGOs and improving their capacity to mobilize and bargain with the state
   and capital. Development aid likewise indirectly promotes respect for
   labor rights through a diffusion process from donor states with superior
   labor rights standards to recipients. I test hypotheses drawn from the
   arguments via quantitative analysis, employing new data on labor rights
   practices as well as disaggregated foreign aid data.},

Abstract = {What impact do international state-building missions have on the
   domestic politics of states they seek to build, and how can we measure
   this impact with confidence? This article seeks to address these
   questions and challenge some existing approaches that often appear to
   assume that state-builders leave lasting legacies rather than
   demonstrating such influence with the use of carefully chosen empirical
   evidence. Too often, domestic conditions that follow in the wake of
   international state-building are assumed to follow as a result of
   international intervention, usually due to insufficient attention to the
   causal processes that link international actions to domestic outcomes.
   The article calls for greater appreciation of the methodological
   challenges to establishing causal inferences regarding the legacies of
   state-building and identifies three qualitative methodological
   strategies-process tracing, counterfactual analysis, and the use of
   control cases-that can be used to improve confidence in causal claims
   about state-building legacies. The article concludes with a case study
   of international state-building in East Timor, highlighting several
   flaws of existing evaluations of the United Nations' role in East Timor
   and identifying the critical role that domestic actors play even in the
   context of authoritative international intervention.},

Abstract = {Militant organizations pursue two common aims: to survive and to achieve
   the goals that define their raison d'etre. Yet, elements that sustain
   the life spans of militant organizations are not necessarily the same
   components that advance the accomplishment of their core, or outcome,
   goals. Further, some organizational practices, such as the use of
   suicide attacks, generate a tradeoff that bolsters survivability while
   detracting from the effective pursuit of outcome goals. This study
   demonstrates that three operating conditions explain variation in the
   duration and achievement of contemporary militant organizations:
   receptiveness to tradeoffs, levels of external support, and the nature
   of adversaries. As such, the unique effects of different operating
   conditions reveal why many militant organizations survive for long
   periods of time but only a few achieve the goals that justify their
   existence.},

   The Challenge of the Implementation Phase},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2014},
Number = {58},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {With a greater frequency, governments have been recognising the
   importance of engaging their citizens and guiding their policies towards
   achieving processes that are more accountable, transparent, effective,
   and efficient. These are the pillars of open government and are the
   principles underlying the Open Government Partnership (OGP) that are
   important for countries to take into account on their policy-making
   processes. Notwithstanding this goal, the success of open government
   initiatives depends on how these processes are carried out. This makes
   reference to the implementation phase that accompanies the elaboration
   of public policies and that is an essential step for governments on
   their purposes of becoming evermore open.
   The studies undertaken by the OECD have focused on how countries create
   effective public services that perform well, and how to promote open and
   transparent governments. Through the studies conducted, the Organization
   has been able to observe the challenges that both member and non-member
   countries face on the field of open government. Reviewing distinct
   national contexts on this matter gives useful insight that contributes
   to the learning process of how to make reforms happen. This objective
   requires building trust, fostering efficiency through innovation, and
   promoting integrity within the public administration.
   By providing a general view of the cases of Brazil, Chile, and Mexico,
   the main goal of this presentation is to shed some light on the possible
   challenges that may arise from open government initiatives and how they
   are dealt with in the Latin American and Caribbean region. This will
   generate an auspicious space to explore the challenges that open
   government policies face in the Latin American context and how countries
   counter them. This will enrich the exchange of experiences and lessons
   learned regarding the implementation of reforms that are consistent with
   the open government approach.},

Abstract = {The U-shaped trajectory of women's parliamentary representation in
   Central and Eastern Europe over the post-communist era has generated
   interest among scholars and non-governmental organizations. One
   particularly interesting case of the recent increase in women's
   parliamentary representation can be found in the Czech Republic. After
   the initial post-communist drop in representation, the proportion of
   female members of parliament (MPs) hovered around 15 percent for nearly
   15 years. However, in the 2010 parliamentary election, something
   happened. After years of little change, the percentage of women MPs
   jumped from 15.5 percent to 22 percent. What caused this increase? Here,
   we conceive the 2010 elections as a natural experiment and discuss the
   primary factors that produced such an increase: the change in preference
   voting rules, activities of non-governmental organizations, and the
   political context surrounding the election. To test the effectiveness of
   these factors, we carry out a multi-method research design based on
   original data. We find that the reduction in the preference vote share
   threshold required to move up the ballot benefitted female candidates
   more than men in the 2010 election.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Volume = {21},

Abstract = {This article explores the European Union's (EU) energy relations with
   Russia through new institutionalist concepts that understand ideas to be
   powerful within policymaking processes, in conferring credibility on
   certain governance norms as well as in contesting existing institutions.
   Explanations of the deterioration in EU-Russia energy relations have
   emphasized divergence in perspectives on energy, and how it should be
   governed, between these actors. Here it is argued that the proliferation
   of different ideas about energy within EU institutions has significant
   implications for this relationship. The paper analyses EU energy policy
   as a whole, including climate policy, and outlines what ideas have been
   influential over policymaking processes and with what consequences.
   Internal ideological differences challenge the dominance and credibility
   of market liberal ideas and policies, the EU's ability to speak with one
   voice in energy and attest to an increasingly complex and contradictory
   EU energy policy.},

Pages = {366-387},
Abstract = {This article is about the roles of Scotland and Norway as political
   units within the British and Danish empires. First, I argue that the
   analytical category of `semi-core' is a useful addition to existing
   relational models of empires and unit positions within them. While
   existing models focus on core periphery dynamics, they cannot cope with
   political units that display elements of both core and periphery. The
   new category of semi-cores better explains imperial dynamics, as I
   illustrate empirically in the second part of the article introducing the
   cases of Scotland and Norway as imperial units. Of importance here is
   how considering Norway as a semi-core sheds new light on the role of
   Norwegian civil servants after independence in 184, and how making the
   parallel with Scotland expands the comparative universe for the new
   Norwegian state in the wake of the dissolution of the Danish Empire.},

Abstract = {Anders Behring Breivik, a lone wolf terrorist, killed 77 people in two
   terrorist attacks in Norway in 2011. This study uses framing theory from
   social movement studies to compare his Manifesto with the rhetoric of
   the anti-Islamic movement that inspired him. The anti-Islamic movement
   has a dual, and sometimes inconsistent, collective action framing. On
   the one hand, they portray Islam as an existential threat to the West
   and a warlike enemy; on the other, they promote peaceful and democratic
   opposition. The potential for radicalization is thus immanent. This case
   study reveals the importance of seeing lone wolf terrorists as acting
   from rhetoric embedded in larger social movements. It further
   demonstrates, in detail, the subtle and complex ways in which political
   narratives rejecting terrorism and political violence still end up
   inspiring such acts.},

Abstract = {What flows between humans when they associate? Since the late eighteenth
   century; the ancient term mimesis has been flanked by an array of
   surrounding terms signifying imitation and contagion. Imitation has been
   sometimes conceptualised as more active than contagion, while a number
   of other phenomena including enthusiasm, possession, mesmerism,
   somnambulism, hypnosis, suggestion, fascination, repetition, compassion,
   influence and depersonalisation have been filling the gulf between
   active imitation and passive contagion, making their distinction
   problematic.},

Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},

Number = {4},
Pages = {328-354},
Abstract = {This article presents a critique of how the dominant paradigms in
   international relations (IR)-neo-realism, neo-liberalism and systemic
   constructivism-approach and explain ethnic conflict. It deconstructs one
   of the most prominent explanatory frameworks that mainstream IR has
   contributed to the analysis of the internationalization of ethnic
   conflicts, the ethnic alliance model, and demonstrates theoretically and
   empirically, by way of a case study of the Kurdistan Workers' Party
   sanctuary in Iraqi Kurdistan, the epistemological and ontological
   deficiencies of this approach. Furthermore, by dissecting the inherent
   `groupism' of this model and related frameworks, it problematizes how
   scholars as co-protagonists of ethnic conflicts substantialize and reify
   the ethnicized discourse and politics of ethnic division, and thus
   contribute to the construction of a normativist and essentialist
   `reality' of the conflicts that they set out to describe.},

Abstract = {The international community is in disarray: Somali pirates are
   terrorizing international seafarers, holding crews to ransom and
   prompting a military response. Yet, piracy and maritime violence are
   concepts of considerable historical specificity contributing to a deeper
   understanding of the power knowledge relationships realized through
   piracy and anti-piracy. The application of Foucauldian genealogy is
   required to detect and identify the discontinuities and struggles
   inherent in the making of history. With its point of departure in the
   case of Sir Francis Drake, the paper traces the pirate, the privateer
   and the Royal Navy in the case of Britain, exploring their discursive
   conflicts and overlaps with the state and each other. It is demonstrated
   that piracy and antipiracy responses are largely conditioned by the
   contemporary modes of government, illustrating three major
   discontinuities that condition four distinguishable configurations of
   the space of maritime violence.},

Abstract = {Lone-wolf terrorism is a threat to the security of modern society, as
   was tragically shown in Norway on July 22, 2011, when Anders Behring
   Breivik carried out two terrorist attacks that resulted in a total of 77
   deaths. Since lone wolves are acting on their own, information about
   them cannot be collected using traditional police methods such as
   infiltration or wiretapping. One way to attempt to discover them before
   it is too late is to search for various weak signals on the Internet,
   such as digital traces left in extremist web forums. With the right
   tools and techniques, such traces can be collected and analyzed. In this
   work, we focus on tools and techniques that can be used to detect weak
   signals in the form of linguistic markers for potential lone wolf
   terrorism.},

Abstract = {This chapter discusses whether the war on al Qaeda and terrorism
   generally is part of an armed conflict or better addressed through law
   enforcement mechanisms. It then dissects the laws of war (jus ad helium)
   regarding self-defense, host state consent, and UN Security Council
   authorization, and the laws in war (jus in hello) standards on drones as
   a weapon system, distinction between civilian and combatant, military
   necessity and signature strikes, proportionality, responsibility, and
   due process. It also introduces suggestions that human rights norms or
   domestic law bind state behavior regarding targeted killing Ultimately,
   strikes against some non-state actors in non-combat zones fall afoul of
   international law, though the U.S. government argues that targeted
   killing with drones fully complies with all applicable laws.},

   Chinese stance in relation to the negotiations for the redefinitions of
   the International Order and the International System (and, hence, Global
   Governance) and, secondly, seeks to perceive the reactions of
   non-developed and developed countries in relation to Chinese strategies.},

Abstract = {Las Colinas, a rural region of northwestern Ecuador, is considered a
   lawless frontier. Violence against women is common, in part because of
   its perceived legitimacy. Since 2000, various nongovernmental
   organizations have conducted workshops on women's rights, producing
   contradictory effects on social relations and rates of violence.
   Understandings and manifestations of gender violence are changing as
   transnational human rights discourses enter Las Colinas and local women
   and men learn about human rights and gain access to state-based justice.
   Human rights and improved access to justice offer powerful openings for
   women and families, but their empowering potential is limited by growing
   social and economic vulnerability and discrepancies between rights-based
   subjectivities and preexisting understandings of the self.},

Abstract = {The Ayoreo populations occupy territories stretching from the east of
   Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, to the north of Paraguay. It includes
   4000 speakers in Bolivia and approximately 2600 in Paraguay; the
   vitality of the language is high (Fabre 2007).
   The information shown and analyzed here was obtained from field-works
   conducted during 2011 and 2012 in the community of Campo Loro,
   Department of Boqueron, Paraguay. While contact between Ayoreo people,
   or at least groups that were speaking what is now called Old Zamuco, and
   cojiione (white people) has been witnessed since the eighteenth century,
   the community in which this research was conducted was contacted very
   recently, between 1960 and 1980.
   In this article, we will try to characterize the sociolinguistic profile
   of Ayoreo people and account for the history of successive contacts,
   forced mostly with foreign groups to arrive at the current situation in
   the community of Campo Loro. In particular, we will try to present
   information},

Title = {Neoliberal environmental justice: mainstream ideas of justice in
   political conflict over agricultural pesticides in the United States},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Pages = {650-669},
Abstract = {Numerous scholars have used political philosophy to characterise the US
   environmental justice (EJ) movement's conception of justice. I build
   upon that work by identifying and critically evaluating the ideas of
   justice that manifest in mainstream (non-EJ) environmental politics. I
   do so through a comparative analysis of two groups of activists
   concerned with the threats posed by pesticides to human health in
   California. Mainstream agri-environmental activists' narratives and
   practices evince libertarian and communitarian ideas of justice that
   support the neoliberalisation of an already compromised regulatory
   system, as they motivate and legitimise policies, practices, and
   discourses that undermine the state's environmental protections and
   shift environmental responsibility to individuals. In contrast,
   California's EJ activists, like the broader EJ movement, marshal a
   pluralist notion of justice as distribution, recognition, participation,
   and capabilities, which rejects the neoliberal project and explicitly
   criticises the social inequalities and relations of oppression that help
   produce environmental inequalities.},

Title = {Beliefs About the Strauss-Kahn Case in France and Germany: Political
   Orientation and Sexual Aggression Myths as Local Versus Global
   Predictors},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {In May 2011, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary
   Fund and a prominent member of the French Socialist Party, was charged
   with attempted rape. Extensive media coverage led people across the
   globe to speculate about intentions and responsibilities. While the case
   was pending, we conducted two parallel Internet surveys, with French and
   German participants (N = 1,314). We examined how strongly exoneration of
   the alleged perpetrator depended on acceptance of modern myths about
   sexual aggression (AMMSA) and identity attributes that are temporarily
   salient as a function of local context (gender, political left-right
   orientation, nationality). AMMSA was a global predictor of exonerating
   the alleged perpetrator across national sub-samples, whereas the
   predictive power of gender and left-right orientation varied locally:
   For French respondents, left-wing political attitudes predicted
   exoneration of the alleged perpetrator, whereas only for German
   respondents, being male predicted exoneration. We conclude that the
   interplay of global (sexual aggression myths) and local (social

Abstract = {The creation of the European External Action Service (EEAS) has a
   significant impact not only on European foreign policy-making, but also,
   more widely, on the transformation of the European political order, and
   represents a further step in the evolution of a European administrative
   space. Analysing the EEAS as an instance of European administrative
   space will inform on the shape of the Euro-polity, in that more
   independent European administrative capacities in area of core
   state-powers could be interpreted as an indicator for a shift of the
   EU's political order. Based on direct observation, document analysis and
   expert interviews with EEAS officials, the paper presents a first
   overview of the outcomes of this capacity-building exercise, suggests a
   comprehensive conceptual framework for analysis and concludes that the
   EEAS can be seen as an instance of the European administrative space.},

Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {493-512},
Abstract = {The culture of corruption has grown roots in Kenyan society at large and
   become endemic. Institutions, which were designed for the regulation of
   the relationships between citizens and the State, are being used instead
   for the personal enrichment of public officials (politicians and
   bureaucrats) and other corrupt private agents (individuals, groups, and
   businesses). Corruption persists in Kenya primarily because there are
   people in power who benefit from it and the existing governance
   institutions lack both the will and capacity to stop them from doing so.
   This work takes a governance and development perspective to analytically
   examine the causes and consequences of corruption in Kenya. It
   identifies the key factors (such as absence of strong and effective
   democratic institutions, centralised power, lack of public
   accountability, and impunity) and synthesises and analyses available
   data, indicators, and other information in that regard.},

Title = {Partisan-motivated prorogation and the Westminster model: a comparative
   perspective},
Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {455-472},
Abstract = {Recent cases of partisan-motivated prorogations of parliaments at the
   federal and provincial levels in Canada have focused attention on this
   phenomenon. While such prorogations are uncommon in the mature
   Westminster-style parliaments, the Canadian cases are not unique.
   Systematic study of partisan-motivated prorogations in the Australian
   states has illuminated the factors commonly associated with such cases.
   This paper outlines the results of this literature and then tests
   whether the Canadian cases fit the pattern. It shows that, on balance,
   these factors do apply. The paper thus concludes that, while
   partisanmotivated prorogations may not be predictable, it is possible to
   identify circumstances in which there is a substantially greater risk of
   their occurrence.},

Abstract = {This contribution examines the co-ordination mechanisms which central
   governments have established to develop positions and cast votes in
   negotiations in the European Union (EU). Conceptually, the contribution
   discusses how different traits of EU co-ordination mechanisms can be
   defined and measured. Empirically, it utilizes a novel data set to map
   the defined traits of the co-ordination mechanisms in EU-28.
   Analytically, the contribution demonstrates that some of the variation
   in the traits of the EU co-ordination mechanisms is connected to public
   Euroscepticism. Therefore the analysis supports studies that have argued
   that a sceptical attitude towards European integration is associated
   with more centralized co-ordination mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Despite two decades of democratisation and some recent liberalisation in
   North Africa, dictatorships linger around the world. New research on
   comparative authoritarianism questions personal rule and studies a range
   of dependent variables, such as why dictators sometimes provide public
   goods. This `analytic authoritarian' literature emphasises collective
   governance and explores the institutional basis of policy control.
   Nigeria's military regimes between 1966 and 1998 provide examples of how
   military factions and subnational actors can impose transaction costs on
   authoritarian policy processes. These alternative centres of policy
   control limited the ability of dictators to unilaterally advance their
   policy preferences on questions relating to federalism and transition
   plans. The article concludes by linking this analysis to Nigeria's
   lingering legacies of authoritarianism and the institutional basis of
   its 1999 transition.},

Abstract = {The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) is a long-standing regional party in
   the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu and in common with many parties it
   has an elite segment that is highly influential. The authors identify
   and analyse the social composition of the DMK elite at the time of the
   2011 assembly election. They argue that the DMK elite need to be
   understood as a group that is constituted by a set of formal and
   informal institutional rules. They consider the extent to which family
   connections or `dynastic ties' alongside other informal rules govern
   admission to the party elite. They ask to what extent the party elite
   are drawn from society in general or if the elite are skewed towards a
   socially privileged segment of Tamil society. This paper disaggregates
   the party elite in terms of caste, gender and religion. They find that
   the wider DMK elite of the legislative party bear some microcosmic
   resemblance to Tamil society but that the elite are segmented so this
   resemblance is very partial at the more senior levels of the party. They
   also find that the party has a workable structure and a degree of
   internal pluralism that is not consistent with claims made in the
   general literature that parties in India are institutionally weak.},

Abstract = {After the transfer of the Portuguese administration to China, Macau kept
   its role as a bridge between East and West, inspired in the Portuguese
   settlement 500 years ago. The pragmatism of the Chinese central
   government, using the Lusophone specificities of this Special

Abstract = {This study examined whether Gormley's insights about the effects of
   public salience and technical complexity on the patterns of
   participation in the regulatory process have explanatory power in an
   international setting. Specifically, I tracked 60 legislative proposals
   initiated by the European Commission and estimated the change made by
   the supranational technocrats in response to the requests of subnational
   politicians. I found support for the theoretical propositions about the
   differentiated effect of salience and complexity on political and
   administrative actors. Consistent with the notion of bureaucratic
   expertise, the Commission is less responsive when the policy issues
   require expertise to be tackled efficiently. Although the European Union
   has been pursuing various mechanisms to democratize its policy process,
   the technical character of supranational regulation precludes the
   broader public and elected politicians from assuming a larger role and
   bureaucracy will continue to be a major player in the international
   arena.},

Abstract = {While both the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) include
   labor standards in their preferential trade agreements (PTAs), they
   pursue different approaches in enforcing these standards. The US relies
   on coercion while the EU prefers a softer, no-sanctions approach. Are
   both effective in improving labor rights in partner states and what are
   the mechanisms leading to this improvement? Recent evidence suggests
   there is a positive ex ante effect of US labor provisions as PTA
   partners improve their labor conditions prior to signing an agreement to
   satisfy the US constituent preferences. Building on this scholarship, we
   argue that the effect of EU standards will also be positive but
   exhibited ex post as a result of learning by civil society actors during
   the implementation phase of labor provisions. We test and confirm this
   argument by estimating an ordered probit of the protection of labor
   rights in EU trade partners before and after signing a PTA.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the heterogeneity of the ``emerging economies{''}
   and their different modes of development. It analyzes the new
   international division of labor that has arisen as a result of the
   emergence, strong growth and rapid industrialization of many Asian

Abstract = {Previous studies examined various aspects of Huntington's controversial
   `clash of civilizations' thesis. This study aims to quantitatively
   explore the theory to understand whether civilizational ethnoreligious
   minorities, i.e. ethnoreligious minorities that belong to a different
   civilization than the majority, face religious discrimination more than
   non-civilizational ones, especially in Western and Islamic
   civilizations. Analysis shows that non-civilizational minorities are
   discriminated against more than civilizational minorities. Findings also
   suggest that while civilizational minorities are discriminated against
   less compared to non-civilizational ones in Islamic civilizations,
   Western civilizations discriminate against civilizational minorities
   more compared to non-civilizational minorities.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the many factors that caused the process of
   transitional justice in Mexico to result in impunity. It examines the
   historical development of the process of transitional justice since the
   creation of the Special Prosecutor's Office in 2001 until it was closed
   down in 2006. The guiding question in this paper is: what factors
   allowed this process of transitional justice to protect rather than
   punish perpetrators of past crimes in Mexico?},

Abstract = {There has been extensive research into the extent to which voters
   utilise short cuts based on gender and race stereotypes when evaluating
   candidates, but relatively little is known about how they respond to
   other background characteristics. We compare the impact of candidates'
   sex, religion, age, education, occupation and location/residence through
   a survey experiment in which respondents rate two candidates based on
   short biographies. We find small differences in the ratings of
   candidates in response to sex, religion, age and education cues but more
   sizeable effects are apparent for the candidate's occupation and place
   of residence. Even once we introduce a control for political party into
   our experimental scenarios the effect of candidate's place of residence
   continues to have a sizeable impact on candidate evaluations. Our
   research suggests that students of electoral behaviour should pay
   attention to a wider range of candidate cues.},

Title = {Social Protection and Satisfaction with Democracy: a Multi-level
   Analysis},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {62},
Number = {4},
Pages = {784-803},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The aim of this article is to examine the link between the quality of
   social protection and citizens' satisfaction with the functioning of
   democracy - an association that has received very limited attention in
   the rich body of empirical research on popular satisfaction with
   democracy. To test the hypothesis that social protection levels
   influence citizens' satisfaction with democracy, the article conducts a
   multi-level regression analysis using European Social Survey (2008/9)
   data from 24 countries. The results of the analysis demonstrate that
   between-country differences are linked to variation in social protection
   levels, and within-country differences depend on individual satisfaction
   with social provision, while controlling for other relevant factors. The
   findings indicate that people do expect democratic regimes to provide
   social protection along with economic performance and thus suggest that
   democratic governments face a challenge in meeting simultaneous demands
   for social protection and economic prosperity. Altogether, the study
   contributes to debates about the implications of welfare policies and
   citizen satisfaction with regime performance.},

Abstract = {This research note draws on a new survey to reveal a widespread
   willingness among current Conservative Party members in Britain to
   countenance voting for the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) at
   future general elections. Those most likely to do so are cultural
   conservatives, but they are not overly right-wing on the distributional
   dimension of politics. They are particularly concerned about immigration
   and the European Union, do not feel valued or respected by their own
   leadership and even regard David Cameron - their own party leader and
   the country's prime mnister - as ideologically more remote from them
   than UKIP. This serves to illustrate some of the strategic dilemmas
   facing centre-right parties confronted by populist right challengers.},

Abstract = {Emotions are a ubiquitous intersubjective element of world politics.
   Yet, passions are often treated as fleeting, private, reactive, and not
   amenable to systematic analysis. Institutionalization links the private
   and individual to the collective and political. Passions may become
   enduring through institutionalization, and thus, as much as
   characterizing private reactions to external phenomena, emotions
   structure the social world. To illustrate this argument, I describe how
   fear and empathy may be institutionalized, discuss the relationship
   between these emotions, and suggest how empathy may be both a mirror and
   potential antidote to individual and institutionalized fear.},

Title = {Small states: Survival and proliferation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {51},
Number = {6},
Pages = {709-728},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {How can the wide fluctuations in the number of small states over the
   past 350 years be explained? Rejecting the notion that the deaths of
   over 150 states can be properly explained by poor statecraft,
   incompetent leadership or major faults in foreign policy decision making
   of small states, the article claims that vast numbers of state deaths
   and large-scale state creation are most properly explained at the system
   level. An argument is developed that describes small state death and
   proliferation as heavily impacted by the state system. By investigating
   the core operating principles of the international state system since
   1648 in light of their impact on the survivability of small states, the
   argument emerges that larger rates of survival and proliferation of
   small states are shaped by broad systemic factors. The article
   contributes a new facet to the study of the small state and offers a new
   and general explanation of small state death, creation and
   proliferation. The findings also challenge International Relation
   Theory's traditional focus on great powers. It is suggested that the
   study of the major structuring actors in international politics may be
   complimented fruitfully by better understanding the system's impact on
   weak and small states.},

Abstract = {In this article, we argue that the Cultural Theory pioneered by Mary
   Douglas can help resolve two pressing issues in the study and practice
   of public deliberation. The first of these issues concerns how best to
   structure deliberative processes (or minipublics) that have increasingly
   been implemented around the world. We use Cultural Theory's analysis of
   social relations to derive a hypothesis concerning the ideal design of
   minipublics, and outline research strategies to test the hypothesis. The
   second issue pertains to scaling out minipublics. We describe John
   Dryzek's and Simon Niemeyer's influential proposal for deploying
   discourses to make public deliberation more representative, and discuss
   the limits of their proposal. Furthermore, we show how Cultural Theory's
   analysis of people's cultural biases (i.e., collectively shared
   perceptions, beliefs and norms) may help overcome these limits and how
   the design of minipublics can generate trust in and legitimacy of public
   deliberation.},

Abstract = {Most IOs have been created on the premise that all sovereign states are
   formally equal. The United Nations General Assembly is no exception, as
   it relies on the one-state, one-vote rule when it comes to decision
   making. However, the equalizing effect of UNGA institutions is limited
   as not all states use their formal rights equally. Why does a state not
   exercise its sovereign equality through the act of participating in IO
   voting? Why are some states more often absent than others? This
   demonstrates that shortages in political, staff and ideational
   capacities, as well as budgetary limitations can prevent states from
   expressing their sovereignty through participating in IO voting, even if
   they would be willing to do so. In addition, absenteeism can also be
   strategic in nature, as smaller states tend to prioritize and focus on
   fewer UNGA resolutions.},

Number = {142},

Abstract = {This paper shows the relationship between regime and dependency
   theories. Its central argument is that international regimes primarily
   serve the accumulation interests of metropolitan capitalism, and hence
   perpetuate dependency. Using the case of the apparel industry in
   sub-Saharan Africa, it brings to the fore both the dependency and
   struggle in international regimes that mainstream regime theory masks.
   The paper concludes that, in its struggle to embed industry, Africa will
   need to clearly interpret the parameters of a more complex international
   political economy than that described in the classic dependency
   literature of the 1970s, and respond to them with cleverness and
   alacrity.},

Abstract = {The American embrace of ``targeted killing{''} outside traditional
   theaters of war has proved highly contentious in recent years. According
   to detractors, the practice constitutes unlawful political murder or
   assassination. In contrast, proponents suggest the United States is
   engaged in a transnational, noninternational armed conflict with Al
   Qaeda and is thus permitted to kill enemy belligerents. This article
   demonstrates that arguments in favor of targeted killing are emblematic
   of the ``Global War on Terror{''} to date, which has sought to limit the
   application of human rights rules in favor of a war paradigm, to expand
   the meaning of combatancy, and to erode the geographical borders of
   armed conflict. These dynamics highlight a critical paradox at the heart
   of US counterterrorism policy. The more legality is strategically
   invoked to legitimize security practices, the less able it is to
   substantively limit state violence and to protect human rights.},

   historical evolution, the social context, refugees moved into in the
   host countries, and the characteristics and interests that have impacted
   on policies for dealing with the refugees in Pakistan and Iran. The
   repatriation program made progress during the first five years of the
   post-Taliban transition, but has stalled ever since. The new strategy
   adopted at the 2012 Geneva Conference intends to reactivate the project,
   but faces numerous obstacles. Finally, the article analyzes how
   political variables in Afghanistan after 2014 may affect the process.},

Abstract = {Why do some terrorist organizations, but not others, adopt suicide
   bombing as a tactic? Dominant accounts focusing on organizational
   capacity, ideology, and efficacy leave certain elements of the
   phenomenon unexplained. The authors argue that a key factor that
   influences whether a terrorist organization does or does not adopt
   suicide terrorism is cultural resonance. This is the idea that deep and
   specific cultural logics, which transcend religion and nationalism,
   enable and constrain the sorts of instrumental behaviors that can be
   utilized in the pursuit of group goals. The article investigates the
   role of a well-established cultural orientation of collectivism, which
   enables the authors to measure culture systematically. Case studies,
   survey data, and experimental research are used to illustrate that
   collectivism lowers the cost of adoption by facilitating the recruitment
   of attackers and reducing societal backlash against self-sacrifice. The
   authors then test for the relationship between collectivism and
   suicide-bombing adoption using an event history analysis framework,
   finding a strong correlation.},

Abstract = {State-building is a central tenet of many current development efforts.
   This primacy of the state rests on a global normative script that
   emphasizes the role of the modern state in providing collective goods
   and services from security to education to health. We analyze state
   performance in six dimensions of service delivery in a cross-sectional
   sample of more than 150 countries. In addition to exploring the
   explanatory power of statehood, we examine various control variables and
   also analyze whether external actors affect the delivery of collective
   goods and services. The core finding of this article is that there is
   remarkably little evidence of a consistent relationship between
   statehood and service delivery. This result casts doubt on the
   conventional wisdom about the centrality of the state for the provision
   collective goods and services, and suggests that other factors may
   explain the observed variation.},

Abstract = {This article explores the role of domestic factors in international
   organization dysfunction, exemplified by the failure of the Second
   International to agree on a common stance and policy for the prevention
   of the First World War. Focusing on the French and German socialist
   parties, the two most powerful forces in the Second International, it
   assesses how domestic factors, such as differences in the dependency on
   the electorate, internal party structure and party-trade union
   relationships affected the policy preferences of these socialist
   parties. It concludes that these domestic differences were the source of
   discrepancy and lack of orchestrated action among the members of the
   Second International. As a result of these differences, the Second
   International failed to coordinate and produce a binding resolution that
   would commit its members to a uniform action against war, hence
   culminating in international organization dysfunction.},

Abstract = {This article adds to typological research on political violence and
   terrorism. A neglected way in the field, including by theoretical
   research. The goal is to marginalize frequent and divisive dilemmas in
   the field, especially dilemmas about definition and causes of terrorism.
   The proposed typology of political violence is deductive. It avoids two
   weaknesses of current typologies : reliance on a definition of terrorism
   and lack of link between state and non-state violence. The violent
   organization is characterized by three criteria : who, why and how ? It
   integrates time variable to allow dynamic analysis of violent
   organizations.},

Abstract = {In March 2000, land occupations in Zimbabwe intensified, forcing the
   government to implement the Fast Track Land Reform Programme, which
   significantly altered the agrarian structure of the country. Ever since,
   there have been widespread misconceptions about the nature and character
   of the land occupations and the identities of new land beneficiaries.
   Using survey data and in-depth interviews from 166 newly resettled
   households, this article shows the majority were `ordinary' poor and
   near-landless people from communal and other rural areas. While there is
   some significant variation within and between new communities, they are
   far from what we might call `elites'.},

Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {41},
Number = {5},
Pages = {110-128},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Brazilian retail sector has been experiencing a dynamic involving,
   on the one hand, a strong approximation toward the financial
   institutions and, on the other hand, an intense concentration process,
   foreign capital participation, initial public offers, and business
   operations internationalization, boosting the retail financialization
   environment. This paper explores this dynamic by focusing on the
   organizational impacts resulting from the diffusion of a financial logic
   on Brazilian financial retail field construction, gathering together
   different actors struggling to define the field's rules. The paper uses
   secondary sources as well as 57 interviews with employees from the
   country's 19 largest retail stores about their work transformation.
   Interesting insights ranging from embarrassment stemming from the
   failure to fulfill goals, retail workers' rights (being legally
   considered banking workers), to the use of slave labor by multinational
   fashion supply chains are garnered. All of these elements connected
   underpin the Brazilian Financial Retail field.},

   COMPETITION?},

Abstract = {Privatization has spread around the globe. While a number of studies
   find empirical evidence for the diffusion of privatization, it remains
   unclear what the relevant linkages between states are. This article
   analyses whether it is economic competition or political affinity that
   influences the diffusion of privatizing public utilities. The sample
   includes telecommunications, postal, and railway providers as the main
   network-based utilities operating at the national level in 15 European
   countries from 1980 until 2007. The results of the spatial regressions
   clearly show that governments follow each other for economic reasons.
   Trading partners strategically interact when privatizing their national
   public-utility providers to form strategic cross-border company
   alliances and to avoid competitive disadvantages in the global market.
   This applies particularly to economies that are highly integrated in the
   international market. Surprisingly, political and ideological
   similarities do not seem to matter for the diffusion of privatization.},

Abstract = {Cameron's flagship policy of the `Big Society' rests on a
   society/government dichotomy, diagnosing a `broken society' caused by
   `big government' having assumed the role communities once played. The
   remedy is greater social responsibility and the `Big Society'. This
   article argues that the dichotomy is deceptive. We aim to show that the
   Big Society is big government, as it employs techniques for managing the
   conduct of individuals and communities such that the mentality of
   government, far from being removed or reduced, is bettered and made more
   efficient. To illustrate this, we explore two major initiatives: the
   National Citizen Service and the Community Resilience programme. These
   projects demonstrate how practices of informing and guiding the conduct
   of individuals both produce agents and normalise certain values,
   resulting in the population being better known and controlled. Thus, far
   from lessening government and empowering people, the Big Society extends
   governmentality throughout the social body.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the agenda leadership capability of two
   American political institutions, Congress and the presidency, in an
   array of issue areas that include both domestic and foreign policy. The
   president has long been considered to have the most significant role in
   setting the policymaking agenda, but there is limited empirical research
   to support that claim. Examining the issue areas of defense,
   environment, health care, international affairs, law and crime, and
   macroeconomics from 1956 to 2005, we find statistically significant
   positive influence by the president on the congressional agenda in all
   six of the policy areas under examination, providing compelling evidence
   of presidential agenda leadership and a reactive Congress. Additionally,
   we find that the agenda relationship between the president and Congress
   is issue dependent, in that presidential attention has the largest
   substantive effect on the congressional agenda in the area of
   international affairs.},

   South China Sea territorial disputes. In view of the exacerbating
   ``China threat{''} perception, Chinese leaders attempt to maintain a
   balance: while building a modern navy, China avoids its deployment in
   maritime law enforcement and the handling of minor territorial
   conflicts. Efforts have also been made to de-escalate such conflicts
   while establishing a deterrence effect. Given such context, the recent
   Sino-Filipino conflict over the Scarborough Shoal is now presented as a
   model of the way China asserts its sovereignty claims in territorial
   disputes. This article considers Chinese foreign policy from a
   traditional realism approach based on content analysis of existing
   documents, literature and interviews of Chinese academics in the field.
   It observes how China's neighbours remain suspicious of Beijing's
   intentions. It concludes that China's relations with ASEAN have been
   adversely affected by the recent confrontation, demonstrating its
   problem of maintaining a balance in the pursuit of multiple foreign
   policy objectives.},

Abstract = {Collaboration is commonly used to deliver public services that reach
   beyond the individual capacities of independent organizations. Although
   much of the literature in the fields of collaborative governance has
   offered theoretical insights to explain how stakeholders might initially
   enter into collaborative processes or how the design of collaborative
   processes can support continued stakeholder participation over time, the
   literature has not effectively studied what factors might drive actors
   to engage one another in a particular conversation or discussion during
   a collaborative process, nor what factors affect whether engagement is
   cooperative or conflictual. We fill this gap through a more
   ``micro-level{''} view of collaborative engagement in a study of the
   South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force, a collaborative
   arrangement involving representatives from 14 federal, tribal, state,
   and local agencies, charged with advising and coordinating the efforts
   in South Florida to restore and recover the Florida Everglades. We use
   data from coded meeting minutes of discussions among the participants in
   the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Program Task Force over a 5-year
   time frame and demonstrate that the types of issues under discussion and
   the actors involved in discussion can either foster or inhibit
   engagement and conflict during dialogue. Our results have important
   implications for the development of a stronger theory of collaborative
   engagement in interorganizational partnerships.},

Abstract = {Successive UK governments have sought to increase financial inclusion by

   union movement to the government's latest modernisation and expansion
   proposals reveal a conflict over perceptions of the purpose of credit
   unions between those who regard them as a means to provide financial
   services to low income communities, and those who regard them as
   self-help organisations offering an alternative to mainstream financial
   services which should remain independent from government initiatives.
   While this division is not new, it highlights potential limitations to
   the viability of achieving social inclusion through voluntary mutualism.},

Volume = {16},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Following the Tunisian revolution of 2011, Arab countries witnessed
   different degrees of revolutionary diffusion. While some countries
   experienced a process of advanced diffusion, others experienced more
   limited forms of emulation. This paper examines the process of regional
   diffusion that occurred in North Africa during the first half of 2011 to
   show that shifts by local political agents explain these differences.
   Using the rich literature of informational cascades, this paper
   investigates the cases of Algeria, Egypt, Libya, and Morocco to
   demonstrate that in all four countries, local political agents actively
   nourished or hindered the process of revolutionary diffusion that
   followed the Tunisian revolution. In Egypt, the strong involvement of
   upper-middle-class youth traditionally close to the regime signaled to
   the general population the presence of a historical opportunity for
   contestation and helped precipitate the 2011 revolution. The same logic
   occurred in Libya where defections of important senior members of
   Gadhafi's regime signaled to the Libyan population that major local
   actors were also dissatisfied with the leadership of the country. In
   contrast, major actors in Algeria and Morocco refused to mobilize
   against their respective governments, thus depriving nascent local
   demonstrations of both the visibility and the resources necessary for
   the inception of an informational cascade. Without a shift from local
   political agents, the process of regional diffusion came to an abrupt
   end in these two countries.},

Abstract = {This article analyses legitimation processes of NATO's member military
   intervention over Libya in 2011. By using Foucault's methodological
   tools for discourse analysis, our aim is to study discursive structures
   in which the justifications of the operation were inserted. Thus, by
   displacing our analytical focal from argument contents to their
   organization in discursive structures, we suppose that the legitimation
   of the intervention did not rely on precise and delimited arguments, but
   on a network of moving and interdependent justifications.},

Abstract = {The principle of cyclicality in the leading theory of multi-level voting
   - second-order election theory - assumes that simultaneous multi-level
   voting should be congruent and that regional electoral contests should
   have no second-order election effects: regional turnout should not
   decrease, parties in office should not lose support, while opposition,
   small and new parties should not attract more votes. This article tests
   the principle of cyclicality of second-order election theory against a
   set of simultaneous multi-level elections in order to explain why
   second-order election effects rise and fall.},

   2011 death of Osama bin Laden and the advent of the ``Arab Spring{''}
   fed expectations that international jihadism was a spent force, attack
   activity in Europe does not only seem to persist, but as will be shown
   here, the region has actually faced an increase in terrorist plots over
   the past few years.},

Title = {Democracy between Ethnos and Demos: Territorial Identification and
   Political Support in the Baltic States},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Pages = {341-365},

Abstract = {Much of the political science literature suggests that a cohesive
   political community is advantageous-if not a precondition-for a stable
   democracy. Forging a cohesive community is obviously a more complex
   matter in a multi-ethnic setting. This article will consider the
   prospects of building political communities in the Baltic
   countries-three countries that, to various extents, struggle to balance
   ethnic pluralism, nation building, and democracy. The article examines
   the relationship between political community and democracy from a
   theoretical perspective, followed by an outline of the nation-building
   strategies taken by Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania after re-establishing
   independence in the early 1990s. Drawing on survey data, we use
   territorial attachment to tap the sense of political community in the
   three countries. Notably, our figures disclose that most of the
   Russian-speaking minorities in Estonia and Latvia identify themselves as
   ``Russians,{''} and not at all with the country they reside in. This
   suggests that the contested issue of citizenship rights in the two
   countries has not been particularly conducive for creating cohesive
   political communities. We then move to the political regime and set out
   to examine the character of regime support in the three countries. Can
   we envisage solid support for democracy and its institutions in the
   absence of a cohesive political community? As it appears, regime support
   is not contingent on territorial identity. Our data disclose that many
   Baltic inhabitants draw a clear distinction between their own
   experiences with different political systems and what they perceive as
   relevant regime options today.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {159-168},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The policy tools of counterterrorism reflect both the nature of the
   terrorist group in question and the strategies of the actors that engage
   in counterterrorism. Historically governments have perceived terrorism
   primarily as a crime, a threat to the state's security or part of a
   broader political campaign. Accordingly, states have adopted
   counterterrorism policies based on law enforcement, military or
   diplomatic strategies, or a combination of these. While international
   organisations have played a supplementary role in terms of law
   enforcement and diplomacy, NGOs have, until recently, played a much
   smaller role in this field. Over the last couple of decades, however,
   with the rise of `sacred terror' and as many states have accorded more
   weight to the propaganda element in terrorist campaigns, containment
   strategies that aim at managing and marginalising the threat have become
   more prominent. This article explores the increasing role of NGOs in
   this changing context, and suggests that the policy tools of NGOs are
   particularly well suited to combating network-type terrorist groups like
   al-Qa'eda and its franchises because such groups depend on complicit
   society, a convincing narrative and information asymmetry vis-a-vis
   their supporters. Here NGOs have distinct advantages because of their
   potential to credibly challenge terrorist narratives on the ground.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship has called for additional research into the role of
   charismatic authority in terrorist groups and the process of
   radicalization. However, the sociological concepts of charisma and
   charismatic authority are being widely misused in terrorism studies.
   Current radicalization research often indirectly flirts with core
   concepts of charismatic authority, but fails to properly tap into its
   analytical utility. This article proposes to begin addressing this gap
   in knowledge in three ways, with: (1) a synthesis of social scientific
   research on charismatic authority, (2) a critical analysis of how
   charismatic authority is being misused and overlooked in the terrorist
   radicalization literature, and (3) an exploration of challenges and
   opportunities for future research concerning charismatic authority and
   terrorist radicalization.},

Abstract = {A growing literature suggests that nuclear assistance from other
   countries is an important determinant of whether states pursue nuclear
   weapons. Existing work does not consider, however, the most widely
   available source of assistance-the Technical Cooperation (TC) program
   administered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). IAEA
   assistance is an important piece of the nonproliferation regime's
   central bargain: member states enjoy nuclear assistance in exchange for
   agreeing not to seek nuclear weapons. Using a data set of TC projects
   since 1972, we examine whether international nuclear assistance is
   associated with the pursuit of nuclear weapons. We hypothesize that some
   TC assistance reduces the cost of pursuing nuclear weapons, making
   weapons programs more likely. We find that receiving TC related to the
   nuclear fuel cycle is a statistically and substantively significant
   factor in state decisions since 1972 to seek nuclear weapons, with
   important implications for existing theories of nuclear proliferation.},

Title = {ELECTORAL RULES OR ELECTORAL LEVERAGE? Explaining Muslim Representation
   in England},
Journal = {WORLD POLITICS},

Volume = {66},

Pages = {229+},

Abstract = {Immigration has fundamentally altered the ethnic and religious makeup of
   most advanced democracies, but substantial variation is observed in the
   political representation of immigrant-origin minority groups across
   countries and cities. Though existing research has highlighted the role
   of electoral institutions in explaining minority representation, it is
   often difficult to isolate their effects across contexts. Focusing on
   Muslims in England and employing a new data set containing over 42,000
   candidate-level observations, this article explains Muslim candidate
   election and selection. To do this, the author makes use of a rule
   change whereby a subset of localities switched from the use of
   multimember elections to the use of single-member elections. She finds
   that these electoral rules have no significant effect on the share of
   Muslims that gets elected but that they do influence the selection
   process: in a given election, Muslims are half as likely to be selected
   when only one seat is up for election as compared with when three seats
   are in play. Yet parties balance the slate across consecutive
   single-member elections, leading to similar results across systems.
   Further, the more undesirable the seat, the more likely it is to have a
   Muslim on the ticket, but this effect holds only in single-member
   elections, and it reverses as Muslims gain electoral leverage. Overall
   electoral leverage proves crucial: the effect of institutions and the
   potential for institution-based discrimination are conditional on the
   size and concentration of the local Muslim population and the votes it
   can deliver at both the election and the selection stages.},

Abstract = {How do house prices affect variation in school quality and citizen
   satisfaction with education? In this paper, we show that the structure
   of socio-economic inequality produced by the housing market has dramatic
   effects on both citizen's preferences over education and its provision,
   along the lines suggested by scholars in the tradition of Tiebout. In
   particular, growing housing prices permit wealthier individuals to
   `target' education in ways that exclude lower income citizens. Districts
   with higher house prices have higher average academic performance but
   also greater variation in performance and a greater number of schools
   opting out of local authority control. Moreover, in districts with high
   variation in school performance, owners of expensive housing are more
   satisfied with schooling than are non-owners, with the reverse pattern
   obtaining in districts with low academic variation.},

Abstract = {Despite significant gains, the majority of the global population still
   lacks the right to effective judicial remedy for rights violations.
   Scholars have recently considered the possibility that creating a Global
   Court of Human Rights could remedy this problem. This article proceeds
   in three sections. It begins with a discussion of the most prominent
   historical proposal for an International Court of Human Rights,
   underscoring the early recognition that a Global Court of Human Rights
   was needed. The next section assesses the need for the Court by
   reviewing the current human rights enforcement and monitoring
   mechanisms. It then turns to concerns with the creation of a Global
   Court of Human Rights. After considering these arguments, the article
   identifies three key benefits of creating the Court and proposes a
   sketch of a Global Court of Human Rights.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {In this article, we critically discuss the democratic legitimacy of
   deliberative experiments taking place in a transnational setting. We
   argue that while deliberative polls through scientific design may
   enhance equal participation and informed opinion making of selected
   citizens, their representative status as part of a broader constituency
   and as a generator of democratic legitimacy is less clear-cut. To
   illustrate our argument, we analyse the results and organisation of
   Europolis, a transnational deliberative experiment. This is an ideal
   case for analysing the linkage between scientific validity of
   deliberative experiments and democratic legitimacy because it introduces
   variation in terms of constituency and group plurality. By critically
   scrutinising this deliberative event, we provide a first take on
   specifying scope conditions for deliberation, with direct reference to
   the lessons from the experiment, reflection on methodological problems
   and, finally, an attempt to discern ways to move from deliberation to
   will formation in the EU setting.},

Abstract = {Between the 1960s and the 1970s, Brazil and South Korea adopted similar
   strategies of development under authoritarian rule: an import
   substitution industrialisation (IST) programme later replaced by export
   strategies (ES), namely, export promotion (EP) in Brazil and export-led
   growth (EG) in Korea. However, whereas Korea was successful, Brazil
   began the 1980s facing socio-economic crisis because of imbalances in
   external accounts. Through the analysis of institutions, organisations,
   and economic indicators, I conclude that the social-political structure
   (defined as the institutions and organisations within the economic,
   political, and social levels) of each nation shaped differently the
   opportunities given by changes in the organisation of the domestic
   economy and international contexts between 1945 and 1985. The
   social-political institutions, which last longer than organisations,
   come mainly from Portuguese (in the case of Brazil) and Japanese (in the
   case of South Korea) colonisation. Therefore, the impact of historical
   junctures, such as economic transformations influenced by changes at the
   international level, might be restricted to organisations at the
   domestic level as institutions related to pre-industrial periods persist
   and constrain the reach of modernisation.},

Abstract = {Evidence of substantial experimental governance has been found in a
   variety of areas of European Union (EU) governance. However the
   relationship between experimentalism in the EU and global governance
   remains unclear. Is experimentalist governance an advantage or a
   disadvantage for the EU in its interactions with global regulatory
   arrangements? This contribution examines the experimentalist character
   of EU financial governance and its interactions with the International
   Monetary Fund, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the
   International Financial Reporting Standards governance institutions. Our
   analysis suggests that experimentalism provides advantages for the EU in
   areas of global governance that are themselves experimentalist. This
   argument challenges more conventional approaches that view
   bureaucratically centralized power as always necessary for the
   successful promotion of interests and attainment of influence at the
   global level. Since some governance problems require detailed harmonized
   rule implementation at single points in time, we also find that
   experimentalist variation occurs temporally as well as across locations
   or jurisdictions.},

Abstract = {Who determines what ideas matter in reform debates? This contribution
   examines reform proposals from the expert groups that emerged during the
   recent international financial crisis. To do so it follows fractal
   distinctions - distinctions that replicate themselves in subsequent
   iterations - among the reports. Fractal distinctions, such as between
   behaviour' or system' as a reform focus, allow us to locate the object
   of regulation within expert groups, the experts' professional context
   and the politics behind the commissioning of work. Analysing fractal
   distinctions provides a useful way to understand the different stresses
   in reports with and without clear mandates, and the role of important
   members of the policy community in promoting particular reform ideas.
   The contribution finds that differences in ideas emerging from the
   financial reform expert groups reflect nested power relationships in the
   commissioning of work, constituent audiences and reform priorities among
   governing institutions, rather than distinct European' and American'
   ideas.},

Abstract = {Shame campaigns aim to change industry practices by targeting the
   reputational value of individual firms. They occupy a contested
   political space from which they leverage existing inequalities in the
   market to redress political inequalities on the ground. Two such
   campaigns - the No Dirty Gold and Global Finance campaigns - are
   assessed based upon their ability to overcome the limitations of relying
   on markets for leverage and selectively targeting firms directly. While
   activists connect companies' right to profit with social and
   environmental responsibilities, they do not directly tackle
   over-consumption and have done little work to reduce economic
   inequality. However, campaigners work to rectify existing political
   inequalities through their efforts to promote transparency, supply
   educational information, and facilitate inclusive debate amongst
   stakeholders. While shame campaigns reflect many of the inherent
   contradictions of global civil society, activists manage to challenge
   unwanted industry activities by circumventing the state institutions
   that facilitate their imposition.},

Abstract = {The relationship between Greenland and the European Union (EU) can best
   be understood by exploring the development from Danish colonialism to a
   future independent Greenlandic state. In 1985, Greenland became the
   first territory ever to leave the European Economic Community (EEC) when
   it opted for status as an `overseas country or territory'. The manner in
   which Greenland had to follow Denmark into the EEC in 1973 - whereby
   Greenlanders saw control over their fisheries move from distant
   Copenhagen to even-more-distant Brussels - was pivotal for the
   Greenlandic demands for home rule that succeeded in 1979 and made the
   1985 withdrawal possible. On 25 November 2008, a majority of the people
   of Greenland voted in favour of enhanced home rule - `self-government' -
   still within formal Danish sovereignty. Denmark and Greenland alike are
   preparing for a future envisioned as involving climate change, intensive
   raw material extraction, new transportation corridors and new claims to
   sovereignty over the Arctic. Greenland uses this imagined future as a
   way of enhancing its subjectivity, not the least when dealing with the
   EU. This article analyses how the Greenlandic self-understanding as
   being on the way to sovereignty - and the tensions involved - structures
   the triangular relationship between the EU, Greenland and Denmark. The
   article concludes that the visions of sovereign equality might, on the
   one hand, create greater expectations than Greenland will immediately be
   able to live up to - at home and in the EU. On the other hand, the
   representation of the Greenland-EU relationship as one of sovereign
   equality - present and future - might just be able to provoke the
   resources necessary to make the dream come true.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between economic globalization,
   factor mobility, government partisanship, and the relative budgetary
   salience of two different instruments of compensation policies: social
   welfare spending and industrial subsidy provision. While welfare
   spending directly benefits labor, industrial subsidies benefit both
   capital owners and labor along the sectoral line. Based on both factoral
   and sectoral models of trade, we theoretically argue and empirically
   show that governments are more likely to use welfare politics as
   compensation policies if free trade generates class-based interests in
   the society, and subsidy politics if trade openness promotes
   industry-based interests. We also argue that the interactions of the
   three variables are contingent on government partisanship. When
   non-class-based interests are salient as a consequence of trade
   openness, left-wing governments are likely to focus on welfare politics
   while right-wing governments favor provision of subsidies. However, when
   class-based interests are salient, even right-wing governments behave
   similarly to left-wing governments, favoring welfare spending over
   subsidies as the key compensation policy. In the analysis of
   compensation policies in the OECD countries between 1980 and 2001, the
   test results confirm our expectations.},

Abstract = {Decisions in international institutions such as the European Union (EU)
   are often made by consensus, even when it is not required. Tit-for-tat
   exchanges provide an explanation for this phenomenon, as such exchanges
   can help to build up support for agreements states might otherwise not
   have had an incentive to support. Tit-for-tat exchanges are typically
   analyzed as trades of support across agreements. However, we argue that
   the priority of negotiators to further their national and bureaucratic
   interests makes exchanges across micro-level issues within a single
   proposal for agreement more prevalent than exchanges across agreements.
   Using both qualitative and quantitative analyses, we show that such
   within-agreement, rather than cross-agreement, linkages are related to
   an increased likelihood of consensus across an array of different EU
   agreements. To understand consensus in international institutions, more
   broadly, it is therefore necessary to look at the substantive issues at
   stake within each agreement.},

Abstract = {This article offers an analyse of the first conviction by the
   International Criminal Court, which declared Thomas Lubanga Dyilo guilty
   of war crimes (conscripting or enlisting children under the age of
   fifteen) and sentenced him to 14 years' imprisonment. Expected for 10
   years, this decision could have enabled the International Criminal Court
   (icc) to confer meaning to its action in Africa, i.e. to clarify the
   meaning of its repression. Alas, judges have interpreted the rules
   applicable to the sentencing without giving it a clear meaning. Nor
   didactic neither pedagogical, the first sentence is therefore
   unsatisfactory, or at least hard to justify.},

Abstract = {Are constitutional secession rights compatible with democracy in a
   multinational political association? Multinational political
   associations are political formations that allow for multiple and
   parallel projects of national identity promotion, and are more likely
   than other political formations to experience secessionist pressure. One
   argument against incorporating secession rights in a constitution is
   that rights-holders might deploy exit threats in order to strengthen
   their bargaining position. This article argues that opponents of
   secession rights have inflated the case against them. Two potentially
   objectionable forms of exit threat are identified - cynical exit threats
   and exploitative exit threats. Cynical exit threats are (nearly)
   impossible to execute, and the most seriously exploitative exit threats
   can be prevented by a sensitively designed secession clause. However,
   secession rights do facilitate exit threats, and in doing so may
   generate unfair power asymmetries and threaten political stability.
   Since none of the objections to secession rights are decisive, decisions
   about whether to include them in a constitution should be made on the
   basis of their likely effects on democratic solidarity.},

Abstract = {Can endorsement of the ethos of conflict alter psychological effects of
   exposure to political violence? Israelis and Palestinians have been in a
   state of political and military turmoil for decades. We interviewed 781
   Israelis and 1,196 Palestinians living in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and
   East Jerusalem. Using structural equation modeling, we found that among
   those with a weak adherence to ethos of conflict, exposure predicted
   higher levels of hatred. For Israelis with a weak adherence to ethos of
   conflict, exposure predicted higher psychological distress and fear. For
   Palestinians with weaker adherence to ethos of conflict, stronger
   exposure predicted stronger threat perceptions. Israelis and
   Palestinians with a strong adherence to the ethos showed steady and high
   levels of negative emotions and threat, regardless of exposure. These
   results indicate that ethos of conflict is a double-edged sword that
   both protects and protracts the conflict. Although it serves as an
   engine fueling the conflict, it also plays a meaningful role as an
   empowering force for people suffering the psychological burden of an
   ongoing conflict.},

   in recent years. Reflecting the unpredictable characteristics of
   technological innovation, these changes have had an associated impact on
   theories that had long served as an accepted framework for the energy
   industry. Similar to the revolution seen on the supply side of natural
   gas markets over the past decade, somewhat analogous developments are
   now arising on the demand side of the equation. Natural gas offers
   significant advantages relative to current energy consumption given its
   lower global carbon emissions and decrease in local pollution. By
   shifting policy focus towards a cleaner and abundant global resource,
   natural gas offers a means of achieving significant incremental capacity
   that has made a material impact on meeting future energy requirements
   while also incrementally improving the environment.},

Abstract = {Explicit social pressure has been shown to be a powerful motivator of
   prosocial behavior-like voting in elections. In this study, I report the
   findings of a randomized field experiment designed to study the impact
   of more subtle, implicit social-pressure treatments. The results of the
   experiment, conducted in the October 2011 municipal elections in Key
   West, Florida, demonstrate that even subtle, implicit observability cues
   can effectively mobilize citizens to vote, perhaps as much as explicit
   surveillance cues. The findings speak more broadly to our understanding
   of human decision making, and even evolution, and provide fodder for the
   claim that humans are evolutionarily programmed to respond to certain
   stimuli. I interpret the evidence to support the notion that
   evolutionarily charged impulses, like exposure to images that implicitly
   signal the potential for surveillance and observability, are sufficient
   to overcome powerful collective action incentives to free ride.},

Abstract = {Human capital is an important determinant of individual and aggregate
   economic outcomes, and a major input to scientific progress. It has been
   suggested that advances in genomics may open up new avenues to enhance
   human intellectual abilities genetically, complementing environmental
   interventions such as education and nutrition. One way to do this would
   be via embryo selection in the context of in vitro fertilization (IVF).
   In this article, we analyze the feasibility, timescale, and possible
   societal impacts of embryo selection for cognitive enhancement. We find
   that embryo selection, on its own, may have significant (but likely not
   drastic) impacts over the next 50years, though large effects could
   accumulate over multiple generations. However, there is a complementary
   technology - stem cell-derived gametes - which has been making rapid
   progress and which could amplify the impact of embryo selection,
   enabling very large changes if successfully applied to humans.},

Title = {Difficulties of the Approximation of Transparency as a Command and

Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2014},
Number = {58},
Pages = {201+},

Abstract = {Transparency policy can achieve the desired effects as long as there is
   a relationship between the supply of government transparency,
   implementation capacity, and social demand. Transparency is particularly
   important at the level of local governments, because they manage
   policies and programs that have direct effects on the quality of life of
   the population. Since 2007, Chile has a transparency public policy that
   prescribes active transparency, i.e. the provision of certain
   information in the websites of public services.
   In the case of Chile, the implementation of transparency policies has
   experienced difficulties in the municipalities and this study
   investigates the factors that impede the fulfillment of its goals. We
   argue that the difficulties are due to the command and control approach
   of the Chilean policy, where the emphasis is on the type of information
   that should provide municipalities, the lack of attention of various
   factors, including municipal and community contexts, complexities of
   operation of information systems and the social demand for transparency.
   We suggest that the social characteristics and political culture of the
   population are factors that could be influencing the limited results
   of-the policy. Our hypothesis proposes that transparency policies can
   have the desired effect, if there is a relationship between supply,
   implementation capacity and social demand. We conclude that in the phase
   of reformulation would be desirable to overcome the prescriptive command
   and control approach, focusing on the offer, and move towards a more
   comprehensive policy, of two bands, which consider the conditions of
   local contexts and demand.},

Abstract = {This article - based on data that employs interviews conducted with
   British Army personnel - adopts a social theory of learning in order to
   examine how both formal and informal learning systems have affected
   organizational learning within the Army in relation to the
   counter-insurgency campaign in Afghanistan. It argues that while the
   Army has adopted new, or reformed existing, formal learning systems,
   these have not generated a reconceptualization of how to conduct
   counter-insurgency warfare. It, furthermore, argues that while informal
   learning systems have enabled units to improve their pre-deployment
   preparations, these have created adaptation traps that have acted as
   barriers to higher-level learning.},

Abstract = {Prior to the May 2011 federal election, Canada had never really
   experienced an intensely right-wing majority government. Given the basic
   nature of electoral coalition building (which had traditionally required
   that any majority government win large swaths of left-leaning Quebec, as
   well as left-leaning urban centres like Toronto, Vancouver, and
   Montreal), Canadian parliaments had habitually maintained a more-or-less
   moderate and centrist orientation. Since the early 1970s, these
   parliaments had overseen the creation of a relatively far-reaching
   federal environmental regulatory apparatus, which had remained in place
   (and continued to expand in some instances) even as the Canadian state
   took on an increasingly neoliberal complexion. In the wake of the
   Conservative Party's majority victory, however, many feared the birth of
   a new era of anti-environmentalism in Ottawa - one that could
   potentially decimate this legacy of ecological protection. Three years
   into the Conservative government's majority mandate, I consider whether
   or not such fears were well founded.},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-17},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {In the period 2009-2011, Member States discussed whether the EU should
   increase its emissions reduction target for 2020 beyond the existing
   20\%. This discussion has not resulted in any agreement, the different
   actors being deeply divided between those calling for a step-up to a
   higher target (for instance 30\%) and those opposed to any kind of
   increase. The division can be seen as a result of a conflict between
   policy frames. The economic crisis has deepened the division between
   those who see climate-change policy as detrimental to growth and those
   seeing it as beneficial to growth. Whereas the latter group - including
   the UK and DG Climate Action -subscribe to the green growth policy
   frame, the former - including Poland - subscribe to the trade-off policy
   frame'. Many Member States have been internally divided between
   proponents and opponents of a step-up, often with environment ministries
   in the former camp and finance and economics ministries in the latter.},

   because North Korea - one of the most unpredictable and threatening
   nation-states on earth - sits on its border. In coming years, South
   Korea must address important issues such as ballistic missile defense
   (BMD), maintaining and upgrading key systems in its conventional forces,
   reaching a burden-sharing agreement with its key ally (the United
   States) when it comes to the cost of American troops being stationed on
   the Korean Peninsula, and perhaps most importantly, the projected
   disestablishment of Combined Forces Command and the command and control
   relationship that will exist with the United States when that occurs.
   These issues are fiscally expensive and often controversial politically.
   Thus, South Korea's military and the challenges that it must face will
   be very important for security in the region in coming years.},

Abstract = {Based on the literature on the diversity of capitalism (DoC) and legal
   origin (LO), this article examines the role of institutional
   configurations in the uneven development of private equity (PE) in 18
   European countries. The article shows that developed stock markets, the
   ability of limited partners (insurance companies) to invest in LBO funds
   and low employment protection are more important determinants than
   investor protection in the case of LBO investments. However, venture
   capital (VC) investments are found to be positively associated with
   investor protection but also with developed stock markets and favourable
   tax rates for managers. R\&D tax incentives for investee companies are
   found to have a negative impact on VC investments, which are nonetheless
   promoted by public R\&D expenditures. Even if national institutional
   configurations matter in explaining differences, as emphasised by LO and
   DoC, we observe a common trend in PE development and financialisation.},

Abstract = {Understanding the development of Republic of Korea (ROK) seapower is
   central in exploring the evolution and nature of its security
   consciousness. This article aims to examine how the wider East Asian
   maritime sphere has influenced ROK perceptions of its own security and
   how such perceptions have come into conflict with the needs of
   maintaining its deterrent capabilities within the peninsular context. In
   doing so it concludes that for the ROK seapower has been an expression
   of wider engagement and international developing security concerns but
   that it is curtailed and influenced by the realities of the threat from
   the North.},

Journal = {SOUTH EUROPEAN SOCIETY AND POLITICS},

Volume = {19},

Pages = {169-192},
Abstract = {The March 2014 local elections, following the Gezi Park protests and
   allegations of government corruption, registered the highest turnout of
   any Turkish election since 1994. Despite strong resistance from
   conservative and liberal circles, the ruling Justice and Development
   Party (AKP) held onto its constituency without losing much electoral
   support. Its losses were shared among the opposition parties, none of
   which emerged in a strong position to challenge the AKP. The rise of the
   Nationalist Action Party (MHP), which came second in five out of 12
   regions, suggested a change in the intra-opposition dynamics. The
   article presents a geographical and socio-economic analysis of the
   election, finding a significant generation gap. It also examines the
   electoral impact of economic perceptions and allegations of governmental
   graft. The election outcome is expected to shape both government and
   opposition strategies in the forthcoming presidential and parliamentary
   elections, potentially leading to another round of incumbent victories
   and increasing societal polarisation.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions does the internal cohesiveness of the European
   Union (EU) determine its external effectiveness? In a first step, this
   introduction probes the frequent assumption that the more cohesive the
   EU presents itself to the world, the more effective it is in achieving
   its goals. The empirical contributions to this collection, which range
   from trade to foreign policy, highlight instead three configurations of
   internal cohesiveness and external effectiveness: internal cohesiveness
   has a positive impact on external effectiveness; internal cohesiveness
   has no impact on external effectiveness; and internal cohesiveness has a
   negative impact on external effectiveness. The international context in
   which the EU operates, including the bargaining configuration and the
   policy arena, functions as an intervening variable in these causal
   links. In a second step, this introduction launches a research agenda
   aimed at explaining these patterns more systematically and determining
   the impact of cohesiveness on effectiveness.},

Title = {The European Commission's Neoliberal Trade Discourse Since the Crisis:
   Legitimizing Continuity through Subtle Discursive Change},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICS \& INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {149-167},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Research Highlights and Abstract Within the European Union (EU), the
   neoliberal trade policy has not only survived the global financial
   crisis (GFC) and Eurozone crisis, but has been reinforced throughout
   these crises. This has been helped by a legitimizing discourse by the
   European Commission that has continuously depicted free trade in a
   favourable relationship vis-a-vis the GFC and the Eurozone crisis.
   Empirically, this article shows how between 2008 and 2012, the EU trade
   discourse has been subtly adapted to the changing crisis environment:
   from defensive, over offensive-desirable and offensive-necessary towards
   necessary-but-not-sufficient at the time of writing. In the tradition of
   critical discourse analysis, we also point at the problematic
   assumptions and logics held by the discourse. Theoretically, it is shown
   how subtly adapting discourse to a fluctuating context can effectively
   limit policy change and legitimize continuity.
   The crisis starting in 2008 has not led to the demise but to the
   reinforcement of neoliberalism, not least within the European Union
   (EU). We argue that this can also be observed in the EU's external trade
   policy, where the European Commission's discourse has continued to
   legitimize neoliberal trade through subtle re-articulations of the
   relationship between free trade and the crisis. In this respect four
   stages can be discerned: defensive, offensive-desirable,
   offensive-necessary and necessary-but-not-sufficient. These subtle
   adaptations are articulated as coherent with the internal Eurozone
   crisis, although we show that their assumptions can be challenged.
   Theoretically, we engage in a critical analysis of the Commission's
   trade discourse in the context of the crisis. Empirically, we focus on
   the different EU Trade Commissioners' discourses between 2008-2012. The
   article shows how subtly adapting discourse to a fluctuating context can
   effectively limit change and legitimize continuity.},

Title = {South American Re-armament: From Balancing to Symbolizing Power},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {138-162},
Abstract = {Since the year 2000, several South American countries strongly invested
   in armaments. At the same time, they increasingly resorted to diplomacy
   and cooperative institutions to maintain peace. This paper establishes a
   nexus between motivations for re-armament and recent debates on regional
   security governance and the emergence of regional powers. Most
   traditional theories have considered armament to be a function of either
   the perception of external threat or the availability of economic means.
   In contrast, this article contends that the rise in arms spending cannot
   be understood without taking into consideration: (a) the coexistence of
   a stable power balance, security community thinking and practices in
   regional security governance; and (b) the desire of emerging states to
   increase their regional or global roles. This analysis emphasizes
   non-conflict-driven external motives for military procurement as a new
   and vital determinant, largely neglected in previous research on the
   region's military spending. Case studies of three major South American
   spenders, Brazil, Chile and Venezuela, underscore the significance of
   non-conflict-driven external factors in military procurement. Their
   experience shows how emergence of regional powers has the potential to
   offset the contradictions between conventional security logics, as the
   tendency of states to purchase arms for non-conflict-related reasons
   equally supports balance of power and security community thinking.},

Abstract = {Recent theoretical developments suggest that management actions have
   different impacts on outcomes in public and private organizations. This
   proposition is important to public organizations widespread import of
   private sector management tools, such as performance management. This
   article examines how performance management influences performance
   outcomes in otherwise similar public and private organizations. Showing
   that the factors expected to diminish the impact of performance
   management parallel the organizational characteristics of public
   organizations, we hypothesize that this type of management is less
   effective in public organizations. A difference-in-differences model
   based on survey data on management in Danish public and private schools,
   combined with administrative data of students test scores, confirms the
   hypothesis. The results have important implications for the transfer of
   management actions across sectors.},

Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {400-420},
Abstract = {Russian interventions in South Ossetia and Crimea indicate a major shift
   in Moscow's policy towards the former Soviet republics. This article
   compares the two interventions in terms of military performance, basis
   of legitimacy, and motivational goals. This confirms the formation of a
   new and more assertive Russian policy in the region. Although there were
   significant differences between the two interventions, improved Russian
   military capabilities reveal the Kremlin's plans to project power in the
   near abroad. The Russian leadership used similar legal justifications
   for the two interventions, based on the Kosovo precedent, opening the
   possibility of further military action in the former Soviet space.
   Notwithstanding the legal excuse, Moscow mainly intervened in Georgia
   and Ukraine to prevent further NATO enlargement eastwards, regain
   geopolitical influence regionally, and respond to perceptions of
   insecurity and a sense of humiliation. With the possible exception of
   the Baltic States, the rest of the former Soviet republics could, sooner
   or later, fall under Russia's sway. It is a challenge that the West can
   choose to confront either with tougher sanctions and more involvement in
   the region, or by initiating a new process of socializing Russia into
   the international community, with security assurances and economic
   incentives in return for acknowledgement of Russia's role as a great
   power.},

Abstract = {Behaviour change is increasingly central to policy and politics. The
   exemplar of nudge, and its relationship to behavioural economics and
   psychology, is outlined. Nudge's claim to libertarian paternalism is
   evaluated in the context of the neoliberal state. A sociological
   critique of behavioural economic assumptions enables a still wider
   account of shifting state citizen relations. Foucauldian analyses of
   such relations, as well as deliberative `think' perspectives, are
   assessed. A more explicitly political, social-democratic model of the
   behaviour change state is advocated. This would be more attuned to the
   socioeconomic context of behaviour, and also be prepared to defend
   citizens against ubiquitous attempts to shape their subjectivity.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},

Volume = {51},

Pages = {101-123},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Although non-state actors have recently proliferated, many predate the
   modern state system itself. Among these, traditional nomads uniquely
   challenge sovereignty. Nomadism undermines states' capacity to tax,
   conscript and otherwise regulate population. However, nomadism
   constitutes an ideational as well as material threat to states. By
   disrupting states' territorial configuration, nomadism undermines the
   ideational foundations of statehood. States have responded to nomadism
   in three ways. Many forcibly settle nomads. Weak states, unable to
   secure borders, allow nomads to migrate relatively freely. Others
   voluntarily facilitate freer migration by reducing the salience of
   borders. We offer three examples: Bedouins, often forcibly settled;
   African pastoralists, permitted to migrate through porous borders; and
   Roma, permitted to migrate transnationally within the European Union.
   While the Bedouin and African instances suggest a necessary conflict
   between the role of state and the culture of nomadism, the European
   experience suggests border relaxation can permit states and nomads to
   coexist.},

   Disarmament?},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {332-355},
Abstract = {This article attempts to reflect on arms control and disarmament as a
   civilizational practice. The provocation for this undertaking can be
   traced back to the growing popularity of civilization discourses. The
   article highlights the paradoxical tension within these discourses with,
   on the one hand, their proclamations of inter-civilizational conflicts
   based on failure to regulate and prohibit the proliferation of weapons
   and, on the other hand, the teleological drive towards building a
   universal civilization of modernity. It critiques these discourses with
   the help of critical security studies and postcolonial insights into the
   problematique of civilization that seeks to universalize that which
   stabilizes and asserts the military superiority of the West while
   marginalizing the efforts of `the Rest' demanding equality and justice
   in practices of arms control and disarmament. The article then uses
   representative historical narratives to demonstrate the historical
   continuity between practices of discrimination and exclusion that
   persist from the late 19th century to the present with regard to weapons
   regulation and prohibition. Contemporary efforts to acknowledge and
   addresses the entrenched biases in the practices of arms control and
   disarmament are discussed to explicate their possibilities and
   limitations. The purpose is to bring centre-stage the human suffering
   experienced by the West and the Rest in practices of arms control and
   disarmament. It is only by confronting the multitudinous affects through
   a post-civilization approach that the reiterated bravado of civilization
   can be questioned and an empathetic and sincere approach towards
   addressing the problem of weapons regulation and prohibition can be
   cultivated.},

Title = {Creating EU law judges: the role of generational differences, legal

   regarding EU law knowledge},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {21},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1120-1141},
Abstract = {The judicial protection system in the European Union (EU) is premised on
   the fact that national judges are supposed to act as decentralized EU
   judges. This role is exercised through tools enshrined in, inter alia,
   primacy, direct and indirect effect of EU law, and the preliminary
   ruling procedure. However, a number of studies show that national judges
   experience difficulties in exercising EU competences due to their lack
   of knowledge in the field of EU law. In this contribution we study the
   differences in the level of self-evaluation of EU law knowledge among
   judges, which consequently influence the way judges approach EU law. For
   that purpose we question the relevance of several institutional and
   socio-legal factors, such as organization of the judiciary, generation,
   the system of legal education and judicial training and practical
   experience with EU law. Our analysis is based on data collected from
   German, Dutch, Polish and Spanish judges.},

Journal = {SOUTH EUROPEAN SOCIETY AND POLITICS},

Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Pages = {155-167},
Abstract = {The cleavage between the secular centre and the religious-conservative
   periphery has been the most important dividing line in modern Turkish
   politics. In the past, centre-right parties have successfully appealed
   to the peripheral majority, emerging as victors in almost all
   parliamentary elections since 1950. This trend continues with the
   Justice and Development Party (AKP). In power since 2002, winner of
   three consecutive elections with increasing majorities, the AKP
   qualifies as a predominant party. The article focuses on the AKP's
   recent drift towards an excessively majoritarian conception of
   democracy, or even an electoral authoritarianism of a more markedly
   Islamic character. Topics discussed include the Gezi Park events in
   May-June 2013, the conflict with the Gulen movement, corruption charges
   against government ministers, recent legislation weakening judicial
   independence and restricting freedom of expression, and the 30 March
   2014 local elections.},

Abstract = {Since the fall of communism and the transition to democracy all
   East-European states have transitioned to multiparty democracies.
   However, the legal frameworks within which parties function differ
   substantially among countries. Some countries embrace diversity without
   posing obstacles to mobilisation on ethnic grounds, for example, while
   others prohibit the establishment and existence of parties of ethnic
   ideology. Here, we study how Bulgarian parties are regulated through the
   Party Law, the Electoral Law and the Constitution. In particular, we
   look at the requirements for setting up of political parties and the
   type, quantity and allocation mechanisms of public funding and trace the
   effect that these and other factors have had on the development of the
   current party system. Empirically, we examine the fate of small
   political parties. Our main conclusion is that the introduction of
   institutions such as an electoral deposit, considerably decrease the
   number of minor political parties.},

Abstract = {Over the last two decades, the European Parliament (EP) has been
   empowered to make European Union (EU) legislation more inclusive,
   transparent and accountable. Yet, co-legislation has increased
   informalization and seclusion, as an ever-larger proportion of
   legislative acts is pre-agreed between Parliament and Council prior to
   first reading. This article asks under which conditions informalization
   is democratically problematic or tenable. So far, `early agreements'
   have been criticized for their lack of transparency and accountability,
   their challenge to deliberation and inclusiveness, and their
   differential empowerment of `relais actors'. Little attention has been
   paid, however, to the representation of the parliamentary principal in
   trilogues. This article draws on Jane Mansbridge's selection model of
   representation to fill the gap; it argues that representation with a
   strong `selection core' and a weak `sanction periphery' is,
   prudentially, best-suited for bicameral bargaining, and it introduces
   normative standards that make the selection model democratically
   tenable. A close analysis of codecision's current practices and
   institutions shows that these fall short of `good deliberation at
   initial selection' and of `narrative accountability'; `ease of
   maintenance and de-selection' is approximated and `transparency in
   rationale' is strengthened in the EP's 2012 Rules of Procedure. Future
   reform should, therefore, introduce two democratically crucial, yet
   hitherto neglected, measures: open deliberation about the appointment of
   rapporteurs; and reason-giving and justification (in addition to
   reporting back) by trilogue negotiators.},

Abstract = {Extending data reported by Mohammed Hafez in 2007, we compiled a
   database of 1,779 suicide bombers who attempted or completed attacks in
   Iraq from 2003 through 2010. From 2003 through 2006, monthly totals of
   suicide bombers show a pattern different from the pattern of non-suicide
   insurgent attacks, but from 2007 through 2010 the two patterns were
   similar. This biphasic pattern indicates that suicide attacks sometimes
   warrant separate analysis but sometimes are just one tactic in a larger
   envelope of insurgent violence. We also show that only 13 percent of
   suicide bombers targeted coalition forces and international civilians,
   primarily during the early years of the conflict, whereas 83 percent of
   suicide bombers targeted Iraqis (civilians, members of the Anbar
   Awakening Movement, Iraqi security forces, and government entities) in
   attacks that extended throughout the duration of the insurgency. These
   results challenge the idea that suicide attacks are primarily a
   nationalist response to foreign occupation, and caution that smart bombs
   may be more often sent against soft targets than hard targets. More
   generally, our results indicate that suicide attacks must be
   disaggregated by target in order to understand these attacks as the
   expression of different insurgent priorities at different times.},

   eastern Congo},
Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {157-171},
Abstract = {Research on conflict tends to oscillate between two poles: cross-country
   research using statistical regressions to isolate key variables, and
   ethnographic research on single countries. I argue that, while the
   former often fails to capture the political and social dimensions of
   conflict, the latter can suffer from a lack of causal rigour. I
   illustrate this argument in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where
   I suggest a greater focus on the locus and process of the conflict.
   Armed groups have become much more integrated into regional political
   and economic elites over the past two decades, just as the Congolese
   state and army have themselves developed links with armed groups since
   the 2003-06 transition. These dynamics, and not a narrow focus on
   conflict minerals and local violence, should attract greater scrutiny.},

   needs and interests, with negative impacts on women's own and their

Number = {1},

Abstract = {This article develops a theoretical approach to stigma in international
   relations and resituates conventional approaches to the study of norms
   and international order. Correcting the general understanding that
   common values and norms are the building blocks of social order, this
   article claims that international society is in part constructed through
   the stigmatization of `transgressive' and norm-violating states and
   their ways of coping with stigma. Drawing on Erving Goffman, this
   article shows that states are not passive objects of socialization, but
   active agents. Stigmatized states cope strategically with their stigma
   and may, in some cases, challenge and even transform a dominant moral
   discourse. A typology of stigma management strategies is presented:
   stigma recognition (illustrated by Germany); stigma rejection
   (illustrated by Austria); and finally counter-stigmatization
   (illustrated by Cuba). Because of the lack of agreement on what
   constitutes normal state behavior, attempts to impose stigma may even
   have the opposite effectthe stigmatizers become the transgressive. A
   focus on stigma opens up new avenues for research on norms, identities,
   and international order.},

Abstract = {What accounts for the spread of Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs)? Despite
   the increasing importance of SWFs in the global economy, we lack
   persuasive systematic answers to that question. Most analysts take for
   granted that economic imperatives drive the creation of SWFs;
   governments create them as effective solutions to the challenges
   generated by reserve accumulation and commodity-export specialization.
   In this article, I argue that the evidence fails to support this theory.
   Instead, the spread of SWFs best resembles the diffusion of a fashion or
   fad. SWFs became fashionable as an appropriate approach for reserve- and
   resource-rich countries seeking to manage policy uncertainty related to
   these economic characteristics. As other countries developed the same
   characteristics, they followed the lead of their peers and also created
   SWFs. I provide, with the use of a new data set, the first
   cross-national political-economy statistical analysis of SWF creation.
   The results suggest peer group emulation has, indeed, been crucial in
   shaping the decision of many countries to create SWFsespecially in
   fuel-exporting countries.},

Title = {Citizenship in China: a Comparison of Rights with the East and West},

Abstract = {After the economic rise of China with the improvement in their standard
   of living, there have been many changes in the rights of citizens in
   China. This paper provides a broad survey of rights to see how China
   compares with the West and some countries in the Far East. This
   comparison assesses citizenship theory as it might apply to China, and
   then assesses a number of measures of rights. First, in order to make
   comparisons, the very different conceptions and theories of citizenship
   in China must be considered. Chinese citizenship is based on more of a
   communitarian model than a liberal or social democratic approach mainly
   due to Confucianism. Despite considerable improvement in citizenship
   rights, China's reliance on a more communitarian citizenship theory
   (rather than liberal or social democratic theories) tends to emphasize
   obligations over rights. Second, in assessing the level of rights in
   China in the 21st century, T. H. Marshall provides the classification of
   legal, political and social rights. Using Freedom House, Fraser
   Institute and other data, I make cross-national comparisons between
   China and Western countries (e.g., the US, Canada and select European
   countries) and East Asian countries or regions (e.g., Japan, Indonesia,
   South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan). I also include Russia since it has
   made a similar transition from communist rule. The paper argues that
   citizenship rights for Chinese citizens have improved for many legal and
   social rights but not so much for political rights. However, all of
   these rights in China are much lower than in the West and much of East
   Asia, though in a few instances the levels are quite similar to Russia.
   I conclude with an estimate of the possible pathways toward greater
   political rights in China over the next few decades.},

Volume = {34},

Abstract = {This paper examines long-term care insurance sales to assess whether
   state income tax subsidies are effective in encouraging the private
   purchase of long-term care insurance. Drawing from the most
   comprehensive available sales data on long-term care insurance policies,
   cross-state and over-time variation in sales data during the late 1990s
   and early 2000s are analysed. This analysis uses a panel model with
   fixed effects controls for potential endogeneity between state provision
   of tax subsidies and actual sales of long-term care insurance policies.
   Income, health and family support factors are significant determinants
   in the sale of long-term care insurance, but the tax incentives provided
   by many state governments do not induce any more sales of long-term care
   insurance than could be expected without such incentives. These costly
   subsidies have not been prudent uses of public dollars, and have not
   helped states cope with the challenge of long-term care costs.},

Abstract = {This study seeks to examine whether and how a group of Australian local
   government workers' perceptions of two relational job characteristics -
   impact on citizens and contact with citizens - influence the
   relationship between public service motivation (PSM) and job
   satisfaction. Government employees who have strong norms about
   performing public service were found to be more satisfied with their job
   partly based on the extent to which they perceived that their jobs
   provided avenues for worthwhile accomplishment through the frequency,
   magnitude, and scope of job impact. In contrast, the employees'
   perceptions of the frequency and breadth of contact with the recipients
   of their service did not significantly influence PSM, or the association
   between PSM and job satisfaction.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},

Abstract = {Conventional discourse in citizenship studies tend to assume that
   individuals are clearly aware of their rights and this
   rights-consciousness drives them to participate actively. This
   assumption, however, neglects the cases of interest-driven participation
   before the advent of rights-consciousness of the participants. By
   studying the homeowners' collective action in Beijing, this study finds
   that the most direct incentive motivating the homeowners to participate
   in the first place is self-interest rather than strong
   rights-consciousness. Homeowners become actively involved in the process
   of democratic participation well before they have acquired a clear and
   strong sense of rights-consciousness. Nevertheless, despite starting off
   as interest-oriented, homeowners' democratic practices have awakened
   their rights-consciousness and further cultivated a sense of citizenship
   identity. This interest-driven participation has paradoxically helped to
   create the democratic ethic of Chinese urban citizens. It has important
   implications for understanding political participation as well as
   citizenship formation in China.},

Abstract = {Counter-insurgency scholars have long been familiar with Sir Robert
   Thompson's classic work Defeating Communist Insurgency, which combined
   analysis of the insurgencies in Malaya and Vietnam with advice for
   counter-insurgents that emphasised the drawn-out nature of insurgency
   and the importance of focusing on population security. While historians
   have called attention to his role with the British Advisory Mission in
   South Vietnam and his later criticism of the US counter-insurgency
   campaign in Vietnam in his various books, less has been written about
   his subsequent role as a pacification advisor to the Nixon
   administration. This article explores Thompson's relationship with
   Kissinger and Nixon and his views on the war in Vietnam from 1969 to
   1974. An examination of Thompson's thinking on Vietnam in the Nixon
   years reveals a theorist whose optimism on US prospects there was based
   on assumptions about elite and public patience for lengthy wars that
   were ultimately misplaced.},

Abstract = {This article addresses two issues. First, it critiques a prominent
   position regarding how affluent states should balance their national
   interest on the one hand and their duty to aid developing states on the
   other. Second, it suggests that absent a principled way to balance
   national interest with international aid, a state's more immediate
   concern is to comply with its negative duty to not harm other states. To
   support this position, the article constructs a conception of harm that
   may be applied to questions regarding a state's negative duties,
   focusing upon the example of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual
   Property Rights Agreement (TRIPS).},

Abstract = {This article analyses the attitudes of the political elite and voters in
   Greece and Portugal vis-a-vis the Troika bailouts, austerity policies
   and the attribution of responsibilities for the crisis. Using both elite
   and mass surveys with similar questions, the article explores to what
   extent the elites and voters share similar attitudes, what might explain
   possible differences between these two groups and between the two
   countries and what this information can tell us about the quality of
   political representation in Greece and Portugal. The differences between
   the countries are explained mainly by the severity of the crisis and
   austerity policies in each country, but also by the diversity of
   political conditions.},

Title = {Explaining corporate short-termism: self-reinforcing processes and
   biases among investors, the media and corporate managers},
Journal = {SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW},

Volume = {12},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Based on the related literature in economics, organizational sociology
   and the sociology of finance, this article constructs a novel conceptual
   explanation for corporate short-termism, that is, the tendency of
   corporate managers to sacrifice long-term investments to improve
   short-term earnings (STEs). We theorize about how such corporate
   short-termism emerges, at least partly, from systemic, self-reinforcing
   processes across various communities of actors including investors, the
   media and managers themselves. In doing so, we refute the common notion
   that corporate short-termism is caused by an inherent preference of
   investors or other actors to focus on STEs. Consequently, the systemic
   perspective offered by this article questions some conventional
   assumptions about the roots of corporate short-termism and emphasizes
   the influence of coordination mechanisms and behavioural biases in
   giving rise to self-reinforcing loops.},

Abstract = {A growing scholarship on policing and security has produced valuable
   insights into the workings of private security firms, state police, and
   citizen-led policing organizations across Africa. In contrast, few have
   explored ``mob justice{''} -the policing performed by less organized,
   more transient formations of citizens. In academic and popular accounts,
   mobs are depicted as anonymous, sovereign entities, acting in a space
   that the state will not, or cannot, enter. Focusing on the township of
   KwaMashu in Durban, South Africa, this article challenges this
   homogeneous depiction. Although anonymous mobs punctuate the township's
   history, residents often find themselves within ``intimate crowds{''},
   navigating the ties that frequently bind them to their suspects, and
   negotiating a space in which they can act without fear of repercussion,
   legal or otherwise. The state police often play an important role in
   shaping the parameters of this policing, even when no case is formally
   opened. This reappraisal of policing formations consolidates and extends
   our understanding of statehood, society, and sovereignty in
   post-apartheid South Africa.},

   South},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2014},
Number = {60},
Pages = {5+},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Notions of the regulatory State have come to stand, in the North, for
   leaching politics out of public administration, particularly from the
   influential policy literature supporting the diffusion of independent
   regulatory agencies. In my address, I will challenge this contention,
   drawing on recent empirical work on the regulatory State in developing
   and emerging economies. I begin by arguing that the governance problems
   that regulation is meant to address should be understood along a
   spectrum from rules to deals. This argument, grounded in empirical work
   carried out in the context of infrastructure and essential services,
   holds that politics is an important and constitutive dimension of the
   story of the rise of the regulatory State. It should be embraced, via a
   conception of regulators, as facilitating legitimate forms of
   negotiation, rather than as neutral rule makers, monitors and enforcers.
   In the second part of the document, I explore the relevance of this
   argument for social rather than economic regulatory issues, and suggest.
   that a particularly fruitful direction for regulatory studies would
   focus on contextualized, interpretive studies of the enforcement and
   compliance dynamics of social regulation, where the centre of analytical
   gravity is the South and its variabilities (rather than using the
   experience of the industrialized North as a universalizing comparative
   benchmark).
   In the third and final part, I engage more directly with the substance
   of political vision often elided in accounts of regulatory governance
   dynamics, and consider the implications of recent developments in Chile
   and Ecuador for the relationship between the regulatory. State and the
   ``post-neoliberal{''} turn in Latin America. This closing section
   exposes some tensions at the heart of ``bringing politics back in{''} to
   debates about the regulatory State, but suggests that these are
   productive tensions that are worth embracing.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article presents a reconstruction of political pluralism derived
   from Joseph Raz's explanation of the authority of law. It argues that
   Harold Laski's critique of state authority, while claiming to be
   pluralistic, leaves little room for the exercise of authority by
   associations themselves. The authority of an association may be
   justified if it facilitates its members' compliance with reasons that
   apply to them, especially reasons that are particular to the members'
   association. This results in the recognition of two types of authority
   in the state: first-order authority, which the state has by virtue of
   being an association of citizens; and second-order authority, which it
   has by virtue of providing the institutional context in which other
   associations can exercise their authority more effectively. The
   resulting image of the state may better acknowledge the variety of
   authoritative claims made by the various associations that effectively
   hold the allegiance of individuals.},

Abstract = {Tax law science has a longstanding tradition in the USA and Western
   Europe. In contrast, Central and Eastern European legal science has only
   recently admitted the independent existence of financial law. Financial
   law, however, is a very broad area of law. This fact will lead to a
   diversification of financial law. The main goal of this article is to
   confirm or refute the hypothesis that tax law is an independent branch
   of law in Central and Eastern European countries, specifically in the
   Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary. For that purpose the
   criteria for being considered an independent branch of law are analyzed,
   namely: separate and specific object of legal regulation, method of
   legal regulation, system and system coherence of legal norms, and social
   acceptance of the branch.},

Abstract = {Political rhetoric in the United States is rife with condemnations of
   public sector workers. The assertion that public sector workers are less
   creative, talented, or autonomous than those working in businesses
   pervades in both academic studies and public opinions. Facing constant
   criticisms, do public managers also perceive that government workers are
   less able than their private sector peers? If so, and more importantly,
   does the perceived inferiority of worker abilities shake their
   confidence, thereby undermining their work attitudes? The present study
   employs social comparison theory to answer these questions. Based on
   state government managers' responses in the United States, the results
   indicate that a clear majority of public managers perceive public sector
   inferiority with respect to worker creativity, talent, and autonomy. The
   findings also show that perceived inferiority is related to lower job
   satisfaction, job involvement, and pride in working for the current
   organization. Based on the findings, we provide suggestions to both
   researchers and practitioners.},

Abstract = {Using discursive institutionalism as an analytical framework, this
   article addresses how national actors build, coordinate and communicate
   discourses on EU defence policy (CSDP) at home. The empirical analysis
   is based on a comparative study of substantive and interactive
   discourses in France and Ireland, two contrasted cases. It demonstrates
   that France and Ireland frame and interpret elements of CSDP that best
   fit their needs, use them to promote their defence agenda in a
   legitimate and European' way and present CSDP as a natural continuation
   of their preferences. These defence agendas revolve around the
   preservation of France's exceptionalism and Ireland's neutrality.
   Discursive institutionalism, which methodologically sheds light on
   agents and institutional contexts, helps to understand the dynamics of
   constructive ambiguity, a discursive strategy often applied to CSDP and
   illustrated by these two cases.},

Abstract = {Embodying a state vision of how civil society ought to function and be
   designed by the authorities, Public Chambers in Russia have been
   criticized as means of state control. This state dominance is the
   starting point in this article, which asks what room to manoeuvre a
   regional Public Chamber has. Drawing upon fieldwork this article
   examines how members and local observers of the Public Chamber give
   meaning to this activity. The analysis assesses the role of state
   dominance, discussion of routines and responses to local demands, and
   concludes that these incremental developments form civil society in
   Russia. (C) 2014 The Regents of the University of California. Published

Abstract = {Seeking to develop a novel understanding of how climate policy
   innovation (CPI) emerges and spreads, we conceptualise three types of
   CPIs - genuinely original, diffusion based, and reframing based - and
   relate these to the sociotechnical transitions literature, particularly
   the multi-level perspective (MLP) that explains change through
   interaction between `niche', `regime', and `landscape' levels. Selected
   climate-related transport policies in Finland, Sweden, and the UK are
   used to illustrate five hypotheses that connect these concepts from the
   MLP to particular types of CPI. `Original' policy innovation may be
   uncommon in contexts with major sunk investments such as transport,
   principally because sociotechnical regimes tend to be resistant to
   political pressures for change originating at the same level.
   Nonetheless, the MLP posits that regimes are subject to influence by
   pressures originating at both niche and landscape levels. Given that
   policy reframing is relatively common, it may offer a key entry point
   for CPI in the short to medium term.},

Abstract = {In his article, Using Local Culture to Further the Implementation of
   International Human Rights: The Receptor Approach, Tom Zwart introduces
   the receptor approach, an alternative view on the implementation of
   international human rights that could promote the cultural legitimacy of
   international human rights law. Zwart's introduction of the receptor
   approach is a remarkable contribution to the ongoing discussion on the
   implementation of international human rights standards and the role of
   cultural communities and institutions. However, we are not convinced of
   the usefulness or the necessity of the receptor approach. We argue here
   that the receptor approach does not add much to the existing
   international human rights framework and that Zwart's arguments can be
   confusing.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the visit of James Richards, President
   Eisenhower's special emissary to the Middle East, to Iraq in April 1957
   following the pronouncement of the Eisenhower Doctrine. An analysis of
   the Richards Mission encompasses a range of specific issues, including
   the relationship in Iraq between the US and UK and American assessments
   of the stability of the Iraqi government. Moreover, this article
   examines the American strategy for navigating the rising tide of Arab
   nationalist sentiment in Iraq after the Suez War. This article explores
   the ways in which US policy-makers privileged the notions of `stability'
   and `order' in Iraqi political affairs and reflects on the critical
   dilemmas and contradictions underlying American policy towards Iraq and
   the Middle East after the 1956 Suez War.},

Abstract = {This paper explores political participation in the post-modern sense
   where it is understood in terms of performativity. Such articulation
   brings to light a broader view of performance politics beyond the normal
   or traditional realms of governments and institutions and congruently
   advances into the fore the multiplicity and complexity of other actors
   and activities of political action. In this sense, the performance of
   political participation as resistance serves as the embodiment of active
   and creative disruption, the epitome of performing politics. To
   illustrate this dynamic, this article centers on women's political
   participation through naked protests and examines how performativity is
   implicated in Femen and Meira Paibi's body protests against rape.
   Discursively, it applies analytical discussions from Goffman
   (performativity as social interaction) and Butler (gender
   performativity) to illustrate that women's naked protests are innovative
   expressions of women's political participation that must be understood
   more substantively, particularly, within the analytical dynamic of
   feminist theorization.},

Abstract = {The European Union is often presented as an entity that has `moved
   beyond' the model of organising political life along the way of the
   modern sovereign state. This paper questions this understanding by
   engaging a set of texts that could be understood as exemplary of the
   EU's official discourse of Europe: EU's failed Constitutional Treaty and
   Javier Solana's collected speeches. A paradox is herein identified: the
   values that are said to sustain Europe's identity and upon which Europe
   is founded are simultaneously presented as distinctly European and
   universal. It is suggested that Europe is being crafted in a pendular
   oscillation between particularising and universalising the values upon
   which Europe allegedly rests. By drawing on critical International
   Relations theory, the paper suggests that this very contradictory
   oscillation between particularising and universalising Europe's values
   to an important extent mirrors modern statecraft. One should therefore
   think twice before announcing the construction of the European Union as
   something qualitatively different from, or `gentler' than, modern
   statecraft.},

Abstract = {This article examines the latest iteration of EU social policy the
   target to reduce poverty and social exclusion by 20 million. The
   application of a three-part conceptual matrix focused on ideas, politics
   and governance indicates key weaknesses. The target is ungovernable
   because it melds different approaches to poverty and social exclusion
   and because of the leeway to Member States to adopt an approach of their
   own choice. And the target is ungoverned because of low political
   priority and uncertainty around its legal status, as well as ambiguity
   over how it fits into the Europe 2020 governance process.},

Abstract = {Building on the publicness, organizational theory, and policy diffusion
   literatures, we describe and evaluate the relationships between
   organizational and two distinct types of environmental publicness and
   organizational practices. Through hierarchical linear modeling, we
   integrate organizational-level data on substance abuse treatment centers
   participating in the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment
   Services in the year 2009, with data on the larger substance abuse
   policy environment at the state level to predict whether organizations
   offer public service practices. Our findings indicate that publicness at
   the organizational and state policy levels are both important
   determinants of the offering of public service practices. Generally, we
   find that privately owned organizations are more likely to offer these
   services when they operate in policy environments with greater
   publicness. However, we also find that private organizations are less
   likely to offer public services that result in clear economic loss if
   they operate in policy environments with a greater number of public
   organizations.},

Abstract = {This article explores how ``traditional values{''} are being used by the
   Russian government to refute the claim that ``LGBT rights are human
   rights{''} and justify the introduction of anti-homopropaganda laws, and
   how members of the Russian LGBT community have sought to contest it.
   Centrally, it traces the development of a discourse that refutes the
   essentialization of sexual identity and, in doing so, seeks to challenge
   the focus on individual identity-based rights of contemporary human
   rights norms. This discursive shift has meant that opponents of the
   legislation have had to develop contestation strategies that
   collectively seek to present an alternative interpretation of
   ``traditional values.{''} The article concludes by considering the
   implications of the Russian case for human rights norms and for the
   notion of universal human rights more widely, arguing that it represents
   a serious challenge to the viability of identity-based LGBT rights
   claims as a basis on which to advance observance of fundamental human
   rights due to their homonormativity.},

Abstract = {Scholars have long debated the causal impact of international
   institutions such as the World Trade Organization or the International
   Monetary Fund. This study investigates Organization of Petroleum
   Exporting Countries (OPEC), an organization that purports to have
   significant influence over the market for the world's most important
   commodity-petroleum. Using four empirical tests, I find that OPEC has
   little or no impact on its members' production levels. These findings
   prompt the question of why so many people, including scholars, believe
   in OPEC's influence over the world's oil supply. The idea of OPEC as a
   cartel is a ``rational myth{''} that supports the organization's true
   principal function, which is to generate political benefits for its
   members. One benefit it generates is international prestige. I test this
   idea using data on diplomatic representation and find that OPEC
   membership is associated with increased international recognition by
   other states. Overall, these findings help one to better understand
   international regimes and the process of ideational change in world
   politics.},

Volume = {92},

Abstract = {Administrative decentralization to government agencies (so-called
   `agencification') has attracted much attention in recent years,
   increasingly for its longevity or evolution after the `high'
   managerialism of the 1980s, and largely through a neo-positivist
   epistemology. Drawing on techniques of narrative and discourse analysis,
   and a model of incremental ideational change, this article identifies
   the necessity of supplementing those existing large-N analyses of
   agencification's expansion and decline with qualitative attention to the
   endurance of policy meaning. It demonstrates how the original
   foundations of managerialism, civil service empowerment and
   decentralization from the UK's seminal `Next Steps' agency programme are
   eschewed in contemporary reform discourse, where agencification is
   instead advocated as centralized, politically proximate and
   departmentalized governance. This substantial reinterpretation of the
   arm's-length concept not only challenges existing claims of continuity
   in UK administrative policy, but also demonstrates the utility of
   interpretive methods for exploring longevity in public management more
   widely.},

Abstract = {Research Highlights and Abstract
   Offers one of the first detailed considerations of how political parties
   in Northern Ireland have adapted to the impact of the dual legitimacy of
   Protestant-British-Unionist and Catholic-Irish-Nationalist identities
   central to the Good Friday/Belfast Agreement
   Extends debates about devolution and party competition which have been
   centred on Great Britain to the United Kingdom.
   Outlines how the continuing bi-communalism of the electorate discourages
   parties from reshaping identity or chasing votes beyond the ethnic
   divide
   Analyses how nationalist parties, Sinn Fein in particular, have
   developed the rights of all citizens on the island of Ireland to be
   Irish, under the post-Good Friday Agreement Irish constitution
   Assesses the data indicating a modest growth of a common Northern Irish
   identity
   In this article we examine how party political competition in Northern
   Ireland impacts on understandings of national identity and citizenship
   both within the region and elsewhere in the UK. These dynamics can be
   seen in expressions of political identity and through organisational
   change and electoral strategies. The consociational framework in which
   Northern Irish parties operate is one of the most powerful dynamics and
   we assess how it has shaped intra-community party competition, most
   notably through the emergence of the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn
   Fein as the strongest unionist and nationalist parties respectively.
   However, our analysis of campaigning and voting in the 2010 General
   Election and 2011 Assembly elections also shows that the transformation
   of party political competition in the UK after devolution is an
   important dynamic and one that has shaped unionist electoral strategies
   in particular.},

Abstract = {The impact of global activism against trade liberalization is examined
   in this article through an analysis of the initiatives of cross border
   civil society networks and with particular attention to the failed 2003
   World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial conference in Cancun. Key
   aspects considered here include the internal dynamics of mobilization -
   which was characterized by a strong framing and widespread protest - and
   the political opportunities in WTO negotiations, which were marked by
   divisions within the North and resistance by a large group of Southern
   governments. In the failure of the WTO Millennium Round in Cancun and
   the loss of momentum of its liberalization agenda, a significant role
   has been played by civil society activism and its ability to combine
   protest, well-prepared lobbying, an epistemic-like community able to
   influence public opinion, and the development of alliances with
   like-minded governments of the South.},

Title = {The (in)effectiveness of torture for combating insurgency},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {388-404},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {It is commonly believed that torture is an effective tool for combating
   an insurgent threat. Yet while torture is practiced in nearly all
   counterinsurgency campaigns, the evidence documenting torture's effects
   remains severely limited. This study provides the first micro-level
   statistical analysis of torture's relation to subsequent killings
   committed by insurgent and counterinsurgent forces. The theoretical
   arguments contend that torture is ineffective for reducing killings
   perpetrated by insurgents both because it fails to reduce insurgent
   capacities for violence and because it can increase the incentives for
   insurgents to commit future killings. The theory also links torture to
   other forms of state violence. Specifically, engaging in torture is
   expected to be associated with increased killings perpetrated by
   counterinsurgents. Monthly municipal-level data on political violence
   are used to analyze torture committed by counterinsurgents during the
   Guatemalan civil war (1977-94). Using a matched-sample,
   difference-in-difference identification strategy and data compiled from
   22 different press and NGO sources as well as thousands of interviews,
   the study estimates how torture is related to short-term changes in
   killings perpetrated by both insurgents and counterinsurgents. Killings
   by counterinsurgents are shown to increase significantly following
   torture. However, torture appears to have no robust correlation with
   subsequent killings by insurgents. Based on this evidence the study
   concludes that torture is ineffective for reducing insurgent perpetrated
   killings.},

Abstract = {The idea that moments of crisis form opportunities for fundamental
   policy change is widespread in political science and public policy. It
   is usually associated with historical institutionalism and the notion of
   critical junctures'. On the basis of an in-depth analysis of social
   policy responses in Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands and Sweden over
   the course of four global economic shocks, we ask whether the notion of
   critical junctures is useful in understanding the nature of change
   triggered by crisis. The main empirical finding is that fundamental
   change in the aftermath of an exogenous shock is the exception rather
   than the rule. Instead, incremental crisis routines' based on existing
   policy instruments are overwhelmingly used to deal with economic
   hardship. We discuss these findings in the light of the psychological
   `threat-rigidity' effect and reflect on their consequences for theories
   of comparative policy analysis and institutional change.},

Abstract = {International organizations, policy experts, and nongovernmental
   organizations promote greater governmental transparency as a crucial
   reform to enhance accountability and curb corruption. Transparency is
   predicted to deter corruption in part by expanding the possibilities for
   public or societal accountability, that is, for citizens and citizens
   associations to monitor, scrutinize, and act to hold public office
   holders to account. Although the societal accountability mechanism
   linking transparency and good government is often implied, it builds on
   a number of assumptions seldom examined empirically. This article
   unpacks the assumptions of principal-agent theories of accountability
   and suggests that the logic of collective action can be used to
   understand why exposure of egregious and endemic corruption may instead
   demobilize the demos (i.e., resignation) rather than enhance
   accountability (i.e., indignation). We explore these theoretical
   contentions and examine how transparency affects three indicators of
   indignations versus resignation-institutional trust, political
   involvement, and political interest-given different levels of
   corruption. The empirical analyses confirm that an increase in
   transparency in highly corrupt countries tends to breed resignation
   rather than indignation.},

Abstract = {Twenty years after the Rwandan genocide, little is known about the
   political values of non-elite Hutu. The post-genocide regime has
   emphasized the problem of ``divisionism{''} and ``genocide ideology{''},
   suggesting a popular preference for a radical stance on inter-group
   relations and reconciliation. This argument has been used to defer the
   question of democracy. This article investigates the attitudes of
   ordinary Hutu at a rural site, and shows that the respondents staked out
   a middle ground, emphasizing the shared interests of ordinary Hutu and
   Tutsi and distancing themselves from the political excesses of both Hutu
   and Tutsi elites. However, this moderate political space appeared to
   yield to more radical views when discussing the pressures of
   transitional justice, when respondents' careful distinction between
   elite and ordinary people collapsed and a monolithic actor, ``the
   Tutsi{''}, was imagined in conflict with ``the Hutu{''}. While this
   slippage appears to be a coping mechanism in the face of stressful
   situations rather than an inherent political preference, the article
   concludes that politically convenient assumptions and maladroit public
   policy risk contributing to the very dangers the regime claims to
   combat.},

Abstract = {There is an increasing scholarly concern that liberalism comes into
   conflict with religious diversity. William Galston blames this tendency
   on Enlightenment liberalism', which places autonomous self-reflection at
   the heart of the liberal project. This article, however, proposes a
   culprit that is more prone to both disrespect and dogmatism: romantic
   liberalism, which idealises authentic self-expression. I develop this
   concept by revisiting the Danish cartoon controversy, allegedly a case
   of Enlightenment liberalism. This exercise reveals that Flemming Rose,
   the editor who commissioned the cartoons, invokes romantic rather than
   enlightened values in defence of the publication. In contrast to
   previous research, I show that Rose does not portray the
   disrespectfulness of the cartoons as a side-effect of trying to promote
   autonomy among Muslims. Rather, he argues in favour of artistic
   provocation as such, invoking a distinctly romantic understanding of
   freedom of speech, which in many ways runs counter to the ideal of
   autonomy.},

   Conceptual Framework and Theoretical Foundations},

Volume = {16},

Abstract = {When multiple third parties intervene diplomatically in the same
   dispute, are their interventions interdependent? Although theoretical
   and empirical evidence suggests that they are, most conflict management
   research fails to theorize about and model this interdependence
   directly. The current project breaks with this tradition by advancing
   the new concept of a conflict management trajectory-the idea that
   conflict management efforts evolve over the course of a conflict and
   successive efforts inform one another. After discussing the rationale
   for and theoretical foundations underlying trajectories, I construct
   these trajectories empirically, summarize and discuss some of their
   characteristics, and create a typology to describe and organize them. In
   the process, I demonstrate that trajectories possess properties that
   clearly differentiate them from isolated interventions (the alternative)
   and display numerous general patterns. Each of these, in turn, suggests
   that trajectories deserve greater study as we seek to integrate and
   expand our understanding of international conflict management.},

Abstract = {This study concentrates on the changing nature of the prison officer
   profession in Poland as the country developed from a Stalinist satellite
   to a liberal democracy and member of the European Union. Drawing on a
   range of archival materials, the study also aims to demonstrate how a
   social institution is shaped by political forces. The analysis supports
   two theses. Firstly, because for two generations the prison system was
   deployed `against the people', it is unsurprising that Polish citizens
   view prison officers in a negative light. Secondly, if prison staff
   wants to be recognised as professionals devoted to a decent and worthy
   task, they are likely need to deploy imaginative public relations. (C)

Abstract = {In this article, I argue that the European financial market integration
   cannot be understood without the European Commission's gradual
   enforcement of supranational competition law for financial services. The
   conflict over the liberalization of public banks in Germany demonstrates
   how the Directorate General for Competition (DG COMP) deepened financial
   market integration through legal proceedings without the participation
   of the Council of Ministers. How could DG COMP prevail over the fierce
   resistance of Germany even though member states never intended for
   European law to have enough leverage to alter core elements of national
   financial systems? The article focuses on DG COMP's capacities for
   strategic action. DG COMP was able to enforce European competition rules
   for financial services, skilfully combining its legal competences with
   political strategies. The case illustrates that the regulatory
   integration of financial services in the EU is much more driven by
   supranational institutions than assumed by the bulk of the literature.},

Abstract = {This article empirically investigates the impact of national
   socio-economic contextual factors on public opinion on globalisation. It
   also examines the mediating impact ... of these factors on the
   relationship between citizens' education, occupation and public opinion
   on globalisation. Using Eurobarometer data, this article demonstrates
   that national levels of unemployment, FDI and trade balances, as well as
   the proportion of the national population with tertiary education
   attainment, influence citizens' opinions on globalisation. They also
   show that national levels of unemployment, trade and FDI balances, net
   migration and the proportion of the national population with tertiary
   education arbitrate the relationship between individuals' education,
   occupation and public attitudes towards globalisation. The article then
   discusses the implications of these findings.},

Title = {Neighbors: About the Multiculturalization of the Polish Past},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Pages = {225-251},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article discusses the problem of neighborly coexistence in
   religiously and ethnically diverse settings. It tackles some widespread
   assumptions regarding the importance of religious/ethnic factors in
   shaping neighborly relations as well as the question of broader
   sociopolitical contexts and their impact on neighborly coexistence. In
   so doing, it argues against those approaches that place neighborhood at
   the center of debates on the breakdown of societal coexistence and use
   it as a tool of explanation of interethnic and interreligious conflicts.
   More specifically, the article engages critically with the way the idea
   of neighborhood is used in debates on Polish history. It argues that the
   idea of past harmony and peaceful coexistence in multicultural settings
   reinforces the image of the Polish society as tolerant and
   diversity-friendly and stresses that the harmonious neighborly
   coexistence was brought to an end by outsiders. As a result, not only
   does it serve the dominant group rather than minorities, but it
   precludes the understanding of the dynamics of ethnic/religious
   pluralism. The article therefore suggests that the studies of diversity
   in Poland should pay closer attention to the context of the
   dominantPolish and Catholicculture in which the diversity has been
   accommodated. Striving to address this problem, it presents some
   findings from an ethnographic study of a multireligious and multiethnic
   neighborhood in rural Poland and provides some comparative insights.},

Abstract = {Matteo Renzi's rise to the leadership of the Democratic Party brings to
   the heart of the centre-left the leadership model imposed upon the
   Italian scene by Berlusconi in the early 1990s. A post-ideological,
   anti-political and innovative type of leadership, which has proved to be
   highly effective in attracting electoral support and media attention.
   Yet a type of leadership that clashes with the cultural and
   organisational roots of the centre-left. The article frames the
   experience of the new party Secretary, focusing on his political
   history, public narrative and style of communication.},

Abstract = {This article traces the political and ideological development of the
   various strands of Irish Republicanism since 1994, with particular focus
   on the transition of the Provisional movement from insurgency to
   government party. In particular, it explores some of the external and
   internal dynamics shaping this process, such as the origins of
   Provisionalism as a social movement organization and the changing
   relationship between the nationalist population and the British state.
   It concludes by considering both the possible future trajectory of the
   Provisionals and the potential of dissident republicans to mount a
   serious political challenge to the status quo in Northern Ireland.},

Abstract = {This chapter presents some political consequences of the parallel
   between the feminine and Judaism, on one hand, and masculine and
   paganism, on the other hand. Doing so, it makes clear the relevance of
   comparing the ``smallest{''} or the individual level approached on the
   basis of the gender issue, and the ``biggest,{''} or worldwide history,
   considered in the horizon of the Western tension between its two
   determining roots. As feminine and masculine are fulfilled in an
   ambivalent way through their partial transformation into their
   ``other,{''} so are Judaism and paganism. Before Christianity, such
   interlacing radically changed neither the feminine nor the masculine,
   nor the human world.},

   between Russia and the United States},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-72},
Abstract = {Tactical nuclear weapons have emerged as an unavoidable issue for future
   nuclear weapons negotiations between Russia and the United States. This
   article discusses challenges and opportunities regarding a tactical
   nuclear weapons treaty. It begins with an overview of precedents from
   the 1987 Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty and the 1991 Presidential
   Nuclear Initiatives. These and subsequent experiences show three major
   obstacles that must be overcome to permit bi-lateral agreement on
   tactical nuclear weapons: definitional issues over differentiating
   tactical from strategic nuclear weapons; negotiation challenges
   including the asymmetries between American and Russian tactical arsenals
   and non-nuclear capabilities such as ballistic missile defence and
   conventional prompt global strike; and verification questions over
   whether and how warhead status can be verified without disclosing
   sensitive information. This analysis examines whether the International
   Atomic Energy Agency could have a role in verification to help
   facilitate agreement. Lastly, this article offers various confidence
   building measures, emphasizing areas where the two countries could
   cooperate. While the obstacles are serious, there are opportunities for
   achieving consensus on some contentious issues.},

Title = {Strategy to motivate and facilitate compromise in Chinese mediation A
   discourse analysis of contemporary Chinese mediation sessions},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {4-20},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to explore language strategies and techniques
   in Chinese mediation that are adopted by mediators to motivate and
   facilitate compromise among disputants.
   Design/methodology/approach - Ten cases were audio-recorded on the spot,
   transcribed for analysis in their Chinese form, and then translated into
   English for English readers. The translation of excerpts used in this
   paper to demonstrate points was double checked to ensure accuracy.
   Discourse analysis was adopted to explore the meanings and functions of
   the utterances in these excerpts.
   Findings - It is found that power is embedded in the mediator's position
   and in his/her role in the mediation. Furthermore, neutrality is less of
   a concern as compared to justice in the mediator's terms. Finally,
   socio-cultural indications of the language strategies and techniques
   were drawn about contemporary Chinese society.
   Practical implications - When dealing with Chinese people in conflict,
   one may emphasize common goals and bring in external reasons such as
   seniority, face, and status to motivate and facilitate compromise.
   Originality/value - Studying transcripts of cases that were recorded in
   real time and recently is rare in studies of Chinese mediation. Studying
   what people actually say provides us data in reality, in contrast to the
   ideals as well as what they say they do in mediation.},

Pages = {172-187},
Abstract = {Multinational companies are increasingly promoted as peacebuilders.
   Major arguments in support of such a position emphasise both
   interest-based and norm/socialisation-based factors. This article uses
   research on large mining MNCs in eastern DRC - those that, arguably,
   should be most likely to build peace according to the above positions to
   engage critically with the business for peace agenda. First it
   demonstrates the limited peacemaking, as well as active peacebuilding,
   activities in broader society that companies undertake. Second, it finds
   that even those companies deemed most likely to build peace continue
   relying on hybrid (in) security practice. Third, this article calls for
   more reflexivity concerning the implications of the business for peace
   research agenda. While the latter might contribute to socialising
   businesses into contributions to peacebuilding, it also produces
   companies as legitimate authorities, despite their limitations as
   peacebuilders. As a result, new conflict and insecurity are produced,
   especially for/with those displaced from land and artisanal mining pits
   and left with no alternative livelihood options.},

Abstract = {Local elections have generally provided useful pointers for overall
   party system patterns in Portugal. The 2013 local elections are of
   additional interest because they were the first nationwide elections in
   Portugal since the substantive start of the country's economic
   adjustment programme, initiated in mid 2011. As such, they also
   constitute the first electoral milestone by which to assess the
   Portuguese party system in a bailout context. Unlike recent bailout
   elections in Ireland and Greece, these local elections did not generate
   a major departure from the prevailing patterns of the Portuguese party
   system. However, we find some evidence of a challenge to the party
   system, with a decline in the combined share of the main parties,
   especially when facing independent candidates.},

Abstract = {Although the importance of sustainability reporting in the public sector
   is widely recognized, there are few studies about this issue. This paper
   analyzed the practices of diffusion of information on sustainability in
   local governments. So, we observed the Websites of the largest local
   governments in Spain using a list of items from the guidelines of GM and
   comparing the results with the results of the Spanish regional
   governments. Our findings show that local governments reported some
   information (50\% of the items), but less than regional governments
   (60\%). Social information is the most widespread and environmental
   information is the least reported.},

Title = {Bases of power and conflict intervention strategy: a study on Turkish
   managers},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {38-60},
Abstract = {Purpose - This study aims to develop an influence perspective for
   managerial intervention in subordinates conflicts, which helps to
   represent various strategies identified in the literature in a single
   model. Managers' power base was then related to their intervention
   strategies. Drawing upon Social Judgment Theory, anchoring of
   subordinates positions is studied as a moderating variable.
   Design/methodology/approach - Thirty nine supervisors and their 165
   subordinates from several organizations in Turkey filled out a
   questionnaire reporting power base of supervisor and their intervention
   strategy utilizing the critical incident technique.
   Findings - Referent power of superior led to mediation in subordinates'
   conflicts. However, mediation decreased while restructuring,
   arbitration, and educative strategies increased with increased anchoring
   of subordinates' positions. These latter strategies mostly relied on
   reward power of manager. Subordinate satisfaction was highest with
   mediation and lowest when supervisors distanced themselves from the
   conflict.
   Research limitations/implications - The present study could only test
   the moderating effect of escalation as an anchoring variable. Future
   studies may look at the anchoring effect of whether the dispute is
   handled in public or in private, and whether the parties have a
   competing versus collaborative or compromising styles.
   Practical implications - Training of managers in mediation may be
   essential in cultures where they play a focal role in handling
   subordinates conflicts. Such training may have to take into account
   their broader influence strategies and use of power.
   Originality/value - An influence perspective is useful in integrating
   the vast array of managerial intervention strategies in the literature.
   Furthermore, the anchoring effect provides a theoretical explanation for
   managers' use of more forceful intervention with less cooperative
   subordinates.},

Abstract = {The Black September events in Jordan in 1970 are an example of the
   conflict the Palestinian issue presented for monarchic regimes. On the
   one hand, wealthy regimes such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait wanted to
   assist the Palestinians in their struggle against Israel, but on the
   other hand, the moment they understood that siding with the Palestinians
   could weaken their regimes, they renounced their support. This article,
   therefore, emphasizes the importance the monarchic regimes in the
   Persian Gulf attributed to their own stability, and the influence that
   issue had on their policies within the Arab world.},

Abstract = {The interactions between the European Union (EU) and international
   policy regimes are ever more important. Much of the existing literature
   has focused on the bottom-up dimension of the EU's role in global
   institutions, assuming that the EU predominantly seeks to project its
   policies to the global level. However, our review of empirical research
   reveals that EU policy exports tend to be rare and that EU-global
   interactions are more varied. On a global scale, the EU is not a
   hegemonic power that can easily transfer its standards to international
   regimes, nor does it always desire to do so. This article conceptualizes
   the EU's interactions with international institutions in four modes
   (policy export, policy promotion, policy protection and policy import),
   establishes different rationales motivating EU actors to engage through
   a given mode and relates recent empirical research to this comprehensive
   typology.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},
Pages = {508-531},
Abstract = {Scholars have widely adopted the view that the behaviour of the Tunisian
   military during the `Arab Spring' constitutes a positive case of
   military defection. This paper argues that, contrary to this dominant
   interpretation, the military remained loyal to the authoritarian
   civilian leadership throughout the protests as it had repeatedly done in
   the past. Defection occurred, however, within the Police and the
   National Guard, which are mistakenly portrayed as having been loyal to
   Ben Ali. The paper shows that scholars have sought to explain exactly
   the opposite of what actually happened and, thus, it questions their
   conclusions regarding civil-military relations in Tunisia.},

Pages = {565-580},
Abstract = {Despite over a decade of government funding and thousands of newcomers
   to the field of terrorist research, we are no closer to answering the
   simple question of What leads a person to turn to political violence?
   The state of stagnation with respect to this issue is partly due to the
   government strategy of funding research without sharing the necessary
   primary source information with academia, which has created an
   unbridgeable gap between academia and the intelligence community. This
   has led to an explosion of speculations with little empirical grounding
   in academia, which has the methodological skills but lacks data for a
   major breakthrough. Most of the advances in the field have come from
   historical archival research and analysis of a few field interviews. Nor
   has the intelligence community been able to achieve any breakthrough
   because of the structure and dynamic of this community and its lack of
   methodological rigor. This prevents creative analysis of terrorism
   protected from political concerns. The solution to this stagnation is to
   make non-sensitive data available to academia and to structure more
   effective discourse between the academic and intelligence communities in
   order to benefit from the complementary strengths in these two
   communities.},

Title = {Socio-moral climate, debate, and decision comprehensiveness interplay
   for team innovation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {105-123},
Abstract = {Purpose - The aim of this paper is to address both the socio-moral
   climate and how teams process debate and decision comprehensiveness as
   pre-conditions for team innovation.
   Design/methodology/approach - A total of 67 teams comprising 413
   participants were surveyed. Data were analyzed with a multiple-step
   multiple-mediation procedure.
   Findings - The socio-moral climate was positively related to innovation.
   The positive relation between the socio-moral climate and innovation was
   mediated stepwise through debate and decision comprehensiveness.
   Research limitations/implications - To overcome the limitations of a
   cross-sectional design, future research opportunities exist in the
   longitudinal evaluation of participatory socio-moral climates and
   comparisons between organizations. Debate and decision comprehensiveness
   can be further studied using behavior-based methodological designs, such
   as observation.
   Practical implications - From this study, practitioners can learn of the
   needs and opportunities for participative approaches when managing
   innovation in teams. Promoting a socio-moral climate of cooperation,
   communication, openness, appreciation, trust and respect and leaving
   open the possibility that debating can help integrative decision
   comprehensiveness and thus innovation.
   Originality/value - This paper expands the literature on organizational
   climate, debate, decision comprehensiveness, and innovation. On the one
   hand, the results empirically linked the socio-moral climate, a
   theoretically well-founded climate construct, to process variables. On
   the other hand, the literature on debate and decision comprehensiveness
   was expanded by adding the socio-moral climate as a pre-condition of
   debate and decision comprehensiveness. Furthermore, both were linked to
   a crucial outcome variable, innovation.},
