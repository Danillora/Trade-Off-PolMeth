Abstract = {Does it matter whether a civil war is fought as a conventional,
   irregular, or symmetric nonconventional conflict? Put differently, do
   technologies of rebellion impact a war's severity, duration, or outcome?
   Our answer is positive. We find that irregular conflicts last
   significantly longer than all other types of conflict, while
   conventional ones tend to be more severe in terms of battlefield
   lethality. Irregular conflicts generate greater civilian victimization
   and tend to be won by incumbents, while conventional ones are more
   likely to end in rebel victories. Substantively, these findings help us
   make sense of how civil wars are changing: they are becoming shorter,
   deadlier on the battlefield, and more challenging for existing
   governmentsbut also more likely to end with some kind of settlement
   between governments and armed opposition. Theoretically, our findings
   support the idea of taking into account technologies of rebellion
   (capturing characteristics of conflicts that tend to be visible mostly
   at the micro level) when studying macro-level patterns of conflicts such
   as the severity, duration, and outcomes of civil wars; they also point
   to the specific contribution of irregular war to both state building and
   social change.},

Volume = {34},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {David Estlund's theory of normative consent attempts to ground
   democratic authority that extends even to some decisions and laws that
   are erroneous, and with which it would be better not to comply, in light
   of the goal of achieving justice. This paper argues that the theory of
   normative consent is unable to ground authority with such a wide scope
   (or, as it will be called in the paper, a wide margin of error').
   Therefore, democratic authority must allow that citizens are in
   principle permitted to disobey laws and policies that are erroneous and
   with which compliance is, on the whole, counterproductive. Even though
   the epistemic threshold for determining both whether a particular
   decision is erroneous and whether it would be counterproductive to
   comply with it must be high, this does not touch the principled point
   that citizens would not be wrong not to consent to proposed authority of
   the type Estlund has in mind.},

Abstract = {We are happy that communism ended mostly peacefully in East-Central
   Europe in 1989. That civil society channeled peaceful dissent in the
   northern part of this region was important. Nevertheless, it is wrong to
   minimize other factors. The action of the main leaders of the Soviet
   Union and the United States were equally or more crucial. Gorbachev's
   unwillingness to sustain old Soviet interventionist policies and
   Reagan's decision to treat Gorbachev with respect and agree to weapons
   reductions against the advice of many of his most hawkish advisors were
   necessary for this to come out well. But unfortunately, because the role
   of civil society was blown out of proportion, and also because the
   transition from communism went relatively smoothly, mistaken conclusions
   were drawn by American policy makers. They came to believe that civil
   society everywhere in the world was inclined to be democratic, peaceful,
   and pro-American. In fact, that has not been the case, and the kind of
   easy transition to free market democracy that marked much of
   East-Central Europe has not been replicated elsewhere, particularly not
   in the Middle East and Afghanistan. It might have been more appropriate
   to conclude from the events of 1989 that Yugoslavia, not Poland, was the
   case that most resembled the ethnically and religiously divided parts of
   the world, and to remember that even in Poland the homogeneity of the
   population was the result of brutal genocide, mass expulsions, and
   forced boundary changes that had taken place as a result of World War
   II.},

Abstract = {This study examines the mechanisms through which the ruling party won a
   plurality of votes using a combination of legal changes and manipulative
   practices during the 2012 parliamentary election in Ukraine. Legal
   changes in electoral rulesthe replacement of proportional representation
   to a mixed systemhelped the ruling party weaken the opposition parties.
   These changes enabled the ruling party to engage in manipulation and
   fraud during campaigning and on election day by suppressing competition,
   crowding out the races with technical parties and clone candidates, and
   manipulating the composition of electoral commissions. The change of
   electoral system also enabled outright fraud on election day. A
   combination of these techniques disrupted both the contestation and
   participation dimensions of democracy, effectively pushing Ukraine into
   a state of competitive authoritarianism.},

Abstract = {This article discusses two situations in which the truth of human rights
   violations was suppressed until generations later: the truth of the
   Arbenz presidency and overthrow in Guatemala and the truth about the
   Spanish Civil War victims. In each of these instances, starkly different
   although with similarities, the impetus for finding out the truth came
   from unexpected sources: in Guatemala, from an insistent family and an
   international commission; in Spain, from a journalist who came upon the
   remains of his grandfather. What occurred and is still occurring in
   these situations offers insights into what victims of human rights
   abuses want and need. It also offers effective ways for a government to
   respond if it hopes to move forward into building a more just society.
   It argues that acknowledgement is as important as knowledge; that truth
   alone, while necessary, is not sufficient.},

   address this gap though an examination of the Court's equal protection
   and gender cases from the 1970s. My case study here has two aims. First,
   I offer an adaptation of the jurisprudential regimes framework as a
   device for framing and identifying legal policy punctuations. After
   identifying Reed v. Reed (1971) as the cut point of such a regime, I
   then use Reed and its progeny to illustrate the promise of culture in
   explaining stasis and change, specifically focusing on the concepts of
   cultural cognition and cultural surprise.},

Abstract = {The conventional argument in studies of political knowledge among
   members of the general public is that greater interest and engagement in
   politics leads to a better grasp of the relevant facts. However, this
   may not always be the case: When the facts themselves become
   politicized, interest and engagement in politics may mean learning the
   facts not as they are, but as competing partisan and media elites want
   them to be. In this article, based on the 2010 Polish National Election
   Survey, we investigate the following questions: Does partisanship boost
   incorrect perceptions of contested facts when the correct answer is
   unfavorable to the respondent's preferred party? Does
   partisan/ideological selectivity in exposure to media outlets do
   likewise? Are stronger partisans more likely to be misinformed about
   politically contested facts even if they are knowledgeable about the
   uncontested ones?},

Abstract = {We assessed whether intergroup contact at a nation-building intervention
   in Malaysia improved participants' perceptions of threat and outgroup
   evaluations and whether this process was conceptually moderated by group
   status in a three-group setting. We found evidence of a strong
   relationship between post-intervention contact and post-intervention
   outgroup evaluations in all groups and evidence of indirect effects of
   post-intervention contact on outgroup evaluations by symbolic threat for
   the minority groups rating the majority group. We found that in the
   context of institutional inequalities, integrated threat theory may not
   be sufficiently complex to uncover the processes that underlie the
   contact-attitude link for majority groups rating minority groups.
   Further, we found indirect effects of post-intervention contact on
   outgroup evaluations via realistic threat for interminority group
   ratings. Thus, we elucidate some of the different mechanisms that
   underlie the intergroup perceptions of majority and minority group
   members.},

Title = {Renewal of the Ideas on the State and Public Administration in Argentina},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2014},

Abstract = {The work aims to analyze the mutations in the ideas on the State and
   public administration in Argentina, emphasizing the changes which have
   occurred since 2001.
   There is agreement in the academic community about the need for a new
   conceptualization after the big bang of paradigms of early twenty-first
   century. However, there is no systematic corpus that integrates new
   insights arising after the crisis was produced.
   This paper will describe the ideas pushed for the three waves of reform
   and modernization that swept the country in the last fifty years: the
   development project, the different phases of structural adjustment and
   the popular and national thought of the Nestor Kirchner and Cristina
   Fernandez de Kirchner presidencies. In the latter case, this is first
   approximation, because in this period there are no uniform
   conceptualization in academia, or in the political forces and the civil
   service researches.
   In this description, we will try to set aside the casuistry to focus on
   the broader aspects Of what was the vision of the role of the State in
   society and how, in that role, it is derived from models of public
   administration management. The objective of the article is not directed
   both to examine the various measures that were implemented -but for the
   sake of exposure is necessary to refer to them- but to describe the
   different views on the issue that there was in each stage. Finally, it
   is concluded with the presentation of the questions that leaves raised
   for the expert knowledge,, the modifications introduced by popular
   national governments.
   While the historic journeys, as well as the empirical foundations are
   taken of the Argentine case, we are convinced that the conclusions have
   regional scope.},

Journal = {BUSINESS AND POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {453-479},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Over time and across countries, researchers have noted frequent and
   mostly unexplained gender differences in the levels of support for
   policies of free or freer trade: according to aggregate results from
   many surveys, women tend to be less favorable toward policies of
   liberalizing trade than men. Positing an economic security explanation
   based largely on a mobile factors approach, we ask if it is women
   generally who are more negative toward trade or rather women who are
   more economically vulnerable - i.e., women from the scarce labor factor.
   We utilize data from two recent surveys on individuals' attitudes toward
   different facets of trade and its effects to examine this hypothesis
   empirically. Rejecting a monolithic definition of ``women,{''} we find
   that disaggregating by education level illuminates to some extent what
   underlying characteristics might be helping to drive some of these
   findings. Lower-skilled women in the US are much less likely to support
   free trade compared to higher-skilled women and this may largely explain
   previous negative findings. The low versus high-skill dynamic is,
   however, much less clear in the findings using survey data from a small
   sample of developing countries.},

Abstract = {Much has recently been written about how to best measure governance or
   state quality. Should we evaluate government performance by looking at
   what government achieves (outputs) as Robert Rotberg and Craig Boardman
   recently suggested? Or should we focus on measuring state capacity and
   bureaucratic autonomy, as Francis Fukuyama concludes? This commentary
   argues in support of Fukuyama's approach by using a public
   administration lens to disaggregate the public sector into two domains:
   upstream bodies at the center of government and downstream delivery
   bodies that deliver, commission, or fund services under the policy
   direction of government. It goes further by recommending a measurement
   framework that focuses on identifying indicators that are behavioral and
   action worthy in relation to five public management systems ultimately
   owned and operated by the central, upstream agencies.},

Abstract = {Advocates of citizen participation argue that a greater role for
   citizens in the budget process can help city governments undergoing
   fiscal retrenchment by improving budget choices and citizens'
   willingness to pay, among others. A contrary view suggests that citizens
   are free riders who want lower taxes but oppose service cuts. How has
   citizen input influenced the choice of fiscal retrenchment strategies in
   municipal governments during the Great Recession? The analysis shows
   that when it comes to budget cutting, participatory cities have a higher
   probability of adopting highly contentious strategies, including
   eliminating services and laying off workers compared with
   nonparticipatory cities. For raising revenues, participatory cities
   avoid increasing property taxes. Citizens' fiscal choices raise
   questions about the future of local autonomy and, ultimately, citizens'
   ability to influence policymaking in the evolving intergovernmental
   system.},

Abstract = {It has been argued, based upon national polling and mid-term election
   results, that Britain's Liberal Democrats will lose a substantial number
   of seats at the next general election. However, such argument is in
   danger of underestimating the unique importance of strong local party
   organisation and incumbency to the Liberal Democrats as a platform for
   subsequent general electoral success. This article examines the changing
   income, expenditure and membership of the party's strongest local
   constituency associations since 2010, and concludes with a short
   assessment of the possible implications for the Liberal Democrats at the
   next election and beyond.},

Abstract = {International trusteeship is widely touted as a solution to the problem
   of failed states, an extreme form of limited statehood. Current theories
   of legitimacy and statebuilding suggest that trusteeships should produce
   more capable states. These theories, however, fail to take into account
   the self-interest and political strategies available to trustees and
   politicians within new states. We pose a more political model of
   statebuilding by the international community, the trustee, and national
   politicians that predicts that trusteeship will fail to produce states
   with greater capacity. We test for the effects of trusteeship on state
   capacity, measured by service provision, by creating a matched sample of
   countries. We find that there is no evidence that states under
   trusteeship develop greater capacity leading to better provision of
   public goods than comparable states not under trusteeship. Would-be
   statebuilders must be more aware of the political incentives of all
   parties involved in the process.},

Abstract = {In public service institutions occupational gender segregation persists.
   These institutions are often gendered with predominantly masculine
   organisational cultures. The lack of passive and active representation
   of women has implications for public policy outcomes. This paper
   suggests a normative typology of the passive and active representation
   of women in bureaucracies, vis-a-vis institutional strategies to address
   the under-representation of women. The typology is based on: a
   theoretical discussion of representative bureaucracy; and a critical
   discussion of strategies to improve the representation of women. A key
   feature of the paper is the development of a typology with a suggested
   concinnity of institutional strategies.},

Abstract = {How the implementation of local governance can be improved in the
   developing world is an open research question. This study discusses the
   difficulty of transitioning toward local governance in Turkey. To
   analyze the basic difficulties of local governance, a survey was
   conducted using a random sampling method within the inner city
   municipalities of Ankara. The findings indicate that improving local
   governance by enhancing transparency and building mechanisms of
   e-governance is the first step to motivating the public to participate
   in and to move toward a system of local governance. In general, each of
   these strategies would likely increase overall citizen involvement and,
   in particular, would increase the involvement of those citizens between
   26 and 35 years old.},

Abstract = {This article is devoted to the problem of the reaction to the Eastern
   Partnership by Russia's both the political establishment and the expert
   community. The question of reactions to the Eastern Partnership in the
   target countries has been extensively posed in academic literature.
   However, the question of Russia's reaction to the Eastern Partnership,
   one of the most important actors of the region, has been rarely raised
   by the academic community. A wide array of factors impacted Russian
   elites' perception of the Eastern Partnership from problematic issues in
   the EU-Russia relations to the post-Soviet states' political and
   economic transformation. Studying the dynamics and peculiarities of
   Russia's perspective on the Eastern Partnership makes it possible to
   draw meaningful conclusions on the nature of Russia's phobias that fuel
   its domestic and foreign policy. (C) 2014 The Regents of the University

Abstract = {Intellectual discourse on democracy has made important impacts on
   China's transformation and the Chinese pursuit of democracy. There has
   been an intense divergence in understanding and interpretation of
   democracy among the Chinese scholars. In spite of different point of
   views among scholars in China, there is a growing consensus among them
   that political reform is the right answer to China's today's problems
   and democracy is a good thing for China. This paper analyzes the ongong
   heated debates on democracy. It reviews the main structure,
   characteristics, and implications of the debates on democracy among
   three major schools of thought, namely: democracy with Chinese
   characteristics, liberalism, and New-Leftism.},

Abstract = {Industry lobbying is traditionally thought of as a non-excludable good
   subject to collective action problems that are most easily solved by
   concentrated industries. However, there is very little empirical support
   for this hypothesis. In this paper, we address a major shortcoming of
   existing work on the topic: Its near-exclusive reliance on data from the
   US. Using comparative firm-level survey data from up to 74 countries, we
   construct an industry-level indicator of concentration and test its
   effect on firms' lobbying activity. Using multilevel Extreme Bounds
   Analysis and Bayesian Variable Selection techniques to account for model
   uncertainty, we find no evidence that industry concentration is a
   predictor of lobbying activity. We discuss the implications of these
   non-findings for the literature and outline possible avenues for further
   research.},

Abstract = {Decades of scholarship have identified several determinants of political
   intolerance, including authoritarianism and normative threat. Previous
   attempts in the literature to associate other individual difference
   variables (i.e., social dominance orientation {[}SDO]) and situational
   variables (i.e., out-groups' gains in power and status) have been
   unsuccessful. Using a dual-process motivational (DPM) model framework,
   in Study 1 we found that SDO predicted political intolerance of groups
   with hierarchy-attenuating political objectives. This relationship was
   consistent over and above other well-known predictors of political
   intolerance, including right-wing authoritarianism (RWA). RWA predicted
   intolerance of groups with both hierarchy-attenuating and
   cohesion-reducing objectives. In Study 2, we manipulated whether an
   immigrant-rights group was described as presenting a normative threat or
   as gaining power and status. Consistent with extant findings, RWA
   moderated the effect of normative threat on political intolerance. More
   interestingly, SDO moderated the effect of gains in power and status on
   political intolerance. The implications of these findings are discussed.},

Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Pages = {540-558},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Although not the most prolific of courts, the Bulgarian Constitutional
   Court (BCC) has now made enough decisions for us to begin characterising
   its decision making. Generally, decision making on the BCC is
   characterised by a low caseload dominated by referrals from parliament,
   by a high level of dissent, and by dissent that in turn is characterised
   by a disagreement between left-and right-wing judges. I make these
   claims on the basis of an analysis of BCC decisions over the period 1991
   to 2010, and in particular on the basis of an analysis of judges'
   dissenting votes as the expression of an underlying latent trait. I
   argue that this latent trait should be interpreted as a left-right
   dimension, both because the positions on this latent dimension match
   descriptions of judges' politics and the politics of those who
   appointed, and because court majorities from the right end of the
   recovered dimension are often found when ruling in favour of right-wing
   opposition groups. On the basis of these findings, I argue for an
   interpretation of the BCC as an additional legislative chamber,
   comparable in this respect to the French Conseil Constitutionnel.},

Abstract = {In late 2012, a rebel force captured Goma, a provincial capital in the
   eastern Congo. This event spurred a renewed debate on the use of force
   by UN peacekeepers. These had begun in the Congo in 1960 with a UN
   operation led by Ralph Bunche - the UN official who largely defined UN
   peacekeeping. This article summarizes UN intervention in the Congo and
   the use of force since then. It traces the main contours of UN
   engagement and then draws some conclusions about when and where the use
   of force can be successfully employed - or best avoided - by UN
   peacekeepers.},

Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {Much analysis of the Philippine political economy takes place without a
   precise understanding of the shifting contours of the Philippine
   capitalist class. Yet, to better understand the country's pattern of
   economic development requires a more finely grained portrait of the
   country's economic elites. Using Ruth McVey's definition of capitalism
   ``as a system in which the means of production, in private hands, are
   employed to create a profit, some of which is reinvested to increase
   profit-generating capacity{''} (1992, 8), the paper combines an analysis
   of sectoral development and the country's top business groups' shifting
   economic interests and investment patterns since the 1980s and argues
   that over time, domestic capitalism has come to more fully embrace
   commercial interests. A key factor to this shift is the tremendous
   growth of overseas workers' remittances and the new opportunities this
   has provided in the service sector. This changing pattern, in turn, has
   given rise to distinct business institutions and practices to facilitate
   capital accumulation in the Philippines.},

Abstract = {An examination of the humanist thought embedded in Jose Marti's
   anticolonial critique reveals his deep devotion to human solidarity and
   human equality, with education, in particular, seen as ``an act of
   love.{''} Underpinning this commitment is Marti's considerate awareness
   of the ``human condition{''} of the oppressed and colonized. Whereas
   humanism as theorized and practiced in Western liberal circles has
   neglected to challenge the current order of oppression, misery, and
   suffering, Marti's humanist critique is situated squarely on the side of
   victims, waving the banner of human dignity and equality as well as of
   solidarity with the disfavored.},

Abstract = {Many controversial immigration policies have recently emerged across the
   United States and abroad. We explore the role of national context in
   shaping support for such policies. Specifically, we examine whether the
   extent to which ideological attitudesRight-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA)
   and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO)predict policy support is
   moderated by the national context of the policy. Across three studies,
   United States citizens read about a controversial immigration policy
   affecting either their own country (United States) or a foreign country
   (Israel or Singapore) and indicated their support for the policy.
   Results reveal that SDO predicts policy support, regardless of its
   national context; this effect is mediated by perceived competition.
   Conversely, RWA predicts policy support only if the policy affects
   domestic immigration; this effect is mediated by perceptions of cultural
   threat. Consistent with prior research, the present findings highlight
   the role of perceived cultural threat to one's ingroup and perceived
   competition in shaping attitudes toward immigration and shed light on
   some of the motivations underlying the recent rise in popularity of
   strict immigration policies.},

Abstract = {We evaluate a theory of the effects of publishing performance
   information on citizens' collective voice to local providers about
   public service performance and the perceptions and attitudes that
   influence their voice. Field experiments show that information about low
   absolute and relative performance of local government household waste
   recycling services lowers citizens' perceptions of performance, and
   information about high absolute and relative performance raises
   perceived performance. Relative information makes citizens judge local
   providers as being more responsible for outcomes in the case of high
   performance, suggesting that systems for comparative performance
   reporting increase local accountability for outcomes. Negativity bias is
   evident, with information about low absolute performance reducing
   citizens' satisfaction but information about high performance not
   raising satisfaction. Information about low performance did not trigger
   collective voice protest behaviour as hypothesized, suggesting that
   providers who need citizens' collective voice the most do not get it.},

Abstract = {This article addresses Russia's role in the Asia-Pacific region and asks
   whether and how its conception of its role has changed. It is suggested
   that within Russia there is a re-evaluation of regionalism, underway in
   both academic and public spheres, which seeks to engage with
   Eurocentric' approaches to regionalism and, to some extent, challenge it
   - much of this remains at a discursive or rhetorical level. However,
   there is also evidence to show that Russia is attempting to diversify
   relations in the region away from China due to the overdependence of
   Russia's Far Eastern region on China in economic terms.},

   Essay (Research Note)},

Pages = {261-284},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to propose a periodization of the
   international policy between Quebec and the United States from a
   framework of analysis developed by Peter Hall. This framework covers two
   levels of analysis : the first level is interested in public policy
   instruments, while the second focuses on the paradigm of public action.
   From these two main criteria, we propose a periodization into five
   periods. The first period (1867-1960) is characterized by the absence of
   structured paradigm and the virtual absence of instrument with the
   exception of a commercial and tourist office in New York. The second
   period (1960-1976), reflects a desire to develop Quebec's largest
   presence in the United States with the creation of many instruments as
   the paradigm of public policy is gradually being built. The third period
   (1976-1980) is characterized by an awareness of the Quebec sovereignists
   of the importance of the United States. This period is noted for a
   significant paradigm shift. The fourth period (1980-2001) is marked by
   the free trade turn. The last period (2000 to present) is characterized
   by the importance of the new challenges that extend the paradigm of
   public policy such as security issues after 9/11, but also the energy
   and environmental issues.},

Abstract = {Most studies of the link between dyadic trade and militarized conflict
   examine the extent of trade interaction. However, interaction measures
   do not account for the impact of cutting off trade (i.e., exit costs).
   In this article, I highlight the link between exit costs, the cost of
   conflict, and the spoils of conquest, arguing that one state's exit
   costs are associated with higher incidence of dyadic conflict when its
   trade partner's exit costs are low. However, its exit costs become less
   aggravatingand eventually pacifyingas its trade partner's exit costs
   increase. I test this argument by estimating import demand and export
   supply elasticities, developing yearly exit cost measures for directed
   dyads, 1984-2000. Statistical tests confirm that unilaterally high exit
   costs are aggravating, but that jointly high exit costs are pacifying, a
   pattern most prominent for trade in strategic commodities.},

Abstract = {Ecological restoration has taken on a new significance in the face of
   climate change and biodiversity loss. Despite its growing policy
   salience, however, the social and political sciences have paid limited
   attention to the study of ecological restoration policy and practice. By
   drawing upon the political science study of multilevel governance,
   institutions, power relations, and place-based politics, a flavour is
   given of what a political science engagement might contribute to the
   rich tapestry of analysis that has already been produced by other
   disciplines on ecological restoration. As the use of restoration grows,
   it is increasingly likely that it will give rise to social dispute and
   be brought into conflict with a variety of environmental, cultural,
   economic, and community interests. Restoration policy and projects
   encounter professional and institutional norms as well as place-specific
   interests and values. There is urgent need to investigate how and in
   what ways some interests become winners and others losers in these
   activities, and how this in turn can influence ecological restoration
   outcomes. A political science lens could help build new criteria for
   evaluating the success of ecological restoration, ones that combine both
   process- and product-driven considerations.},

Abstract = {In theory, ecological citizenship (EC) has been suggested as a driver of
   individual pro-environmental behaviour (PEB), providing a more stable
   foundation for lifestyle changes than reliance on external policy tools.
   The relevance of EC for explaining PEB is tested by applying data from a
   Swedish survey designed to capture various aspects of EC. A significant
   proportion of Swedes fulfil the values-based requirements of ecological
   citizenship, as outlined in EC-theory. Furthermore, individuals who
   think along the lines of EC are more likely than others to behave in an
   environmentally friendly manner in their day-to-day activities. Certain
   aspects of EC are more important for PEB than others, which implies the
   need for further theoretical development of EC theory.},

Abstract = {The relatively low level of concern about climate change among Americans
   has important implications for climate policy. While many studies have
   examined individual characteristics associated with climate change
   attitudes, fewer studies have considered the effects of environmental
   conditions on such attitudes. Here, we use two national samples of
   American adults to explore the impact of abnormal daily temperatures on
   levels of concern about climate change. We test the hypotheses that (1)
   abnormally warm temperatures, and (2) both abnormally warm and
   abnormally cool temperatures are associated with higher levels of
   concern. Using a generalized ordinal logit, we find that the quadratic
   form of deviation from mean temperature on the date of the survey is
   significantly associated with higher levels of concern, thus supporting
   the second hypothesis. We discuss several theoretical frameworks that
   may explain this result including availability bias, mental models, and
   implicit stimuli, and the implications for climate policy.},

Journal = {HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {397-427},

Abstract = {Human rights law has begun to address the inequalities and exclusions
   that structure the domain of domestic work. The ``everyday{''} of
   exclusions from employment law and social security, and precarious
   migration status, had, until recently, attracted only limited attention.
   This article examines the reforms introduced in the Overseas Domestic
   Workers (ODW) visa regime in the United Kingdom. The move towards a more
   precarious migration status for migrant domestic workers marks a
   rejection of the reforms secured through sustained political activism.
   It also highlights the contingency and instability of political moments
   that secure progressive change for migrants, and the enduring limits of
   human rights law.},

Abstract = {This article analyses preferences for European economic governance in
   the European sovereign debt crisis. We assess citizens' opinions on
   increased intergovernmental co-operation and supranational governance in
   the economic sphere. We argue that current efforts to tackle the euro
   crisis do not benefit the typical `winners of European integration'.
   Moreover, European economic governance constitutes an even greater
   perceived threat to national identity, especially in the member states
   that fare well economically. Hypotheses are tested using multilevel
   analysis of Eurobarometer survey wave EB 75.3 (2011).},

Abstract = {Many view information and communication technologies (ICTs) such as
   mobile phones, computers and the Internet as tools that can
   significantly strengthen the quality and depth of Africa's engagement
   with the world economy. This paper interrogates the impacts of Africa's
   burgeoning ICT `revolution' through an examination of their use among
   small, medium and micro-scale enterprises (SMMEs) in South Africa's and
   Tanzania's wood products and tourism sectors. The findings reveal that
   while new ICTs are being adopted rapidly, they are generally used for
   communication purposes, not deeper forms of information processing and
   management. This `thintegration', while positive in many ways, has done
   little to stop a trend towards the devaluation of the goods and services
   provided by the SMMEs surveyed here. Moreover, ICTs are enabling new
   forms of outside intervention and intermediation into African markets,
   often further marginalising local firms and industries. The article
   details these outcomes and demonstrates why `thicker' and more
   transformative kinds of ICT integration will remain elusive in the
   absence of changes to non-ICT-specific structures and power relations
   that limit Africa's ability to participate in the global information
   economy.},

Abstract = {What role does the international diffusion of gender norms play in
   determining recent increases in women's political representation? We
   argue that norm diffusion has larger positive effects on women's cabinet
   representation than on women's legislative representation. We also show
   that within cabinets, norm diffusion affects low-prestige appointments
   more than high-prestige appointments. We test these arguments using an
   original database of ministers from 1979 to 2009 and find that the
   association of women's representation with three separate indicators of
   international diffusion-levels of women's representation among
   neighboring states, levels of women's representation among
   intergovernmental organization partners, and time since ratification of
   the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against
   Women-is consistent with our arguments.},

Abstract = {The thin capitalisation rule is the specific anti-avoidance rule which
   aims to protect national tax revenues from excessive debt financing of
   corporations. The literature indicates the effectiveness of thin
   capitalisation rules in limiting internal borrowing. Following in the
   footsteps of many countries, Slovenia introduced `thin cap' rules via a
   tax reform in 2005. The paper focuses on testing whether the
   introduction of the rule in 2005 has affected the level of internal
   borrowing in enterprises which are 25\% or more owned by foreign
   entities from the EU and, consequently, whether it has achieved its aim.},

Abstract = {Since the mid-1990s, there has been a debate about the social investment
   state model in advanced societies. Such an orientation towards
   preventive investment in education rather than redistribution (or social
   spending) raises the question of whether, and if so, what kinds of
   relationships exist between educational and economic inequalities. Based
   on an international comparison of 20 advanced economies, the results of
   the analyses suggest that the role of education as an `equalizer' should
   not be overestimated. Direct redistribution is much more likely than
   education to combat poverty in advanced societies. Yet increasing the
   mean literacy rate by reducing the proportion of low-literate adults is
   also positively associated with less economic inequality. Welfare states
   with `double liability'-investing in children's education and in more
   equal family conditions-therefore perform best in terms of economic
   inequality.},

Abstract = {Deeply divided societies would seem to be infertile ground for mass
   deliberation. Enclave deliberation', among people on the same side, may
   well occur. But people on opposing sides may not trust one another, they
   may not listen with an open mind, or they may regard the other side's
   arguments as insincere cover for sectional interests. Perhaps, though,
   we underestimate their deliberative capacities? This article examines a
   deliberative poll (DP) in the Omagh area of Northern Ireland, a society
   having only recently emerged from protracted violence, reflecting and
   reinforcing the deep divide between Catholics and Protestants. The topic
   - the future of the local schools - was one on which many of the issues
   were heavily impinged by the Catholic-Protestant divide. We examine the
   extent to which a representative sample, including both Catholics and
   Protestants, was able to deliberate constructively and how the
   experience changed their policy attitudes and their opinions of one
   another.},

Abstract = {Since 2006, Mexico has militarized its war on drugs, backed by the
   United States. Examination of this drug war from a critical political
   economic angle suggests that the neoliberal reforms implemented in
   Mexico over the past several decades have increased the size of the drug
   industry and that drug war rhetoric facilitates the containment of
   popular opposition to neoliberal policies. U.S. popular culture has
   contributed to legitimizing the drug war and making it more acceptable
   to the U.S. public. An analysis of selected movies, television series,
   and a video game shows that the themes presented in these productions
   are very similar to those conveyed by U.S. government officials and
   mainstream analysts. Indeed, popular culture messages reflect elite
   views of U.S. foreign policy because the media-entertainment industry is
   itself part of the corporate establishment. Desde 2006, Mexico, con el
   apoyo de los Estados Unidos, ha militarizado su guerra contra el
   narcotrafico. Una critica de esta guerra contra el narco de un punto de
   vista politico-economico sugiere que las reformas neoliberales
   implementadas en Mexico durante ya varias decadas han agrandado la
   industria de estupefacientes, y que la retorica de la guerra contra el
   narco facilita la contencion de la oposicion popular que se opone a la
   politica neoliberal. Mientras tanto, en los Estados Unidos, la cultura
   popular ha contribuido a legitimar y hacer mas aceptable la guerra
   contra el narco. Un analisis de peliculas y series de television
   seleccionadas, mas un juego de video, muestra que los temas presentados
   en estas producciones son muy parecidos a los difundidos por oficiales
   del gobierno de Estados Unidos y analistas convencionales. De hecho, los
   mensajes de la cultura popular reflejan las perspectivas de la elite con
   respecto a la politica exterior de los Estados Unidos porque los mismos
   medios de entretenimiento forman parte del establecimiento corporativo.},

Abstract = {The legend of Jesus Malverde articulates the myth of a
   late-nineteenth-century social bandit in Sinaloa, Mexico. Beatified at
   the grassroots, Malverde became known decades later as the patron saint
   of narcos (drug traffickers). In the past few years, this anticanonical
   figure has provoked controversy because of his supposed association with
   the criminal world. An examination of the meanings of sanctity and
   criminality in the Malverde cult in various cultural productions
   suggests that the worship of this bandit-saint originally reflected the
   asymmetrical power relationships in Sinaloa during the Porfirian
   modernizing period. His recent transformation into a narco-saint points
   to the integration into the global market of this region's contraband.
   The conflictive image of criminal and redeeming saint illustrates a form
   of emerging modernity in Sinaloa that represents the intimate desires of
   those worst affected by illegality and calls into question the unjust
   and exclusive official system. Beyond his role as a folk religious
   symbol, Malverde has acquired transnational influence as a laic saint
   identified with the vulnerability of the human condition under
   globalization. La leyenda de Jesus Malverde articula el mito de un
   bandido social sinaloense de fines del siglo 19. Beatificado por el
   pueblo, Malverde conocido decadas mas tarde como el santo patron de los
   narcos. En los ultimos anos esta figura anti-canonica ha provocado
   controversia por su supuesta asociacion con el mundo criminal. Un examen
   del significado de la santidad y la criminalidad en el culto a Malverde
   en varias producciones culturales sugiere que la adoracion a este
   bandido-santo en su origen refleja las relaciones asimetricas del poder
   en la Sinaloa porfiriana. Su transformacion en narco-santo apunta hacia
   la integracion del contrabando de droga de esta region al mercado
   global. La imagen conflictiva como criminal y santo redentor ilustra una
   forma de modernidad emergente en Sinaloa que representa los deseos mas
   intimos de los mas afectados por la ilegalidad y pone en tela de juicio
   el injusto y excluyente sistema oficial. Mas alla de su papel como
   simbolo religioso popular, Malverde ha llegado a tener influencia
   trasnacional como santo laico identificado con la vulnerabilidad de la
   condicion humana bajo la globalizacion.},

Volume = {51},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {257-271},

Abstract = {This article presents an eclectic review of the analytical study of
   terrorism that views all agents as rational decisionmakers. This
   analytical literature began in earnest with the seminal study of US
   skyjackings by William Landes in 1978. After 11 September 2001, the
   analytical literature on terrorism grew rapidly. Based on policy
   relevance, my survey article identifies five key areas of intense
   research interests. These include analyses of terrorist attack trends,
   the economic consequences of terrorism, the study of counterterrorism
   effectiveness, the causes of terrorism, and the relationship of
   terrorism and liberal democracies. New developments in the field focused
   on distinguishing key differences between domestic and transnational
   terrorism. Additionally, recent game-theoretic advances permitted more
   active agents and stages to the games. Other major developments involved
   the study of networked terrorists and the role of counterterrorism
   foreign aid. Fruitful future directions include using advanced
   econometric methods to discern the true impact of terrorism on growth,
   applying spatial econometrics to the study of terrorism, ascertaining
   the determinants of terrorist groups' longevity, and learning how to
   foster international counterterrorism cooperation.},

   Conflicts can expand when third parties perceive future threats from
   attackers, but how do they evaluate threats from coalitions rather than
   single states? Multilateral aggregations of power can generate fear in
   observers that coalitions may soon turn against them. Yet only some
   provoke opposition from observers, reducing their chances of success and
   expanding the conflict, while others do not. What accounts for this
   difference? I analyze a game-theoretic model of a third party's decision
   to intervene in an ongoing conflict and a coalition's decision to
   disband afterward, which is most likely when its preferences are
   diverse. When coalitions are powerful, an increasing diversity of
   foreign policy preferences reduces the probability that observer states
   balance against them, but when coalitions are weak, increasing diversity
   increases the probability of balancing. I find support for this
   conditional relationship between power, preferences, and balancing in a
   sample of 180 interstate crises from 1946 to 2000.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the outputs of a broader research. Such one has a
   general objective: to analyze the ways in which the link between living
   conditions and crime was reconstructed on social crime prevention
   policies in Argentina, during the first decade of 2000. We understand
   these linking as ``overlap spaces{''} between social and criminal
   policies. This perspective allows us to look up for historical changes
   observed on social and criminal policies, in order to apprehend the
   process involved on social crime prevention policies.
   According to this, we hold a hypothesis: the development of crime
   preventive policies on the early 2000s emerged from the encounter of two
   processes: on one hand, the centrality that ``workfare{''} assumes on
   the social policy field; on the other hand, the emergence of the idea of
   ``democratic security policy{''}, focused on the principles of
   prevention and participation, on the crime policy field. By the end of
   the decade, the centralization of social security on the social policy
   field and the emergence of the idea that ``democratic security
   policy{''} must be politically controlled, pointed the end of such
   strategic link.},

Abstract = {This article examines the effects the drone strike campaign in Pakistan
   is having on Al Qaeda Central. To that end, it constructs a theoretical
   model to explain how the campaign is affecting Al Qaeda's capacity to
   carry out terrorist attacks in the United States and Western Europe.
   Although the results of one single empirical case cannot be generalised,
   they nonetheless constitute a preliminary element for the construction
   of a broader theoretical framework concerning the use of armed drones as
   part of a counterterrorism strategy.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this work is to examine whether small
   municipalities can reduce costs through cooperation and delegation. We
   first examine factors explaining the decision of municipalities to
   cooperate and delegate service delivery responsibility, in this case
   residential solid waste services, to another government. Furthermore, we
   estimate the impact of cooperation on the costs of providing residential
   solid waste services. The empirical analysis is done using a sample of
   small Spanish municipalities. Results of the empirical analysis suggest
   that cooperation is a pragmatic choice for municipalities with a
   suboptimal size: municipalities that cooperate by delegating face lower
   costs for residential solid waste services than those that do not.
   Furthermore, we find that cooperation allows municipalities to save
   costs once we control for the form of production and other factors
   explaining costs.},

Abstract = {This article explores the motives that drive the Council of Europe's
   (CoE) engagement beyond its membership and examines the pathways that
   the organisation uses to export its core norms and values. Based on the
   discussion of the activities of the CoE in its core issue areas - that
   is, human rights, democracy and the rule of law - three analytically
   distinct instruments can be discerned that the organisation employs to
   influence the development in neighbouring regions and beyond:
   `inclusion,' `fieldwork' and `voice'. However, the discussion also
   demonstrates that the CoE's institutions are lacking a unified strategy
   as to how to engage with non-member states.},

Abstract = {International trade agreements lead to more foreign direct investment
   (FDI) in developing countries. This article examines the causal
   mechanisms underpinning this trade-investment linkage by asking whether
   institutional features of preferential trade agreements (PTAs), which
   allow governments to make more credible commitments to protect foreign
   investments, indeed result in greater FDI. The authors explore three
   institutional differences. First, they examine whether PTAs that have
   entered into force lead to greater FDI than PTAs that have merely been
   negotiated and signed, since only the former constitute a binding
   commitment under international law. Second, they ask whether trade
   agreements that have investment clauses lead to greater FDI. Third, they
   consider whether PTAs with dispute-settlement mechanisms lead to greater
   FDI. Analyses of FDI flows into 122 developing countries from 1971 to
   2007 show that trade agreements that include stronger mechanisms for
   credible commitment induce more FDI. Institutional diversity in
   international agreements matters.},

Abstract = {Despite all the talk of `hearts and minds' being the key to
   counterinsurgency, local public opinion is rarely studied and when it
   is, it often yields surprising conclusions. Through analyzing polling
   data from Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan, this article shows that public
   opinion is less malleable, more of an effect rather than a cause of
   tactical success, and a poor predictor of strategic victory. As a
   result, modern counterinsurgency doctrine's focus on winning popular
   support may need to be rethought.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates why and how French and German leaders converged
   on an agreement for reforming the European Monetary Union in response to
   the outbreak of the debt crisis in Europe. To answer these questions, we
   begin by revising Putnam's two-level game in order to offer a
   constructivist account of the politics of `grand bargains' in the
   European Union. The Eurozone negotiations, we argue, are better viewed
   as a simultaneous double game in which preferences are constructed and
   reconfigured as leaders address simultaneously the other European
   decision makers and their own constituencies. In a discursive
   institutionalist perspective, a frame analysis is conducted on the basis
   of press conference speeches and press interviews in 2011 and 2012. It
   is demonstrated that the Franco-German agreements on new policy and
   institutional arrangements were only possible because the respective
   leaders resorted to differing discourses in terms of paradigms, norms
   and values.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the emergence of the European Institute of
   Innovation and Technology (EIT), from the launch of the policy idea in
   2005 to the first EIT board decisions on knowledge and innovation
   communities in 2009. Earlier attempts to set- up a European institute
   have either failed or have taken a very long time and the initial idea
   of the EIT was risky and controversial. This raises the question of how
   and why the idea of the EIT took root so quickly. The analysis builds
   upon Kingdon's work and shows the important role of Barroso as policy
   entrepreneur and of contextual factors keeping the policy window open
   for a surprisingly long time.},

Abstract = {Instituted to try serious crimes committed during the Khmer Rouge
   period, including genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, the
   Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) has been
   heralded as an historic opportunity for the Court to develop
   international jurisprudence on reparations and to provide a workable
   model for how best to address victims' rights in international criminal
   trials. At the end of Case 001, however, the Court seems to have fallen
   well short of those expectations. This article examines how and why the
   ECCC failed to live up to the high expectations that accompanied its
   institution. It argues that political pressure, financial constraints,
   and the absence of a clear understanding of what ``collective and moral
   reparations{''} entail have all contributed to the Court's failure to
   realize its original intention to advance the international reparations
   agenda.},

   Enlargement'},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},

Volume = {36},
Number = {6},
Pages = {585-600},
Abstract = {The prospect of a constituent part of a European Union (EU) Member State
   attaining independence is growing. The year 2012 saw the confirmation of
   an independence referendum in Scotland, to take place in the fall of
   2014, and sub-state nationalism returned to the fore in Spain, Belgium
   and Italy. Currently, there is no clear mechanism through which to deal
   with a part of a Member State becoming an independent state. The premise
   of this article is that such a state of confusion is not conducive to
   the smooth functioning of the EU. The article argues that, in order to
   remain faithful to its normative principles and to avoid a dislocation
   in the single market, the EU must find a way to handle internal
   enlargement short of expelling new states that might emerge from
   existing Member States. The official position set out by the European
   Commission thus needs to be problematised.},

Abstract = {In 2004, Brazil submitted to the Commission on the Limits of the
   Continental Shelf (CLCS) a Submission for the outer limit of the
   Brazilian continental shelf for its extension beyond the limits of 200
   nautical miles. In 2007, the CLCS presented its recommendations, however
   it did not recommend four areas proposed by Brazil, the Amazon Fan among
   them. The objective of this study is to present the main legal and
   technical aspects of the controversy about the Amazon Fan, in order to
   evaluate some alternatives for a future submission, new or revised.},

   neoliberal global economy, using military power and other means to
   neutralize resistance and maintain global military dominance. A primary

   space and cyberspace. US hegemonic power is increasingly being
   challenged and so are its democratic institutions.},

Year = {2014},
Pages = {87-91},
Abstract = {The US-dominated nation-state system promotes nationalism and
   militarism. It imposes new forms of colonialism characterized by global
   resistance against the imposition of a US-led global neoliberal economy,
   increasing levels of inequality and violence. It suggests a global civil
   war within the human race itself a war against our own self Going to war
   once again and the election of a neoliberal government in 2013 suggest
   that the interests of war will continue to dominate the Australian
   political economy as part of the US empire project. In Gandhian terms it
   means that the struggle for peace within the individual, and therefore
   society, is increasingly being swayed towards the urge to dominate and
   wage wars on others.},

Abstract = {In 2007 five upper-middle-class white youths savagely beat domestic
   worker Sirlei Dias de Carvalho Pinto at a bus stop in the Tijuca
   neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. According to one assailant's confession,
   they had attacked her because they thought she was a prostitute. A cross
   reading of this event and a blackface performance about black women on
   Brazilian national television in 2008 suggests that in Brazil the
   dehumanization of the black female body in the popular imagination
   scripts black women as prostitutes, justifying and motivating violence.
   The attack on Carvalho was a disciplining moment that simultaneously
   reflected and marked her body as black and female. Black femaleness is
   marked as outside the social contract and, by extension, outside the
   moral order. Performative epistemologies of race/gender/sexuality in the
   popular imagination created the conditions necessary for this violence
   to occur.},

Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {366-379},
Abstract = {The question concerning the boundary between the religious and political
   is a continuously vexing question for Christians who want to contribute
   to public life and those who want to engage public life in a manner that
   is consistent with their spiritual lives. This article argues that the
   spiritual life, enacted in the practice of prayer, is not incidental to
   public life but actually constitutes a unique politics. Prayer bears in
   its practices a political theory that on the one hand provides areas of
   interface with secular political theory and practice, whilst at the same
   time providing a critique of many political presumptions of the status
   quo. The article will first look more generally at the relationship
   between practice and theory, before analysing how the embodied nature of
   prayer implicates the contours of a new public body. This new body in
   turn suggests new contours of what it means to be a political subject,
   new terms of citizenship, and flowing from that, a new kind of political
   modus vivendi, exemplified by new attitudes to the necessity of survival
   in politics.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-80},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to provide a structured overview of the most
   important research conducted in the field of international mediation.
   Although there are still strong similarities between the processes of
   international and domestic mediation, lack of a clear structure on the
   international level suggests that international mediation activities
   could be separately academically scrutinized. This literature review is
   aimed at illustrating the unique nature of international mediation.
   Design/methodology/approach - Various factors that affect the overall
   process and the outcome of international mediation efforts were
   clustered in four distinct yet interrelated groups. The first section
   illustrates various mediators' characteristics that might induce the
   disputants to accept mediation and agree to specific terms that were
   mediated in the process. In the second section two distinct factors
   affecting the mediation outcome were explained: contextual and
   behavioral. Finally, in the third sections various types of mediators
   were discussed.
   Findings - The article shows the intricate complexities of international
   mediation, highlighting four distinct features that might have an effect
   on the mediation outcome: mediator's characteristics, contextual
   features, behavioral factors, and types of mediators.
   Originality/value - This article attempts to offer a comprehensive
   overview of the current state of the art in international mediation, and
   suggests potential areas of future research.},

Abstract = {This article uses a collective-action framework to study the
   mobilization of the Arrow Boys (AB), a community defense militia in
   South Sudan. Drawing on general collective-action explanations, this
   article argues that the mobilization of the AB was facilitated by two
   factors: (1) a strong overlap of the fighter's private and the
   community's public benefit and (2) close social relationships and
   expectations within the community. The article supports these
   theoretical claims by, first, examining the scope conditions under which
   the AB formed and, second, drawing on individual interviews with AB
   members from Western Equatoria in South Sudan.},

Abstract = {Is there such a thing as Canadian neoconservatism ? Even though many
   analysts in Canadian foreign policy use this term to describe the Harper
   government and the << Calgary School >>, they fail to conceptualize
   precisely the political object in question. Some go as far as saying
   that this ideology was imported from the United States. This paper's
   goal is, first, to show the << recognition >> that American
   neoconservatives give to their Canadian counterparts and vice versa,
   thus illustrating the ideological proximity between these two
   neoconservatisms. However, the second portion of the article consists in
   proposing a generic definition of neoconservatism, to show that if it is
   warranted to speak of a Canadian neoconservatism to describe the Harper
   government and the << Calgary School >>, it is not a sign of American
   influence. Rather, Canadian neoconservatism has its own particularities
   and tradition.},

Abstract = {One of the two stated objectives of the new Research Note section of
   Political Psychology is to present short reports that highlight novel
   methodological approaches. Toward that end, we call readers' attention
   to the flanker task, a research protocol widely employed in the study of
   the cognitive processes involved with detection, recognition, and
   distraction. The flanker task has increasingly been modified to study
   social traits, and we believe it has untapped value in the area of
   political psychology. Here we describe the flanker taskdiscussing its
   potential for political psychologyand illustrate this potential by
   presenting results from a study correlating political ideology to
   flanker effects.},

Abstract = {China presents a paradox for scholars of environmental politics.
   Environmental politics and policymaking in China now includes elements
   critical to environmental protection in the West, including
   non-governmental participation and stringent environmental legislation.
   Yet the country's authoritarian system constrains popular participation,
   and environmental outcomes are generally poor. China's South-North Water
   Transfer Project (SNWTP) embodies this puzzle: despite the pluralisation
   and development of environmental politics and policymaking, the SNWTP is
   a technocratic mega-project that imposes high social, economic, and
   environmental costs. What explains this puzzle, and what are the
   implications for understanding environmental politics in other
   authoritarian developing countries? I evaluate two current theories -
   Ecological Modernisation and Authoritarian Environmentalism - against
   the SNWTP case, and argue that it illustrates the ability of governments
   to co-opt environmental politics to pursue other strategic objectives,
   in turn necessitating greater attention to the mix of persuasive and
   coercive strategies in environmental politics.},

   Introducing Global Policy's Special Section},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The 2013 Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) offers the first comprehensive, global
   and legally binding standards on the trade and transfer of conventional
   arms. The idea for the treaty was conceived not in the boardrooms of
   weapons manufacturers, nor in the assembly halls of statecraft, but
   rather by civil society activists and Nobel Laureates - practitioners,
   academics, survivors and researchers and advocates. And its robust
   provisions on human rights, humanitarian law and gender were championed
   by states often marginalized by traditional arms control. The resultant
   treaty is a sort of `platypus' of international law - simultaneously an
   arms control regime, an instrument of human rights and humanitarian law
   and a trade agreement. Given its widespread acceptance and likely rapid
   entry into force, it could have a wide-ranging impact on global policy
   making in many issue areas. But as with any new framework of global
   policy, the ATT represents a compromise, recognizing the legitimacy of
   states' rights to trade in weapons. This special section on the ATT,
   written from the perspective of scholars and practitioners associated
   with the civil society campaign that championed the treaty, reviews the
   ATT's normative implications, role of NGOs and implementation
   challenges.},

Abstract = {Kaldor's `new wars' argument has stimulated a forceful debate over the
   last decade. Albeit providing important insights, this debate has
   messily conflated arguments, concepts and theories. As a result, when it
   comes to enhancing our understanding of contemporary armed conflicts, it
   is bringing diminishing results. In this article we suggest avenues for
   further research and point to current research programs that may help
   put the debate `back on track' and push the discussion forward by
   examining systematically some of the aspects Kaldor described as
   defining features of `new wars'. Concretely, we stress the importance of
   undertaking a longer historical perspective for drawing inferences; call
   for bringing warfare in the study of civilian victimization; highlight
   the conceptual differences between `new wars' and civil wars and
   emphasize the importance of taking their transnational dimension
   seriously; make a plea for disaggregation for capturing relevant
   temporal and spatial variation; and draw attention to new data sets and
   the opportunities they offer to statistically test the `new wars'
   argument. In a concluding section, we broadly outline the significance
   of this discussion for policy making.},

Title = {Communicative Interaction Between Mexico and Its International Critics
   Around the Issue of Military Jurisdiction: ``Rhetorical Action{''} or
   ``Truth Seeking Arguing{''}?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},

Abstract = {During the government of Felipe Calderon (2006-2012), international
   advocates showed particular concern about the issue of military
   jurisdiction. They persistently argued that violations of human rights
   by members of the armed forces should be prosecuted through the civil
   system of penal justice. The government responded by developing a clear
   and coherent human-rights-oriented discourse. This article studies this
   process of communicative interaction, recurring to the notions of
   ``rhetorical action{''} and ``truth seeking arguing.{''} Which one of
   these two modes of communicative interaction dominated? And, what does
   this tell us about the reach of the socialization process around the
   issue of military jurisdiction in Mexico? The article concludes that
   ``rhetorical action{''} was the dominant mode of communicative
   interaction, suggesting that the Calderon government developed
   human-rights-oriented arguments in order to advance its previously
   defined preferences and interest, and that therefore the socialization
   process was rather limited.},

Abstract = {The emergence of the economic and financial crisis has already shown
   important electoral and political consequences in southern Europe.
   Drawing on the experience of two bailed-out countries, Greece and
   Portugal, we use original data collected before and after 2008 to
   examine how patterns of political representation have changed during
   this period. We argue that austerity measures have significantly
   affected the way MPs represent their electorates, namely in terms of
   policy congruence. In addition, the economic crisis has also deepened
   the legitimacy crisis in both countries. Finally, we find that the
   short-term impact of the crisis has had a greater impact on voters'
   attitudes than on those of their representatives.},

Abstract = {This work addresses the dimensions and content of ideological space in
   Portugal and Greece after the onset of the sovereign debt crisis and the
   imposition of austerity policies in the two countries. By examining both
   elite interviews and public opinion data, the article principally
   attempts to determine whether the economic crisis has created a new
   division in ideological space by cross-cutting or completely replacing
   older ones. In addition, we attempt to gauge the position of
   crisis-related issues relative to issue divides on European integration
   and globalisation which, up to now, have been dormant in Southern
   European countries.},

Abstract = {This qualitative paper deals with the challenges of translating
   culturally competent care into practice. It looks at how those working
   in oncology and reproductive medicine engage with adults from South
   Asian and white ethnic backgrounds, whose fertility might be affected by
   cancer. Our findings suggest practitioners, despite a commitment to
   sensitive care, struggle to engage with cultural diversity and
   reconciling individual behaviour with what they think they know about
   South Asian cultures. This creates misunderstandings, leading to poor
   practice. Our conclusion explores the extent to which practitioners can
   adopt more sensitive practice by understanding that cultural beliefs are
   negotiable.},

Abstract = {Despite a plethora of policy and scholarly discussions on how
   overlapping memberships affect the implementation of rules of origin
   meant to facilitate trade within regional trade agreements (RTAs) of
   developing countries, there has yet to be any theory development or
   empirical test to verify these claims. This article re-examines these
   previous discussions and articulates and empirically tests a theoretical
   model on the effects that overlapping memberships have had on intra-RTA
   trade. Using measures of overlapping memberships at both the RTA and
   country levels of analysis, I find that overlapping memberships in RTAs
   involving developing countries have had a negative effect on intra-RTA
   trade levels. These findings shed light on steps developing countries
   can take to address overlapping memberships and strengthen regional
   integration at a time when there is a push for north south trade
   agreements such as those the European Union is negotiating with several
   of these developing countries.},

Abstract = {Social loafing is a common social disease whereby individuals exhibit
   lower performance when they work in a group than when they work alone,
   causing waste of manpower in organizations. Past researches on
   antecedent variables of social loafing tend to focus on the impacts of
   the personal and job characteristics within organizations, but few have
   considered the impacts of external factors on social loafing. This study
   takes as its object of investigation the tax collectors of Taipei
   National Tax Administration, which has reformed itself as a ``tax
   service agency,{''} with the purpose of exploring the effect of
   taxpayers' collaborative behaviors in the service production and
   delivery processes on the perceived social loafing of tax collectors. It
   finds empirically that all three kinds of collaborative behaviors (i.e.,
   voluntary compliance, trust, and evaluative feedback) and the aggregate
   thereof, as perceived by tax collectors, have significant negative
   correlations with the perceived social loafing of tax collectors. What
   is more, the effects of these collaborative behaviors on tax collectors'
   perceived social loafing are greater than those of the control variables
   in this study (i.e., the employees' job involvement and job
   characteristics). These results provide powerful evidence for the
   feasibility of direct citizen participation in the production and
   delivery processes of public services and indicate that the government
   should prioritize decreasing the perceived social loafing in service
   agencies via direct citizen participation.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to contribute towards greater theoretical and
   empirical understanding about medical tourism developments globally.
   This evidence leads us to examine some widely-held assumptions regarding
   the size and shape of global medical travel. Our paper examines three
   central issues: (1) Do published figures and projections `add-up', are
   figures from multiple sources consistent, and what decisions and
   interests are involved for those compiling these statistics? (2) How
   should any emerging global industry be understood and explained? (3)
   Given this analysis and market understanding how, if at all, can
   national governments stimulate activity?},

Abstract = {The research on the influence of democracy on terrorism renders support
   for two causal mechanisms. One is that democracy reduces terrorism
   because it creates an environment in which dissenters can pursue their
   interests through peaceful means. The other argument states that
   democracy encourages terrorism due to the intrinsic liberties and
   freedoms that provide an opportunity for terrorists to easily organize,
   recruit, and mount operations. This article contributes to this second
   line of thought by framing support for rebel groups as one of the
   contexts in which democracy's influence on terrorism is examined. I
   identify a theoretical mechanism about how democratic states unknowingly
   facilitate terrorism by letting terrorists freely stay within their
   borders, raise funds, smuggle arms, and operate offices. The empirical
   findings provide support for the hypothesis that democracies are
   vulnerable and can easily be exploited by terrorists since they have an
   environment conducive to terrorist activities.},

Abstract = {Policy development and implementation should ideally be informed by
   assessments and evaluations, but research has shown that their use is
   far from straightforward in politicised environments. Their role in the
   adoption and evolution of policy innovations, which fundamentally change
   policy, has not been extensively analysed. Here, I show that the role
   can be understood using a new framework that bridges the gap between an
   agency-dominated innovation management perspective and a
   process-oriented transition perspective. I apply this framework to
   examine the evolution of an important policy innovation: the EU
   emissions trading system (ETS). In the political struggle to introduce
   and maintain the ETS, the role of evaluations and assessments has
   changed from destabilisation and reframing to consolidation. The
   analysis underlines the importance of the interaction between Member
   States, EU institutions, and non-state actors in the often-neglected
   stabilisation phase of EU-level policy innovations.},

Abstract = {The present study investigates how Poles perceive the post-communist
   political system of contemporary Poland. A nationwide random sample of
   400 adults was selected, using a probability quota sampling strategy,
   and interviewed face-to-face in respondents' homes. The chief outcome
   variables were: full acceptance, conditional acceptance, and rejection
   of the Polish version of democracy. The majority of respondents
   generally approved, fully or at least conditionally, the new democratic
   system in Poland. Multiple regression analyses showed that differential
   attitudes toward Polish democracy depend on respondents' age, their
   understanding of the concept of democracy, evaluations of democracy in
   general, and levels of political anomie. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Pages = {527-538},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Scholarly work on the impact of domestic politics on international
   cooperation has grown significantly over time. Unfortunately, there is a
   democratic bias to much of this literature as scholars typically focus
   on the relative advantage of democracies at cooperation. Our paper seeks
   to shed more light on the cooperation potential of autocracies by
   distinguishing different types of autocratic regimes. We argue that
   autocracies that more closely resemble democracies in the institutional
   characteristics that have been found to be important for cooperation
   (that is, greater leader accountability, limited policy flexibility, and
   greater transparency) should be more successful at cooperation and thus
   more likely to cooperate with one another and with democracies.
   Specifically, we expect single-party and military regimes to be
   advantaged at international cooperation compared to personalist systems.
   We test our theoretical expectations using the 10 Million International
   Dyadic Events data (1990-2004) and find support for our theoretical
   argument.},

Abstract = {This article responds to Michael Saward's call for a more
   context-specific approach to the study of democracy by exploring
   developments in, obstacles to, and prospects for, a more deliberative
   and participatory model of democracy in the UK. A review is undertaken
   first of the New Labour and coalition governments' attempts at
   constitutional reform, in order to assess the implications these efforts
   have had, and continue to have, for the institutionalisation of such a
   model of democracy. Despite proclamations of lofty ambition successive
   UK governments have wrapped themselves in the straightjacketing logic of
   the Westminster model of parliamentary government. As a consequence
   their actual proposals lack ambition and are often incoherent. The story
   told in this respect is therefore one of largely unrealised rhetoric.
   The `largely' qualifier is included, however, in recognition of the
   space created by Labour's constitutional reforms for participation at
   the peripheries of governance. The second section of the article focuses
   on these spaces by, first, commenting briefly on whether the
   participatory aspirations of the architects of Scottish devolution have
   been realised before, second, examining the use of specific deliberative
   mechanisms-such as citizens' juries, deliberative polls and
   participatory budgeting-at varying locations within the political system
   and in public agencies and services. Evidence of democratic innovation
   is presented; however, any optimism on this front must be tempered, as
   the power-sharing potential of such mechanisms, and their capacity to
   move us towards a more comprehensive and joined-up deliberative system
   in the UK, is hampered by the lack of a facilitating institutional
   landscape. Finally, an overview is provided of the three remaining
   articles that make up this special section on deliberative and
   participatory democracy in the UK.},

Abstract = {No productivist model of socialism has ever existed in Cuba. Rather, the
   Cuban approach has drawn on a hybrid of ethical principles with some
   consistent strategic themes. Cuba's socialist strategy has been
   reformulated quite flexibly, in relation to these principles and
   historical circumstances, and this flexibility seems to have been
   important in allowing Cuban socialism to adapt and survive. More
   recently, Cuba has looked for a selective engagement with the global
   economy, advancing its strong service sectors while protecting key
   domestic services and domestic food production. The major in-principle
   change in recent years has been the licensing of the hiring of private
   labor. Changes to Cuba's microeconomy are also best understood through
   the lens of ethical socialism and adaptation. Special attention to
   Cuba's microeconomy is warranted because of the complex relation between
   wages, subsidized prices, and shared services.},

Abstract = {The main aim of the paper is to measure the relative efficiency of the
   R\&D sector in the EU-27 at the regional level. For this purpose, the
   paper applies a non-parametric approach, i.e. data envelopment analysis
   (DEA), to assess the relative technical efficiency of R\&D activities
   across selected EU (NUTS-2) regions. The empirical analysis integrates
   available inputs (R\&D expenditures, researchers and employment in
   high-tech sectors) and outputs (patent and high-tech patent
   applications) over the 2005 2010 period. The empirical results show that
   among regions with a high intensity of R\&D activities the most
   efficient performers are Noord-Brabant (Netherlands), Stuttgart
   (Germany) and Tirol (Austria). In contrast, a wide range of NUTS-2
   regions from the Baltics, Eastern and Southern Europe is characterized
   by an extremely low rate of knowledge production and its efficiency,
   particularly in Poland (Mazowieckie), Lithuania (Lietuva), Latvia
   (Latvija), Romania (Bucuresti-Ilfov), Bulgaria (Yugozapaden), Slovakia
   (Zapadne Slovensko), Greece (Attiki), Spain (Canarias) and Italy
   (Sardegna).},

Abstract = {How do women fare under rule by Islamists? Whereas some scholarly work
   suggests that Islamists are effective at providing the type of social
   services that benefit women most, other studies contend that Islamic
   groups support pro-male policies and cultural interventions that
   disadvantage the well-being of women. In order to adjudicate between
   these views, I compare two neighborhoods in Greater Cairo that are
   similar on a number of dimensions but in one, a militant Islamist group
   came to dominate local politics, whereas in the other, strongmen ruled
   the streets in the absence of a strong state presence. Using an original
   data set of retrospective health histories for women in each
   neighborhood, I find that women subject to governance by the Islamic
   group enjoyed better outcomes related to reproductive health than a
   statistically matched set of women in the comparable neighborhood while
   being no more likely to marry early or drop out of school.},

Abstract = {A tide of oppression against sexual minorities disturbs current theories
   explaining the globalization of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender
   (LGBT) rights. But unlike the turn in race theory exploring rights as an
   outgrowth of marginalization, research on LGBT rights still focuses on
   structural changes or the influence of Western LGBT forms. This article
   argues that a powerful new and globalizing state homophobia is a
   convenient tool for state actors threatened by structural adjustment
   mandates from above and demands for greater opportunity from below. In
   such contexts, state actors and allies import ready-made LGBT identities
   as bogeymen, but in an unintended consequence, organizing among sexual
   minorities refracts those identities in transformative ways. From
   research in France, Uganda, and Egypt, this article concludes that some
   contexts, where the state targets LGBT rights claims as hostile, are
   better served through a politics of social and political capabilities
   over rights and identities to allow space for sexual minorities to
   develop.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to analyse the shift away from the moral certainties
   of the Cold War epoch and of humanitarian interventions in the 1990s, to
   suggest that `evil' plays a very different role in politics and
   international relations today. In current constructions of the world -
   as much more global, complex and non-linear - the past certainties of
   liberal internationalism appear to be a symptom of problematic moral
   hubris. Rather than the transcendental moral certainties of good and
   evil, globalization and complexity seem to suggest a more immanent
   perspective of emergent causality, eliciting a reflexive ethics of
   continual work on `good' public modes of being. In which case, `evil' is
   no longer considered to be an exception but becomes normalized as an
   ethical learning resource. The 2011 case of the mass killings by
   Norwegian Anders Breivik will be highlighted as an example of this
   process. This article suggests that this `democratization' of evil is
   problematic in articulating evil as a revealed or emergent truth in the
   world that requires social and personal self-reflexivity, thereby
   suborning moral choice to onto-ethical necessity.},

Abstract = {In recent years, translation has begun to be employed in
   multidisciplinary policy studies as a more constructivist alternative to
   the established policy transfer literature. While both transfer and
   translation acknowledge the complex nature of communication in the
   adaptation of policies to new contexts, they are yet to investigate the
   impact of communication types on the modification of policies. This
   study draws upon public relations theory in order to develop four modes
   of translation in the transfer of policy. The modes are utilized as a
   means of illustrating how two-way communication between both borrowers
   and lenders, and borrowers and policy stakeholders is most likely to
   increase the chances of policy success. The practicality of the
   theoretical model is illustrated through examples of congestion charge
   translation in Stockholm and Greater Manchester.},

Title = {Development of the environmental taxes and charges system in Estonia:
   international convergence mechanisms and local factors},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},

Volume = {35},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {It is often claimed that the development of new policy areas (e.g.
   environmental policy, innovation policy) in Central and Eastern European
   (CEE) countries was initiated and influenced by international events and
   organizations (e.g. the European Union, International Monetary Fund, and
   United Nations) in the 1990s when these countries became independent and
   opened up to the Western world. This article seeks to clarify the
   importance and role of exogenous and endogenous explanatory factors in
   the adoption and development of new policy instruments (NPIs). This
   article proposes an adjusted theoretical framework of convergence
   mechanisms and a brief systemized overview of local factors to analyze
   and explain to what extent international factors influenced the
   development process of new fiscal instruments in practice in CEE
   countries with the example of the establishment of the environmental
   taxes and charges system in Estonia. Based on qualitative interviews
   with Estonian environmental policy experts as well as law and document
   analysis, this article concludes that the Estonian case study highlights
   the significance of policy learning, harmonization, and coercive
   imposition but most apparently, and contrary to common belief, different
   domestic factors have played a more essential role in shaping the NPIs.},

Abstract = {Deliberative democrats assume that political deliberation is capable of
   transforming citizens' opinions and attitudes. This article takes this
   assumption as a starting point and tries to test it empirically by
   determining whether deliberation in an inter-group setting induces more
   positive out-group attitudes. Based on data from two deliberative
   experiments in Belgium, we argue that the overall effect of deliberative
   quality on attitude change is limited. The most important determinant of
   changes in out-group attitudes is the group composition. Citizens who
   are confronted with the out-group are more likely to hold more positive
   out-group attitudes afterwards.},

Title = {Local Elections as a `Stepping Stone': Does Winning Council Seats Boost
   the Liberal Democrats' Performance in General Elections?},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},

Volume = {62},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {In this article, we use a structural equation model (latent variable
   mediator analysis) to show that a strong local base has two key effects
   on Liberal Democrat support in the 2010 general election. First, it has
   a direct effect on Liberal Democrat support at Westminster elections by
   bridging the electoral `credibility gap'. Second, local success has a
   significant indirect effect on party performance through campaign
   effort. Here we find that the Liberal Democrats obtain appreciable
   electoral benefits where they campaign intensely. They also use
   grassroots campaigning to recruit local activists and party workers,
   which cements the local party infrastructure and enables the party to be
   more effective in targeting local resources. The total standardised
   effect is therefore fairly substantial even after controlling for an
   array of other predictors. It is also larger than the total effect of
   local election success on both Conservative and Labour Party support in
   2010. Far from being inconsequential, winning seats at the local level
   provides a significant boost to the Liberal Democrats' performance in
   general elections.},

Abstract = {I examine how anger stemming from violence in the Israel-Palestine
   conflict influences intragroup retaliation. In July 2010 I conducted a
   series of experiments in two cities in the Southern District of Israel
   affected to varying degrees (high and low) by rocket fire from the Gaza
   Strip. For each experiment, subjects were partnered anonymously with a
   member of their community. They were then exposed to one of two
   emotional manipulations: one that induced anger or one that did not.
   Finally, each subject was given an opportunity to keep an endowment or
   allocate it towards destroying a portion, or all, of their partner's
   income (pay to punish) in retaliation for their partner having taken
   money from them previously. This decision to pay to punish was designed
   to closely mimic the costly nature of conflict. The findings suggest
   that anger has a conditional effect on decisions to pay to punish: in
   Sderot (most affected by rocket fire), anger decreases punishment, while
   in Ofakim (less affected), it increases punishment. Additionally, higher
   exposure to violence made subjects more likely to engage in negative
   reciprocity.},

Abstract = {This article explores the Post-Amnesty Programme (PAP), launched in 2009
   following the decision of some insurgent militia leaders in the Niger
   Delta to `drop their weapons in exchange for peace' with Nigeria's
   federal government. It addresses the following questions: how has the
   PAP been shaped by the politics of the Nigerian state, and elite and
   transnational oil interests? Is the trade-off between peace and justice
   sustainable when such peace fails to address the roots of the
   grievances? The article argues that the PAP is an unsustainable
   state-imposed peacebuilding project to preserve the conditions for oil
   extraction by local, national and global actors.},

Abstract = {Financing of local public services is, in principle, subject to the
   European Union State aid law and policy. Thus, local authorities of the
   Member States and certain other stakeholders shall carefully observe
   complex and restrictive State aid rules, since their breach can
   substantially impair the desired performance of local public services.
   However, the daily practice at the local level, in particular within the
   new Member States, still reveals significant shortcomings, which can be
   at least to a certain extent imputed to complexity and considerable
   rigidity of the State aid rules. The European Commission has recently
   offered a new set of rules, the so-called, Almunia package, aimed at
   bridging the said problems. The Almunia package is of great importance
   for the local public services and their stakeholders as it has offered
   considerable simplifications for the small, mostly locally oriented
   projects. Indeed, the new package is an important step in the right
   direction, at least from the local public services perspective.},

Abstract = {In the wake of the global financial crisis, interest in the relationship
   between the economy and the environment substantially increased. Several
   proposals emerged between 2008 and 2012 for the creation of a `Green New
   Deal', `Green Stimulus', and a `Green Economy'. These proposals are
   often conflated with one another under the rubric of `green capitalism',
   but there are important distinctions to be made between them. Each
   suggests a different role for the state in regulating the market and the
   financial sector (i.e. they suggest different models of capitalism). The
   proposals can also be distinguished by the positions taken on ecological
   modernisation (i.e. they put forward different models of `greenness').
   Recognition that there are varieties of green capitalism being mooted
   increases the opportunities for more targeted critiques of each model
   and enables a more constructive debate about the options for creating
   sustainable economies in the developed world.},

Abstract = {When do international treaties cause domestic policy adjustments? While
   previous research emphasizes the consequences of treaty ratification, we
   argue that the need to secure entry into force can induce states to
   change their policies already before ratification. If a state expects
   benefits from a treaty, it can increase the probability of foreign
   ratification by implementing policies that benefit pivotal domestic
   players within its partner country. Accordingly, studies that focus on
   policy change after ratification underestimate the importance of
   treaties and partly misconstrue the causal connection between treaties
   and policies. We test the theory against data on the relationship
   between North-South preferential trading agreements (PTAs) and
   automobile emission standards, finding that developing countries adopt
   automobile emission standards between the signature and ratification of
   North-South PTAs.},

Abstract = {Does development aid attract foreign direct investment (FDI) in
   post-conflict countries? This article contributes to the growing
   literature on effects of aid and on determinants of FDI by explaining
   how development aid in low-information environments is a signal that can
   attract investment. Before investing abroad, firms seek data on
   potential host countries. In post-conflict countries, reliable
   information is poor, in part because governments face unusual incentives
   to misrepresent information. In these conditions, firms look to signals.
   One is development aid, because donors tend to give more to countries
   they trust to properly handle the funds. Our results show that aid seems
   to draw FDIhowever, this is conditional on whether the aid can be
   considered geostrategically motivated. We also show that this effect
   decreases as time elapses after the conflict. This suggests that aid's
   signaling effect is specific to low-information environments, and helps
   rule out alternative causal mechanisms linking aid and FDI.},

Abstract = {This article argues that when democracy is not yet institutionalized,
   leaders have little incentive to push for clean elections, in part
   because they are likely to face accusations of fraud from domestic
   opposition groups regardless of their true behavior. Reputable
   international election observers can facilitate self-enforcing democracy
   by providing credible information about the quality of elections, thus
   increasing citizens' ability to coordinate against the regime when
   election fraud occurs, and discrediting sore loser protests. Patterns of
   postelection protests are consistent with the argument, including that
   postelection protests are more likely and last longer following negative
   reports from international observers. International election observers
   help promote democracy by making postelection protest more accurate in
   the short term, thereby increasing incentives for leaders to hold
   democratic elections in the long term.},

Abstract = {Two parallel norms mandate an international duty to hold state leaders
   individually accountable for serious corruption and human rights crimes.
   The development of these new norms is poorly explained by realist and
   neoliberal perspectives, but there are also weaknesses in recent
   constructivist explanations of norm diffusion that emphasize agency at
   the expense of structure. Such approaches have difficulty explaining the
   source of and similarities between new norms, and treat norm
   entrepreneurs as prior to and separate from their environment. In
   contrast, drawing on sociological institutionalism, we present a more
   structural explanation of individual accountability norms. The norms
   derive from an overarching modernist world culture privileging
   individual rights and responsibilities, as well as rational-legal
   authority. This culture is more generative of norm entrepreneurs than
   generated by them. The specific norms are instantiated through a process
   of theorization within permissive post-Cold War conditions, and diffused
   via mimicry, professionalization, and coercive isomorphism.},

Abstract = {Entering the twenty-first century, China has demonstrated an assertive
   foreign policy, not only in employing various types of economic and
   military leverage but also in conducting the Three Warfares (??) -
   psychological warfare, public opinion warfare, and legal warfare. This
   article attempts to identify the motives and methods of China's Three
   Warfares by analyzing its history, logic, and agents. Based on this
   analysis, the author also presents the position of the Three Warfares in
   China's foreign policy and the warfares' impact on the international
   security environment involving other major powers and China's neighbors.},

Abstract = {3D printing (3DP) is a classic disruptive technology that is likely to
   have a huge and widespread impact on the world. This revolutionary
   technology is likely to dramatically change business models, shift
   production location, shrink supply chains, and alter the global economic
   order, potentially degrading the importance of the Asian export
   manufacturing platforms and revitalizing the US innovation engine and
   the US economy. In the process, 3DP will change the `global operating
   environment' for policy makers as well as business and labor. 3DP is
   already a proven `general purpose' technology that is being used for an
   enormous range of applications, such as fabricating spare and new parts
   for planes, trains and automobiles and thousands of items in between. It
   has huge environmental benefits, including substantial reduction in
   resources consumed in production, manufacturing products only on demand,
   and `just in time production' of goods at or near where they are
   consumed, greatly reducing the carbon footprint of goods produced and
   shipped thousands of miles to consumers.},

Abstract = {This article assesses South Africa's foreign policy commitment to human
   rights by studying the country's role in the United Nations Human Rights
   Council, which began its work in 2006. South Africa's behavior is
   evaluated in terms of its participation in four aspects of the Council's
   work: the institution-building phase that took place during the body's
   first year, country-specific human rights issues, thematic human rights
   problems, and the Universal Periodic Review. It is concluded that South
   Africa has become a defender of unpalatable regimes and an obstacle to
   the international promotion of human rights.},

Abstract = {The majority of scholarly debates on varieties of Jewish nationalism
   focus on the Jewish man's role in the rebuilding of the Jewish homeland
   and his body in the regeneration of the Jewish nation. This article
   discusses Zionism's gender politics surrounding the Jewish woman's body
   and selfhood in this rebirth process and the formation of a modern
   Jewish identity in interwar Poland. It explores Jewish patriarchal
   structures and the discursive power and reach of Zionist ideology.
   Jewish women engaged not only in the ideological rebirth of the Jewish
   nation, they also initiated the physical rebirth of the Jewish Woman who
   was deemed too urban and thus degenerate (the modern Jewish woman was
   viewed as possessing next to no ideological consciousness and physical
   strength). Therefore, Zionist female ideologues argued that the bodily
   rebirth of Jewish women would lead to the strengthening of their Jewish
   identities and inevitably the Jewish stock. While still in the Diaspora,
   women had to work on developing strong healthy bodies, inasmuch as
   Zionist men were expected to make themselves into strong muscular Jews
   to be able to immigrate to Palestine and work there productively.
   Besides being able to work in Palestine alongside Jewish men,
   nationalist Jewish women had to be strong and healthy for one more
   reason: they had to be able to give birth to healthy children, which in
   the Zionist context meant giving birth to a healthy Jewish nation.},

Abstract = {Given the onset of a violent rebellion by an armed non-state group, how
   do states re-establish intra-state peace and hence fulfill their basic
   function as providers of internal security? In this article I argue that
   one way governments perform this core function is by recruiting
   non-combatants into local self-defense units called civilian defense
   forces (CDFs). By providing for local security, leveraging their
   superior local knowledge, and provoking insurgent reprisals against
   civilians, CDF units facilitate the influx of tactical intelligence as
   well as isolate insurgents from non-combatant populations physically as
   well as politically. Consistent with the argument, statistical analyses
   of two different cross-national data sets of insurgencies from 1944 to
   2006 reveal that a state is 53 percent more likely to vanquish a
   guerrilla threat if the incumbent deploys CDFs. The analyses also cast
   doubt on a recent claim in the literature that incumbent force
   mechanization adversely affects the states' ability to counter insurgent
   threats. Given that CDF deployment is a more easily manipulable variable
   than most other elements of state power, CDFs appear to be an effective
   instrument of counterinsurgency deserving of further academic and policy
   attention.},

Title = {What do policy-makers do with scientific uncertainty? The incremental
   character of Swedish climate change policy-making},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {22-39},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {This article explores how policy-makers are managing scientific
   uncertainty in policy-making. This is done through a case study of the
   Swedish climate change policy process from 1975 to 2007, based on
   interviews and an extensive review of official publications and
   documents. The study shows that scientific uncertainty played a very
   marginal role in the development of Swedish climate politics. When faced
   with scientific uncertainty, policy-makers came to rely more on
   knowledge of what was politically possible to do, than on what was
   desirable from a scientific perspective. Thereby, policy-making became
   incremental in character. The article argues that in order to understand
   the dynamics involved, we need to pay attention to how scientific
   knowledge and uncertainty are translated from a scientific context into
   a political one. These framings, done by knowledge brokers, are crucial
   for the use of scientific knowledge in politics. Scientific uncertainty
   negatively impacts scientists' willingness to act as knowledge brokers
   and thereby the possibility of policy-makers to use knowledge. The
   article argues that despite the lessons from previous research, there
   seems to be a need for empirically grounded studies that highlight the
   limits of the rational paradigm captured in, for example, evidence-based
   decision-making.},

Abstract = {Despite increasing concern over the potential threat from forest jihad,
   there has been no systematic attempt to assess whether such attacks are
   in fact taking place. Drawing on principles from the geospatial
   profiling of terrorist events, fire-risk prediction data, and
   information on jihadist convictions, this article offers a thorough
   review of the evidence to address this question. The available
   information suggests that so far, jihadists have not attempted to attack
   North American or European wildlands by means of arson. Despite calls
   for popular resistance terrorism in the jihadist literature, and the
   apparently low costs associated with this type of attack, jihadists have
   so far shown little appetite for forest jihad.},

Abstract = {The United States government has adopted new approaches to counter
   violent extremist organizations around the world. ``Soft security{''}
   and development programs include focused educational training for groups
   vulnerable to terrorist recruitment, norm messaging through local radio
   programming, and job creation in rural communities. This article
   evaluates the effectiveness of one set of these multi-vectored,
   community-level programs through data from 200 respondents in two
   similar, neighboring towns in northern Mali, Africa. The data show that
   residents in Timbuktu who were exposed to the programming for up to five
   years displayed measurably altered civic behavior and listening patterns
   in comparison with their counterparts in the control town of Dire, which
   had no programming (controlling for potential covariates including age,
   ethnicity, and political and socioeconomic conditions). However, there
   was little measurable difference between the groups in terms of their
   cultural identities and attitudes towards the West. While this study is
   unable to definitively prove a causal connection between programming and
   behavioral outcomes, it nonetheless strongly suggests that the process
   of ``winning hearts and minds{''} can be effective at certain levels but
   may require extended time and dedicated resources to generate
   higher-level results.},

   cross-country patterns},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {21},
Number = {9, SI},
Pages = {1330-1349},
Abstract = {The political control of the bureaucracy is a major theme in public
   administration scholarship, particularly in delegation theory. There is
   a wide range of policy instruments suitable for the purpose of control.
   In practice, however, there are economic and political limitations to
   deploying the full arsenal of control tools. We explore the implications
   of the costs of control by examining cross-country patterns of fire
   alarms. We identify and categorize a set of control instruments and
   their rationale using accountability typologies. We then code the
   presence or absence of different instruments by drawing on an original
   dataset of 14 instruments in a population of 17 European countries.
   Using configurational analysis, we analyse cross-country patterns. In
   the conclusions, we reflect on the patterns identified, their
   implications for controlling bureaucracy in advanced democracies and the
   literature on administrative traditions. We finally propose how our
   empirical findings may be extended to further explanatory analyses.},

Abstract = {Among states that gained independence following World War II, Sri Lanka
   was widely considered to have a good chance of succeeding
   democratically. This promise was sundered when successive leaders
   embraced ethnocentric policies that were geared towards empowering the
   majority Sinhalese Buddhists at the expense of minorities. This
   ethnocentrism contributed to civil war and adversely affected the
   country's institutions - including the island's political parties. The
   attendant political decay has not only led to malgovernance and
   democratic regression, it has pushed the country in an authoritarian
   direction. Sri Lanka thus represents a classic case of how ethnocentrism
   can undermine democratic institutions and of the long-term negative
   consequences.},

Title = {Islamist Actors from an Anti-system Perspective: The Case of Hizbullah},
Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {487-503},
Abstract = {The case of Hizbullah offers an important opportunity to examine
   Islamist actors. Created during the 1980s as a religious-oriented
   movement with a clear Islamic agenda, it gradually shifted towards a
   more pragmatic position, entering Lebanese political life in 1992. In
   its early days Hizbullah adopted a clear anti-system posture and
   strongly criticised the con-sociational Lebanese system and the
   international order. By comparing three key moments in the political
   evolution of the movement this article analyses the strategy of
   Hizbullah from an anti-system perspective. The aim is to demonstrate how
   playing as a dual anti-system actor (as both social movement and party)
   on two interrelated levels (domestic and external) has been a strategic
   and informed political choice. Hizbullah has been able to juggle these
   positions over the years, activating or silencing its domestic
   anti-system attitude to the benefit of the external one. To have a
   differentiated anti-system attitude has allowed it to maintain a double
   (but always coherent) position in the different systems it plays,
   adapting its anti-system posture to the political circumstances, to its
   goals and to the international context.},

Abstract = {Research Highlights and AbstractThis article shows:
   The importance of non-party members (supporters) in election campaigns.
   Party evolution rather than self-evident decline. How parties cope with
   falling membership to staff campaigns. The extent to which supporter
   activities complement and supplement those of members.
   Existing research on volunteer activity in political parties has tended
   to focus on party membership, both in terms of numbers and activities
   undertaken. Recent developments in British political parties suggest
   however, an increasing role for party supporterssupporters of parties
   who are not formal members. Using data collected through surveys of
   election agents at the 2010 general election, this article examines the
   extent of supporter activity in constituency (district-level) campaigns,
   the extent to which active local parties stimulate supporter activity,
   the correlates of supporter and member activity, and whether supporter
   activity makes a positive and independent contribution to parties'
   constituency campaigns. The article provides an important opportunity to
   question whether the evolution of party organisations suggests that
   formal members may be less important than has been previously assumed in
   the conduct of election campaigns and the extent to which supporter
   activity complements that of members.},

Abstract = {To advance empirical research on international environmental
   institutions, new data on national positions at the international
   climate change negotiations are introduced. The observations cover more
   than 90 countries at two historical moments of climate change decision
   making: the pre-Kyoto Protocol enforcement (2001-2004) and the
   post-Kyoto Protocol (2008-2011) meetings. Data were collected from
   different types of written text. Coding entailed a qualitative
   (dictionary-based) content analysis and a quantitative text analysis. By
   systematically exploring these new data, I offer a `map' of national
   preferences at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
   (UNFCCC). I also propose a discussion of the dimensions of conflict and
   policy competition over 10 years of climate negotiations.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Pages = {1452-1472},
Abstract = {This article investigates the European Commission's external energy
   policy through the lens of the regulatory state. It argues that because
   of the nature of its institutions, policy tools and resources, the
   Commission remains a liberal actor even as the world leaves the benign
   pro-market environment of the 1990s and becomes more mercantilist - or
   `realist'. The article tests seven hypotheses related to two key
   challenges as perceived by the Commission: building energy markets, and
   making them work. It finds that the Commission seeks to project the
   single market beyond its jurisdiction to deal with transit
   infrastructure problems; extend international regimes to cover energy
   trade; deal with monopolists such as Gazprom through classical
   competition policy; and fix global energy market failures with clear
   regulatory state tools. Importantly, however, some actions by the
   Commission can be seen as an attempt to counterbalance external actors,
   or as second-best efforts to address energy market failures.},

   institutional framework and procurement liberalisation, and examines how
   effective institutional reforms can trigger liberalisation. Findings
   show that the critical success factors for institutional reform are
   political commitment, the ability to craft an appropriate agenda, and
   eventual compliance with rules. There is an inverse relationship between
   costs and benefits of institutional reform, suggesting that Vietnam
   might prefer employing GPA observer status as a means for procurement
   liberalisation.},

Abstract = {In this article, I argue that factors inherent to the structure of a
   military organization and their relationship with the political
   leadership play a role in the organization's tendency to perpetrate
   violence against civilians during civil disobedience campaigns. To
   examine this hypothesis, I conducted a three-phased statistical analysis
   on a database containing 97 campaigns that took place between 1972 and
   2012. In the first phase, I examined the relationship between military
   centric factors and violent crackdowns. In the second phase, I examined
   the relationship between military centric factors and mass killing. In
   the third stage, I examined the relationship between two specific types
   of discrimination in the military and mass killing. I found strong
   evidence supporting the hypothesis mentioned above. High-risk militaries
   that served a militarized regime, contained loosely regulated or
   indoctrinated paramilitaries, and discriminated against the protesting
   group, were much more likely to perpetrate violence against civilians
   during civil disobedience campaigns than low-risk militaries. The
   conclusions of this study suggest that further examination of the
   military's role in perpetrating violence against civilians during
   protests and conflict may provide some novel findings.},

Abstract = {In this article, we explore the potential of actor network theory and
   feminist material semiotics as a set of tools for critical policy
   analysis. We describe their focus on material heterogeneity, ontological
   multiplicity and performativity, and consider how this both generates
   political and policy possibilities and impossibilities and also creates
   the potential for change. We explore this by considering the British
   policy response to the 2001 foot and mouth disease epidemic, which we
   treat as a case of ontological multiplicity, and ask what might have
   happened if policy makers had recognized and responded to this
   multiplicity.},

Title = {International peacebuilding goes local: analysing Lederach's conflict
   transformation theory and its ambivalent encounter with 20 years of
   practice},
Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {11-27},
Abstract = {This article examines how peacebuilding theory has influenced the shift
   from the international to the `local' in the practice of international
   peacebuilding and analyses the consequences for local communities,
   international peacebuilding practice and critical peacebuilding
   research. The results demonstrate that transformative peacebuilding
   theories, in particular John Paul Lederach's work, have enormously
   influenced the policy discourse and practice of supporting the `local'.
   Revisiting 20 years of this theory-practice encounter, this article
   concludes that peacebuilding practitioners have overwhelmingly
   recognised the importance of Lederach's shift towards local actors.
   However, this has failed to result in the desired peacebuilding
   outcomes. This article identifies three main reasons: (1) particular
   understandings of the `local' by the `international'; (2) narrow
   international support strategies, ignoring the broader international,
   regional and local peacebuilding arena, and existing power relations;
   and (3) the mantra status of Lederach's middle-out approach as an almost
   unquestioned theory of change in civil society peacebuilding that
   invites reflections on theory-practice encounters and responsible
   peacebuilding scholarship.},

Journal = {SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {5-31},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article provides a new view on the old problem of herding in the
   global south by foreign portfolio investors. It advocates a liquidity
   perspective that problematizes the capacity for a herd to form because
   of the absence of sufficient counterparties willing to trade. Drawing on
   ethnographic interviews with local professional investors in Malaysia (a
   substantively and theoretically important stock market) the findings are
   non-intuitive relative to the common-sense expectations of the
   information asymmetry and identity-based herding literatures. Although
   locals watch their foreign competitors closely, and therefore could
   imitate their trades, these small, local finance firms find few reasons
   to imitate these powerful international actors. Instead, locals enable
   crowds of foreigners because they are willing to be counterparties even
   when they perceive the foreigner's trade as savvy, highly skilled or
   informed. The conclusion explores implications for herding, global
   capital flows and social structures that may generate liquidity in
   business-to-business markets.},

Abstract = {Religion research in international relations (IR) has grown
   exponentially, but has it extended an understanding of religious agency
   beyond the assumptions of secularism? This article suggests the
   orientation towards religion in IR is now best described as
   `postsecular' and employs a linguistic analogy to offer a three-fold
   argument. First, the study of religion in IR has shifted from a focus on
   morphology (i.e. the definitional forms of religion) to syntax (i.e. the
   political functions of religion). Second, by likening the dynamics of IR
   to the syntax of a sentence, the impacts of religion can be measured by
   linking religious actors and interests to different word-functions that
   make up the sentence. This is modelled by comparing the functions of
   religion in IR against the four noun cases of classical grammar. Third,
   applying the model highlights the constraint of secular `readings' of
   the political by illustrating how religion can be sustained throughout
   the full `syntactical range' of IR, thereby presenting a post-secular
   `reading' of religion in the discourse of international affairs.},

   potential complementarities and contradictions. An application of the
   three modes to the case of EU external action.
   This articlea sympathetic critique of the literature on Normative Power
   Europe'observes that the rationales for EU external action, while
   understandable in terms of the concept of normative power', emerge from
   a variety of overlapping and potentially contradictory liberal
   arguments. For the purposes of the argument, these liberalisms are
   organised into three ideal types: market liberalism, the pursuit of
   peace through liberal means and the ethic of cosmopolitan duty. The
   article suggests that while it is possible to associate different
   domains of EU external action with different varieties of liberal
   discourse, it is often more appropriate to see these policy domains as
   sites of struggle, negotiation and (perhaps) reconciliation between
   competing liberal projects.},

Title = {Implementation of an Ideological Paradigm: Early Duginian Eurasianism
   and Russia's Post-Crimean Discourse},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {380-399},
Abstract = {Alexander Dugin, the well-known public philosopher, entered Russia's
   intellectual and political life in the 1990s, with strongly
   anti-American and often anti-Western statements. Dugin's philosophy,
   especially in its early version, was of great use for foreign analysts
   with its emphasis on the irreconcilable conflict between the Eurasian
   civilization - with Russia in its centre - and the Atlanticist
   civilization led by the United States. While the image of Atlanticism
   and Americanism as despiritualizing forces ready for global predominance
   emerged in Dugin's work early on, it was later supplemented by another
   image, stressing Atlanticism as a desire to play God, to change the
   nature and the man himself. Consequently, Atlanticism and Americanism
   cannot live in peace until the Eurasian civilization is destroyed
   completely. While geopolitical Duginism of the 1990s had few direct
   translations into actual Russian foreign policy, it had an indirect
   relationship to Putin's posture in Crimea and Ukraine, and on the
   economically centred Eurasian Union. The importance of Duginism in the
   minds of segments of the American and British leadership is due, rather,
   not so much to the danger of an aggressive Russia, but to the waning of
   Washington's influence in Europe. Duginism is less a manifestation of
   Kremlin policy, than an ideological construction mostly belonging in the
   past. Instead, pragmatic nationalists are the most influential people in
   the present-day Russian elite.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {55-72},
Abstract = {How does the European Commission make its own policies? Research on EU
   policy-making has generated many indirect, informed answers to this
   question. However, a focus upon the Commission's internal practices
   remains under-theorized and under-specified. Drawing upon
   constructivist, institutionalist and sociological policy analysis, this
   article instead mobilizes a generic approach to policy-making as
   `political work' entailing three overlapping processes:
   problematization, instrumentation and legitimation. This conceptual
   framework is then applied to a comparison of Commission policy-making as
   regards the wine and pharmaceuticals industries. The principal finding
   is that there are three scope conditions for Commission policy-making
   which seeks deep institutional change: problematization must be precise
   rather than vague; instrumentation needs to be programmatic rather than
   dispersed; and commissioners and senior Commission officials must commit
   to sustained strategies of legitimation. Overall, this theory-driven
   approach to policy-making provides a means of shedding new light upon
   both the Commission and its role within European integration.},

Abstract = {A decade ago international peacemakers turned a blind eye when violence
   in Darfur, Sudan, first escalated into civil war. This article addresses
   the war's brutal beginnings, using a close reading of internal
   communications, interviews, and public statements to deepen our
   understanding of the predicament that key peacemakers found themselves
   in, and dug themselves into. For a long first year, when the majority of
   violent deaths in Darfur occurred, peacemakers employed a set of
   discursive strategies that intentionally depoliticized Darfur's
   conflict. Despite knowledge to the contrary, peacemakers carefully
   avoided connections between Darfur and the ongoing north-south peace
   negotiations they were championing to end Sudan's long second civil war.
   These ideational moves gave peacemakers a degree of cover for not
   responding directly to the conflict, but they also shaped the political
   calculations and opportunities of domestic actors in ways that further
   enabled armed violence, ultimately leading to policy failure. The
   problems of peacemaking in Sudan highlight the particular challenges
   that arise from negotiating peace. Negotiations give words a privileged
   place in taming the materiality of violence, yet this also leaves
   peacemakers liable to shaping new trajectories of political violence
   born out of local dissatisfaction with the prospects for peace.},

Title = {At the Mercy of the market?: State-enabled, market-oriented labor
   migration and women migrants from the Philippines},
Journal = {PHILIPPINE POLITICAL SCIENCE JOURNAL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-36},
Abstract = {Since the 1970s, overseas labor migration from the Philippines has
   evolved into a market-driven, private sector-dominated, and
   state-enabled phenomenon. The Philippines responded to a growing
   external demand for migrant labor by encouraging the proliferation of
   private recruitment agents with government performing a secondary and,
   primarily, facilitative role. Over the last four decades labor migrants
   have made a significant contribution to Philippine economic development
   by way of their income remittances. Increasingly since the 1990s,
   however, more and more of the Filipino labor migrants deployed from the
   country for overseas jobs were women in both unskilled and semi-skilled
   occupations. Confronted with high-profile cases of abuse and
   discrimination especially and particularly of its women migrants, the
   Philippine government began to enunciate a migration program policy that
   was grounded within a rights-based framework as can be gleaned from its
   adoption of the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995.
   Interestingly, while a rights-based framework has been incorporated into
   the Philippines' migration program perspective, the essential policy
   outlook is still one that retained a market-driven character. The paper
   points out an essential dilemma between the Philippine state's
   market-driven migration policy logic and its logic of protection and
   care for its deployed migrant workers. The resolution of this dilemma
   lies in a state-market codetermination relationship that leaves migrants
   vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. The dominant role of the private
   sector in effect can seriously undermine the rhetoric of protection. The
   paper critically examines the history and practice of the Philippine
   overseas employment program. It argues that the dilemma between the
   market and the rights of migrants is resolved with the adoption of a
   paternalistic-instrumentalist outlook toward women migrants that places
   a premium on the rhetoric of rights for the sake of generating
   remittance income which, in the Philippine case, is substantial. Such a
   paternalistic-instrumentalist policy perspective allows women to be
   mobile and flexible enough to address global market demands while at the
   same time accomplishes the state's own legitimacy and stability needs,
   i.e., foreign exchange generation and job creation. Subsequently, it is
   this promotion of labor flexibility that opens the way for illegal
   recruitment and other illicit flows that place women migrants in
   vulnerable and oppressive situations overseas.},

Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {735-758},
Abstract = {Why do groups adopt terrorism? Major theories of terrorist
   radicalization assume it to be a rational process whereby groups select
   terrorism as the policy most likely to advance their goals. Not all
   terrorism is rational, however, and these theories cannot explain cases
   when groups pursue terrorism despite it being self-defeating. We
   distinguish between rational and irrational terrorism, and explain the
   latter using social psychology's groupthink mechanism. Although
   terrorists are widely assumed to be vulnerable to groupthink, empirical
   work on the phenomenon has focused overwhelmingly on decision-making by
   national executives. We firmly establish the link between groupthink and
   terrorist radicalization by tracing groupthink's operation through the
   development of the Weather Underground, an American terrorist group that
   emerged in the late 1960s and conducted six years of bombings against
   the U.S. government. All of the antecedent conditions, symptoms, and
   decision-making defects predicted by groupthink are evident in the
   Weather Underground, providing valuable evidence of the dangers of
   irrational radicalization and offering lessons for its prevention.},

Abstract = {The merits and shortcomings of various electoral systems for
   post-conflict elections in divided societies have been debated
   extensively. This paper aims to contribute to this debate by moving
   ethnic composition, i.e. the number, size and settlement patterns of
   ethnic groups in a society, centre-stage as a context condition for list
   proportional representation, majoritarianism and single member
   plurality. An overview is then provided of the electoral systems used in
   23 post-conflict parliamentary elections conducted in divided societies,
   and we discuss to what extent they correspond to the requirements of a
   society's ethnic composition.},

Title = {The politics of policy anomalies: bricolage and the hermeneutics of
   paradigms},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {183-202},
Abstract = {This article addresses three issues troubling predominant models of
   paradigmatic policy change and proposes an alternative perspective on
   the subject. The first issue pertains to the conflation of very
   specific, but difficult to operationalize, types of policy change in
   Peter Hall's standard three-order typology for understanding policy
   development. The second has to do with the view that exogenous
   phenomena, namely shifts in the locus of decision-making authority, are
   necessary for `paradigmatic' policy change to occur. The third issue
   stems from Hall's strict adaptation of Thomas Kuhn's ideas concerning
   the (in) commensurability of succeeding paradigms. All three problems
   are shown to be derivative of the fact that policy change is more
   complex than often assumed. Instead of conceiving of policy change in
   definite or `ordered' terms, it is argued that analytical focus should
   be directed toward the hermeneutic contest that unfolds as agents patch
   together ideas in the attempt to identify and explain the sources of
   policy problems. This largely discursive conflict takes place as agents
   vie to influence the structure of `solution sets' in a process of
   `policy bricolage'. The article advances a revised and more
   actor-centered formula for understanding types of paradigmatic and
   intra-paradigmatic policy change by developing a more precise
   understanding of different types or `orders' of policy anomalies and the
   role anomaly definition plays in the construction of new paradigms.},

Abstract = {Since the 1980s, scholars have come to appreciate the role clergy have
   in shaping the political attitudes and behaviour of the faithful.
   Through their leadership in self-selecting religious contexts, they are
   well positioned to translate religious values into political values.
   Given their potential as opinion leaders, this study investigates the
   dynamics of clergy opinions. Focusing on clergy in the Republic of
   Ireland and Northern Ireland, it assesses the influence of psychological
   factors on economic and cultural attitudes, while controlling for the
   influence of contextual and personal characteristics. This is done using
   a question-order experiment embedded in an original survey. There are
   three key findings: (1) clergy attitudes are sensitive to cognitive
   primes that elevate the salience of interpersonal and institutional
   concerns; (2) clergy are sensitive to the perceived preferences of their
   institutional superiors; and (3) social-psychological factors affect how
   clergy report their political opinions. This means that the
   social-psychological dimension should be considered important alongside
   existing frameworks for understanding clergy politics.},

Abstract = {Governance is a term which is widely, but not always precisely, used,
   and this article seeks to clarify what the term is being used to mean.
   In particular, it is concerned with whether it denotes a particular mode
   of government, or whether is a broad category encompassing all modes of
   government. It focuses on the arguments about political practice on
   which the original claims about governance were based, and the evidence
   that there has been a change is political practice which demands a new
   label. It concludes with a discussion of the way that accounts of
   government are used in the practice of governing, and the incentives
   that this gives both participants and observers to adopt the warm but
   fuzzy term `governance'. (C) 2014 Policy and Society Associates (APSS).

Abstract = {Large and rapid power shifts resulting from exogenous economic growth
   are considered sufficient to cause preventive wars. Yet most large and
   rapid shifts result from endogenous military investments. We show that
   when the investment decision is perfectly transparent, peace prevails.
   Large and rapid power shifts are deterred through the threat of a
   preventive war. When investments remain undetected, however, states may
   be tempted to introduce power shifts as a fait accompli. Knowing this,
   their adversaries may strike preventively even without conclusive
   evidence of militarization. In fact, the more effective preventive wars
   are, the more likely they will be launched against states that are not
   militarizing. Our argument emphasizes the role of imperfect information
   as a cause of war. It also explains why powerful states may attack
   weaker targets even with ambiguous evidence of their militarization. We
   illustrate our theory through an account of the 2003 US-led invasion of
   Iraq.},

Abstract = {Do international court judgments influence the behavior of actors other
   than the parties to a dispute? Are international courts agents of policy
   change or do their judgments merely reflect evolving social and
   political trends? We develop a theory that specifies the conditions
   under which international courts can use their interpretive discretion
   to have system-wide effects. We examine the theory in the context of
   European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) rulings on lesbian, gay,
   bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) issues by creating a new data set that
   matches these rulings with laws in all Council of Europe (CoE) member
   states. We also collect data on LGBT policies unaffected by ECtHR
   judgments to control for the confounding effect of evolving trends in
   national policies. We find that ECtHR judgments against one country
   substantially increase the probability of national-level policy change
   across Europe. The marginal effects of the judgments are especially high
   where public acceptance of sexual minorities is low, but where national
   courts can rely on ECtHR precedents to invalidate domestic laws or where
   the government in power is not ideologically opposed to LGBT equality.
   We conclude by exploring the implications of our findings for other
   international courts.},

Abstract = {The financial cost of corruption has recently been estimated at more
   than 5 per cent of global GDP. Yet, despite the widespread agreement
   that corruption is one of the most pressing policy challenges facing
   world leaders, it remains as widespread today, possibly even more so, as
   it was when concerted international attention began being devoted to the
   issue following the end of the Cold War. In reality, we still have a
   relatively weak understanding of how best to measure corruption and how
   to develop effective guides to action from such measurement. This paper
   provides a detailed review of existing approaches to measuring
   corruption, focusing in particular on perception-based and
   non-perceptual approaches. We highlight a gap between the
   conceptualisation of corruption and its measurement, and argue that
   there is a tension between the demands of policy-makers and
   anti-corruption activists on the one hand, and the motivations of
   academic researchers on the other. The search for actionable answers on
   the part of the former sits uncomfortably with the latter's focus on the
   inherent complexity of corruption.},

Abstract = {Many companies offer their customers voluntary carbon `offset'
   certificates to compensate for greenhouse gas emissions. Voluntary
   offset certificates are cheap because the demand for them is low,
   allowing consumers to compensate for their emissions without significant
   sacrifices. Regarding the distribution of emission reduction
   responsibilities I argue that excess emissions are permissible if they
   are offset properly. However, if individuals buy offsets only because
   they are cheap, they fail to be robustly motivated to choose a
   permissible course of action. This suspected lack of robust motivation
   raises both pragmatic questions about the functioning of offsetting
   schemes and moral questions about the worth of such unstable motives.
   The analysis provided here also has wider implications for the normative
   analysis of partial compliance and `many hands' problems, especially for
   those cases where compliance levels and costs interact.},

Abstract = {Robert Putnam's hunkering down' thesis regarding the negative effect of
   ethnic diversity on trust and willingness to participate in collective
   life launched an ongoing debate concerning the ramifications of
   diversity for social cohesion. Findings regarding the way in which
   diversity affects social cohesion are discrepant, some scholars arguing
   that diversity has negative effects on social cohesion and others
   indicating insignificant or even positive effects. This study claims
   that these conflicting conclusions are explained by the vagueness of
   social cohesion - a multidimensional concept. Analyzing cross-national
   survey data from 42 European countries, it demonstrates how diversity is
   variably related to the diverse dimensions and operationalization of
   social cohesion. While diversity is not associated with the most
   commonly adduced dimension of social cohesion - namely, interpersonal
   trust - it does possess a negative relation to two other dimensions of
   social cohesion: belonging and social solidarity. Even these negative
   relations are not consistent across different operationalizations of
   belonging and social solidarity, however. In the face of increasing
   concerns regarding the implications of diversity for social cohesion,
   these findings demonstrate that caution must be exercised when examining
   the relations between these two phenomena.},

Abstract = {How do students see' globalization? How do they understand visual
   representations of its political, social and ethical dimensions? This
   article discusses the use of visual materials as a tool for teaching
   globalization theory. Images convey specific values and beliefs, frame
   understandings of global problems, provide access to distant locales and
   offer a form of resistance. Such media allow students to consider how
   images may reproduce inherently politicized articulation, and to gain a
   better understanding of models of and concepts related to globalization.
   The article discusses a specific exercise, learning outcomes and
   pedagogical barriers to students' understanding of visual representation
   of space and place. It provides both specific images related to
   globalization and student analyses which illustrate how visual analyses
   may facilitate integration, synthesis and retention of otherwise
   abstract theories and concepts.},

Abstract = {Public contracting is designed to reduce costs and to enhance service
   quality. However, few prior studies have clarified the multiple
   performance dimensions of public service delivery influenced by
   contracting. This study empirically tests how different contracting
   elements are associated with local fiscal performance and income
   inequality in terms of competing values. For the test, the different
   contracting elements (scope, competition, stability, specification and
   monitoring) are respectively measured through a nationwide public
   service delivery survey. Multiple performance values of public service
   delivery (efficiency, effectiveness and equity) are measured through
   local fiscal data and the Gini index. Overall, competitive market is
   associated only with efficiency, while stability is related only to
   equity.},

Abstract = {Tintin is a cultural icon whose popularity has led to critical
   assessments accusing the comic of perpetuating orientalist and racist
   images. This article presents a different reading of Tintin by asking a
   more fundamental question: what understanding of the political is
   manifested in Tintin's Adventures? I argue that Tintin creates a
   political sphere that fosters an image of peace which does not eradicate
   conflicts, but facilitates them. Bildung, spatio-temporal conditionality
   of knowledge, spheres of elasticity, and power ensure that they do not
   turn into violence. All these are characteristics of the comic and
   create a powerful visualisation of the human condition of politics.},

Abstract = {Concentrating on the health sector, this article argues that the
   provision of collective goods through external actors depends on the
   level of state capacity and the complexity of the service that external
   actors intend to provide. It shows that external actors can contribute
   most effectively to collective good provision when the service is
   simple, and that simple services can even be provided under conditions
   of failed statehood. Effectively delivering complex services requires
   greater levels of state capacity. The article also indicates that
   legitimacy is a key factor to explain variance in health service
   delivery. To demonstrate this, the article assesses health projects in
   Somalia. It shows that simple servicesmalaria prevention and
   tuberculosis controlare provided effectively in all three Somali
   regions, including the war-torn South-Central region. In contrast, the
   HIV/AIDS project only achieved substantial results in Somaliland, the
   only region with a comparatively higher level of state capacity, and
   failed in the South-Central region and Puntland.},

Title = {International relations between war and revolution: Wilsonian diplomacy
   and the making of the Treaty of Versailles},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {51},
Number = {5},
Pages = {619-647},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Peace Treaties of 1919 retain a prominent place within the study of
   International Relations (LR). The theoretical significance of Versailles
   for IR can hardly be overstated. For much rests on the question of
   whether the post-war settlement was problematic due to its liberal
   nature or in spite of it. Yet, explanations as to why Versailles
   diplomacy was so problematic vary significantly. What were the central
   factors affecting policymaking at Versailles? And what does Paris Peace
   diplomacy tell IR theory about modern foreign policymaking processes?
   This article provides a critique of standard IR interpretations of
   Wilsonian diplomacy at Versailles, illustrating how realist and
   liberals' uncritical acceptance of Wilson as the quintessential
   `idealist-liberal' statesman glosses over a core contradiction at the
   heart of Wilsonian diplomacy: the wielding of power politics to
   transcend power politics. In doing so, it examines the effects of the
   Bolshevik revolution as a paradigm-rupturing event transforming the
   nature and dynamics of the First World War and the post-war settlement.
   This traces the unique sociological patterns of uneven and combined
   development thrown up by the war and the geopolitical problems this
   created for Wilson and the Allies in forging a new international order.},

Abstract = {Societies involved in intractable conflicts form conflict-supporting
   narratives that illuminate and justify their intergroup conflicts. These
   narratives play an important role in satisfying the basic
   sociopsychological needs of the involved individuals and collectives. In
   order to fulfill this role the narratives tend to be biased in favor of
   the in-group, selective, distorting and simplistic. This article
   analyzes such narratives that focus on the following major themes:
   Justification and Threats (of conflict), Delegitimization (of the
   opponent), Glorification and Victimhood (of the in-group), the
   in-group's need for Patriotism and Unity, and its Aspiration for Peace.
   Additionally, the article describes the individual and collective
   functions of these narratives. It also describes six main methods that
   are used in the narratives' construction: reliance on supportive
   sources, marginalization of contradictory information, magnification of
   supportive themes, fabrication of supportive contents, omission of
   contradictory contents, and use of framing language. Because
   conflict-supporting narratives are so functional, the involved societies
   struggle to support their dominance within their own society as well as
   in the international community. This article, therefore, presents seven
   methods that are used by the parties in their intrasocietal struggles -
   control of access to information, censorship, discrediting of
   contradicting information, monitoring, punishment, encouragement and
   rewarding, and closure of archives. Similar methods are used in the
   international arena struggles. Finally, it describes the process of
   change from adherence to the conflict-supportive narratives to the
   construction of new peace-supporting narratives and adherence to them.},

Abstract = {Academics and policy makers require a better understanding of the
   variation of policies that regulate global migration, asylum and
   immigrant naturalization. At present, however, there is no comprehensive
   cross-national, time-series database of such policies, rendering the
   analysis of policy trends across and within these areas difficult at
   best. Several new immigration databases and indices have been developed
   in recent years. However, there is no consensus on how best to
   conceptualize, measure and aggregate migration policy indicators to
   allow for meaningful comparisons through time and across space. This
   article discusses these methodological challenges and introduces
   practical solutions that involve historical, multi-dimensional,
   disaggregated and transparent conceptualizing, measuring and compiling
   of cross-national immigration policies. Such an approach informs the
   International Migration Policy and Law Analysis (IMPALA) database.},

Abstract = {In this article, we assess the impact of counterterrorism measures on
   trade. Our work brings three value addition to the literature: (1) it
   develops a simple theory to emphasize the endogeneity between terrorism
   acts, counterterrorism measures, and trade; (2) it delivers an original
   strategy to identify empirically the effect of counterterrorism security
   measures on trade flows (using third country incidents); and (3) it uses
   a new data set on business visas issued by the United States to test
   further the hypothesis that terrorism is affecting trade through the
   security channel. Our results suggest that counterterrorism security
   measures matter for US imports. The level of the impact is up to three
   times higher when the acts result in a relatively high number of
   victims, when the products are sensitive to shipping time, or when they
   ask for networks and business people mobility in order to be sold.},

Abstract = {The notion that public managers influence organizational performance is
   common in public administration research. However, less is known about
   why some managers are better at influencing organizational performance
   than others. Furthermore, relatively few studies have systematically
   examined managerial influence and scholars have yet to investigate
   either quantitatively or systematically managerial influence in the
   White House. Utilizing original survey data collected from former White
   House officials who served in the Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Clinton
   administrations, this study applies empirical public management theory
   to examine for the first time the key determinants that shape
   perceptions of chief of staff managerial influence. The findings
   demonstrate how several core concepts in public management theory help
   explain the dynamics that drive perceptions of managerial influence,
   thereby providing a new contribution to the literature on public
   management.},

Abstract = {The introduction of Big Data sets in the healthcare domain has presented
   opportunities to engage in analytics of very large sets containing both
   structured and unstructured data. With advances in information
   technology (IT), these data sets have become available from diverse
   sources at greatly increased rates. The availability of Big Data sets
   has introduced complexities that we must address, not only in terms of
   semantics and analytics but also in terms of data management, storage,
   and distribution. Currently, the capabilities to ingest, analyze, and
   manage multipetabyte data sets have underscored the limitations of our
   analytics capabilities supported by relational database management
   systems. This essay argues that an ontology-based approach to data
   analytics provides a practical framework to address the semantic
   challenges presented by Big Data sets. No ontological framework can
   address the operational and management requirements introduced by the
   availability of Big Data sets, however. There are also a number of IT
   architectural factors that must be considered in implementing such a
   framework.},

Abstract = {Sample selection models, variants of which are the Heckman and Heckit
   models, are increasingly used by political scientists to accommodate
   data in which censoring of the dependent variable raises concerns of
   sample selectivity bias. Beyond demonstrating several pitfalls in the
   calculation of marginal effects and associated levels of statistical
   significance derived from these models, we argue that many of the
   empirical questions addressed by political scientists would - for both
   substantive and statistical reasons - be more appropriately addressed
   using an alternative but closely related procedure referred to as the
   two-part model (2 PM). Aside from being simple to estimate, one key
   advantage of the 2 PM is its less onerous identification requirements.
   Specifically, the model does not require the specification of so-called
   exclusion restrictions, variables that are included in the selection
   equation of the Heckit model but omitted from the outcome equation.
   Moreover, we argue that the interpretation of the marginal effects from
   the 2 PM, which are in terms of actual outcomes, are more appropriate
   for the questions typically addressed by political scientists than the
   potential outcomes ascribed to the Heckit results. Drawing on data from
   the Correlates of War database, we present an empirical analysis of
   conflict intensity illustrating that the choice between the sample
   selection model and 2 PM can bear fundamentally on the conclusions
   drawn.},

Abstract = {This article studies the association between ethnic conflicts and
   political attitudes. It employs a new data set on the casualties of the
   ethnic conflict in Turkey to identify the effects of the Kurdish
   insurgency on the electoral behavior of the Turkish voters. The results
   indicate that the conflict leads to the political polarization of the
   society along ethnic nationalist lines. Further investigation of the
   data also provides some empirical support for the constructivist
   argument that the salience of ethnic identities is subject to change in
   response to external stimuli, of which ethnic conflict constitutes a
   drastic example.},

   Africa, the continent with the most peacekeeping operations. Its
   abilities and leadership enable it to lead mediation processes, bring
   together external stakeholders, be on the front lines of certain
   peacekeeping operations, enhancing its credibility in managing
   conflicts. However, for some time, South Africa's commitment, which was
   already exhibiting certain weaknesses both in terms of abilities and
   leadership with regard to its reputation and status, seems to be losing
   momentum. At the same time, we have seen a rise in Realpolitik power,
   which has drawn considerable criticism.},

Abstract = {Why does party identification motivate citizens to participate in
   politics? From a theoretical standpoint, it is in a partisan's
   self-interest to free ride on the efforts of others. Yet, mere
   identification with a party is enough to motivate many people to
   overcome this structural hurdle. We theorize that, by virtue of aligning
   one's self with a party, individuals become more likely to react to
   their political environment with anger and enthusiasm rather than fear.
   Anger and enthusiasm are associated with approach and continuation of
   current behavior, while fear triggers behavior reconsideration. In
   short, party identification stimulates participation via anger and
   enthusiasm. On the other hand, fear produces thought but not much
   action. We find support for our model using data from the American
   National Election Studies (ANES) and an original laboratory experiment.},

   Examining North Korean rhetorical strategies, 1949-2010},

Abstract = {This study investigates the impact of economic statecraft on the North
   Korean Government. As a totalitarian regime, which is characterized by a
   controlled mass media, the North Korean Government tries to contain
   potential problems caused by sanctions by using three types of political
   rhetoric: appeasement, backlash, and surveillance. Using time-series
   data from 1949 to 2010 derived from a content analysis of the New Year's
   Day addresses by Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il, and Kim Jong Un, the
   empirical results suggests that the North Korean Government does alter
   its rhetorical strategies in response to external economic sanctions.
   Negative sanctions cause the regime to use appeasement strategies (or
   calls for reforms and internal changes). It tends to use backlash
   rhetoric (or blaming the sanctioning powers) in response to,
   interestingly, positive sanctions. Surveillance rhetoric, or the call
   for internal vigilance against enemies, on the other hand, does not have
   any statistical connection with sanctions, rather driven by other
   factors, such as the Korean War, external instability, and so on. (C)

Abstract = {The inter-war period saw a flowering of comparative research on
   emergency administration in response to the Great Depression. This
   article argues that Weimar and Nazi Germany was an important point of
   reference for scholars comparing different policy responses to the Great
   Depression. Centralization and administrative discretion were considered
   pivotal for effective crisis governance, irrespective of the political
   context. The resulting administrative ideology was ignorant of the
   polycratic realities of the Nazi state and frequently lauded its
   hierarchical features while condemning the Weimar Republic as anarchic.
   Faced with the challenge presented by Nazism, of squaring efficiency and
   accountability in the context of New Deal America, scholars of public
   administration developed ideas for training a new type of civil servant
   who was capable of acting beyond the control of legislative
   institutions. By exploring the ambiguous relationship between public
   administration and Nazism, this article highlights the complex issues
   confronting scholars of public administration in times of crisis.},

Abstract = {Since the landmark volume The Search for Deliberative Democracy in China
   (Leib and He eds. 2006), a growing number of theoretical and empirical
   studies in the context of China have advanced our knowledge of
   deliberative democracy in comparative settings. This paper aims to
   discuss the recent development and prospects of deliberative democracy
   in China, with particular focus on the approach of a deliberative system
   that has not been adequately addressed in the context of China. This
   paper proposes an analytical framework for the concept of deliberative
   capacity building in the context of contemporary China. The paper
   analyses three dimensions of deliberative capacity building: social
   capacity, institutional capacity; and participatory capacity of a
   deliberative system. The three dimensions lay particular emphasis on the
   public sphere, empowered space, and deliberative actors respectively.
   The multi-dimensional framework considers deliberative capacity building
   as a process by which the three dimensions synergize and evolve with
   each other to produce a functional deliberative system incorporating
   isolated deliberative practices. The multi-dimensional analyses suggest
   that deliberative capacity building is critical to democratization in
   China, as it produces a stronger public sphere, more effective
   government responsiveness and improved participatory competence.},

Abstract = {This article questions the negative outlook on the democratic
   accountability in public-private partnerships (PPPs). It challenges this
   widely held perception in the literature with the empirical findings of
   a case study of Flemish school infrastructure (Belgium). A large design,
   build, finance, and maintenance (DBFM) programme is compared with the
   regular subsidizing system through the public agency AGIOn (Agency for
   School Infrastructure). This case study demonstrates that more
   accountability forums and actors can be active in the PPP, that they can
   behave more actively in the PPP, and that they get results in terms of
   accountability. It provides a critical example of having more
   accountability in the PPP variant of school infrastructure than in
   direct public provision, and there are reasons to argue that this also
   means improved accountability, because internal and latent processes of
   accountability become external and actual ones.},

Abstract = {The migration of thousands of Guatemalan Maya due to political violence
   and poverty since the 1970s has led to the establishment of various
   diasporic communities throughout the United States. A frequent
   destination for the Maya is Los Angeles, California, where they are
   confronted with pressure to adapt to an environment that is
   predominantly Latino/Hispanic. Maya identity, expressed through the use
   of traditional dress, language, literature, and spirituality, is
   challenged by Euro-American culture, which discriminates against these
   customs. These conditions are more severe for Maya children, who face
   difficulties in maintaining their heritage as public education
   socializes them into U.S. culture and history. The children of Maya in
   Los Angeles are recovering their identity and culture through music,
   religion, literature, and language, resisting imposed identities and
   reaffirming their Maya roots.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},

Pages = {146-158},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The Security Council has found that the endemic use of rape in war for
   military advantage - which is primarily targeted against women and girls
   - is a military tactic that presents a threat to global peace and
   security. Despite concerted global efforts over the last two decades to
   end its use, rape as a tool of war continues undeterred. This article
   links the intransigent use of strategic rape with states' failure to
   treat it as an unlawful tactic of war under the rules of international
   humanitarian law (IHL) that regulate the `means and methods of war'.
   Embedding strategic rape under IHL's weapons framework will increase its
   stigmatization, a critical factor in stopping the use of abhorrent
   weapons or tactics in war. Other potential benefits include the opening
   up of civil and criminal accountability frameworks and others which
   provide restitution and reparations for war rape victims. This article
   focuses on the role of all states in enforcing the weapons framework and
   it calls for states to undertake an impact and injuries assessment of
   strategic rape under the Article 36 weapons review process.},

Abstract = {Recent growth in the number of school choice programs across the country
   has ignited debate on the stratifying effects of these programs. In the
   context of interdistrict open enrollment, this paper analyzesboth
   theoretically and empiricallyhow choice programs affect stratification
   levels through the mechanisms of (i) the relative characteristics of
   program participants and nonparticipants and (ii) the schooling choices
   of different groups of program participants. The theoretical analysis
   uses Monte Carlo simulation techniques to analyze a hypothetical world
   where interdistrict choice is available to students in three school
   districts that are allowed to vary in student composition, the type of
   students who take advantage of the interdistrict choice program, and
   schooling choices of students who open enroll. The results of these
   simulations provide an understanding of the conditions under which an
   interdistrict open enrollment program leads to increases, decreases, or
   no changes in stratification levels. The empirical analysis uses data
   from the universe of students attending Colorado public schools in
   2009-10 to examine how the state's interdistrict choice program affects
   stratification levels. It also analyzes the factors responsible for any
   increases or decreases in stratification and finds both participation
   patterns and differences in schooling decisions across groups to play
   important roles. The paper concludes with a discussion of its
   implications for research and policy.},

Abstract = {Does the emergence of a new boundary-spanning policy regime shift the
   focus of well-established organized interests, or does it mobilize new
   ones? In this article, I show that interest groups with a presence in
   Washington before 9/11 rapidlybut temporarilyshift their attention to
   the homeland security issues. Established groups' entrenchment in
   antecedent subsystems appears to buffer against widespread policy
   disruption and interest upheaval. However, a new set of previously
   latent groups opportunistically mobilizes after the regime is
   institutionalized. Newly mobilized groups replace those that retreat
   back to the regime's antecedent subsystems. Though the policy regime
   fails to resolve the jurisdictional turf conflicts that triggered its
   creation, the institutionalization of homeland security generates its
   own original, distinct government demand for lobbying. Interests that
   previously had no business in Washington before 9/11 took advantage of
   the new opportunities the regime offered without supplanting interests
   established long before the Department of Homeland Security and its
   congressional committees existed.},

Abstract = {This article is interested with the legal mobilization of transnational
   interest groups at the European level (European Union and Council of
   Europe). It compares the legal and political lobbying strategies of two
   umbrella organizations - the European Women's Lobby (EWL) and the
   European Roma and Travellers Forum (ERTF), which seek respectively to
   promote the rights of women and those of Roma - focusing on their
   interactions with European institutions and law. The article analyses
   the contrasted relationship of these groups to legal mobilization as a
   rights advancement strategy, shedding new light on how law can be
   strategically used by both strong and weak civil society actors. Beyond
   classical factors linked to organizational characteristics and identity,
   the differential usages of law by the two groups are explained by the
   role of strategic actors who adapt to the specificities of the system of
   governance in the two policy sectors - gender equality and
   anti-discrimination.},

Abstract = {Targeted killing has become an increasingly prevalent tactic employed by

   use, the criteria for targeted killing permissibility have remained

   on-the-ground implementation by Israel and the United States. While both
   Israel and the United States may have largely adhered to the laws of
   armed conflict, in practice, discrepancies in implementation exist. This
   is primarily due to the ambiguity of the ``distinction{''} and
   ``proportionality{''} principles, two key legal and moral criteria that
   need further clarification.},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen a wealth of studies on Cultural Economics, in
   line with the importance of the economic performance of the public
   sector. In this context, the two-stage double bootstrap procedure of
   Simar and Wilson (2007) has been used to estimate the efficiency
   determinants of Spanish local entities in the management of culture
   oriented public infrastructures, given the limited financial resources
   available to these entities. The final sample comprises 1,159
   municipalities. In the first stage, technical efficiency is estimated by
   Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and, based on a truncated-regression,
   the resulting efficiency estimates are regressed on a group of 10
   selected environmental variables in a second stage. We have also
   considered the influence of a dummy categorical variable -the political
   sign of the governing party- on the efficient provision of the
   facilities under study. The results show the existence of a significant
   relation between efficiency and all the variables except two:
   unemployment rate and political strength. Our results also show that
   municipalities governed by conservative parties are more efficient.},

Abstract = {The authors explore how modern autocrats win elections by inducing
   employers to mobilize their employees to vote for the regime and thereby
   subvert the electoral process. Using two original surveys of employers
   and workers conducted around the 2011 parliamentary elections in Russia,
   they find that just under one-quarter of employers engaged in some form
   of political mobilization. They then develop a simple framework for
   identifying which firms engage in voter mobilization and which workers
   are targeted for mobilization. Firms that are vulnerable to state
   pressure-financially dependent firms and those in sectors characterized
   by asset immobility-are among the most common sites of workplace-based
   electoral subversion. The authors also find that workers who are
   especially dependent on their employer are more likely to be targeted
   for mobilization. By identifying the conditions under which workplace
   mobilization occurs in authoritarian regimes, the authors contribute to
   the long-standing debate about the economic bases of democratization. In
   addition, they explore an understudied means of subverting elections in
   contemporary autocracies: the use of economic coercion to mobilize
   voters. Moreover, their research finds that clientelist exchange can
   thrive in industrial settings and in the absence of deeply embedded
   political parties.},

Abstract = {Agencies must simultaneously weigh technical information along with the
   political and distributive consequences of their decisions. In a study
   of the US Environmental Protection Agencys (EPAs) implementation of
   federal pesticide regulations, I show that the EPA accounts for both
   case and constituency factors. I assess the effects of both uncertainty
   and information in agency decisions. I offer the use of a multilevel
   model with three types of random effects to capture specific case
   factors (the crop, the pest, and the pesticide) to account for
   unobservable heterogeneity in outcomes. The models show that the impacts
   of uncertainty and information depend on the decision environment.},

Abstract = {The concept of policy paradigm, which was developed by Peter Hall in
   1993, has given rise to an abundance of literature on ideas and policy
   dynamics. Despite its theoretical value, however, the original concept
   was insufficiently specified and has been used in problematic ways by
   many policy scholars, thereby undermining the validity of their
   descriptive and causal inferences. The main argument defended in this
   article is that scholars studying policy paradigms should devote as much
   attention to the ideas of policy makers as to the policies they adopt,
   while distinguishing between the two constructs as much as possible.
   This article reviews these issues and puts forward seven guidelines that
   aim to better circumscribe the concept of policy paradigm and improve
   research on ideas and policy dynamics.},

Abstract = {Do military alliances foster aggressive behavior in allies to the point
   of undermining the security goal of the alliance? Like others, we find
   that alliance commitments may cause moral hazard because allies do not
   fully internalize the costs of actions that can lead to war. But unlike
   others, we show that the effect of moral hazard can improve security.
   Moral hazard can be the driving force behind generating deterrence and
   avoiding costly conflict. Aggressors may refrain from initiating crises
   if their target enjoys additional resources from its ally and so is more
   willing to fight back. So rather than incurring costs, moral hazard may
   be the very key to deterring potential aggressors and minimizing the
   risk of conflict. This behavior allows alliance partners to capture a
   deterrence surplus, which are the gains from avoiding conflict.},

Abstract = {Given the closure of the Special Court for Sierra Leone debates about
   its impact have intensified. The question of the significance of the
   Court's legacy is increasingly topical given its legal and political
   dimension. This article examines the notion of legacy in lieu of
   empirically assessing and measuring any legacy and develops a
   re-conceptualisation of the multifaceted process of leaving a legacy. It
   is argued that a deeper understanding requires a focus on multiple
   legacies as well as on multiple actors. The Court as legacy leaver has
   pioneered an institutional approach to legacy planning. Against the
   backdrop of ongoing construction its legacies have already become sites
   of contestation over the Court's significance for Sierra Leone, Africa
   and international criminal justice.},

Title = {Safe Across the Border: The Continued Significance of the Democratic

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Pages = {118-125},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We investigate the research findings reported in Gibler () that suggest
   the democratic peace is in fact a spurious artifact of stable borders.
   If corroborated, this set of findings would mark an important
   reorientation for the field. However, we show that the research design
   used in Gibler () suffers from several problems, including omitting the
   lower order terms of interaction variables and inappropriately assuming
   cross-dyad independence of artificially created dyadic democracy scores.
   Our replication and extension shows that even when controlling for
   stable border variables, democracy continues to be a consistently useful
   predictor of international conflict. Further, the stable border
   variables themselves prove to be less consistent predictors of both
   peace and democracy as compared to previous research. These results
   suggest that both territorial issues and democracy can coexist as
   explanations for interstate bellicosity.},

Abstract = {Reforming a totalitarian state requires the changing of old institutions
   to new democratic ones, establishing new democratic procedures, changing
   people's mindsets and introducing new democratic values. Many observers
   claim that Ukraine, the second-most populous country of the former
   Soviet Union, has fallen short of making meaningful democratic reforms.
   While much work in this regard remains to be done, it would be unfair to
   claim that Ukraine has not made any advancement with regard to
   democratic reforms. In this article, we describe and analyze broadly the
   correlation between the establishment of the new administrative court
   system in Ukraine and the ability of asylum-seekers to gain asylum
   status as evidence of intentional democratic reforms. The findings,
   which derive from data gathered from the Ukraine Register of Court cases
   from May 2009 through May 2010, suggest that Ukraine has implemented
   such reforms slowly and awkwardly. However, we suggest that Ukraine's
   recent establishment of an administrative court reveals that deliberate,
   albeit cautious, steps have been taken to limit the power of the current
   government and hold it responsive and responsible towards the people.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the evolution of New Agenda for Cooperation and
   Cross-border Development (NACCD), being implemented by the Uruguayan and
   Brazilian governments, since 2002. This program refers to a wide set of
   public policies designed to improve life quality of cross-border
   citizens and includes a wide range of international agreements and
   public projects (more than 100) from 2002 to 2013.
   The analysis specially refers to the following topics. Firstly, the
   article assesses the program outcomes by describing main social and
   demographical cross-border features. Secondly, it focuses on agreements
   features and public projects that have already been included in the
   public agenda. For this purpose a database has been designed to track
   agreements and projects during this period. Thirdly, the document
   analyses the NACCD institutional system and specifically focuses on the
   influence of intergovernmental relationships on cross-border public
   policies multi-level governance between both States, particularly
   emphasizing the Brazilian case. At last, some conclusions are drowned,
   as well as several critical factors are specified in order to improve
   public policies and projects involved in this cross-border program.},

Abstract = {Three experiments demonstrate that in the context of U.S. foreign policy
   decision making, people infer informational quality from secrecy. In
   Experiment 1, people weighed secret information more heavily than public
   information when making recommendations about foreign political
   candidates. In Experiment 2, people judged information presented in
   documents ostensibly produced by the Department of State and the
   National Security Council as being of relatively higher quality when
   those documents were secret rather than public. Finally, in Experiment
   3, people judged a National Security Council document as being of higher
   quality when presented as a secret document rather than a public
   document and evaluated others' decisions more favorably when those
   decisions were based on secret information. Discussion centers on the
   mediators, moderators, and broader implications of this secrecy
   heuristic in foreign policy contexts.},

   bitumen development proposals in Alberta, Canada, home of the tar sands
   - one of the world's largest reserves of fossil fuel. Within the context
   of economic and ecological impacts of fossil-fuel resource development
   in Alberta, we chart the active treadmill forces, and examine the legal
   framework that enables public involvement in the province. We also
   provide a detailed account of the extent of public participation through
   the available avenues to date. We conclude, in line with the
   expectations of the treadmill of production, that the institutionalised
   processes of participation have been restricted to the point of
   nullifying the possibility of effective, democratic control over the
   expansion of the tar sands.},

Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {30},
Number = {2},
Pages = {230-245},
Abstract = {Using the 2010 Hungarian media law as a case study, this article traces
   the process in which an issue in the domestic politics of a
   ({''}new{''}) EU member state is transformed into a transnational
   political conflict. How and why do political actors ``upload{''} issues
   from the domestic to the EU level, specifically into the European
   parliamentary arena? How do others with conflicting interests resist
   such a change? The analytical framework is based on venue shopping, a
   concept hitherto mainly utilised in the context of interest group
   behaviour. Contestation around the Hungarian media law illustrates that
   a number of conditions related to the existing links of the uploading
   political actor with the new venue and the nature of the issue itself
   are necessary to make uploading a viable strategy.},

Abstract = {This chapter re-examines the functionalist and actor-centred logics and
   the interaction between them. It examines whether political players only
   react to existing constraints and determine whether the solution to the
   constraint can be achieved or whether they in fact also shape the
   substance of the reform. Similarly it reflects on whether the
   constraints can not only shape the reform content but also contribute
   towards enabling reforms to take place. It concludes that the four
   country case studies help us to uncover a more diversified overall
   approach to explaining the reform outcomes.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},

Pages = {407-426},
Abstract = {The article discusses action research in a Dutch intergovernmental
   project group DV2050. That group was to assess the effects of climate
   change and soil subsidence on the regional water system and to propose
   adaptive policies to increase regional water safety. In this study, we
   draw a parallel between the stakeholder participation trajectory of
   DV2050 and our collaborative learning trajectory within the DV2050
   project. In the academic literature, both participatory policy-making
   and action research are advocated for instrumental, normative and
   quality reasons. In our case, both trajectories took place in an
   entrenched context, i.e. a strongly institutionalized environment in
   which the involved governments compete for competencies. Despite broader
   ambitions stated at the beginning of these trajectories, we explain that
   both became instrumentalized by actors involved, narrowing their scope.
   Instrumentalization was influenced by powerful interests, a strongly
   institutionalized science-policy interface and the pressure of imminent
   decision-making.},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Commemorations and reparations are central elements of the transitional
   justice agenda. The inclusion of memory-related measures among the steps
   that states are expected to take along the transitional process has been
   progressively translated from the transitional justice domain to the
   language of international law. Judicial and quasi-judicial human rights
   instances have required states to make and undertake memorials,
   commemorations and public acts of remembrance, both as an instrument of
   reparation for the individual victim and as a mechanism to warn against
   the repetition of the same abuses in the future. As a result of this
   trend, memory-related measures have progressively become part of the
   state obligation to provide reparations to victims. The inclusion of
   memory-related measures in the scope of the international obligation to
   repair, however, raises some thorny issues. This review of the
   jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in relation to
   memory-related orders and analysis of the case of the memorial El Ojo
   que Llora in Peru critically assesses the emerging trend of using
   memory-related initiatives as measures of reparation determined by
   judicial organs.},

Abstract = {This article examines the phenomenon of ``ecoterrorism{''} from a
   conceptual and empirical perspective. We explore the political and
   academic debates over the meaning and use of the term ecoterrorism, and
   assess the validity of the concept of ``ecoterrorism{''} and of the
   alleged threat of the Radical Environmentalist and Animal Rights (REAR)
   movement by analyzing the characteristics of both the movement and its
   actions. Our analysis shows that the term ecoterrorism should only be
   used for a small proportion of the actions of REAR movement.
   Consequently, counterterrorist measures should only target these
   terrorist minorities, rather than all groups and the broader movement.},

Abstract = {This article examines whether and how the Euro crisis has affected the
   long-term trends of politicization of Europe in France. Has the crisis
   fueled the extent of politicization? Do we observe shifts in specific
   aspects of Europe being politicized? Are the patterns of opposition
   changing? To answer these questions, the authors compare the electoral
   campaign in 2012 with all French campaigns since 1974. Additionally,
   France is put in a broader comparative perspective. Politicization is
   conceptualized as three interrelated dimensions: issue salience, actor
   expansion, and polarization. Methodologically, the article is based on a
   relational content analysis of newspaper articles. The findings show
   that the Euro crisis boosted the level of politicization, and economic
   policies, as well as justification frames became more important.
   However, the degree of polarization was higher in election campaigns
   that focused more on constitutional conflicts over membership and were
   dominated by concerns with national identity and sovereignty.},

Title = {Elite patronage over party democracy - high politics in Sri Lanka
   following independence},
Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1},
Pages = {166-186},
Abstract = {When Sri Lanka became independent in February 1948 it lacked a
   well-established party system and instead relied upon patronage and
   elite social relationships. Though it had a long pre-independence
   history of constitutional development and evolving democracy, party
   politics was not deep-rooted and political power continued to be wielded
   by an elite that had an almost feudal relationship with the masses. The
   convention based Westminster model Sri Lanka adopted engendered a local
   system that relied more on relationships than rules. Political parties
   and institutions were often unable to check and balance the Executive's
   conduct of power. Sri Lanka's elite operated British institutions in an
   anachronistic eighteenth-century manner such as in having a
   patronage-based Cabinet dominated by its prime ministerial leader/patron
   rather than by collegial attitudes or values. The weakness of party
   institutionalisation and the ambiguity in the constitutional
   arrangements laid the foundations for future political conflict and
   marginalisation of segments of society. The continuity of affairs of
   state from the colonial era and the known and reassuring leadership of
   D.S. Senanayake and his `Uncle-Nephew Party' masked the democratic
   tensions and institutional fragility within the Sri Lankan state that
   would come to the fore violently only years after what was then seen as
   a model transfer of power.},

Abstract = {Southern European welfare states are under stress. On the one hand, the
   recession has been causing unemployment to rise and incomes to fall. On
   the other hand, austerity has affected the capacity of welfare states to
   protect those affected. This paper assesses the distributional
   implications of the crisis in Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal from
   2009 to 2013. Using a microsimulation model, we disentangle the
   first-order effects of tax-benefit policies from the broader effects of
   the crisis, and estimate how its burden has been shared across income
   groups. We conclude by discussing the methodological pitfalls and policy
   implications of our research.},

Abstract = {Research Highlights and AbstractThis article shows:
   Clear pluralities of British survey respondents opposed their nation's
   military interventions in Afghanistan and Libya. Opposition to
   involvement in the conflicts mostly a function of the costs the missions
   would impose on the nation and concerns about the morality of the
   missions. Attitudes towards the parties and their leaders are weak
   predictors of the respondents' attitudes towards involving the nation's
   military in the conflict. Survey experiment reveals the positions
   leaders and parties took on sending additional British troops into
   Afghanistan did not prime support or opposition to such a surge'.
   Scholarship is divided on the primary drivers of public support for the
   use of military force. This article addresses this controversy by
   comparing three competing models of British public opinion towards the
   use of military force in Afghanistan and Libya. Analyses of national
   survey data demonstrate that cost-benefit calculations and normative
   considerations have sizable effects, but leader images and other
   heuristics have very limited explanatory power. These results are
   buttressed by experimental evidence showing that leader cues have
   negligible impacts on attitudes towards participation in a military
   surge' in Afghanistan. The minimal role heuristics played in motivating
   citizen support and opposition to the conflicts in these two countries
   contrast with their significant relationship to citizen attitudes
   towards the British intervention in Iraq. These conflicting results
   suggest that the strength of leader and partisan cues may be animated by
   the intensity of inter-elite conflict over British involvement in
   military interventions.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},

Volume = {36},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {321-337},
Abstract = {The Euro crisis presents a puzzle to the post-functionalist approach to
   European integration. In spite of unprecedented social hardships,
   politicization, loss of popular support and political turmoil in the
   Eurozone, the Euro crisis has produced major new steps of technocratic
   supranational integration. This article shows that integration during
   the euro crisis can be sufficiently explained by a neofunctionalist
   account based on path dependency, endogenous preference change and
   functional spill over. Finally, it explores three mechanisms that have
   helped to shield EU-level reform from a constraining dissensus:
   euro-compatible government formation, avoidance of referendums and
   delegation to technocratic supranational organizations.},

Abstract = {Research on active citizenship tends to focus on the government
   perspective on initiatives from the public. In this paper we seek to
   redress the balance by focusing on the practice of citizens'
   initiatives. Two citizens' initiatives in the Netherlands are analyzed
   in terms of their evolution, their organization and the strategies
   adopted. Strategies are viewed here as the contingent product of a
   self-transforming organization, and a way of relating its internal
   process to the outside world. There is a mechanism at work in this
   interaction which enables initiators to connect with others
   successfully. Such interactions can therefore be seen as bonding
   processes, fueled by a process of self-transformation. Their ability to
   adapt and to mobilize people and institutions makes citizens'
   initiatives plural in their manifestations and challenging for
   governance and steering.},

Abstract = {Since the early 2000s, scholars from a variety of disciplines have used
   the concept of financialization to describe a host of structural changes
   in the advanced political economies. Studies of financialization
   interrogate how an increasingly autonomous realm of global finance has
   altered the underlying logics of the industrial economy and the inner
   workings of democratic society. This paper evaluates the insights of
   more than a decade of scholarship on financialization. Three approaches
   will be discussed: the emergence of a new regime of accumulation, the
   ascendency of the shareholder value orientation and the financialization
   of everyday life. It is argued that a deeper understanding of
   financialization will lead to a better understanding of organized
   interests, the politics of the welfare state, and processes of
   institutional change.},

Abstract = {For the comparative study of the effects of electoral systems on the
   descriptive representation of ethnic minorities in parliament, Macedonia
   is a highly interesting case because the country had several elections
   under majoritarian as well as under proportional systems. Whereas most
   observers claim that ethnic Albanians have benefitted from the
   introduction of proportional representation, the article argues that the
   merits of PR have been overstated. First, scholars have often only
   reported members of political parties but not independent candidates in
   parliament. Second, when comparing the share of seats before and after
   the introduction of PR, the growing share of the Albanians in the
   population is usually ignored.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the conditions under which government
   officials who implement policy integrate the best available science into
   regulatory practice. It examines the adoption of rapid wetland
   assessment tools, a type of science policy innovation, by street-level
   bureaucrats in six US Mid-Atlantic states. These bureaucrats operate in
   relatively opaque and discretion-laden institutional settings. The
   analysis of an original survey of state wetland officials shows that
   these officials are more likely to adopt tools when they have more
   opportunities to learn tool-related information and practice norms.
   Bureaucrats' adoption of this class of science policy innovations
   appears facilitated by peer communication via network ties, on-the-job
   experience and incentives and disincentives associated with bureaucrats'
   organisational contexts and operating environments.},

Abstract = {The United States has made repeated public commitments to provide
   humanitarian aid based on need alone. However, some scholars suggest
   that US self-interest is a stronger predictor of US humanitarian
   assistance than need. We examine the tension between self-interest and
   need by studying the allocations made by the US Agency for International
   Development's Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance for more than 100
   developing countries between 1989 and 2009. Moving beyond previous
   studies, we measure need based on both natural (floods, earthquakes,
   hurricanes) and man-made (conflict related) disasters. Contrary to much
   previous scholarship, we find need factors shape the decision to provide
   aid more than US self-interest does. We also find important differences
   in how much humanitarian assistance is distributed in the pre- and
   post-9/11 eras, with foreign policy affinity to the United States and
   battle deaths playing useful roles in how much aid a country receives in
   the post-9/11 period. The findings generally point to the ongoing
   importance of need as a driver of humanitarian aid decisions.},

Abstract = {Electorally, Western European populist political parties have been
   rather successful in the last two decades. But how pervasive is their
   actual populist message? Although some scholars have looked at the
   diffusion of this message, they have only focused on the arena of party
   politics. Research on how widespread populism is beyond the party
   political sphere is still in its infancy. This study looks at populism
   in public debates in the media. Based on a content analysis of opinion
   articles in newspapers in five Western European countries, I demonstrate
   that these debates have become more populist over the years, and that
   the degree of populism is strongly related to the success of populist
   parties. This indicates that populism is more widespread than previously
   assumed. I also show that letters are more populist than other opinion
   articles and that debates in tabloid media are not more populist than
   debates in elite media.},

Abstract = {On War's unfinished state has been a source of difficulties for
   interpretation for 180 years. By establishing a hierarchy of revision
   among the parts, we propose a criterion that can bring any part of On
   War in line with the most advanced stage of Clausewitz's thinking. We
   exemplify the utility, illustrate the underpinnings and appreciate the
   potential of this criterion. We argue that the criterion offers the
   prospect of a shared, coherent, fully consistent and faithful rendering
   of Clausewitz's theory of war.},

Abstract = {Taiwan's anti-nuclear movement has a chequered history over the past
   three decades; its revival after the 2011 Fukushima incident was
   unanticipated. Analysing the political outcomes triggered by a major
   international disaster, I argue that Japan's nuclear catastrophe did not
   directly stimulate Taiwanese activism, but its effect was relayed
   through a host of domestic factors. The persistent efforts of
   anti-nuclear activists after their 2001 defeat were eventually rewarded
   with the local audience becoming more receptive to their message. The
   resurgence of social movements after 2008 also provided a more
   supportive environment. Finally, because the Democratic Progressive
   Party, which in earlier years had been closely associated with the
   anti-nuclear movement, was forced into taking a back seat, anti-nuclear
   sentiment could cross the partisan divide.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The term `human rights' succeeds by the breadth of its application:
   across law, politics and culture. It functions effectively in the fields
   of international, regional and domestic law, while also being an
   important player in the world of international relations. And while
   doing all this, it finds time too to stand for something above politics
   and law, the force of goodness in the world, the importance of each
   individual (no matter how weak) within every polity (no matter how
   strong). How has the idea of human rights achieved this level of
   influence? What are its main challenges today? What sort of future lies
   in store for such universal entitlements? This article offers a broad
   review of the origins of human rights, their current effectiveness and
   the likely directions open to the subject in the years ahead. Its themes
   are drawn from the range of disciplines that make human rights possible.
   Against the odds the author finds in the resilience of human rights
   reasons for hope for a better future, one in which the good work done by
   the term greatly exceeds the damage of which - as history and current
   practice well shows - it is also immensely capable.},

Abstract = {The growth in the use of collaborative governance arrangements has been
   accompanied by burgeoning scholarship in the field of public affairs
   that seeks to understand the benefits of engaging diverse stakeholders
   in common venues. However, few scholars have formally assessed the role
   of government actors in facilitating outcomes for individual
   participants in such efforts. Moreover, little work on collaborative
   governance examines how individual incentives and barriers to collective
   action are formed within the nested nature of these contexts. We
   contribute to the study of collaborative governance by formally
   investigating how the relative centrality of government actors in
   collaborative policy-making venues affects individual relationship
   building and learning for participants therein. We find that government
   actor centrality is positively associated with relationship building and
   learning. However, in testing two different conceptualizations of
   centrality, we find that the definition of this construct clearly
   matters.},

Volume = {54},

Abstract = {Historically, two tendencies have struggled within the Latin America
   region: one, a strongly nationalist outlook emerging from the creation
   of the nation-state in the 19th century; and the other, a unitary
   project to address the threat of an ``external enemy.{''} This paper
   first presents an overview of these two perspectives and examines the
   performance of Mercosur in the past decade, focusing on the creation of
   the collective identity of Mercosur. Then it moves on to examine the
   role of ideas and identity with a view to analyze how this determines
   and constrains decision making, and to study how this role conditions
   regional identity. Finally, consideration is given to collective
   identity in relation to Mercosur.},

Title = {NATIONAL VERSUS ETHNIC IDENTIFICATION IN AFRICA Modernization, Colonial
   Legacy, and the Origins of Territorial Nationalism},
Journal = {WORLD POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {66},
Number = {4},
Pages = {709+},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Communal conflicts, civil wars, and state collapse have led many to
   portray the notion of African nation-states as an oxymoron. Some
   scholars of African politics-often referred to as second-generation
   modernization theorists-have argued that strong ethnic attachments
   across the continent resulted from rapid economic and political
   modernization, the very forces credited with reducing parochial ties and
   consolidating European nations in classic modernization theory. Others
   have argued that national consolidation in Africa is particularly
   unlikely due to high degrees of ethnic diversity, colonial rule that
   exacerbated that diversity, and the partition of cultural groups.
   Despite the ubiquity of these arguments, there has been very little
   comparative empirical research on territorial nationalism in Africa.
   Using individual-level data from sixteen countries, combined with a
   novel compilation of ethnic group and state characteristics, the author
   evaluates the observable implications of these long-respected
   theoretical traditions within a multilevel framework. She finds that
   attachment to the nation, relative to one's ethnic group, increases with
   education, urbanization, and formal employment at the individual level,
   and with economic development at the state level-patterns more
   consistent with classic modernization theory than with second-generation
   modernization theory. Thus, if modernization in Africa does indeed
   intensify ethnic attachment, the impact is overwhelmed by the concurrent
   increase in panethnic territorial nationalism. Similarly, the results
   show that ethnic diversity and the partition of ethnic groups by
   ``artificial{''} state borders increase, rather than decrease, the
   degree to which individuals identify nationally. Taken together, these
   results reject pessimistic expectations of African exceptionalism and
   instead suggest that the emergence of widespread national identification
   within African states is not only possible but even increasingly likely
   with greater economic development.},

Abstract = {De facto states, functional on the ground but unrecognized by most
   states, have long been black boxes for systematic empirical research.
   This study investigates de facto states' internal legitimacypeople's
   confidence in the entity itself, the regime, and institutions. While
   internal legitimacy is important for any state, it is particularly
   important for de facto states, whose lack of external legitimacy has
   made internal legitimacy integral to their quest for recognition. We
   propose that the internal legitimacy of de facto states depends on how
   convincing they are to their citizens as state-builders. Using original
   data from a 2010 survey in Abkhazia, we examine this argument based on
   respondent perceptions of security, welfare, and democracy. Our findings
   suggest that internal legitimacy is shaped by the key Weberian
   state-building function of monopoly of the legitimate use of force, as
   well as these entities' ability to fulfill other aspects of the social
   contract.},

Abstract = {Allowing or restricting foreign movement is a crucial policy choice for
   leaders. We argue that freedom of foreign movement reduces the level of
   civil unrest under non-democratic regimes, but only in some
   circumstances. Our argument relies on the trade-offs inherent in exit
   and voice as distinct strategies for dealing with a corrupt and
   oppressive state. By permitting exit and thereby lowering its relative
   costs, authoritarians can make protest and other modes of expressing
   dissatisfaction less attractive for potential troublemakers.
   Liberalizing foreign movement can thus function as a safety valve for
   releasing domestic pressure. But the degree to which allowing emigration
   is an effective regime strategy is shaped by the economic opportunities
   offered by countries receiving immigrants. We find that freedom of
   foreign movement and the existence of economic opportunities abroad
   reduce civil unrest in non-democratic states. However, at high levels of
   unemployment in the developed world, greater freedom of foreign movement
   actually increases protest.},

Title = {How and why chiefs formalise land use in recent times: the politics of
   land dispossession through biofuels investments in Ghana},
Journal = {REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {41},
Number = {141},

Abstract = {In the current land deals debate, land dispossession is often attributed
   to exploitative acts of agricultural investors. However, the role of
   equally active actors in the making of land deals such as chiefs, who
   customarily are custodians of land, does not feature prominently in the
   debate. The paper shows that the recent surge in large-scale land deals
   in Ghana corresponds with chiefs' pre-existing motivation to
   re-establish authority over land for two reasons: firstly, to formalise
   the use of `stool land' to create rural development opportunities;
   secondly, to formalise boundaries of `stool land' to avert potential
   future land litigations. Social groups lacking recognition from chiefs
   therefore often lose land, whereas land areas of those persons
   recognised by chiefs are protected, sometimes even regardless of their
   `citizenship' identity in project villages. The author argues that an
   understanding of how local social institutions and politics mediate
   investment in land will enrich analyses of processes of land
   dispossession.},

Abstract = {Does domestic political unrest deter foreign direct investment (FDI)?
   And what are the longer term impacts of unrest upon the market? Most
   theories suggest that investors are deterred by unrest. However,
   empirical research returns only marginal support. We argue that these
   mixed results stem from the conflation of the distinct tactics and
   outcomes of political unrest. Violent forms of unrest increase
   uncertainty and risk. By comparison, nonviolent forms of unrest are
   shown to more frequently achieve their goals and increase the prospects
   for democratic change and market stability. In addition, investors avoid
   markets where campaigns have ended in failure, defined as the campaign
   not achieving their stated political aims. Failed campaigns often
   precipitate a cycle of unrest that create greater uncertainty over the
   long-term stability of a state. We find strong evidence in favor of our
   propositions, even after taking political motivation and non-random
   selection into account.},

Abstract = {A new developmentalism is said to have taken hold in Brazil over the
   past decade. Incorporating multiple policy strategies, it has three main
   pillars: promoting inclusive growth in the home economy, engaging the
   international economy to underpin national development and to sustain
   long-term growth, and pursuing internal and external objectives through
   the collaboration of a strong state and a strong market. In spite of
   several major accomplishments, this approach has disproportionately used
   industrial policy tools to privilege firms in traditional sectors and
   foster increased reliance on commodities, tendencies that have been
   enabled by bureaucratic incoherence and weak oversight of public
   financing. This makes it unlikely that deep productive transformation, a
   key developmentalist objective as defined by the East Asian experience,
   will materialize.},

Abstract = {The governance of climate change is in flux. In the understandable rush
   to explore what is filling the governance gaps created by gridlock in
   the international regime, scholars risk under-appreciating the capacity
   of states to engage in policy innovation at national and sub-national
   levels. Based on a review of existing concepts and theoretical
   explanations for (in) action at this level, we make the case for
   adopting a more holistic approach to understanding policy innovation,
   covering the source of new policy elements ('invention'), their wider
   entry into use ('diffusion'), and their projected and/or real effects
   ('evaluation'). The analytical and methodological challenges that arise
   from integrating these three perspectives are systematically explored
   and integrated into a new analytical framework used in the other
   contributions to this volume to explore more fully the politics of
   invention, diffusion, and evaluation in specific areas of mitigation and
   adaptation policy.},

Abstract = {This note uses a new data set on international territorial disputes and
   boundary agreements to explore whether and how legal commitments affect
   state behavior. Do border treaties reduce subsequent conflict simply
   through their effect on the distribution of the disputed good, or do
   treaties have legal and political implications such that a given
   distribution of territory has different effects depending on whether it
   is de facto or de jure? There are three main results. First, among
   states that have homeland territory disputes, the adoption of a legally
   binding border is associated with a significant reduction in the
   likelihood of future militarized conflict over the territory. Second,
   this effect is the same regardless of whether the treaty transfers
   territory or converts a de facto or contested border into a de jure
   border without changing the status quo distribution. Third, there is no
   equivalent reduction in conflict when states create explicitly
   provisional borders that allow them to retain their claims to areas that
   they do not possess. These findings suggest that border treaties do more
   than simply specify the distribution of territory and provide for
   transfers. By requiring states to renounce claims to territories that
   they do not receive, treaties generate ex ante costs of signing and/or
   ex post costs for reneging that explain their association with
   subsequent peace.},

Abstract = {The tragic events of 10 April 2010 became one of the most important
   topics of public discourse in Poland. They remain its central issue
   until today. This paper is an attempt to investigate one aspect of the
   phenomenon: the impact of the disaster and subsequent events on the
   presidential election of 2010. It is based on the results of research
   carried out within the Polish National Election Study (PNES) project. At
   least three reasons make it plausible that the Smolensk catastrophe had
   a great impact on Polish politics. Firstly, the disaster had legal and
   constitutional consequences; the sudden death of a head of state always
   generates a number of specific actions, policy changes, and (most
   importantly from the perspective of this paper) determines the election
   calendar. Secondly, the disaster had psychological consequences; it
   caused a strong psychological shock for participants in the political
   process, which redefined political competition, public discourse, and
   the media coverage. Thirdly, narratives about the events preceding the
   crash and following it quickly became an important element of Polish
   politics, especially in the media and in the electoral campaign. The
   main finding of the paper is that the Smolensk catastrophe did not
   produce a fundamental change in the political preferences and voting
   patterns of Polish citizens. At both the aggregate and individual level
   we observe relative stability in voter turnout patterns and voting
   preferences. The paper also finds that the catastrophe strengthened
   existing preferences and behavior patterns, and it petrified existing
   divisions. This paper is a study of voting behavior in extreme
   situations. It analyses a unique phenomenon-voting during a huge social
   trauma and right afterwards. Thus, in addition to the idiographic
   objective of the paper (explanation of voting behavior in the 2010
   presidential election in Poland), it also has a nomothetic aspect,
   because it contributes to the theoretical discussions about voting
   behavior in traumatic, exceptional situations. It can serve as a
   reference point for future studies addressing the issue of electoral
   behavior in unexpected, unusual contexts.},

Abstract = {In the first federal and national elections after the collapse of
   communism in Czechoslovakia, supporters for Moravian autonomy achieved
   significant levels of representation and obtained nearly a quarter of
   the vote in Moravia itself. This movement was short-lived. The Czech
   Republic would not become a federal state and the Moravian movement
   disintegrated. Scholars have suggested that the Moravian movement was a
   temporary phenomenon linked to the collapse of communism. It is argued
   in this article that the economic, historical and cultural bases for a
   Moravian movement pre-date the post-communist euphoria. Instead, the
   decline of the movement can be attributed in part to governmental
   decisions motivated by a fear of further state disintegration after the
   creation of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Institutional changes with
   the creation of the Senate and the Kraj have been explained by party
   politics and by Czech-EU relations. In this article, it is argued that
   these reforms were also motivated by a desire to weaken Moravian
   identity. The Moravian autonomy movement has collapsed but economic,
   historical, and cultural distinctions remain. Furthermore, despite these
   reforms, there are differences in the electoral behavior of Moravians
   and Bohemian that could serve as the potential base for future regional
   mobilization.},

Abstract = {State capacity is a key concept for research in public policy and
   political science. Despite its importance, there is no broadly accepted
   measure of state capacity in the existing literature, and frequently
   used measures of capacity have not been examined for their validity. We
   begin with an explicit definition of state capacity - the state's
   ability to implement public policy - and connect this definition to a
   measurable outcome of state capacity - the state's taxation of income.
   We show that this measure, income taxes as a percentage of total tax
   revenue, is a useful indicator of state capacity and meets higher
   standards of measurement validity than other tax-based indicators. We
   also compare our measure to the most common existing indicators of state
   capacity to show that income taxation is a better theoretical and
   statistical measure of states' effectiveness in policy implementation.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {37},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {770-792},
Month = {JUL 29},
Abstract = {The French doctrine towards peace operations has, over the last two
   decades, reflected the ambivalence of France's position, stretched
   between on the one hand a military culture that places the use of force
   at the centre of strategy and on the other hand multidimensional
   operations that by their nature integrate a large range of activities.
   As a consequence France has evolved as a `reluctant peacekeeper': while
   it has been significantly involved in peace operations since the end of
   the Cold War, the military has never felt comfortable with the
   peacekeeping concept, seen as a dilution of their primary function of
   fighting wars. This tension has shaped both doctrinal development and
   operations. Twenty years after the French engagement in former
   Yugoslavia, lessons have been learnt, and policy-makers have become
   aware of the evolution of conflict management and the subsequent
   necessity to integrate the military dimension into a broader framework.
   Yet France's policy is still shaped by a certain aversion towards the
   concept of long-term multinational peace operations, and a parallel
   preference for more focused and reactive operations. The merits of the
   use of force are central to these debates. While these policy
   preferences are responses to legitimate concerns about both the
   efficiency of foreign interventions and the soldier's identity, they
   also raise questions as to their compatibility with the long term and
   multidimensional requirements of bringing sustainable peace in fragile
   states.},

Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {442-458},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) is frequently criticized as
   being an inefficient talking shop. Such criticism is partially due to
   the fact that UNGA resolutions are not legally binding, and partially
   due to the considerable share of resolutions that are debated repeatedly
   in multiple UNGA sessions. This article shows that more than half of the
   resolutions on the negotiation agenda of the UNGA in a given year are
   not novel, but have been discussed in the same arena in the past. As
   this increases the negotiation workload and also the capacity
   requirements of the member states, the widespread phenomenon of
   repetitions is puzzling. Therefore, the article examines the reasons
   behind reoccurring resolutions. It distinguishes between incrementalist
   and symbolic rationales and sheds light on the different motivations for
   repetitions in a series of case studies. This reveals that both
   rationales matter for repeating resolutions and that neither symbolic
   politics nor incrementalism are confined to specific types of issues or
   actors.},

   MASCULINITIES IN THE MINIBUS-TAXI INDUSTRY},
Journal = {AFRICAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {113},

Abstract = {The last two decades of economic decline in Africa have drawn attention
   to the crisis of masculinities, to ``failed men{''} unable to build
   kinship networks and to ``violent men{''} who damage social networks
   whilst competing for scarce resources. This article argues that a
   fragmented, neoliberal society also produces new patterns of patriarchal
   aggrandisement. Focusing on Johannesburg's minibus-taxi industry, it
   shows how large informal sector activities are structured through
   kinship networks that in turn give rise to modes of masculinity seeking
   to control these networks. Johannesburg's minibus-taxi business is
   dominated by retrenched labour migrants, who moved into the
   transportation sector in the 1980s and 1990s at a time of industrial
   decline. It thus offers a case study of the changing patterns of
   accumulation and household formation in a social landscape where kinship
   ties continue to constitute the key relationships of obligation and
   support. Drawing on three-dozen core interviews with Zulu-speaking taxi
   owners and transporters, this article demonstrates that the taxi owner
   and the taxi boss are men to be emulated, but that the relationships
   between ``big men{''} and ``failed{''} or ``violent{''} men are
   uncomfortably close.},

Abstract = {The emergence of ``big data{''} offers unprecedented opportunities for
   not only accelerating scientific advances, but also enabling new modes
   of discovery. While we understand how to automate routine aspects of
   data management and analytics, most elements of the scientific process
   currently require considerable human expertise and effort. We argue that
   realizing the full potential of data to accelerate discovery calls for a
   concerted effort in advancing Discovery Informatics: (i) understanding,
   formalization, and information processing descriptions of the entire
   scientific process; (ii) design, development, and evaluation of the
   computational artifacts (representations and processes) that embody such
   understanding; and (iii) application of the resulting artifacts and
   systems to advance science (by augmenting individual or collective human
   efforts, or by fully automating science).},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {In the contemporary multiplying uncertainties of local governments,
   politicians and public managers are constantly faced by a recurrent
   problem: despite financial constraints and with scarce resources, they
   have to combine the delivery of efficient public services with local
   economic development and democratic quality. This paper draws on an
   ethnography concerning the design and implementation of a Strategic
   Planning process within a Spanish city government and is framed by the
   proposition that local governments are experimental places for what is
   usually referred to as democratic governance. Focusing on the way in
   which the use of Strategic Planning entails a trade-off between urban
   and economic development and democracy, the article explores how this
   formal mechanism of citizens' and business' participation serves to
   establish relational processes to reinvigorate local economic
   development, democracy and administrative modernization. The paper also
   argues that, in order to fully implement new urban development practices
   at the local level, it is necessary to take into account not only
   institutional issues, but also the communal, social and political
   resources that frame both formal and informal deliberations propelled by
   the Strategic Planning process. It is the interaction and combination of
   these that determine the paths and developments of local government
   innovations.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to show that the current European Union
   (EU) legal framework is unnecessarily restrictive and unduly suppresses
   economic and developmental initiatives in many stagnating regions across
   Europe. More innovative industrial policies, instruments and measures
   should be adopted in a highly decentralized manner across the EU.
   Between the `laissez-faire' and `dirigiste' approaches, there is
   significant room to maneuver for more pro-active industrial and
   development policies. New forms of industrial policies could and should
   be reinvented and implemented across the EU not to harm or distort
   competition, but rather to further enhance it. More than one form and
   framework exist for a Single Market and for the competition
   policies.Modern industrial policy presupposes high-quality public
   institutions with highly competent administration. It requires autonomy
   and accountability of the public administration to counter the pressures
   of various interest groups. The proposal to revive and articulate modern
   types of industrial policies across the EU is a call for comprehensive
   economic and social restructuring. The task of modern industrial policy
   is to organize and strengthen capabilities of restructuring in the
   direction of high-productivity activities.},

Abstract = {Based on a study of reliability consequences of New Public Management
   (NPM) reforms in Norwegian critical infrastructure sectors, this article
   suggests that the discourse of work found in NPM renders essential
   aspects of operational work invisible - including practices that are
   known to be of importance for reliability. We identify two such
   organizationally `invisible' characteristics of operational work: the
   ongoing situational coordination required for keeping a water supply
   system or an electricity grid running, and the aggregating operational
   history within which this happens. In the reorganized infrastructure
   sectors, these crucial aspects of operational work fit poorly in market
   oriented organizational models and control mechanisms. More generally,
   our analysis contributes to the understanding of how some types of work
   fit poorly within the discourse of work found in NPM.},

Abstract = {Previous scholarship has largely failed to address the effect of
   economic interdependence on issue areas other than interstate conflict.
   This study seeks to redress this lacuna by focusing on states' visa
   policies and examining the impact of trade and capital interdependence
   in the context of transnational terrorism. The article argues that
   economic ties affect visa policies through a reconfiguration of
   preferences and the opportunity costs of economic loss and by tempering
   the impact of terrorism. To support this claim, the study conducts
   statistical analysis using directed dyad data on the visa policies of
   207 states and independent political units. The article shows that the
   impact of economic interdependence is contingent on whether states are
   directly targeted in attacks of terrorism or face indirect threats from
   global terror. The study finds that economic incentives overwhelm
   security concerns when threats are indirect but have relatively limited
   influence, given threats against a state's own citizens or territory.},

Abstract = {This article analyses how, within the European Union foreign policy
   system, information is gathered and knowledge is constructed. The
   analysis is based on the evidence provided by a unique dataset,
   comprising the Heads of Mission reports between 1998 and 2010 and the EU
   member states' diplomatic networks. After distinguishing between
   information and knowledge, the article tackles three related aspects.
   First, it shows that the EU is able not only to favour information
   exchanges, but also to gather information and construct knowledge.
   Second, it argues that, while member states have an interest in
   contributing their own information and knowledge, European knowledge is
   also possible. This is demonstrated by means of an in-depth analysis of
   the preparation of the Heads of Mission report on East Jerusalem. Third,
   the article suggests that, depending on the reach of their diplomatic
   network, some member states are interested more than others in European
   information, but all member states are interested in European knowledge
   and in each other's interpretation of current affairs.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the special issue on policy work at the
   sub-national government level and non-governmental sector in three
   countries: Australia, Canada, and the Czech Republic. It consists of
   three parts. First, new public governance theory is presented as a
   general theoretical perspective that captures some of the important
   macro factors influencing the nature of current policy work. Second, an
   overview of empirical findings on policy work of subnational governments
   and NGOs is provided. This review discusses different possible
   interpretations of these findings. Third, main findings from each paper
   presented in this special issue are summarized. (C) 2014 Policy and

Abstract = {Much of the diffusion literature in international relations,
   international political economy, and comparative public policy focuses
   on explaining patterns of convergence among states, international
   organizations, and transnational organizations. This literature suggests
   that full or complete convergence is not a necessary or even likely
   outcome of diffusion processes. However, as of yet, findings of varying
   degrees of convergence remain largely context-specific and a more
   general and systematic review of the mechanisms explaining ``how
   much{''} convergence occurs is still missing. To address this gap, this
   article offers a state-of-the-art review of studies describing and
   explaining the phenomenon. On that basis, we trace the occurrence of
   varying degrees of convergence back to differences in (i) the nature of
   the underlying diffusion model; (ii) the specificity of the diffusion
   item; (iii) the type of diffusion mechanism in operation; and (iv) the
   institutional context at the point of adoption.},
