Abstract = {Although intelligence postmortems are a common practice in the aftermath
   of intelligence failure, little is known about how they are conducted.
   This article explores the methodology employed by Robert Jervis in
   intelligence postmortems that followed the fall of the Shah of Iran in
   1979 and the formulation of the 2002 Iraq national intelligence estimate
   that warned of the possibility that Iraq had restarted its nuclear
   program. The analysis reveals the challenges faced by scholars as they
   attempt to assess why analysts failed to offer accurate estimates and
   the way contemporary international relations theory can be applied to
   the realm of policy. The findings of the postmortems also shed light on
   areas where additional collaboration among scholars and analysts can
   advance the art of intelligence analysis.},

Abstract = {Why do some interest groups express more policy preferences than others
   during open consultations organized by the European Commission? This
   article examines this question by testing an explanatory framework that
   emphasizes the inter-organizational context in which lobbying takes
   place and interest groups' resource endowment. The empirical analysis
   focuses on environmental policy-making. The findings show that interest
   groups' preference articulation behaviour is largely influenced by the
   number of inter-organizational linkages they have with other
   stakeholders. Resource endowment matters in that resource-rich interest
   organizations are found to be less likely to articulate their
   preferences via open consultations. Interest groups' organizational form
   is also a relevant predictor of the likelihood they articulate
   preferences: in consultations, European federations voice more
   preferences than national or individual organizations.},

Abstract = {The need to honour the dead is universal, and of particular importance
   in animist cultures, where the aggrieved dead can cause illness, crop
   failure, infertility and failure to marry. While the angry dead and
   their role in rural communities after state conflict are increasingly
   acknowledged in the transitional justice literature, there have been no
   longitudinal studies on the humanitarian outcomes and transformational
   possibilities of exhuming and reburying murdered civilians. Exhumations
   in rural Zimbabwe in the 1990s, which allowed the reburial of civilians
   killed in the 1980s Gukurahundi massacres, are assessed here from the
   vantage point of 2014. Families mostly continue to reflect on positive
   outcomes from the reburials. The reburials are perceived as having
   transformed family dynamics, healing rifts and allowing for the
   reintegration of alleged sell-outs. Retrospectively, it is clear that
   most people did not know where their relatives were until the
   exhumations provided a context for previously silent neighbours to tell
   the truth. Exhumed gravesites that were once indicative of horrific
   murders now signify wrongs that were put right, allowing the community
   to `go there.' The potential of reburials to address the rights of the
   living dead needs to be more widely addressed in transitional justice
   policies.},

Abstract = {Seeking to explain the difficult cases of delayed democratic transition
   in the Western Balkans, recent literature argues that `national
   identity' significantly limits the effectiveness of external actors'
   political conditionality. This argument is tested in this article by
   investigating Serbia's co-operation with the International Criminal
   Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), which was demanded by the
   United States and the European Union (EU). The findings show that
   incidents of Serbian co-operation with the ICTY were not preceded by
   widespread national identity change; rather, co-operation occurred when
   Serbia was faced with consistent external pressure and the immediate
   prospect of small-scale rewards. Conditionality thus remained effective.
   These findings challenge theoretical arguments that issues of national
   identity may impede external actors' projection of power, independently
   of domestic actors' cost-benefit calculations. Moreover, they suggest
   that, in the future, external actors such as the EU may continue to rely
   upon political conditionality for their democratization agenda, even
   concerning domestically sensitive issue-areas.},

Abstract = {Why do some authoritarian rulers, such as Saddam Hussein, kill or
   torture other people personally, whereas others, like Joseph Stalin,
   delegate such violence to subordinates? Such politically motivated
   interpersonal violence committed by authoritarian leaders has never
   before been theorized. Through a comparison of Hussein and Stalin, we
   explain why some dictators engage in this behavior and others do not. We
   propose a model based on three components: the individual's prior
   habituation or non-habituation to violence; regime characteristics that
   `select for' a personally violent or non-violent ruler; and, once a
   ruler takes power, the interaction of the first two variables. We also
   suggest that most communist regimes featured organizational
   characteristics that discouraged such violence by the leader.},

Abstract = {The arrest of the protest punk band Pussy Riot (PR) in March 2012 and
   the subsequent prosecution of three band members pose a significant
   puzzle for political science. Although PR's performances presented a
   coherent alternative to the Putin regime's image of Russian reality, it
   was unlikely that the discordant music and crude lyrics of their art
   protest would inspire Russian society to take to the streets. Yet, the
   regime mounted a very visible prosecution against the three young women.
   We argue that the trial marked a shift in the Kremlin's strategy to
   shape state-society relations. In the face of declining economic
   conditions and social unrest, the PR trial encapsulated the Kremlin's
   renewed focus on three related mechanisms to insure social support:
   coercion, alliance building, and symbolic politics. The PR trial
   afforded the Kremlin an important opportunity to simultaneously redefine
   its loyal constituency, secure the Church-state relationship, and
   stigmatize the opposition.},

Title = {Controlling Capital: The International Monetary Fund and Transformative
   Incremental Change from Within International Organisations},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Pages = {445-469},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {As a result of a long-running internal debate there have been notable
   incremental changes to how the International Monetary Fund (IMF) treats
   capital controls, particularly those directed at inflows. These changes
   combine new acceptance of these policy instruments with an older
   emphasis on their negative consequences and on the desirability of free
   movement of capital. Policy change of this sort is puzzling from the
   standpoint of the existing literature on international organisations
   (IOs), which has thus far paid little attention to transformative
   incremental change associated with long-term contestation. This article
   departs from this tendency by drawing on insights from principal-agent
   theory, constructivism and historical institutionalism to identify the
   conditions under which such change may originate. I argue that actors
   within IOs are likely to pursue incremental change by layering new
   policies on to old ones as a way to build coalitions and to respond to
   external organisational insecurity imperatives and diverse member state
   preferences and to internal path-dependent organisational cultural
   features. Over time the incremental shifts brought by layering can
   induce transformative rather than reproductive change because they fit
   with consequentialist and appropriateness behavioural logics. I
   illustrate this argument by investigating recent changes in IMF policy
   on capital controls.},

Title = {The Impact of Patents on Innovation, Technology Transfer and Health: A
   Pre- and Post-TRIPs Analysis of India's Pharmaceutical Industry},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {The debate surrounding the World Trade Organization's Trade-Related
   Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) Agreement indicates that
   patents matter for development. Yet literature on the geography of
   knowledge transfer shows that knowledge is spatially sticky, suggesting
   that the impact of patents can be exaggerated. Using interview evidence,
   this paper explores how Indian pharmaceutical firms have responded to
   changes in patent law, including the introduction of more extensive
   patent protection in 2005 as a condition of TRIPs. A regime of limited
   patent protection for over three decades prior to TRIPs facilitated
   informal knowledge transfer and the emergence of a pharmaceutical
   industry with significant domestic capabilities. Contrary to some
   expectations, the Indian pharmaceutical industry has continued to grow
   post-TRIPs, with large domestic firms becoming involved in more formal
   technology transfer as part of an increasingly collaborative
   relationship with multinationals. This trend is also driven by a focus
   on the markets of developed countries, raising questions for the future
   sustainability of India's low-priced medicines. While changes in patent
   law can facilitate or inhibit a variety of aspects of development, the
   adaptation of the Indian pharmaceutical industry suggests that their
   impact must be related to the broader institutional setting,
   particularly the underlying domestic capabilities.},

Abstract = {Human trafficking, and especially sex trafficking, is not only
   susceptible to alluring and sensational narratives, it also plays into
   the celebrity-as-rescuer ideal that receives considerable attention from
   the media, the public, and policy-makers. While some celebrities develop
   enough expertise to speak with authority on the topic, many others are
   neither knowledgeable nor accurate in their efforts to champion
   antitrafficking causes. Prominent policy-makers allow celebrity
   activists to influence their opinions and even consult with them for
   advice regarding public policies. Emblematic of larger, fundamental
   problems with the dominant discourse, funding allocations, and
   legislation in current antitrafficking initiatives in the United States
   and elsewhere, celebrity activism is not significantly advancing the
   eradication of human trafficking and may even be doing harm by diverting
   attention from aspects of the problem and solution that sorely require
   attention.},

Abstract = {The article uses a variety of documents, published and unpublished, to
   explore the 1923 arrest, interrogation and `trial' of Mirsaid
   Sultan-Galiev, often considered the Bolsheviks' leading expert on Muslim
   affairs in the early Soviet period. Contrary to the historiography on
   this crucial moment in the development of Soviet nationality policy, I
   argue that Sultan-Galiev was not Stalin's `first victim'. Rather,
   responding to the vagaries of Soviet nationality policy, he did indeed
   violate party discipline in a number of ways, and was engaged in
   developing conspiratorial ties outside of the party. In fact, the party
   leaders, and Stalin in particular, treated him less severely than they
   could have.},

Abstract = {The formal end of apartheid was greeted with optimism and expectations.
   A new Government of National Unity with Nelson Mandela at its head
   signaled a new just and democratic social order, including social
   justice in and through education. Twenty years later, formally
   desegregated yet class-based educational institutions, continuing
   disparities and inequities, and poor academic achievement are key
   features of the contemporary educational order. This article considers
   how far South Africa has come since 1994 in realizing laudable
   constitutional and policy goals, especially equity, quality, and social
   justice in education. It argues, however, that, as a consequence of
   policy, the doors of learning remain firmly shut to the majority of
   South Africans. Some key strategies to advance social justice are
   identified. A failure to act now and with urgency to reform South
   Africa's educational approach betrays constitutional ideals and leaves
   intact the systemic crisis of education that especially affects South
   Africa's historically disadvantaged and marginalized peoples.},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {After two decades in which transnational governance of production
   processes has typically meant voluntary subscription to privately
   developed standards, some transnational rulemaking projects are
   promoting mandatory compliance with law. The emerging timber legality
   regime is one example of this, and scholars' efforts to theorize this
   regime have produced provocative new analyses of interactions between
   public and private standards. Recent analyses, including those in this
   issue, predict that the new legality regime will bolster voluntary
   initiatives that certify sustainable forests. Based on research in
   Indonesia and China, I argue that this prediction is questionable and
   that the rise of the timber legality regime could constrict, rather than
   expand the space for global private authority. Further, I argue that it
   would not be entirely a bad thing if the legality regime overtook
   sustainability certification. Behind these specific arguments are
   general perspectives on how domestic circumstances shape transnational
   business governance and on the role of states in pluralistic fields of
   governance - both issues that are obscured by more architectural
   approaches.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the rules and practices pertaining to visa
   regimes and the crossing of borders across the European Union, Israel
   and the Palestinian territories. Their consideration as three
   interlinked entities rests on the high degree of EU-Israeli
   interdependence, the EU's deep involvement in the Palestinian
   territories and Israel's control over the latter. The article evidences
   the existence of variegated borders regimes applying to different
   categories of Israelis, Palestinians and EU citizens, together with
   Israel's outstanding prerogatives in defining these practices. The
   analysis suggests conceptualizing the space comprising the EU and
   Israel/Palestine as overlapping borderlands, with Israel and the
   territories emerging as a single, yet highly fragmented, space in which
   borders are alternative expressions of power relations in protracted
   conflicts. With the EU being drawn into prevailing conflict dynamics,
   the type and extent of EU-Israeli-Palestinian interconnectedness thus
   undermine the coherent implementation of Brussels' mainly bilateral
   policies towards Israel and the territories.},

Abstract = {Research has recognized that states enable or constrain private
   governance initiatives, but we still know too little about the
   interactions between private and public authority in the governance of
   various social and environmental problems. This article examines how
   states have responded to the emergence of forest and fisheries
   certification programs, and how state responses have influenced the
   subsequent development of these programs. It is argued that historical
   and structural differences in the management of forest and fisheries
   have resulted in divergent state responses to certification programs,
   but that both trajectories of interaction have led to a strengthening of
   the non-state program. The article draws upon these cases to inductively
   identify types of interaction between state policies and non-state
   certification programs, the causal mechanisms that shed light on
   interaction dynamics, and the conditions under which state involvement
   is likely to result in either strengthening or weakening of non-state
   programs.},

Abstract = {In this article we explore the concept of depletion through social
   reproduction (DSR). We describe depletion, identify its key indicators
   and suggest different methodologies that could be used to measure it. We
   discuss issues having to do with gendered harm as well as questions
   about how depletion might be reversed. We conclude that recognizing DSR
   in this way can be a powerful tool for understanding the consequences of
   non-recognition of the value of domestic work to national economies, as
   well as the harm that might accrue in the doing of this work at both a
   systemic and individual level.},

Abstract = {International economic issues have become a foremost government concern
   since the start of the global financial crisis, leaving economic
   security increasingly linked to more traditional concepts of national
   interest and politico-military security. This prioritization has been
   reflected in the recent requirements of the United Kingdom's
   intelligence and security actors. Yet, scholarly research has neglected
   the relationship between intelligence, international economics, and
   contemporary security policy. Taking current requirements as a catalyst,
   this article draws on contemporary British history to explore when
   intelligence can be used to protect economic security and when
   intelligence actors can best use economic measures to achieve broader
   politico-military goals. The use of secret intelligence in the economic
   sphere does, however, have certain limitations and it should therefore
   only be employed when necessary.},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates that most new EU Member States experience
   serious problems of state capture. It argues that central European
   states cluster around two dominant modes of party competition. In the
   first, predominantly ideologically committed elites (Poland, Hungary,
   Estonia, Slovenia and Estonia) established relatively electoral
   professional' party competitions, only to face deepening fiscal
   constraints on mainstream ideological competition. Following the
   collapse of the social democratic left, both Hungary and Poland
   experienced attempts to reassert political monopoly, i.e., party state
   capture'. In the second group (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania,
   Bulgaria and Latvia), more entrepreneurial political elites established
   brokerage' party systems, in which public policy remains a side-product
   of an essentially economic competition. All five states show high levels
   of corporate state capture' in which public power is exercised primarily
   for private gain. These findings contest the more optimistic
   expectations of the institutionalist literature on state-building and
   democratic consolidation.},

Abstract = {The aim of this chapter is to evaluate the business world as a
   battlefield by establishing a contact between the basic characteristics
   of the competition strategies and Sun Tzu's principles. In order to
   fulfill this aim, qualitative research method was used and Sun Tzu's
   book The Art of War was investigated in respect of competition, and the
   studies on this subject were comprehensively evaluated. As a result, a
   conceptual fragment was formed for the terms used in the book so as to
   adapt Sun Tzu's principles to the study. According to this conceptual
   fragment, the matching is as follows: war - competition; enemies -
   competitors; environmental conditions - elements affecting the
   competition environment and the management and decisions of the company;
   battlefield - business world/market; weapons - means used in the
   strategy construction of the organization and in the implementation of
   the strategies.},

Abstract = {During the Second World War there was an increasingly developed system
   for controlling the code-names used for operations where different
   Allied forces were involved. This paper follows the development of this
   system -based on the British InterServices Security Board -that spread
   to overseas theatres on the British side and to American forces
   world-wide. The selection of code-names was not without controversy;
   with Winston Churchill getting personally involved and his intervention
   is highlighted. A critique of the system is attempted, although the
   final judge is ultimately the success of the security of the activities
   disguised by the code-names.},

Abstract = {Applying the `victory at all costs' principle adopted during World War
   II, partisans-the long arm of the Soviet regime in the occupied
   territories-pressured civilians to resist the enemy. The thinking behind
   most of their coercive policies seemed rational within the framework of
   this concept; however, the passions produced by merciless fighting,
   communist dogma, Stalinist culture with its habitual witch-hunts, and
   the belief in collective guilt frequently escalated coercion far beyond
   rational limits. Partisans increased the polarisation of civilian
   society between supporters and enemies of the Soviet state, killing
   thousands of bystanders in the process.},

Abstract = {Today the segregation of duties is commonly used to ensure regulatory
   compliance in various industries. This article considers the
   organizational requirements for the effective implementation of this
   principle, through an examination of a duality-based
   segregation-of-duties type control system and its fundamental
   characteristics. Cases from the Swedish banking and finance sector are
   discussed to show how breakdowns in duality-based systems have
   compromised compliance and even encouraged crime, and how crimes could
   be carried out in practice. Particular attention is paid to the critical
   role that gullibility, loyalty, and dependency relations among employees
   played in these cases, in leading control persons to neglect their
   responsibility to review and approve their colleagues' work, while
   bringing no consequences for their ability to carry on performing their
   work tasks. The argument is made that an effective duality-based
   segregation-of-duties type control system presupposes social relations
   characterized by relative autonomy and third-party dependence, along
   with work task interdependence.},

Abstract = {Although politicization has become a key concept in European integration
   studies, it is still contested whether, when and to what extent European
   issues have become politicized in domestic political arenas. This
   article contributes to this discussion both in conceptual and empirical
   terms. It uses a new multidimensional index of politicization to
   systematically trace the development of politicization in national
   election campaigns in five West European countries (Austria, Britain,
   France, Germany and Switzerland) from the 1970s to 2010. The findings
   provide clear evidence that Europe has indeed been politicized in the
   past decades. Moreover, two different paths towards such a
   politicization are identified. One of these paths is dominated by
   populist radical parties from the right, while the other path is shaped
   by the conflict between mainstream parties in government and opposition.
   On both paths, conflicts over membership play an important role and
   cultural-identitarian framing strategies are used.},

Abstract = {Varied forms of mobility are rapidly transforming communities across the
   world. In Africa's cities and urban peripheries, the results of human
   movements include ever more diverse sets of new arrivals living
   alongside longer-term residents as they seek protection, profit, and
   passage elsewhere. Some move on and others return home, while still
   others shift within in search of new opportunities or security. In the
   absence of muscular state institutions or dominant cultural norms, these
   areas have become estuarial zones in which varied communities of
   convenience are taking shape. Unlike well-documented urban gateways or
   ghettos, these communities range from radical forms of exclusion to
   remarkable modes of accommodation that enable people to extract usufruct
   rights: to live in but not become fully part of the cities they occupy.
   Using examples from Maputo, Johannesburg, and Nairobi, this article
   explores the nature of these estuaries in ways that challenge the
   conceptual foundations typically informing debates over migrant rights,
   integration, and the boundaries of belonging. This means eroding clear
   distinctions between hosts and guests along with a call to reevaluate
   the relative importance of state institutions and policies. Most
   fundamentally, it questions new residents' interests in localized
   political and social recognition and participation. The article
   concludes by suggesting the need to reconsider the forms and scale of
   community through which the newly urbanized claim rights and the nature
   of the rights they desire.},

Abstract = {Both the Russian public and its elites were taken by surprise by the
   fact that Russia has become an immigration country. It has resulted in
   widespread anti-immigrant sentiments and inconsistency in government
   actions. Russian immigration politics, as well as immigration politics
   in liberal democracies of the West, are characterised by a wavering
   between protectionist and liberal laissez faire approaches. This leads
   to a mismatch between public rhetoric and legal decisions. However, two
   features seem to make the Russian situation specific: open borders with
   most of the countries of the former Soviet Union and omnipresent
   corruption. Corruption results in a discrepancy between formal (legal)
   decisions and informal (illegal) practices.},

Abstract = {Concerns about performance and cost efficiency have taken center stage
   in discussions about the funding and oversight of public universities in
   recent years. One of the primary manifestations of these concerns is the
   rise of performance funding policies, or policies that seek to directly
   link state appropriations to the outcomes institutions generate for
   students. Despite the popularity of these policies, relatively little
   systematic research examines their effect on student outcomes at public
   colleges and universities. We use data collected from the Integrated
   Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) to analyze the effectiveness
   of performance funding policies as a mechanism for improving student
   graduation, persistence, and degree attainment in more than 500
   postsecondary institutions in all fifty states over a span of 18 years.
   We find that current performance funding policies are not associated
   with higher levels of student performance and that these policies may in
   fact contribute to lower performance over a longer period of time.
   However, more recent policies linked to institutional base funding may
   produce some likelihood of long-term improvement and require additional
   research.},

Abstract = {In the absence of public information on the inner workings of the
   Russian political regime, especially during Medvedev's presidency,
   outside observers often have to rely on politicians' unguarded comments
   or subjective analysis. Instead, we turn to quantitative text analysis
   of political rhetoric. Treating governors as a quasi-expert panel, we
   argue that policy positions revealed in regional legislative addresses
   explain how elites perceived the distribution of power between Putin and
   Medvedev. We find that governors moved from a neutral position in 2009
   to a clearly pro-Putin position in 2011, and that policy initiatives
   advocated by Medvedev all but evaporated from the rhetoric of governors
   in 2012.},

Abstract = {This article examines transnational environmental networks as an
   important and thus far under-studied mechanism that can influence the
   pathways toward compliance with European Union (EU) legislation in new
   Member States. The argument stipulates that transnational networks, on
   balance, increase the capacity and political leverage of Central and
   Eastern European states and societal actors to activate management and
   enforcement paths to compliance with EU environmental norms. The
   theoretical framework specifies the network assets and the mechanisms
   through which they can support the two paths to compliance. In the
   empirical section, this framework is used to examine the impact of
   transnational environmental networks on the compliance with EU
   biodiversity directives in two of the most recent Member States:
   Bulgaria and Romania.},

Abstract = {Studies in the wake of the ``cultural turn{''} in diplomatic history
   have shown that propaganda and public diplomacy were key aspects of
   Western Cold War strategy This article expands recent literature by
   focusing on propaganda practices at the grassroots level, making use of
   West and East German archival records to trace information campaigns in
   relation to the Vietnam War. In addition to explaining the organization
   of East German propaganda campaigns, the article explores the methods
   used by the psychological warfare section of West Germany's Ministry of
   Defense. This section maintained an unofficial network that helped
   publish ``camouflaged propaganda{''} at home as well as in France and
   Great Britain. Germany's Nazi past was an important aspect of East
   Germany's campaign that accused West Germany of having deployed a
   ``Vietnam Legion.{''} Interestingly, Germany's Nazi legacy also cast a
   shadow over the methods West German psychological warfare experts relied
   on to counter East German accusations.},

Abstract = {This article examines Belarusian strategies in the bilateral
   politico-military alliance with Russia, focusing on the issue of
   recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, in addition to the evolution
   of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation. It argues that the
   approaches interpreting the alliance as a response to decisions of
   external actors cannot fully account for the disagreements between the
   parties. The analysis of Belarusian strategies demonstrates how the
   decisions of external actors, such as the European Union and to a
   certain extent the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, function as
   bargaining chips for the Belarusian leadership. Due to the
   intra-alliance security dilemma, external actors have at times even
   weakened the alliance rather than automatically inducing its cohesion.},

Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {Focusing on Mexico, this article makes two departures from existing
   studies of the determinants of foreign direct investment (FDI): (1) it
   disaggregates investment into three types (resource-, market- and
   efficiency-seeking); and (2) it models variation in investment
   subnationally, across the 32 Mexican states. Using panel data for
   foreign investment between 2000 and 2009, we find that the predictors of
   subnational variation in investment go beyond simple geographic and
   economic conditions and include factors such as local political party
   control, social stability and the perceived effectiveness of state
   authorities. Moreover, the three types of investment are shaped by
   distinct social, political and economic dynamics. Insofar as the
   location and type of foreign investment can affect economic development
   and inequality within - and not just between - countries, the
   subnational distribution of investment is of consequence for both
   academics and policy makers.},

   legislative elections held in Russia in 1999-2011 in order to assess the
   impact of electoral authoritarianism upon women's representation in
   sub-national legislative bodies. The analysis of 50,520 cases of
   candidate nomination and 9553 cases of electoral success, supported by a
   cross-regional statistical study of the factors of women's nomination
   and success, empirically confirms an explanatory model that incorporates
   three working hypotheses derived from the mainstream literature on
   women's representation. According to this model, the 2002-2003 electoral
   reform, by introducing proportional representation into regional
   electoral systems, strongly facilitated women's representation. After
   the advent of electoral authoritarianism, proportional rules, in
   combination with the increased party magnitude' of the pro-government
   party, continued to exert expectedly positive effects; yet these effects
   were offset by the decreased competitiveness in majority districts. As a
   result, political regime transformation did not lead to a significant
   increase in the number of female deputies.},

Abstract = {Pointing to its radical underpinnings in so-called `Open Marxism' and
   its theory of the state (one that subsumes the state in the capital
   relation), this article critically scrutinises Peter Burnham's thesis of
   `depoliticisation' as a dominant accumulation strategy and regime. The
   article identifies ambiguities around Burnham's depiction of New Labour
   in power as committed to depoliticisation. It addresses these by drawing
   a distinction between regime of accumulation and mode of regulation,
   characterising New Labour's political economy in terms of the latter as
   a form of depoliticised Keynesianism framed by `discretionary
   constraint'. Contra-Burnham, the article points to the continued
   efficacy of Keynesian and social democratic political agency in the
   context of a dialectic of depoliticisation and repoliticisation focused
   on the role and power of the state. This dialectic is symptomatic of the
   contested regulation of capitalism around the defence of the value of
   money, on the one hand, and its broader management and redistribution,
   on the other.},

Abstract = {Both national intelligence agencies (NIAs) and international
   verification organizations (IVOs) attempt to assess compliance with arms
   control treaties. Their strengths and weaknesses are complementary.
   Because IVOs are seen as legitimate, they are able to conduct on-site
   inspections to verify declared activities and to confirm or disprove
   allegations of clandestine cheating. NIAs are more flexible and have a
   greater ability to uncover preliminary evidence of clandestine
   activities on which further investigations can be based. Such
   investigations require NIAs to share intelligence with IVOs. While this
   kind of intelligence sharing is generally permitted by arms control
   agreements, it is controversial. Nonetheless, it appears to have become
   more common in recent years, particularly during the International
   Atomic Energy Agency's investigation of Iran's nuclear program. While
   intelligence sharing creates risks for both IVOs and NIAs, it is
   ultimately critical to the effective verification of arms control
   agreements and steps can and should be taken to ensure it becomes more
   common and less controversial.},

   Intelligence Liaison},
Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {29},
Number = {5},
Pages = {758-777},
Abstract = {Using memoirs can be a vital way of supplementing archival evidence or
   indeed of overcoming a shortage of contemporaneous sources, and they
   offer insights into the attitudes and motivations of participants as
   well as how they recorded and remembered events. Memoirs retain an
   inherent value that must not be ignored, particularly in the study of
   intelligence liaison which addresses the kinds of personal and cultural
   aspects which are often especially well illuminated through
   autobiographical writing. This paper explores some of the theoretical
   and practical issues associated with the use of memoir material and
   examines them through the prism of selected autobiographical writings
   related to Anglo-French intelligence liaison from the Great War up to
   the Second World War.},

Abstract = {This article describes the EU's impact on economic performance in the
   new Member States since the advent of membership. It first deals with
   the EU's role in promoting the economic boom that marked the region up
   to 2007, emphasizing the role of the single market and of the EU in
   anchoring and encouraging economic policy liberalization. The second
   section investigates the EU role in buffering the bust that occurred
   after 2007, looking at structural fund spending and financial sector
   instruments to enhance liquidity. I argue the EU had a (mostly
   unintentional) pro-cyclical effect that fuelled the boom and contributed
   to setting up the region for a very hard fall during the bust. I also
   show the EU efforts to buffer the hard times were far quicker in the
   area of structural fund spending compared to very slow and limited
   innovation in liquidity provision, especially for non-eurozone states.},

Abstract = {There are at least two central pathways through which the modern
   democratic state interacts with citizens: public school systems and
   criminal justice systems. Rarely are criminal justice systems thought to
   serve the educational function that public school systems are
   specifically designed to provide. Yet for an increasing number of
   Americans, the criminal justice system plays a powerful and pervasive
   role in providing a civic education, in anticitizenry, that is the
   reverse of the education that public schools are supposed to offer. We
   deploy curriculum theory to analyze three primary processes of the
   criminal justice systemjury service, incarceration, and policingand
   demonstrate the operation of two parallel curricula within them: a
   symbolic, overt curriculum rooted in positive civic conceptions of
   fairness and democracy; and a hidden curriculum, rooted in empty or
   negative conceptions of certain citizens and their relationship to the
   state.},

Abstract = {In a constantly changing and increasingly globalised world, religion
   still plays a significant role in influencing consumer behavior. The
   intent behind this study is to scrutinize the effect of normative
   factors on Muslim consumers' apparel purchasing decisions. The survey
   was comprised of a sample of 500 Muslim consumers from the universities
   and shopping malls in Faisalabad city of Pakistan. Correlation was used
   to analyze the sample. The findings indicate that consumers in
   Faisalabad (Pakistan) area consider Islam their source of reference, and
   they prefer to wear clothing as commanded by Islamic Shriah. This study
   confirms that normative factors had a highly significant relationship
   with consumer buying behavior. The chapter's interesting findings serve
   to remind organizations that they cannot neglect the element of religion
   in their marketing activities, particularly when operating in the
   vicinity of Islamic countries.},

Abstract = {The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935 has been widely
   portrayed as an anachronistic piece of legislation that needs to be
   reformed or abandoned. In the absence of reform, many US labor unions
   try to avoid the NLRA process altogether by organizing workers outside
   the confines of the law. But Somos un Pueblo Unido, or Somos, a worker
   center in New Mexico, has been using a novel interpretation of the NLRA
   less to boost union density than to develop an alternative to contract
   unionism. By helping nonunionized workers use Section 7 of the NLRA to
   act concertedly in their own defense, I argue, Somos is combating
   employer abuse, in the short run, and demonstrating that worker centers
   and their memberships may be transforming the US labor movement, in the
   long run. Their experiences illustrate the ability of organizations to
   redeploy existing institutional resources with potentially
   transformative results.},

Abstract = {EU citizenship is often regarded as the culmination of a process whereby
   the transnational mobility of workers has led to the granting of rights
   to humans qua citizens, with both legal scholars and ethnographers
   emphasizing its normative significance in this respect. Challenging such
   a narrative, this study sets out to highlight the contingent nature of a
   postnational EU citizenship, with reference to the lived experiences of
   migrant Roma. As a first step, we highlight the conditionality within EU
   law associated with the granting of rights to those enacting EU
   citizenship by residing within EU territory beyond their own member
   state. In a second step, we highlight the variable ways in which such
   conditionality is deployed in different national contexts, with
   reference to the frameworks in France and Spain. While the former has
   deployed these conditions in a manner that has excluded EU citizens,
   particularly migrant Roma, the latterat least for a timewas more
   permissive in its granting of rights to EU citizens than EU law
   required. However, in a third step, we suggest that the lived
   experiences of migrant Roma in these two national contexts have not been
   as different as the legal differences suggest. Drawing on ethnographic
   fieldwork on Romanian Roma in two municipalities near Barcelona, we
   demonstrate the ways in which a local politics of exclusion is legally
   possible, even within an ostensibly permissive juridical framework of
   citizenship. We highlight how the ambiguity of a multilevel citizenship
   not only opens up possibilities for multifaceted forms of exclusion, but
   also for various forms of resistance, both within and beyond a juridical
   citizenship framework.},

Abstract = {The paper examines the macroeconomic imbalance procedure (MIP) with the
   purpose of assessing its potential effectiveness compared to
   International Monetary Fund (IMF) surveillance. The comparison reveals
   that the MIP performs better than the Fund's surveillance in terms of
   the provision of clear and practical advice, knowledge of domestic
   polities and ease of activating sanctions. Neither the MIP nor the IMF,
   however, provide for mechanisms to prevent political considerations from
   interfering with the activation of sanctions and the distribution of the
   burden of adjustment. The MIP also does not attenuate problems of
   asymmetric treatment that create the conditions for public backlashes.
   Its single-country focus and the limited integration of macroeconomic
   and financial analysis are further factors that may undermine the
   effectiveness of the MIP. In the conclusions, the paper reflects on the
   factors that may help explain the limited incorporation of the lessons
   available from the Fund's experience into the MIP.},

Abstract = {When do non-governmental organizations (NGOs) cooperate with each other?
   Even with much touting of the positive effects of inter-NGO cooperation
   on humanitarian outcomes, the extant literature offers us few insights
   into the determinants of this cooperation, especially in a
   cross-national framework. Drawing on both the current NGO literature and
   the larger cross-disciplinary literature on inter-organizational
   cooperation, I argue that both trust and opportunity are needed for
   inter-NGO cooperation. Trust in other organizations is highly dependent
   on governance structures within the state. Similarly, in the uncertain
   situation of humanitarian disasters and development work in non-Western
   states, security concerns and a lack of a coordinating leadership body
   can limit the opportunities of NGOs to collaborate. The presence of
   humanitarian state interveners can act to mitigate these concerns and
   provide NGOs with more opportunities to collaborate. Using a novel
   measure of NGO to NGO cooperation in non-Western countries, empirical
   results of this project largely support the hypotheses derived from this
   trust and opportunity framework.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to explain the surprising decline in Russian President
   Vladimir Putin's approval rating in 2011. During the previous 10 years,
   Putin's rating had correlated closely with Russians' perceptions of the
   state of the economy. Yet the fall in his approval - from 79\% in
   December 2010 to 63\% a year later - occurred despite roughly stable
   economic perceptions. Comparing Levada Center polls from late 2010 and
   2011, the paper explores both who (what types of respondents) grew
   disenchanted with Putin, and why (what issues or grievances prompted
   this switch). It finds that (a) the fall in support for the Kremlin -
   although faster among members of the ``creative class,{''} women, the
   rich, and residents of provincial cities - was broad-based, occurring
   among all social groups examined; (b) attitudes toward immigration, the
   West, and Russia's international status, as well as assessments of
   public service quality, changed little during 2011; (c) Putin's
   declining popularity most likely reflected stronger - not weaker -
   economic concerns; although the proportion judging economic performance
   to be poor did not increase, those who saw economic weakness became much
   less supportive of the Kremlin. Russians appear to have increasingly
   blamed their political leaders for unsatisfactory economic and political
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {Recent analysis on New Regionalism has, for Bjorn Hettne, raised
   important ontological questions over what we study when we study
   regionalism'. The paper contributes to this debate by focusing on the
   shared beliefs, norms and rituals that hold a region together. Working
   between the New Regionalism literature and thinking on international
   regimes, this paper - to paraphrase Friedrich Kratochwil and John Ruggie
   - outlines the inescapable inter-subjective quality' of a region. This
   focus on inter-subjectivity seeks to improve on existing approaches that
   consider shared social structures as already fixed, and/or as autonomous
   constructs operating over and above regional actors. In order to
   appreciate how inter-subjective structures and regional agents interact
   with each other, the paper explores the social construction of Latin
   America. Specifically, it examines the politics of regionness -
   understood here in relation to identity, space and agents - to
   demonstrate how various regional actors operate within, and reconstruct,
   shared meaning. In so doing, it interrogates the practices that govern
   and continually produce the region.},

Title = {When do foreign banks `cut and run'? Evidence from west European
   bailouts and east European markets},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {21},

Abstract = {Very high levels of foreign bank ownership in central and eastern Europe
   (CEE) gave rise to fears that the region would be vulnerable to `cutting
   and running' during a financial crisis, whereby western parent banks
   would repatriate capital and liquidity to their home markets and abandon
   their CEE clients. Such fears were compounded by the economic
   nationalism of late 2008 and early 2009 in western Europe, as well as by
   west European bank bailout programmes that privileged home markets over
   foreign ones. Although CEE experienced a severe credit crunch in late
   2008, compared to other financial and economic crises, western bank
   behaviour in CEE has not amounted to `cutting and running'. While many
   experts credit the `Vienna Initiative' for maintaining foreign bank
   exposures in the region, this paper argues instead that it was the deep
   form of financial integration to which CEE was subject that kept banks
   committed. Specifically, western banks' `second home market' business
   model, in which capital moved east via foreign-owned bank subsidiaries
   as opposed to primarily via branches or cross-border lending, led to
   only moderate retrenchment from CEE.},

Abstract = {This article explores and analyzes the role of women who exercised
   agency as perpetrators during the genocide in Rwanda in 1994. Genocide
   narratives traditionally cast women as victims, and many women did
   suffer horrific abuses and become victims of torture in Rwanda. However,
   this gender-based characterization of women is inaccurate and
   incomplete. After presenting a multidisciplinary body of literature
   relevant to female agency during genocide, this article explores three
   core questions related to female agency during the Rwandan genocide. It
   discusses how women were mobilized before and during the genocide, the
   specific actions of women who exercised agency and finally what happened
   to these women in the aftermath of the genocide. This article is based
   upon research that was gathered by the author and includes interviews of
   female perpetrators as well as victims and witnesses of direct violence
   committed by women. The article asserts that women played an active role
   in the Rwandan genocide but are often excluded from the dominant
   narrative. This article also addresses the implications of ignoring
   female perpetrators of genocide. It suggests that such an oversight may
   have a detrimental impact on the long-term peace and stability in
   post-genocide Rwanda.},

Abstract = {A substantial body of literature argues that government funding
   motivated by the Cold War shaped (or distorted) the content of the
   American academic disciplines. This article tests the impact of such
   funding on the academic study of the Soviet economy, a small field
   created to help fight the Cold War. It documents the amount of attention
   given by researchers to the military sector of the Soviet economy, the
   topic of central importance for the Cold War, and finds that their
   publications largely ignored it. Considerations other than the interests
   of the sponsors determined the choice of topics in the discipline.},

Abstract = {Since 2000, the federal government and all fifty states have passed laws
   that criminalize the trafficking of persons for labor and commercial
   sex. To date, relatively few human trafficking cases have been
   identified, investigated, and prosecuted by local criminal justice
   authorities. Using data from case records and qualitative interviews
   with police, prosecutors, and victim service providers in twelve
   counties, we discuss the challenges local police face in identifying
   cases of human trafficking. We find that the culture of local police
   agencies and the perceptions of police officials about human trafficking
   do not support the identification of a broad range of human trafficking
   cases. Since local definitions of human trafficking are still evolving,
   police focus on sex trafficking of minors, which they perceive to be the
   most serious problem facing their communities. Reluctance to
   differentiate between vice and sex trafficking minimizes the problem of
   human trafficking and makes labor trafficking seem largely nonexistent.},

Abstract = {This article provides an insight into the status quo and functions of
   the European Parliament (EP) in the European Union (EU) multi-level
   governance system in order to better locate the structural issues the EP
   is facing in terms of accountability and legitimacy in the EU. The study
   mainly finds that the EP's extension of powers by the treaties and
   non-treaty-based inter-institutional agreements has led it to become a
   legislative powerhouse, the work of which is concentrated in the less
   visible committees. This development, however, comes at the cost of the
   EP's function as a public arena of debate and conflict, with the big
   party groups mainly voting like a singular bloc in the plenary because
   decisions had already been agreed in the committees. In sum, increasing
   competences and workloads do not lead to more legitimacy and
   accountability.},

Abstract = {Eastern Europe is among the major sources of migrants who travel for
   work to other European nations. In this research, in-depth interviews
   and analysis of legal cases of migration in Bulgaria reveal that the
   typical kinds of human trafficking in the region are sexual
   exploitation, labor exploitation, forced servitude, and trafficking of
   pregnant women for the sale of their babies. For each type, I examine
   victim profiles, recruitment strategies, transportation, and the types
   of control and exploitation that traffickers use. Comparisons are drawn
   between the Bulgarian findings and patterns in other Eastern European
   nations.},

Abstract = {The 1996 legislative reform of welfare shifted provision away from cash
   assistance and toward a litany of work-support services, central among
   which are child care subsidies (Allard 2009). As part of a larger study
   of welfare reform in Florida, we conducted semistructured field
   interviews with more than 50 welfare transition caseworkers in four
   purposively selected regions. Consistent with Lipsky's emphasis on
   worker decisions as concrete manifestations of policy intentions, we
   find that caseworkers' interpretations of the priorities of TANF have
   substantial influence over decision making regarding the use and
   withdrawal of child care subsidies.},

Abstract = {The article looks at the ``tough choices{''} (per the National
   Development Plan) South Africa has to make to be a successful country.
   It provides policy recommendations and prescriptions for many of the
   critical issues facing South Africa. The most urgent policy challenges
   revolve around high levels of unemployment, the regulation of the labor
   market and the role of unions, the shortage of skills, and the education
   system. The solutions proposed include the relaxation of labor laws,
   which hinder entry into the labor market, especially for young people;
   the introduction of special economic zones; the adoption of an open
   migration regime for skilled migrants; and the establishment of low-fee
   private schools and private tertiary education providers. The article
   calls for bold and visionary leadership in South Africa to ensure that
   the ``tough choices{''} needing to be made are implemented.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2014},

Number = {1},

Abstract = {Historically and contemporaneously, persons with disabilities have been
   excluded from exercising their human rights, including the right to
   political participation. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with
   Disabilities responds to this circumstance and provides a holistic
   solution. Article 29 addresses the design and implementation of an
   electoral process that is non-discriminatory, while also requiring
   states to provide voters with disability-related accommodations and
   other facilitative measures to enable their equal right to vote. Yet to
   date, what little attention has been paid to the voting rights of
   disabled persons has focused on the validity and scope of exclusions,
   and neither courts nor legislators have turned to the positive side of
   the ledger, namely, how to enable individuals with disabilities to
   exercise their franchise. Emerging practices around the globe
   nonetheless bear out that persons with disabilities can be successfully
   incorporated in all phases of an electoral process. Further, they can
   perform a variety of roles beyond exercising the franchise-as voter
   educators, election commissioners, observers, monitors and committee
   members, and as candidates. The article reflects evolving state policies
   and practices by disabled people's organizations, and draws on our
   experience working in this field to provide guidance for disability
   inclusion throughout the ongoing process of pre-electoral, electoral and
   post-electoral phases that comprise the electoral cycle.},

Abstract = {To what extent are Russian state agencies involved in predatory
   behavior, and what are the determinants of their activities? Analyzing a
   novel data-set comprising 312 cases of illegal corporate raiding
   (reyderstvo) between 1999 and 2010, this article identifies a shift both
   in the regional and sectoral distribution of raids over time, as well as
   an increasing participation of state agencies in criminal raiding
   attacks. Using panel regression analysis to look at the determinants of
   increasing state involvement, this article shows that election results
   for the ruling president and his party, as well as the degree to which
   elections are manipulated throughout Russia's regions, are significantly
   and positively correlated with the number of raids in a given region,
   while regions with governors that have stronger local ties are
   characterized by a smaller number of attacks. A potential interpretation
   of these findings is that the federal center may tolerate a certain
   degree of predatory activities by regional elites, as long as these
   elites are able to deliver a sufficiently high level of electoral
   support for the center, with the effect being weaker in regions where
   the governor is interested in the long-term development of the regional
   economy.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present an outline of state transformation in the
   context of a Nordic welfare state. We use Finland as an example of the
   transformation process in which a welfare state form we call a cartel
   polity is shifting towards a corporate polity, a particular adjustment
   of the competition state. We conceptualise the corporate polity as a
   spatio-temporal fix under construction. The corporate polity is both an
   on-going process to build a corporation-inspired management model for
   the Finnish state and a novel state ethos that is underpinned by
   constant concern about the state's international competitiveness in
   front of `nature-like' market forces, transnational investors and highly
   skilled labour. We propose that the imaginary of a corporate polity is
   endorsed by a discursive practice that constructs a ceaseless crisis
   condition in the Finnish state, through repetitive and mundane
   activities related to state governance. Through the empirical analysis,
   we single out four dimensions of the corporate polity:
   fiscal-managerial, digital, capacity-oriented and territorial. Finally,
   we provide brief reflections on the potential state transformations in
   the future.},

Abstract = {Despite the emergence of Brazil as a global power, little is known about
   its security and intelligence services and the way they are seen by
   Brazilian society. This article analyzes the Brazilian perception of the
   role of its intelligence services and the relationship between the
   intelligence community ( IC) and the decision makers. The historical
   background of intelligence in Brazil and a general overview of the
   Brazilian IC after the reestablishment of democracy are presented, as
   well as the general mechanisms of control and accountability of the
   secret services. Finally, there is consideration of some concerns on
   reforming the intelligence sector and its control and oversight
   apparatus.},

Abstract = {This article explores the intelligence requirement of international
   mediation, a topic that is ignored in both the literature on conflict
   resolution and the literature on intelligence. A mediator's strategies
   and tactics ought to be informed by a deep understanding of the parties'
   internal calculations about the conflict and its resolution.
   Intelligence is needed to gain this understanding because the parties
   typically do not reveal their sensitive deliberations to outsiders.
   United Nations mediation teams should have a monitoring and analysis
   unit that endeavours to meet this need and reduce the ignorance that
   commonly afflicts international mediation.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {458-486},
Abstract = {This article examines the successful denuclearization of Iraq by the
   International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in the early 1990s and the
   apparent failure of the US Intelligence Community (IC) to rethink its
   assessments of Saddam's desire for nuclear weapons despite Baghdad's
   co-operation with the IAEA inspectors, and clear evidence from the
   Ongoing Monitoring and Verification team that this was a highly
   successful process. US policy towards Iraq, from the Clinton
   administration onwards, was hyper-politicized; it relied on a default,
   unchanging view of Saddam Hussein as a rogue leader bent on WMD
   acquisition and regional domination in an area that was of vital
   importance to the United States. The article also considers the impact
   of the fractious UNSCOM inspections process and argues that this was
   severely compromised by political intrusion, which was also ignored by
   the US IC in its assessments of Saddam's intentions. Ultimately, US
   intelligence on Iraq was filtered for a decade through a
   hyper-politicized lens that tended to discount evidence from the IAEA
   that disproved pre-existing assumptions.},

Abstract = {Major US federal regulatory decisions are developed and justified using
   regulatory impact analyses (RIAs) mandated by executive order. We
   examine the scientific citation activity in RIAs, a unique effort that
   we believe holds significant potential for understanding the use of
   science in policymaking. This paper reports preliminary findings from
   collecting and examining scientific citations in 104 RIAs from
   2008-2012. We present evidence indicating that some agencies make
   extensive use of science in RIAs, that there is substantial variation in
   use across agencies, and show variation across journals and disciplines
   cited by regulatory agencies. Finally, we present analysis showing that
   regulatory policymakers make greater use of research published in highly
   cited scholarly journals. We conclude by outlining several future
   directions for research using these data.},

Abstract = {The literature on financial regulation has typically emphasized the role
   of the powerful financial industry in shaping regulatory outcomes.
   However, capture theories cannot explain the prominence of financial
   consumer protection in post-crisis reform agendas. By contrast, this
   article argues that, despite their collective action disadvantage, a
   polymorphous network of civil society organizations was able to gain
   momentum after the financial crisis and to influence the financial
   reform process. In this policy window, where decision-makers were
   looking out for an alternative source of expertise, a transnationally
   connected civil society (TCS) network successfully mobilized to place
   consumer protection on reform agendas in tandem with public
   entrepreneurs and on the back of a popular backlash against big finance.
   This argument will be explored through a comparative study of the impact
   of transnational pressures on policy-makers in Europe and the US in the
   immediate aftermath of the crisis. In the conclusion, the article
   shortly discusses the substance of the financial reforms that have been
   undertaken.},

Abstract = {Understanding just how state leaders respond to fiscal crises and the
   continuing challenges of adequate funding should provide insight into
   how successful states are likely to be in creating environments where
   most citizens can attend and benefit from higher education. This article
   describes and begins to classify the nature and range of state responses
   to ongoing fiscal challenges. We focus on state-level leadership and
   governance, fiscal policies, and accountability mechanisms. We identify
   five types of responses: cutting costs (emphasizing cost controls and
   low-cost providers); buying degrees (allocating state funds based on
   outcomes not inputs); the grand bargain (providing more campus autonomy
   in exchange for lower funding); hunkering down and waiting (hoping that
   state appropriations will return to past levels); and falling apart
   (weak governance mechanisms compounding financial difficulties). The
   tradeoffs inherent in each approach are discussed.},

Title = {Financing College Opportunity: Factors Influencing State Spending on
   Student Financial Aid and Campus Appropriations, 1990 through 2010},

Abstract = {Some states invest relatively heavily in financial aid programs that
   benefit lower-income citizens, while other states concentrate their
   investment in programs that benefit students from higher-income
   backgrounds. States also vary in their levels of direct appropriations
   to campuses, a form of public subsidy that has long been viewed as
   benefitting middle-income citizens. What factors influence states to
   allocate higher education subsidies in a more or a less redistributive
   manner? This article reports on a study that examined sources of
   variation in state spending on need-based aid, merit-based aid, and
   appropriations over the period 1990-2010. Findings document
   relationships among spending patterns and structural and political
   conditions of states, indicating a ``trade-off{''} between spending on
   merit-and need-based aid; as states invest more in the former, they
   reduce spending on the latter. We also show that the presence of a
   Republican governor and the strength of Republican representation in
   state-houses each is associated with increased state spending on
   need-based financial aid. Our results further show that increased wealth
   is positively associated with state spending on merit-based financial
   aid programs and state appropriations for higher education, but not
   need-based financial aid. We also find distinctive patterns of state
   support for higher education depending on the degree of centralization
   of a state's governance arrangement for higher education; namely, the
   presence of a highly centralized structure is associated with decreased
   spending on merit-based aid programs and increased state appropriations
   to colleges and universities.},

Abstract = {Experimental economics is now part of mainstream economics and is fast
   becoming one of its most influential methods. Drawing on the distinction
   between market and behavioural experimentation, this article assesses
   the compatibility of the most influential experimental research with the
   neoliberal understanding of the political and moral preconditions for
   markets to develop. A politically relevant asymmetry at the core of this
   research programme will be signalled: while issues of political economy
   are eschewed by market experimenters (for example, whose interests are
   favoured and whose groups have power in economic processes), topics of
   moral economy are recognised and dealt with by behavioural experimenters
   (for example, the interactions between economic institutions and
   individuals' motivations and moral make-up). It is argued that
   experimental research has thereby contributed to a depoliticised and
   moralised view of markets, one that tends to present markets as a
   civilising institution once their technical and moral failures are
   recognised and adequately dealt with.},

Abstract = {Declining rates of marriage and overall increases in union instability,
   combined with high levels of unintended and nonmarital fertility, create
   the possibility for parents to have children with more than one partner,
   called multiple-partner fertility, or MPF. The unique characteristics of
   families with MPF present data and other logistical challenges to
   researchers studying the phenomenon. Drawing from recent studies and
   updated data, I present new estimates of MPF that show that about 13
   percent of men aged 40 to 44 and 19 percent of women aged 41 to 49 have
   children with more than one partner, with a higher prevalence among the
   disadvantaged. Compared to parents with two or more children by only one
   partner, people with MPF become parents at younger ages, largely with
   unintended first births, and often do so outside of marriage. This
   article touches on the implications of MPF for families and concludes by
   discussing the theoretical difficulties in studying MPF and the
   challenges it presents to public policy.},

Abstract = {After four years in operation the United Nations Human Rights Council
   (UNHRC) is subject to criticism, and various scholars and practitioners
   alike present and discuss reform proposals. In the present paper we
   study systematically the controversial decisions in the UNHRC. We find
   that controversial proposals are introduced by countries with a
   blemished human rights record, and that in the votes on these proposals
   the council members belonging to the European Union (EU) vote very
   distinctly from the remaining members and have preferences quite
   different from those member states that violate human rights. Extending
   an empirical approach frequently used in parliamentary research we can
   also show that in votes in the UNHRC preferences of member states
   dominate over their membership to particular blocs. As controversial
   votes also heavily polarize the UNHRC we argue that the problems faced
   by the UNHRC's predecessor, namely the Commission on Human Rights, have
   reappeared.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that there is an emerging trans-regional security
   complex reaching from Russia through Central Asia to China. Shared
   security norms have resulted in statist multilateralism, that is,
   state-directed cooperation on shared interests while closely guarding
   distinct identities and specific political features. The paper outlines
   member states' key political values and shows how they framed' shared
   understandings about security. It then explains how security norms
   inform the institutional designs of the two main multilateral security
   organisations thereby directing the nature of cooperation, testing the
   argument in two key conflicts: in Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan.},

Title = {Is Russia a militocracy? Conceptual issues and extant findings regarding
   elite militarization},
Journal = {POST-SOVIET AFFAIRS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {27-50},

Abstract = {The dominant paradigm for understanding contemporary Russia holds that
   Vladimir Putin's tenure in office has been accompanied by a massive
   influx of former KGB and military personnel - so-called siloviki - into
   positions of power and authority throughout the polity and economy.
   Claims of extensive elite militarization, however, are largely based on
   the analyses of only one research program and, moreover, the validity of
   the estimates produced by that research program is open to question on
   numerous grounds. In this article, we review existing research on elite
   militarization in Russia; discuss a series of conceptual and empirical
   issues that need to be resolved if valid and meaningful estimation of
   military-security representation is to be achieved; introduce new
   findings; and evaluate the totality of existing evidence regarding
   whether the Russian state under Putin deserves to be labeled a
   militocracy. We find that the most straightforward reading of existing
   data indicates that the percentage of siloviki in the political elite
   during Putin's first two terms as president was approximately half of
   that which has been widely reported in both scholarship and the media,
   and also declined during the Medvedev presidency. In addition, our
   analysis of a broader cross section of the elite estimates
   military-security representation during the Putin presidency to have
   been lower still. Overall, existing data paint a less alarming picture
   of the depths to which siloviki have penetrated the corridors of power
   since 2000 than has been commonly portrayed and thereby cast doubt on
   Russia's status as an FSB state. On the other hand, past trends also
   provide some basis for expecting that the numbers of siloviki will once
   again rise during Putin's current presidential term.},

Abstract = {The global financial and economic crisis has prompted some scholars to
   suggest that a fundamental regulatory shift away from neoliberalism will
   take place - both in general and in the field of EU competition
   regulation. This paper shows that so far no radical break with the
   neoliberal type of competition regulation is heaving into sight. It sets
   out to explain this from the vantage point of a critical political
   economy perspective, which identifies the circumstances under which a
   crisis can result in a regulatory paradigm shift. Contrasting the
   current situation with the shift in EC/EU competition regulation after
   the crisis in the 1970s, the paper argues that the preconditions for a
   fundamental shift in this issue area are not present this time around.
   Several reasons account for this: the current crisis has been construed
   by economic and political elites as a crisis within and not of
   neoliberal capitalism; the social power configuration underpinning the
   neoliberal order remains unaltered; no clear counter-project has
   surfaced; the European Commission has been (and remains) in a position
   to oppose radical changes; and finally, there are no signs of a wider
   paradigm shift in the EU's regulatory architecture.},

Abstract = {In the Balkans, interethnic peace sustained by international
   participation has been prone to disappear as security problems are
   associated with unstable economic conditions of the new emerging states.
   Moreover, the new collective presidency system with unclear boundaries
   of power sharing for these countries in transition also contributes to
   unstable political conditions. The global economic crisis, higher
   unemployment rates, and budgeting problems are some economic-based
   issues. In the Balkans, sustaining long-term interethnic security is to
   be traced to a number of complex factors. The last decade reveals the
   importance of sustaining interethnic security among conflicting parties
   by maintaining common economic interest rather than solitary military
   measures. This chapter illustrates the contributory role of economic
   recovery in sustaining long-term interethnic peace. It is also aimed to
   illustrate the link between economic recovery and interethnic security.},

Abstract = {Securitization theory's core contentionthe social construction of
   security as a speech-actis perceptive and productive, yet insufficiently
   attentive to societies engulfed in profound existential uncertainty
   about their own survival. Such societies are immersed in what I call
   deep securitization, whereby widespread public discourses explicitly
   frame threats as probable, protracted, and endangering the very
   existence of the nation/state. Under deep securitization, to politicize
   is to securitize, sectors intensely intertwine, political legitimacy's
   object is the polity/identity itself, and securitization steps are
   typically nonbinary and nonlinear. Empirically, if some securitizations
   are deeper than others, Israel's is one of the deepest. In this study, I
   examine this exceptionally apt, though little-examined, case for
   securitization theory. Israeli public discourse abounds with existential
   threats, invariably depicting the Jewish people and polity as
   endangered. The article analyzes the securitization of demography and
   its linkage to geography and democracy in the Israeli-Jewish discourse
   and praxis.},

Abstract = {Why do political parties increasingly address international
   institutions? This paper analyses the politicisation of international
   governance, that is, a process in which institutions' policies and
   procedures become salient and controversial on the level of mass
   politics. It uses data on party platforms' content from 26 OECD
   countries to test a number of explanations for politicisation. Results
   suggest that scholarly debate tends to overestimate the role of
   globalisation for driving politicisation, while institutional variables
   are too often neglected. First, increased scope of international
   governance has made questions of international governance much more
   salient topics of party manifestos. Second, recent shifts of political
   authority to the international level can explain increased contestation
   of international governance to a remarkable extent. What is more, the
   contestation of international authority in the realm of electoral
   politics seems to be substantively shaped by exclusive nationalism, but
   not by democratic concerns.},

Abstract = {This article uses statistical analysis of aggregate electoral returns in
   order to establish continuities in the territorial patterns of support
   between four major political parties of contemporary Russia, on the one
   hand, and those parties that contested national legislative (Duma)
   elections from 1993 through 2007, on the other hand. It is hypothesized
   that such continuities, dubbed ``territorial genealogies,{''} are
   largely rooted in the migration of region-based gubernatorial political
   machines from one national party to another, which constitutes a major
   flow of organizational continuity in the development of political
   parties. Statistical analysis confirms that the main hubs of machine
   politics in Russia's regions, originating from the intra-elite struggles
   of the 1990s, provide United Russia with the territorial core of its
   current support. Other political parties retain electoral salience in
   those regions where their electoral appeal is not mitigated by the
   presence of political machines, which underscores the importance of
   non-machine party organization for their electoral destinies.},

Abstract = {Why do some states transition, with foreign assistance, from fragile to
   robust? Scholars in state-building have argued that neotrusteeship is an
   effective strategy by which external organizations might build
   postconflict states. This article tests this hypothesis, and two related
   propositions, in a paired comparison of Kosovo and Timor-Leste. The two
   states are similar in many respects and both experienced regional peace
   enforcement operations to end violent conflict, followed by massive
   neotrusteeship operations. They have had divergent results, however, in
   postconflict state-building: while the state and economy are gradually
   becoming stronger in Timor-Leste, the same cannot be said of Kosovo,
   which continues to be plagued by high unemployment, low growth,
   corruption, and organized crime. I argue that many of Kosovo's problems
   can be traced back to the strategy of dividing international
   responsibility for neotrusteeship operations.},

Abstract = {Since 2001, international attention has focused on the conflicts in Iraq
   and Afghanistan, and specifically on the question of whether external
   intervention can assist weak or fragile states in successfully making
   the transition to stable democracies. This article analyzes the U.S.
   occupations of Japan beginning in 1945, Afghanistan beginning in 2001,
   and Iraq beginning in 2003, and uses these cases to review and critique
   the literature on why some interventions have been more successful than
   others in building robust and effective state institutions. The
   comparative analysis suggests that external interveners face substantial
   barriers to state-building in circumstances that lack favorable domestic
   preconditions. The United States has been more successful when
   preserving existing state capacity than when attempting to build state
   strength where it did not previously exist.},

Abstract = {This article examines whether tuition deregulation in Texas (in 2003 the
   state legislature gave tuition-setting authority to institutional
   governing boards) has affected the college enrollment of
   underrepresented and lowincome students. Using a
   difference-in-differences research design, we find that Hispanic
   students have been most negatively affected by tuition deregulation.
   Results for black students are largely mixed, in that we find an
   increase in college enrollment after deregulation in some
   specifications, while Pell Grant recipients, incoming and returning,
   appear to have experienced an increase in college enrollment following
   deregulation. Implications and recommendations for state governments
   considering this contentious legislation are provided.},

Abstract = {While the possibility of European disintegration is prominently on the
   public agenda, European Union (EU) studies have so far largely neglected
   the issue. This article looks for a proper theoretical starting point to
   conceptualize and explain European disintegration. Theories about
   European integration, but also international politics, comparative
   federalism, optimum currency areas and imperial decline appear to be
   problematic bases to this end. Some of these theories suffer from a
   state bias. Other theories are too narrowly focused to explain the
   complex process of disintegration. Yet others fail to interconnect
   coherently the manifold disintegrative factors. A theoretical framework
   on polity formation developed by Bartolini is the most promising basis
   from which to examine European disintegration as it avoids the problems
   just mentioned. It shows that Eurosceptic dissatisfaction mainly induces
   partial exits within the EU due to the EU's weak lock-in power, its
   problematic voice structuring and the lack of proper full exit options.},

Abstract = {Fieldwork is arguably the most exciting phase of a doctoral research
   degree. As a first timer in the `field', fieldwork can be a daunting
   task due to the dilemmas faced. In my practice note, I have focused on
   the various identity dilemmas and challenges I face during fieldwork
   within the context of the ongoing international human rights-related
   trial and investigation process of the International Criminal Court
   (ICC) in Kenya. The presence of an international process can shape
   research and create dilemmas for an individual researcher. These
   dilemmas were based on my various identities as an insider and outsider
   female, Kenyan Mugikuyu researching on Kenyan politics. In the note I
   have discussed how creativity is important in addition to prior training
   in methods and ethics, and the need for experienced researchers to share
   with first-time researchers subtle experiences which are mostly learnt
   in the field. This practice note discusses how I ensure my safety and
   negotiate access in the field especially in the context of the ICC trial
   which has shaped human rights-related research in the counties where I
   am researching.},

Abstract = {Over the past two decades, China has launched a nationwide endeavor to
   push domestic firms up the value chain. This article explores why, in
   some localities, Chinese firms had significant success in upgrading,
   while in other localities, firms were paradoxically trapped in a
   race-to-the-bottom competition. Drawing on national economic census
   data, a firm-level survey, and in-depth interviews, the article conducts
   a controlled comparison of China's largest electronics manufacturing
   bases in the Yangtze and the Pearl River Deltas. It argues that the
   local government's choice of global business allies shaped the upgrading
   behavior of domestic firms. When local governments allied with large
   multinational corporations (MNCs) at the top of the value chain, they
   reinforced the hierarchical structure of production, shrank the
   upgrading space for domestic firms, and squeezed them to the bottom of
   the value chain. In contrast, alliances with small foreign invested
   firms at the bottom helped break the hierarchical segregation and held
   more potential for local learning and innovation. The article sheds new
   light on the question of when industrial policies succeed or fail to
   facilitate domestic upgrading in a globalized era.},

Abstract = {What do we know about the relationship between Europe, the European
   Union and European identity? While national identity is a multifaceted
   phenomenon, European identity has been linked to the growth of the
   European Union. This article attempts to analyze some of the attributes
   of individuals with European identity in central and eastern Europe
   prior to EU accession by applying existing hypotheses on correlates of
   European identity. The phenomenon of identification with Europe prior to
   EU accession provides a window into understanding the identity
   mechanisms that inform the concept of European identity. The first
   Eurobarometer surveys measuring European identification in central and
   eastern accession states reported a puzzling finding: that more people,
   not less, identified with Europe than in existing EU states. An analysis
   of the Eurobarometer results provides counter-intuitive comparisons and
   contrasts between eastern and western Europe and uncovers potential
   mechanisms illustrating the content of contemporary European identity.},

Abstract = {The current study addresses health care reform in transitional countries
   and explores the impact of out-of-pocket payments on access to maternal
   health services drawing on Kazakhstan's case. Data on out-of-pocket
   payments and access to maternity care were generated through qualitative
   in-depth interviews conducted in Almaty during the period 2009-2010. The
   results indicate that while health sector reform was designed to improve
   the quality of care and equity, the introduction of official user
   charges accompanied by a rapid growth of informal payments created
   financial barriers that prevented women from accessing maternal services
   leading to reduction in utilisation of maternity care.},

Abstract = {Why do party systems stabilise quickly in some new democracies while
   others remain in extended flux? As a core variable of comparative
   politics, party system stability has led scholars to generate various
   theoretical explanations, but consensus is still lacking. Given its
   widely divergent party systems, postcommunist Europe presents an
   important opportunity to revisit stability's determinants. Applying
   hypotheses derived from theories about competition in multidimensional
   policy spaces, I find that they better explain variation in a 14-case
   sample than contending hypotheses about the electoral system, economic
   performance, constitutional design, political culture, or previous
   democratic experience.},

Abstract = {Using postcolonial analysis coupled with fieldwork in both Afghanistan
   and Nepal, I argue that contemporary colonial relations within private
   security make possible a gender and racial hierarchy of security
   contractors. This hierarchy of contractors results in vastly different
   conditions of possibilities depending on the contractors' histories and
   nationalities. Empirically documenting perspectives from Gurkhas,
   constituted as third country national (TCNs) security contractors, this
   article contributes to the existing critical theory and gender in both
   private military security company literature and postcolonial studies by
   (1) providing a needed racial and gendered analysis from the position of
   the racialized security contractors and (2) empirically documenting a
   growing subaltern group of men participating as security contractors.},

Abstract = {What is the role of intelligence for counterterrorism? Most studies of
   counterterrorism ignore the vital role of intelligence, focus only on
   its most controversial aspects, or fail to recognize how
   counterterrorism intelligence differs from traditional intelligence
   issues. This article argues that many of the common criticisms of the
   CIA and other agencies misunderstand counterterrorism intelligence and
   what is realistic for gaining information on terrorist groups. In
   particular, the important role of signals intelligence, liaison
   relationships, document exploitation, and interrogation are overlooked.
   In addition, intelligence analysis and the relationship with the
   policymaker differ fundamentally for counterterrorism. This article
   emphasizes the need to recognize these differences when evaluating
   counterterrorism and calls for being cautious with intelligence reform.
   In addition, it argues for changing US detention policy and making the
   public more aware of the inevitable gaps related to counterterrorism
   intelligence.},

   Currency Float Reconsidered},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {5},
Pages = {769-789},
Abstract = {This article argues that the lead role of West Germany in the transition
   from fixed to floating exchange rates sits uneasily with accounts that
   conceptualise the breakdown of Bretton Woods in terms of hegemonic power
   politics, the influence of global economic interests or a neoliberal
   paradigm shift. Short of a convincing explanation, the German currency
   float seems to be a prime example of states surrendering to financial
   markets. The article offers an alternative interpretation that focuses
   on the nexus between state agency and capital accumulation. German
   authorities were indeed confronted with a destabilising influx of
   dollars that undermined their available policy options. But as they
   realised that these inflationary flows emanated from the same
   export-oriented forces in whose interest they had sought to hold on to
   an undervalued currency, they chose floating in order to regain command
   over liquidity and create an anti-inflationary programme that was at the
   heart of Germany's subsequent ability to better manage the 1970s crisis
   than its partners. Attention to the particular circumstances and
   consequences of these `structured choices', I conclude, may offer a more
   compelling account of financial globalisation as a state- led project
   than those which generalise from the US context.},

Abstract = {In line with expectations EU membership has only a limited impact on
   party politics in the new Member States of central and eastern Europe
   (CEE); even the economic crisis has not altered this level of impact. An
   examination of party positioning, party appeals and party competition
   indicates the EU plays the role of a boundary keeper, a reference point
   and a weapon to be invoked in domestic competition, particularly to
   lambast opponents for their incompetence, especially when it comes to
   the ability to access and manage EU funds. Underlying parties' stances
   on European integration are the deep-rooted vulnerabilities which help
   explain why the CEE states recognize the necessity of co-operation and a
   pooling of sovereignty at the European level.},

Abstract = {The descriptive part of this research focuses on the latest trends in
   U.S. inward Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and describes the U.S.
   inward FDI flows and stock as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product
   (GDP) and includes geographic and sectoral distribution of inward U.S.
   FDI. The important part of U.S. inward FDI profile relates to inward
   U.S. FDI employment and inward U.S. FDI financial flows, which include
   equity, reinvested earnings, and intercompany debt. The corporate
   players, Mergers and Acquisitions(M\& A's) and green field investment
   are discussed briefly. The empirical part of this research investigates
   state-based factors affecting the inward FDI employment among 50 states
   of the United States and is based on data collected by the Commerce
   Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This study identifies
   several state-specific determinants of FDI employment. The results
   indicate that the major factors exerting positive impact on inward U.S.
   FDI employment are: real wages, infrastructure, unionization level,
   educational attainment, FDI stock, and manufacturing density. In
   addition, the results show that gross state product growth rate, real
   per capita taxes has negative impact on FDI employment.},

Abstract = {A common substantive topic in intelligence studies is the analysis
   process. The addition of active-learning techniques to reinforce key
   concepts like competitive analysis, `wheat' versus `chaff', and the
   different `ints' of intelligence can be an important supplement to
   existing teaching methods. Moreover, a deeper appreciation of the
   intelligence analysis process is likely to be best achieved through
   simulation learning. Drawing on the growing literature that recognizes
   active learning and simulations as important pedagogical tools, this
   teaching note presents an original active-learning simulation for the
   college-level intelligence studies classroom in which students face an
   analysis challenge that highlights different components of the analysis
   process. This simulation increases appreciation for intelligence
   analysis and serves as a student-friendly method for enhancing
   intelligence studies pedagogy.},

Abstract = {The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), whose the history dates
   back to ``Shanghai five,{''} was founded in 1996 in order to deal with
   security and border issues. However, in the course of time, the
   organization has expanded the cooperation ground: the vision of the
   organisation has been recently enlarged so as to intensively emphasise
   economic issues such as forming a free trade area and initiating an
   economic integration. Since the potential economic effect is ambiguous
   and initially depends on the actual trade structure among the member
   countries, it is crucial for policymakers to have the right tools to
   evaluate the economic effect of such an initiative. The aim of this
   study is to provide practical guidance to policymakers for determining
   the potential economic effect of a further Free Trade Area (FTA) to be
   founded within the SCO. For this purpose, a set of indicators are used
   to determine the potential effect at regional and industrial levels that
   a possible regional trade arrangement may yield for the participating
   countries. It is concluded that there is a geographical bias towards
   trading among the members. To overcome this, there are two possible
   solutions for the SCO if it attempts a FTA: It should generate
   inter-industry and intra-industry trades and initiate new members.},

Abstract = {Garbage is stuff that matters: the generation, disposal, and management
   of waste represent some of the most visceral flows in our society. Yet
   most international scholars continue to regard it as trivial to focus on
   the mundane practices and menial materiality associated with managing
   rubbish. Contra this dissociation, and through an analytics of
   assemblages, I argue that international theory can (and nowadays must)
   encompass both the grand designs of diplomacy and the mundane
   cosmopolitics of everyday life. In the everyday, the international is
   embodied, performed, and domesticated. I chart these multi-scalar
   connections as they unfold in Sydney, Australia, demonstrating how a
   focus on a global challenge such as climate change has been redefining
   the mundane realities of waste management.},

Title = {Building European Union capacity to manage transboundary crises: Network
   or lead-agency model?},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {418-436},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In recent years, the European continent has witnessed a substantial
   number of ``transboundary crises{''} - crises that cross geographical
   borders and affect multiple policy domains. Nation states find it hard
   to deal with such crises by themselves. International cooperation, thus,
   becomes increasingly important, but it is not clear what shape or form
   that cooperation should take. This article explores the growing role of
   the European Union (EU) in managing transboundary crises. More
   specifically, it reflects on the different ways in which the expanding
   contours of the EU's emerging crisis capacity can be organized. Using
   three ``performative dimensions{''} - sense-making, coordination, and
   legitimacy - the article discusses the possible advantages and
   disadvantages of a decentralized, network model and compares it with a
   more centralized, lead-agency model. It concludes that the current
   network model is a logical outcome of the punctuated and fragmentary
   process through which EU crisis management capacities have been created.
   It also notes that the shortcomings of this model may necessitate
   elements of a lead-agency model. Such ``agencification{''} of networks
   for transboundary crisis management may well lead to a hybrid model that
   is uniquely suited for the peculiar organizational and political
   creature that the EU is.},

Title = {Why Testify? Witnesses' Motivations for Giving Evidence in a War Crimes
   Tribunal in Sierra Leone},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Although witnesses are indispensable to the operation and success of war
   crimes courts, little is known about their motivations for agreeing to
   testify. This article advances existing knowledge by drawing on findings
   from interviews conducted with 200 witnesses after they gave evidence in
   the Special Court for Sierra Leone. Participants were asked to describe
   their reasons for testifying. Content analysis was used to examine the
   variety and frequency of responses. Overall, 18 conceptually distinct
   motivations were mentioned, with most witnesses reporting multiple
   motivations. The response given most frequently was `to denounce wrongs
   committed against me during the war,' followed by `to contribute to
   public knowledge about the war.' Desires for retributive justice (e.g.,
   accountability, punishment), and to fulfill a moral duty to other
   victims, were each mentioned by approximately one in four witnesses.
   Other key motivations included establishing the truth and narrating
   their stories. Motivations differed by gender, age, victimization
   status, side (prosecution versus defense) and trial. The results support
   the idea that witnesses value the opportunity to publicly denounce
   atrocities committed against themselves and others. The findings point
   to both congruities and incongruities between the aims of witnesses and
   the goals of war crimes courts. Further, the findings suggest that there
   may be two broad, overarching aspects of the decision to testify: those
   that are primarily geared toward helping oneself and those that are
   primarily geared toward helping others. Pragmatically, the findings can
   enhance efforts to support witnesses in preparing for and completing
   their testimonies.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on how the EU has interpreted the Arab uprisings as
   they unfolded in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) since December
   2010. EU actors have long acknowledged limits in the EU's strategy
   towards its southern neighbourhood, which largely bypasses the demands
   of local populations. The article analyzes the EU's efforts at
   recreating an `enhanced' framework of support for political reforms in
   the south. It concludes that the EU and local partners in the south
   still have different `visions' regarding democratic change, which shows
   the limitations of the EU's understanding of the MENA region.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {A small but dominant group of global financial elites has been trained
   in France. These elites hold powerful positions in the global
   derivatives industry, most prominently in the field of equity
   derivatives. The specialized French role is both a cause and a
   consequence of the intensifying use of derivatives, one of the major
   developments in global financial capitalism. Equity derivatives have
   spread from France to Europe, and now to Asia, with London and Hong Kong
   serving as control centers. Three factors are key in explaining the
   French niche in global derivatives. First, particular characteristics of
   national systems, in this case highly advanced French mathematics
   education, can spawn market dominance in specific areas of the global
   economy. Second, French networks, founded on shared experiences in
   French schools and French banks, are both relatively closed and highly
   portable across national borders. Third, new actors in developed and
   developing regions of the global economy are driving demand for
   derivatives products that are designed by French trained elites in
   French banks and especially in global banks. The global financial crisis
   has neither derailed the demand for derivatives nor, consequently, the
   role French engineering schools play in educating some of the top global
   financial practitioners.},

   main conclusion is that while reform priorities of the EU in the region
   are aligned with transition experience, the actual participation of
   actors from the new members in implementing EU-financed projects aimed
   at promoting democratic governance is limited. This contradiction should
   be resolved or it will further erode the credibility of the EU's
   external policies.},

Title = {Assets or liabilities? The politics of bank ownership},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {765-789},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {By 2014, there was significant variation across the global economy in
   the levels of domestic and foreign bank ownership among states. While
   major emerging and most advanced countries continued to protect domestic
   control over the bulk of their banking assets, a number of developing
   and transition economies had opened their banking markets to
   unprecedentedly high levels of foreign bank ownership. This introduction
   to a special issue on the politics of bank ownership examines why states
   have taken such divergent paths, and maps out some of the major
   consequences of disparate foreign bank ownership levels. The special
   issue finds that banking sector protectionism against a backdrop of
   globalization has generated new conflicts and costs for states.
   Paradoxically, it is the large, powerful countries that are most
   susceptible to such costs and conflict, in contrast to their more open,
   if weaker, counterparts. In addition, we find that high levels of
   foreign bank ownership have not resulted in significant vulnerability
   for host states, as some scholars had predicted. In some cases, foreign
   bank ownership can even improve a weak state's power position. Finally,
   we conclude that states' varying approaches to banking sector
   protectionism and openness complicate efforts to supranationalize bank
   regulation and supervision, exacerbating financial instability.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Abstract = {We investigate the character of the market for corporate control (i.e.
   takeovers) in French and German banking. The key feature of this
   character is the marked ability of French and German banks to resist
   unsolicited takeover bids, especially - although not exclusively- those
   from foreign competitors. We present an institutional perspective to
   account for the restrained character of takeovers in French and German
   banking. Our perspective is composed of two elements. First,
   institutional arrangements are important since they structure power
   relations among firm stakeholders by providing opportunities, as well as
   imposing constraints, to influence the decision-making process in which
   takeover transactions take place. Second, institutional arrangements
   provide firm stakeholders with several potential opportunities, not just
   one, to block unsolicited bids since takeover contests are composed of
   sequences of decisions for which approval is needed at each stage.
   French and German banks have used different mixes of institutional
   arrangements, themselves located at different stages of takeover
   transactions, to secure restrained markets for corporate control. Our
   institutional analysis, in turn, also illustrates an important
   shortcoming of banking sector protectionism, namely the contribution of
   protection from unsolicited takeover bids to the building of banks
   carrying systemic risks.},

Abstract = {The quality of democracy depends on both politicians and citizens. While
   most attention has focused on politicians, this paper looks at citizens.
   There has been some scepticism about whether the postcommunist public is
   prepared to rule their countries. The legacies of communism and the
   rigours of the transition may have produced citizens whose opinions are
   unstable and ill-informed and therefore a poor basis for democratic
   policy making. This paper tests this proposition by considering the
   nature of public opinion in the Czech Republic. Its main conclusion is
   that postcommunist public opinion is more reasonable than conventional
   wisdom suggests. Opinions on most policies change slowly if at all and
   when they do change the changes are prompted more by gradual shifts in
   mores than by political manipulation. This suggests that citizens in the
   region are prepared to have a significant voice in policy making.},

Abstract = {Current revelations about the secret US-NSA program, PRISM, have
   confirmed the large-scale mass surveillance of the telecommunication and
   electronic messages of governments, companies, and citizens, including
   the United States' closest allies in Europe and Latin America. The
   transnational ramifications of surveillance call for a re-evaluation of
   contemporary world politics' practices. The debate cannot be limited to
   the United States versus the rest of the world or to surveillance versus
   privacy; much more is at stake. This collective article briefly
   describes the specificities of cyber mass surveillance, including its
   mix of the practices of intelligence services and those of private
   companies providing services around the world. It then investigates the
   impact of these practices on national security, diplomacy, human rights,
   democracy, subjectivity, and obedience.},

   War between the Soviet Union and the West; it was also a region in which
   East Germany played a salient role in the Soviet bloc's antagonism
   toward Israel. From 1953, when the German Democratic Republic (GDR)
   signed its first trade agreement with Egypt, until 1989, when the
   Communist regime in the GDR collapsed, East Germany opposed the state of
   Israel and supported Israel's enemies in the Arab world, providing arms,
   training, and other support to countries and terrorist groups that
   sought to destroy Israel. From the mid-1960s until 1989, but especially
   from 1967 to the mid-1980s, both the Soviet Union and the GDR were in an
   undeclared state of war against Israel.},

   discrimination in insurance has shown the potential reach of the

   non-discrimination as the basis for market-regulatory social policy. It
   is shown that the European Commission's initial support for prohibiting
   insurance discrimination faltered with the realization that the measure
   would have little efficacy as a distributive social policy. It was left
   to the Court to assert that non-discrimination rights are constitutive
   for European markets, regardless of their functional and instrumental
   limitations. The Court's focus was on the market-integrative potential
   of rights as sources of norms for the conduct of insurance
   relationships. It is argued that this form of constitutive regulation is
   distinct from distributive social policy as it does not require that
   outcomes are egalitarian, but, rather, that the processes governing
   market relations should respect fundamental rights.},

Abstract = {Despite the onset of the current economic crisis there has been no
   significant move towards protectionism amongst most of the world's
   economies. Although rational institutionalist explanations point to the
   role played by the constraining rules of the World Trade Organisation,
   countries have largely remained open in areas where they have not
   legally bound their liberalisation. While accounts emphasising the
   increasing interdependence of global supply chains have some merit, I
   show that such explanations do not tell the full story, as integration
   into the global economy is not always associated with support for free
   trade during the crisis. In response, I develop a constructivist
   argument which highlights how particular ideas about the global trading
   system have become rooted in policy-making discourse, mediating the
   response of policy elites to protectionist pressures and temptations.
   Trade policy-makers and a group of leading economists have constructed
   an ideational imperative for continued openness (and for concluding the
   Doha Round, albeit less successfully) by drawing on a questionable
   reading of economic history (the Smoot-Hawley myth); by continually
   stressing protectionism's role as one of the causes of the Great
   Depression non-liberal responses to the current crisis have been all but
   ruled out by all except those willing to question the received wisdom.},

Abstract = {This article outlines the evolution of youth European policies, in a
   context marked for over 25 years by a very high level of youth
   unemployment, exacerbated since 2008 by the economic crisis. It is
   striking that the European Union (EU) has until recently preferred a
   transversal approach to youth, considering youth unemployment as an
   issue among others. Moreover, the difficulty of the EU to co-operate
   with a wide spectrum of youth organizations is obvious, especially with
   those in favour of a far more protective approach against youth
   employment. However, we seem to witness the rise of a corporatist system
   in the field of youth, in which a few organizations are considered as
   legitimate interlocutors, even if they are consulted on issues which are
   the less sensitive at the expense of youth unemployment policies.},

Abstract = {The European Union gas model worked steadily for nearly four decades:
   since the time that gas first emerged as an important resource in
   European energy demand. However, since the late 1990s this stability has
   been disrupted by a number of factors. The EU reform agenda has been the
   most important of these. Following a structural-conduct-performance
   plan, the European Commission has forced changes on players, scenarios
   and exchange mechanisms through legislative action in order to build a
   new energy model based on those operating in the United States and the
   United Kingdom. The main point of this article is that despite these
   actions, many features of the traditional model have been modified but

Abstract = {Multilateral, subregional partnerships are one of the defining features
   of contemporary European politics. The 2004 enlargement of the European
   Union introduced a new partnership entity to the mix-the Visegrad Group
   of states, comprising the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and
   Slovakia-which offers its members a useful model to discuss and
   represent common interests in a collective manner within the regional
   and international political landscape. The article provides a reflection
   on the evolution of the Visegrad Group of states since 2004. It examines
   four key policy areas (institutional candidacy, energy policy, eastern
   neighbourhood and defence policy) where the group has either learned
   some difficult lessons or is seeking to apply those lessons. The article
   suggests that the Visegrad Group's greatest strength lies in its
   flexibility to become more responsive to the challenges it faces and it
   is likely therefore to remain appealing to its member states and to be a
   permanent feature within the wider cohort of European Union subregional
   partnerships.},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {This article sets out the concept of a technical system and explores its
   ability to explain why some transnational regulatory domains are
   governed by a single transnational business governance (TBG) scheme,
   while in others there are many such schemes. By linking the numbers of
   TBG schemes that govern any particular transnational regulatory domain
   to technical systems in this way, important insights are provided into
   TBG interactions. Where technical systems are present, the TBG schemes
   that govern them will be specialized and complementary, rather than
   competitive. More generally, a technical systems approach illuminates
   the set of extended relationships that connect TBG schemes to the
   industry they seek to regulate. By tracing out these relationships we
   can reveal indirect interactions between TBG schemes that may be
   mediated through firms or market infrastructures. These indirect
   interactions can be obscured by approaches that only focus on the direct
   interactions among TBG schemes. The article analyzes two cases of TBG
   schemes in global finance. The first, derivatives, has a single overall
   TBG scheme. The second case, professional financial designations, has
   multiple competing TBG schemes.},

Abstract = {South Africa desperately needs newly recommitted leadership capable of
   serving the entire nation, not a ruling class or a cohort of robber
   barons. It is conceivable that political leadership capable of building
   upon Mandela's legacy and uplifting the nation and its people could come
   from within the ranks of the Democratic Alliance, from Agang, or from
   South Africa's several other national political parties. But it is more
   likely to arise within the ANC, possibly through the deputy presidential
   and eventual presidential efforts of Cyril Ramaphosa or others within
   the dominant ANC not yet fully dedicated to assuming national
   leadership. But from wherever it comes, South Africa is ready and
   anxious to be renewed.},

Abstract = {The World Bank is the most important financier for international
   investment. The bank opens credits mostly for investment projects in
   developing countries. Turkey has received various investment credits
   since its membership to the World Bank on March 11, 1947. The credits
   were used for economic and social domains. Turkey has also been granted
   credits from the European Investment Bank (EIB). The credits received
   are composed of micro credits that belong to Small and Medium
   Enterprises (SMEs). A regional development bank, Islamic Development
   Bank, has also received credits through Eximbank and Industrial
   Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) to finance Turkish SMEs. This chapter
   deals with Turkish investment strategies in the framework of basic
   principles of investment - development banks.},

Abstract = {Barack Obama appeared poised to capture more votes among Evangelical
   women than Evangelical men given the prominence that economic and
   wartime issues played in the 2008 election. However, I find that no
   gender gap existed among Evangelicals in 2008; instead, religious
   tradition trumps gender as a predictor of presidential vote choice.
   While Obama fared similarly to John Kerry, Evangelical women were
   significantly more likely to vote for Al Gore than Evangelical men,
   demonstrating that there may be circumstances in which Democratic
   presidential candidates can mitigate some of their voting losses to
   Evangelical women.},

Abstract = {The basis of any business, including non-public Higher Education
   Institutions (HEIs), is financial security, which is ensured by
   achieving sufficiently high profits and financial liquidity. Especially
   in these times, a rapidly changing market, the competition, and the
   upcoming birth rate forces HEIs to optimize operational and strategic
   decisions. On one hand, it creates new opportunities for non-public
   HEIs, but on the other, it is a source of danger for the future of their
   operations. Therefore, they must not only overcome the difficulties
   encountered in everyday life but also try to respond to the challenges
   posed by their environment, demonstrating the special care to ensure the
   efficiency of their operations. They must not only try to increase the
   quality of offered services or manage their funds rationally but with
   equal attention should ``invest{''} in modern management methods and
   concepts. Through the use of controlling, contemporary non-public HEIs
   are able to choose an optimum variant of decision facilitating the
   achievement of their goals. In view of the above, this chapter discusses
   the special considerations relating to controlling HEIs from the point
   of view of increasing their effectiveness.},

Abstract = {The invisibility of immigrant women's health care and justice needs,
   which are directly related to the triple oppression they face and
   intersectional identities they hold, is highlighted by the silence
   surrounding a requirement that they be immunized against cervical cancer
   with the controversial vaccination, Gardasil. Such a requirement was the
   unintended consequence of a statutory mandate colliding with an agency
   recommendation, and it disproportionately burdened women and girls
   emigrating from Mexico. A quiet and far-reaching coalition used
   unconventional means to get the policy reversed and opened new ways for
   scholars to understand potential responses to agency-level injustices
   for groups marginalized by dominant discourses of public health and
   immigration.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1042-1070},
Abstract = {The dollar has been the world's first currency since the end of World
   War II, possibly since the inter-war period, and is the leading currency
   today. A growing chorus of observers believes this dollar-centered order
   is coming to an end. While much commentary revolves around changes in
   the distribution of power, measures are only loosely related to the
   material basis for currency dominance. A proper understanding of the
   dollar's global role requires a quantitative assessment of the United
   States' monetary capabilities and currency influence relative to
   potential rivals. Moreover, while there is general recognition that a
   shift in power capabilities away from the United States is an
   insufficient, although necessary, condition for the prevailing currency
   hierarchy to reverse, there exists no systematic exploration of how
   power is exercised when converting monetary capabilities into currency
   influence. This paper offers a systematic assessment of the monetary
   capabilities and currency influence of all countries in the world as
   well as an analysis of how the three faces of power sustain dollar
   hegemony.},

   economic indicators to understand the justification for South Africa's
   ascension to full BRICS Membership, and what it may mean strategically
   for the BRICS bloc. They then explore the BRICS strategy of development
   by briefly discussing the increased activity by BRICS in Africa to unify
   the developing and underdeveloped world. Finally, the authors discuss
   the creation of the BRICS Development Bank and the bank's effects on the
   International Monetary Fund and World Bank specifically, and western

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {29},
Number = {6},
Pages = {901-925},
Abstract = {When Socialist intellectual John Strachey was appointed as Secretary of
   State for War in 1950, his pre-war record as a Marxist writer with close
   connections to the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) became a
   matter of public debate. A bitter campaign was run against him in the
   Beaverbrook press, and some members of the US defense and nuclear
   establishment pressed for an embargo on sensitive information being
   passed to the UK War Office. American suspicion of the political
   reliability of the Labour government was heightened by the appointment,
   but this does not explain how and why some Americans were so hostile to
   Strachey. The FBI's dossier on his pre-war activities, circulated
   amongst his American critics, documented Strachey's supposed secret
   membership of the CPGB's Central Committee. MI5 and Special Branch files
   show that this supposition was based on faulty intelligence. The
   readiness of American anti-Soviet protagonists to lend credence to such
   suspicions contrasts with the relaxed view of Strachey's past that was
   taken in Whitehall. Both positions were characteristic of their time,
   and of this stage in the Anglo-American alliance. This paper explores
   the ways in which American insecurities and a British climate of
   tolerance towards fellow travellers shaped the way that episode played
   out.},

Abstract = {There is an ever-growing demand in the world for humanitarian action in
   response to the suffering caused by complex emergencies and natural
   disasters. Part of the power and appeal of humanitarianism is its
   universality, that is, the idea that humanitarianism is premised on
   cross-cultural moral truths and principles and a concern for the
   alleviation of suffering of humankind, regardless of differences. This
   idea of universality, however, is being called into question as
   expressions of humanitarianism and humanitarian actors become
   increasingly diverse. While Western states and organizations have long
   dominated the international humanitarian order (IHO), this is no longer
   the case today, with non-Western governments and societies becoming
   increasingly important and visible contributors to international
   humanitarian assistance. At the same time, these new IHO players are
   contributing to a broader range of perceptions of what constitutes
   legitimate humanitarianism; and while the concern for the suffering of
   others may be universal, it is clear that the response to suffering may
   differ across cultures.},

Abstract = {A peculiar model of post-communist political economy has evolved in
   Belarus under President Aliaksandr Lukashenka. It features
   prioritisation of non-entrepreneurial social groups, a strong role for
   the state, and extensive social security provision. The model appears to
   be grounded on Lukashenka's understanding of his political powerbase;
   having no external backing for his policies, he wants to command as wide
   grass-roots support as possible to remain in office. By doing so, he
   rejects the principles of pluralist democracy and market economy, making
   Belarus's political economy model quite different from that envisaged in
   the mainstream post-communist theories of neo-liberalism and gradualism.},

Abstract = {Addressing the literature on the historical origins of capitalism, this
   study analyses the role agriculture played in the formation of
   non-market economic coordination in economic and social affairs around
   1900. It argues that the dominant rural production profile dictated
   whether farmers did exert a significant impact on socio-economic
   institution and policy formation outside the rural sector. By applying
   the method of parallel demonstration of theory, we illustrate the
   plausibility of these theoretical considerations through juxtaposing the
   historical record of Germany, Denmark, New Zealand and the USA. The
   article highlights the limits of a dichotomous view on the origins of
   capitalism because the coordination effect of rural economies varies
   within the later coordinated and the later liberal cluster of market
   economies.},

Abstract = {The restructuring of the Russian mass media has created a two-tier media
   system, where some outlets, notably national television, are very
   tightly controlled, while others, including the internet, are allowed a
   substantial degree of freedom. The allocation of media outlets to one or
   other tier is carried out according to procedures that can be compared
   to the Italian lottizzazione, a method used to allocate political
   control within the state broadcaster RAI. Recent changes in media usage
   are now threatening the equilibrium of the system, thus posing a
   challenge to those responsible for its administration.},

Abstract = {The article concentrates on recent successes of non-partisans
   (independents) in Polish local government. A majority of mayors and
   councillors remains unaffiliated with any party-in this respect Poland
   is an outlier among European countries. The article examines both the
   factors determining the cross-national variation in the level of local
   government partyness and those causing the differences between the
   municipalities. The analyses of local elections held in 2006 and 2010
   demonstrate that non-partisans' successes are primarily due to the
   previous election results (the advantage of incumbency); a possible
   `partisan offensive' to colonise new resources in local politics is
   sluggish.},

Title = {Free Us from Power: Governmentality, Counter-conduct, and Simulation in
   European Democracy and Reform Promotion in the Arab World},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {293-310},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {For over a decade, Arab governments have been enrolled into EU
   initiatives aimed at promoting democratic reform in the region. Common
   to these initiatives are their claims to be uninvolved with power and
   external imposition, professing instead to be based on voluntary notions
   of local demand and ownership. This article challenges this core
   liberalist assumption of the absence of power. Drawing on Foucault's
   reflections on liberal governmentality, it shows how power operates
   through a technology of ``contractualization{''} which produces a
   distinct Arab subjectivity in the form of a lack (of reform will). Yet
   governing technologies are never complete, and possibilities of reversal
   and resistance always exist. In the second part, the article engages
   with the emerging debate on Foucault's concept of counter-conduct,
   opening up the concept to more subtle and less spectacular forms of
   resistance. Drawing inspiration from Derrida's analysis of (in)
   hospitality and Baudrillard's logic of simulation, the article shows how
   the liberal assumptions of ``invitation,{''} ``ownership,{''} and
   ``gradualism{''} inherent in European reform initiatives enable
   resistance in the form of: (i) selection of entry; (ii) setting
   conditions; and (iii) simulating reform.},

Abstract = {In June 1989, the First Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet
   Union established the Commission for Historical and Legal Estimation of
   the Soviet-German Non-aggression Pact of 1939. In the commission,
   representatives from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania condemned the Soviet
   annexation of the Baltic States, prompting heated arguments regarding
   the invalidity of the related secret protocol of the pact with other
   members who continued to hold the traditional Soviet ideological view of
   the pact as something positive. The debate over the secret protocol had
   the further potential to extend to disputes over `recovery of lost
   territory' amongst the Baltic States, Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus and
   Russia. This article analyses the arguments used by commission members,
   considering the interplay of national interests, how they balanced
   arguments between restoration of `state sovereignty' and maintenance of
   borders, and how they finally compromised and concluded the commission's
   report.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) encourages cross-border inter-firm networks as a
   part of its external governance approach. What is the effect of these
   networks? Do they lead to regulatory convergence around EU standards in
   the eastern neighbourhood? Using original survey data, as well as data
   on regional enterprise-related regulations, this article argues that the
   density of interaction among private actors and between private actors
   and regional governments in such networks create conditions for private
   actors to lobby for regulatory change, resulting in approximations to EU
   standards. By testing the transnational mechanisms of policy change, the
   article points to the possibility of integration, even in the absence of
   membership prospects. However, the findings also indicate that the
   extent of regulatory change is conditioned by cross-border network
   structure as well as the institutional distance between the partnering
   regions.},

Abstract = {A growing body of literature focuses on the attitudes produced by
   women's representation. One area of particular interest is the effect of
   women's representation on perceptions of corruption in government.
   Multiple scholars have found that citizens view women in government as
   more trustworthy and less corrupt. Others have suggested that the link
   between gender and corruption is spurious or dependent upon regime
   characteristics. Additionally, many studies of women's effect on
   corruption were published prior to the widespread adoption of gender
   quotas, when levels of women's representation were considerably lower.
   We argue that the relationship between women and perceptions of
   corruption can be better understood by applying an integrated model of
   representation, which explores the effects of formal, descriptive, and
   substantive representation on perceptions of corruption. Using a
   time-series analysis of 140 countries worldwide from 1998-2011, this
   study finds that women's descriptive and substantive representation are
   correlated with lower perceptions of corruption. However, gender quotas
   are correlated with higher perceptions of corruption among political
   elites.},

Abstract = {This article offers a political economy review of the literatures and
   the empirical evidence concerning the Rise of the South'. The study
   focuses on global convergence (in the long-term, in the last 30 years,
   and in the aftermath of the 2008 global crisis), economic decoupling
   between developing and advanced economies, and the economic strategies
   which may help catching-up, especially the flying geese' paradigm and
   industrial policies supporting manufacturing sector growth. It shows
   that the mainstream literature suffers from significant weaknesses; that
   empirical claims concerning convergence and decoupling have been
   exaggerated, and that flying geese-type strategies are severely limited.
   Examination of the drivers of growth in the South and the policies
   implemented in key converging countries support the claim that political
   economy approaches can offer valuable policy insights to countries
   grappling with the challenges of long-term growth and development.},

Abstract = {Over the past two decades, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe
   have completed a long transition from authoritarian rule, and joining
   the EU has been considered to be an indication of the end of the
   consolidation process. However, this path was anything but linear and in
   many cases it was marked by concentration and abuse of executive power,
   a systematic political patronage and a plebiscitary interpretation of
   democracy. In order to shed light on the meaning of these phenomena,
   this paper provides for an analysis of democratic consolidation in these
   countries by way of comparing the cases of Bulgaria, Poland and
   Slovakia.},

Abstract = {This article reassesses the impact of inflation on long-term growth for
   a panel of 14 European Union countries in the years prior to monetary
   unification. While previous research mostly focuses on a linear nexus or
   allows for a piecewise linear relationship with a single threshold, this
   study takes account of a more complex relationship. The empirical
   estimates for the full EU sample confirm the hypothesis that the
   relationship between inflation and growth is positive for very low
   inflation rates (that is, below an estimate of 1.6 per cent),
   insignificant thereafter and negative for high, two-digit inflation
   levels. The estimate of the inflation level that divides the
   insignificant from the negative effect is found to be higher in the
   group of traditional cohesion countries than for the rest of the sample.},

Title = {Giving Meaning to Human Rights: An Analysis of Human Rights Discourse in
   Malawi},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {259-280},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {When human rights are seen as discursively constructed, it is assumed
   that human rights are given content and meaning not only by legislators
   and courts ('from above') but also by actors within social movements and
   community development ('from below'). The article analyses human rights
   discourse in Malawi in general and two examples of human rights practice
   in particular from the perspective of giving meaning to human rights.
   Who gives meaning to the human rights concept-'ufulu' in Chichewa-and
   who is excluded? The first project to be analysed is called Shire
   Highlands Sustainable Livelihoods Programme (SHSLP) and is implemented
   by Oxfam and local partners in the Southern Region. In the SHSLP there
   was open use of `rights language', especially by so-called radio
   listening clubs. Actors did not primarily rely on fixed definitions of
   the human rights concept in general, instead the meanings of `human
   rights' were shaped in the process of demanding services from local duty
   bearers, that is, making claims. The second project produced a draft
   bill, The Food and Nutrition Security Bill. The article analyses the
   bill from the perspective of giving meaning and content to the right to
   food. A drafting process that would have included wide consultations
   could possibly have contributed to a public dialogue about the meaning,
   source, and authority of the right to food as well as forms and
   strategies for claiming it. However, this opportunity to discuss the
   relevance and meaning of the right to food for the lived reality of the
   people in Malawi was not taken by the organizations behind the bill.},

Abstract = {This article argues that empirical developments in international
   security governance offer untapped opportunities for strengthening
   intellectual links between European Union (EU) studies and international
   relations. To uncover these links, the article first demonstrates how
   the EU has started to address various chemical, biological, radiological
   and nuclear security risks through adopting an approach conceptualized
   as transnational security governance'. The article subsequently argues
   that this approach can be convincingly explained by drawing on the
   insights from the study of the sociology of bureaucracy and bureaucratic
   behaviour in international relations. In this story, the EU's approach
   to international security is an example of normal bureaucratic practice,
   stemming in particular from the bureaucracy's moral and expert
   authority. Importantly, the engagement with the broader social science
   scholarship will benefit EU studies as much as other sub-disciplines.},

Abstract = {As rights claims on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity
   occupy an increasingly prominent place in international politics, it
   seems clear that the long-running Woman Question has been supplemented
   by a set of variously articulated ``queer questions.{''} Drawing on
   postcolonial, feminist and queer theory, and readings of queer literary
   and cinematic texts from India and Iran, this article explores moments
   of resonance, intersection and tension between the Woman Question and
   queer questions. It argues, first, that contemporary queer questions
   echo the preoccupations of the Woman Question even as they are uncannily
   prefigured by it; second, that these questions have been mutually
   disruptive of one another, so that queer questions are not simply a
   rerun of the Woman Question; and third, that differences between these
   questions are problematically flattened out in projections of shared
   futurity articulated in the abstract universality of ``human rights.{''}
   Navigating the shared pasts, fraught presents and imagined futures of
   Woman and queer questions, the article brings queer critiques of
   temporality to bear on the concerns of postcolonial queer activism. It
   elucidates opportunities and challenges for alliance between the
   subjectivities interpellated by these various questions. In addition, it
   asks how the proliferation of new subjectivities under the sign of
   ``queer{''} troubles notions of universal human rights.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the economic and political economy factors
   explaining why countries agree upon services commitments in regional
   trade agreements (RTAs) going beyond the General Agreement on Trade in
   Services (GATS), what we call the commitments gap. Using a unique
   dataset comprising of detailed schedules of services commitments
   disaggregated by sub-sectors and covering almost all countries that are
   members of a services RTA, we are able to quantify the extent to which
   geographical, systemic as well as economic and institutional factors
   correlate with a country's pattern of RTA commitments that go further
   than commitments made at the WTO. Strong explanatory variables are
   asymmetries between negotiating partners and market size, together with
   endowments in mid-skilled labor and institutional governance. Whereas
   some of these forces are strongly positively associated with commitments
   made beyond GATS, others are significant determinants that correlate
   negatively with a country's commitment patterns in RTAs. We also find
   strong differences between services industries providing evidence that
   not all economic and political economy factors are of equal importance
   for all services. For instance, financial and construction services
   often diverge significantly from our general pattern of explanations.},

Abstract = {This article examines the varied consequences that the label trafficked
   holds for migrants and for the organizations that assist them. In the
   case of migrants from the Dominican Republic to Argentina, threat of
   U.S. economic sanctions prompted the two governments to document
   incidents of trafficking by labeling all forms of migrant labor
   exploitation as trafficking. Collapsing a range of coerced and
   noncoerced labor experiences under one label has muddied the definition
   of trafficking. In contrast, U.S. trafficking policy systematically
   ignores significant exploitation of labor migrants, in part because of
   the volatile politics of immigration in the United States, and because
   of the conflation of sex trafficking with trafficking. The article uses
   these two examples of the effects of labeling exploited workers as
   trafficking victims to draw attention to the politicization of the term
   trafficking.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the effect of informal ties between judges (as
   represented by regional court chairpersons) and prosecutors on the
   repressive implementation of criminal justice in Russia in the area of
   fraud convictions. The authors utilize criminal law statistics of
   Russian regional courts for 2006-2010 to determine the alignment between
   chairpersons and prosecutors by measuring the length of their mutual
   career paths. The informal ties have a strong impact on trial outcome,
   which, however, changes over time. During periods of high bureaucratic
   risks and uncertainty, regions with a higher extent of informal ties
   between judges and prosecutors exhibit more repressive law enforcement.
   If external risks decrease, informal coalitions seem to increase the
   independence of the courts, insulating them from bureaucratic pressures
   and limiting their repressiveness.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {498-522},
Abstract = {This article discusses the reform of intelligence governance in two
   sub-regional groupings of former communist states: East Central Europe
   and the Balkans. These two sub-regions are delineated according to the
   pace and nature of transformations that they have undergone since the
   collapse of communist rule and their relations with respect to the
   European Union, the key political and economic organization in Europe. A
   number of lessons are drawn from comparing experiences in the two
   sub-regions relating to democratic reform of the security apparatus, and
   in particular the intelligence sector. Significant factors in the
   consolidation of democratic governance of intelligence include the
   nature of precursor communistera regimes and the legacies they created,
   whether armed conflict has occurred during the transition, the extent
   and character of external (especially EU) assistance, and the strength
   of media and civil society. These factors appear to have influenced how
   transitional regimes have sought to introduce institutional reforms to
   constrain the powers of those services and their susceptibility to
   arbitrary use. They also have influenced measures taken to redress
   abuses by intelligence services under the preceding communist regime and
   the legitimation of the post-authoritarian state.},

Abstract = {More than 11 years have passed and Doha Development Round (DDR) has been
   in the doldrums, having full uncertainties that may result in closure.
   Trade negotiations are at a standstill, resulting in revivalism of trade
   protectionism in the name of ``new regionalism{''} or preferential
   agreements (India-Japan, India-EU). This would lead to dismantling
   multilateral trading system for which World Trade Organization was
   created in January 1995. It is vital to protect and preserve the gains
   of the WTO in a variety of related areas. Therefore, the success of a
   multilateral trading system is imperative, and this could only be
   possible when DDR is successful and revivalism takes place. If impasse
   is continued, the concept and practices of free trade would be
   transformed into trade protectionism in the name of new regionalism. If
   it happens, then the future of global trade is uncertain and there would
   be enormous loss of potential and opportunities of creation of trade,
   and no country could afford it. Doha is stuck. Where do we go from here?
   The present chapter analyses the issues relating to the closure vs.
   success of the DDR. Every effort must be made to keep it alive both in
   the interest of mankind and the globe. If in 12th round, nothing
   concrete comes up, then the member countries are thinking and planning
   to replace it by Global Recovery Round (GRR), which is becoming more
   significant to deal with. Hence, this chapter attempts to examine the
   three options, namely closure, revival, and replace.},

Abstract = {One of the intriguing unidentified cover names in the Venona decryptions
   released in the mid-1990s was `19', a Soviet source senior enough to
   report taking part in a conversation with President Roosevelt, Prime
   Minister Churchill, and Vice-President Wallace at the 1943 Trident
   conference. While some historians thought the evidence too ambiguous to
   identify the real name behind `19', others built a case that it was
   presidential adviser Harry Hopkins. Alexander Vassiliev's notebooks,
   made public in 2009, resolved the issue by firmly identifying `19' as
   State Department official Laurence Duggan. There remain, however,
   writers who refuse to accept the evidence that `19' was Duggan and
   insist that Hopkins was a Soviet agent on the basis of insubstantial
   evidence.},

Abstract = {Political participation and citizens' perceptions of the legitimacy and
   fairness of government are central components of democracy. In this
   article, we examine one possible threat to these markers of a just
   political system: family member incarceration. We offer a unique glimpse
   into the broader social consequences of punishment that are brought on
   by a partner's or parent's incarceration. We argue that the criminal
   justice system serves as an important institution for political
   socialization for the families of those imprisoned, affecting their
   attitudes and orientations toward the government and their will and
   capacity to become involved in political life. We draw from ethnographic
   data collected by one of the authors, quantitative data from the
   National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, and interviews with
   recently released male prisoners and their female partners. Our findings
   suggest that experiences of a family member's incarceration complicate
   perceptions of government legitimacy and fairness and serve as a barrier
   to civic participation.},

Abstract = {The importance of innovation for enterprises increases each passing day.
   As a result of globalization, enterprises are under intense competitive
   pressure. They have to make innovation for increasing \textbackslash{}
   market share or for protecting it. Non-innovative firms lose their
   customers and their existence faces a threat from other innovative
   actors in the market. Therefore, firms have to design their organization
   structure that encourage innovation. Mintzberg's innovative organization
   structure is investigated in this chapter. Mintzberg's five-part
   organizational structure is described briefly in this chapter, and a
   case study, which is related to innovative (adhocratic) organization
   structure, is performed. Thus, its aim is to identify the diversity
   between theory and practice via of the theoretical knowledge. As a
   result of the study, a high degree of similarity between the application
   and Mintzberg's theory, which is related to innovative organization
   structure, is identified.},

Abstract = {This article traces political and institutional developments in the
   Republic of Georgia after the Rose Revolution. Particular focus is
   placed on efforts by Georgian policy-makers to align Georgian political
   institutions with Western models. Drawing on the concept of policy
   transfer, the author demonstrates various pitfalls in this process.
   Based on the gathered evidence, it appears that Georgian policy-makers
   engaged in various processes of `incomplete transfer', compounded by a
   lack of understanding or deliberately false conceptions of Western
   institutions. Despite democratic rhetoric and interlinkages with the
   West, Georgia moved to a novel form of `hyper-presidentialism' and
   dismantled institutional checks and balances. Hence, the Rose Revolution
   initially served to reinforce the already existing institutions of
   `patronal presidentialism' through a series of misguided institutional
   modifications. The author also discusses the outcome of the recent
   parliamentary and presidential elections, which may have ironically and
   accidentally further democratised the country.},

   the realities of supply-chain trade will require a new organization-a
   WTO 2.0 as it were. Reasoning on the optimal nature of the new
   organization is based on the nature of supply-chain trade, the nature of
   the disciplines that underpin it, and the nature of the gains from
   cooperation.},

Journal = {POLITICS \& SOCIETY},

Volume = {42},

Abstract = {For many years women tended to vote more conservative than men, but
   since the 1980s this gap has shifted direction: women in many countries
   are more likely than men to support left parties. The literature largely
   agrees on a set of political-economic factors explaining the change in
   women's political orientation. In this article we demonstrate that these
   conventional factors fall short in explaining the gender vote gap. We
   highlight the importance of a religious cleavage in the party system
   across Western European countries, restricting the free flow of
   religious voters between left and right parties. Given that surveys show
   us a constantly higher degree of religiosity among women and a
   persistent impact of religion on vote choice, religion explains a
   substantial part of the temporal as well as cross-country variation in
   the transition from the more conservative to the more progressive voting
   behavior of women.},

   non-state authority to govern business conduct across borders has vastly
   expanded in numerous issue areas. As these initiatives proliferate, they
   increasingly interact with one another and with state-based regimes. The
   key challenge is to understand the implications of these interactions
   for regulatory capacity and performance, and ultimately for social and
   environmental impact. In this introduction, we propose an analytical
   framework for the study of transnational business governance
   interactions. The framework disaggregates the regulatory process to
   identify potential points of interaction, and suggests analytical
   questions that probe the key features of interactions at each point.},

   an Irish Urban Housing Estate},

Abstract = {Housing rights are becoming significant as a tool for highlighting needs
   and raising housing standards across the world. These rights are now an
   integral part of economic, social, and cultural rights within
   international human rights instruments, while the right to adequate
   housing is recognized legally at national and international levels.
   Among the methods of implementing these rights the human rights based
   approach (HRBA) is used by NGOs, community organizations and rights
   advocates. Many housing rights issues arise in relation to standards in
   social housing, urban regeneration and social housing policy
   development. This article examines a case study where the HRBA has been
   applied by local authority tenants in partnership with community
   development organizations and supported by human rights expertise to
   campaign for improvements to substandard housing conditions and
   deprivation within a Dublin inner city social housing estate. It
   appraises the adoption of the HRBA as a response to inadequate housing
   conditions and delayed regeneration programmes. The impact of poor
   housing on the health of tenants was an integral element of the
   arguments used. The outcomes of using the HRBA for the rights holders
   (the tenants) are assessed. Overall, this campaign led to significant
   improvements in conditions. The factors underlying the success centred
   on the way in which the HRBA framework, with its focus on measurable
   indicators of human rights violations, enabled community development
   organizations to create a human rights based public campaign that
   exerted considerable political pressure through the empowerment of
   tenants, leveraging of human rights experts, and considerable media
   publicity. The development of solutions in parallel with the local
   authority was also important. This approach transcended many established
   NGO and state approaches to addressing poverty.},

Abstract = {This article explores how the full liberalization of migration as a
   consequence of Austria's European economic area (EEA) accession in 1994
   impacted on the education structure of migrants to Austria. To identify
   the effects of this policy change, use is made of the fact that only
   migrants from EEA member states were affected, while third country
   citizens were not. Robust evidence is found that the share of low
   educated permanent migrants from the EEA to Austria reduced relative to
   the share of low educated permanent migrants from other countries after
   Austria's EEA accession. This suggests that liberalizing migration may
   be an effective way to improve the skill structure of migrants in
   countries with a high share of low-skilled migrants.},

Abstract = {South Africa has an estimated 6.4 million people living with HIV, with
   more than 2 million already on treatment. The disease emerged in South
   Africa at the same time as the transition to democracy began in 1990.
   Although the country has seen considerable advances in many social
   spheres, the health sector has lagged. This lag is primarily because the
   HIV/AIDS epidemic results in an increased burden of disease in a cohort
   of people who would otherwise be healthy. This article warns that the
   all-pervasive nature of the epidemic will put other areas of development
   at risk. With economic development come new threats to the health of
   South Africans, including noncommunicable diseases and environmental
   change. Service delivery remains a challenge for the government at all
   levels, and the demands of not only South Africans but of migrants and
   refugees need to be considered.},

Abstract = {This article investigates whether EU accession can help Bulgaria and
   Romania limit state capture and the undue influence of business actors
   on the policy process. Particularly vulnerable to such influence,
   Bulgarian and Romanian institutions are monitored through the EU's
   co-operation and verification mechanism and the Commission and ECJ
   infringement procedures. We argue that, under certain conditions, these
   tools can improve the quality of democracy in both countries. The key
   conditions are the presence of domestic actors able to use the EU and
   carry over procedural policy requirements from the acquis to other
   policy-making. Analysing policy-making processes in the forestry sector,
   we find NGOs able to use EU links and governments sensitive to naming
   and shaming can result in a positive influence of EU rules on the policy
   process and quality of democracy. This is true even in least likely
   cases, such as non-acquis policy areas in Bulgaria and Romania.},

Abstract = {This article presents research on the consequences of mass imprisonment
   for childhood inequality. I investigate average and race-specific
   effects of paternal and maternal incarceration on the risk of child
   homelessness, using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing
   Study. The results suggest that (1) recent paternal but not maternal
   incarceration substantially increases the risk of child homelessness,
   (2) effects are concentrated among African American children, and (3)
   increases in familial economic hardship and decreases in access to
   institutional support explain some of the relationship. Taken together,
   the findings indicate the prison boom was likely a key driver of the
   growing racial disparities in child homelessness, increasing black-white
   inequality in this risk by 65 percent since the 1970s. When coupled with
   the other effects of mass imprisonment on childhood inequality, these
   results suggest that the prison boom will likely lead to far greater
   black-white inequality in civic and political participation, as the
   children of the prison boom come of age.},

Abstract = {This article takes issue with the `no demos' thesis about the European
   Union. Empirically speaking, a `demos' requires a sense of community
   among the citizens, on the one hand, and a lively public spheres in
   which political issues are debated, on the other. It is argued in this
   article, first, that a majority of European citizens has developed dual
   identities - to their nation-state and to Europe and this
   Europeanization of national identities is sufficient to sustain
   carefully crafted (re-)distributive policies on the European level.
   Second, the euro crisis has strongly increased the politicization of
   national public spheres and has also led to their growing
   Europeanization with regard to issue salience and to the actors
   represented.},

Abstract = {California today represents an emerging front line in the long struggle
   to abolish capital punishment in the United States. In 2012 voters
   narrowly declined to approve a ballot initiative that would have
   replaced capital punishment with a sentence of life without parole in
   prison (LWOP), and in 2014 a federal district court held California's
   death penalty unconstitutional, citing many of the same problems with
   capital punishment which were identified by advocates of the ballot
   measure, especially very long delays between sentence and execution and
   a tiny number of executions. The growing success of what have been
   called `new abolitionist' arguments in politics and law renews an old
   concern about penal reform: are the substitute sanctions just as cruel
   as the death penalty which they seek to end? This article takes up the
   challenge of that critique, and argues that in the context of other
   challenges to extreme punishment in the United States today, especially
   those being mounted around human dignity, this is a good time to remove
   capital punishment. The death penalty, when considered in its metaphoric
   and discursive role, helps anchor a larger structure of extreme
   punishment in ways that LWOP does not. Ending capital punishment could
   trigger a broader reframing of punishment that will end LWOP as well.},

Abstract = {This article explores the relationship between memory and place in
   understandings of urban change in Central Asia. Drawing on narratives of
   long-term residents of two Central Asian cities we investigate the ways
   in which positive memories of the Soviet past emerge when people speak
   about the urban environment of today. We explore why such fondness for
   the Soviet past has emerged, what elements of the past are most
   cherished, and which urban communities remember these elements. We ask
   what these forms of memory reveal about what has been lost and what this
   tells us about the present anxieties of urban residents.},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},

Abstract = {This paper evaluates external factors that shape the establishment of
   transparent institutions, with a focus on the work of the Extractive
   Industries Transparency Initiative in Azerbaijan. The evidence from
   Azerbaijan suggests that in hydrocarbon-rich countries, genuine reform
   can only be achieved through the combined efforts of external and
   domestic actors. More specifically, the paper argues that transparency
   promotion from abroad relies on the existence of political
   accountability and genuine anti-corruption measures in order to work as
   intended. The case of Azerbaijan illustrates the potential limitations
   of external remedies to the `resource curse' and emphasises the
   significance of accountability in political regimes.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes contemporary Russian liberalism through the prism
   of competing trends of moderate pluralist and monistic radical thought.
   The author focuses particularly on the pluralist trend, less well known
   in the West, arguing that its prospects are more promising over the long
   term. Ideological and tactical differences within the liberal camp in
   Russia are compared with those in the West, both for the purpose of
   emphasizing that such differences are not unique to Russia and to show
   the connections between Russian and Western strands of liberal political
   thought.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {This article analyses the politics of banking and fiscal union in the EU
   in the context of continued threats to financial stability in Europe.
   Contrasting the expectations of functional responses and power politics,
   it finds that the behavior of the states and the outcome of negotiations
   most closely resembles contemporary realist expectations. Minimal
   supranationalism takes place to prevent complete collapse, but the main
   development is that financially powerful member states coerce and impose
   changes on weaker member states, without committing to the financial
   transfers that the latter require to survive the financial crisis, with
   negative consequences for European financial stability.},

Abstract = {There has been a recent resurgence of interest in debates about the
   power of business (Culpepper 2011; Bell 2012) and Bell and Hindmoor
   (2013) make an important, theoretically informed, but empirically
   rooted, contribution to that debate. In this response, we address both
   aspects of their contribution, arguing that their treatment of Lindblom
   is partial and, consequently, so is their explanation of the case. As
   such, we largely rely on their narrative of the evolution of the
   Australian mining tax, focusing first on critically examining Bell and
   Hindmoor's theoretical position, before turning to their analysis of the
   case.},

Abstract = {This article reflects on how Peru's reparations program is experienced
   and comprehended by Andean communities in the aftermath of the country's
   internal conflict. It focuses on how exhumations are interpreted by war
   victims' families in the highland district of Chungui. The exhumation of
   mass graves, the return of human remains and dignified burials are
   intended to provide families with a measure of closure. In these Andean
   communities, the exhumation process is interpreted as intimately linked
   with economic compensation, provoking confusion as to the
   responsibilities of each state institution involved in the reparations
   program. This situation generates mistrust and conflict, and gives rise
   to questions regarding the extent to which transitional justice
   mechanisms are experienced positively by families in this district.},

Abstract = {Researchers largely have relied on a measure of family structure to
   describe children's living arrangements, but this approach captures only
   the child's relationship to the parent(s), ignoring the presence and
   composition of siblings. We develop a measure of family complexity that
   merges family structure and sibling composition to distinguish between
   simple two-biological-parent families, families with complex-sibling
   (half or stepsiblings) arrangements, and complex-parent (stepparent,
   single-parent) families. Using the Survey of Income and Program
   Participation (SIPP), we provide a descriptive profile of changes in
   children's living arrangements over a 13-year span (1996-2009). SIPP
   sample sizes are sufficiently large to permit an evaluation of changes
   in the distribution of children in various (married, cohabiting, and
   single-parent) simple and complex families according to race/ethnicity
   and parental education. The article concludes by showing that we have
   reached a plateau in family complexity and that complexity is
   concentrated among the most disadvantaged families.},

Abstract = {How did the state protect and then subvert men's household authority
   when the state was exclusively staffed by men? I answer the above
   question by critically fusing neo-Weberian scholarship on modern state
   development with feminist political sociology on gender and the state,
   and by examining establishment of the French conscription system. When
   first creating a mass army in the nineteenth century, the French state
   offered family-based exemptions, balancing between expanding state power
   and maintenance of men's household authority. However, intensification
   of twentieth-century total war led to a decrease in family-based
   exemptions, and the state's diminished support of men's household
   authority. I thereby identify how the fiscal-military state first
   supported then diminished men's household authority through one of the
   state's most masculine arms.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to the literature on the mechanics of change in
   global economic governance. By synthesising an empirically driven case
   study with conceptual insights from the existing literature, I highlight
   three intervening variables that enabled the Legislative Mandates passed
   by the US Congress in 2009 on the use of social-spending targets
   (education and health expenditure ring fences) in IMF concessional
   lending to be rapidly translated into operational change. The
   intervening variables that stood between US domestic action and rapid
   operational change are: first, the existence of effective enforcement
   mechanisms to ensure compliance from the US Executive Director with the
   Mandate; second, preference congruence between other primary principals
   and the content of the Mandate, and; third, the existence of effective
   enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance from IMF staff with the
   principals' collectively-sanctioned goal. The outcome observed - the
   near universal incorporation of social-spending targets into
   concessional lending arrangements - adds credence to calls for further
   empirical work to assess the extent of a post-Washington Consensus
   transition at the IMF.},

Abstract = {Since 2001, the European Union has put in place a comprehensive internal
   and external framework for protecting classified information. This
   framework has brought into existence EU classified information and
   defines accepted common principles and standards across EU institutions,
   agencies and Member States for protecting it. It has been established to
   enable the EU to achieve its external and internal policy objectives and
   further its interests. This article argues that recent criticism of the
   EU's regulatory approach in the literature and the press is exaggerated.
   It explains why the EU has avoided a `pillar'-based legislative approach
   to regulating classified information based on policy domains, and forged
   a broad degree of convergence across EU institutions and Member States
   on a pragmatic approach largely based on internal rules. This has
   allowed the EU to emerge as a credible and capable security actor in the
   eyes of Member States and international partners.},

   prospects of registered apprenticeship training for raising productivity
   in the long-term care (LTC) industry, a high-demand, low-wage field that

   registered apprenticeship programs and analysis of administrative data
   suggest that apprenticeship training improved productivity, client

   clear whether cost savings were sufficient to offset low Medicare and

Abstract = {The proclamation of the Charter for Fundamental Rights of the European
   Union, in December 2000 at Nice, France, followed by its inclusion
   within the failed Constitutional Treaty and its current status as a
   legally binding document under the Treaty of Lisbon, charts the changing
   fortunes of European Union politics dealing with fundamental rights
   protection. This article outlines the main rationales and hopes behind
   the enactment of the Charter and notes that through the process of
   political conditionality it may have been devalued from its very
   conception. The article suggests that, following their accession,
   Poland, and later the Czech Republic, used the Charter and Lisbon Treaty
   negotiations, including their opt-outs from the Charter, to engage in a
   game of power politics that had both domestic and European undertones.
   This politics of power game-play reflected a need by both states, and
   Poland in particular, to respond to both the political conditionality
   that they had been required to sign up to as part of the accession
   process and to emphasise how membership had improved their negotiating
   power. The article suggests that the consequence of this action by both
   states has not only further devalued the Charter but potentially
   undermined the rights of Polish and Czech citizens.},

Abstract = {The global intellectual property (IP) regime is in the midst of a
   paradigm shift in favour of greater access to protected work. Current
   explanations of this paradigm shift emphasize the agency of
   transnational advocacy networks, but ignore the role of academics.
   Scholars interested in global IP politics have failed to engage in
   reflexive thinking. Building on the results from a survey of 1679 IP
   experts, this article argues that a community of academics successfully
   broke the policy monopoly of practitioners over IP expertise. They
   instilled some scepticism concerning the social and economic impacts of
   IP among their students as well as in the broader community of IP
   experts. They also provided expert knowledge that was widely amplified
   by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and some intergovernmental
   organizations, acting as echo chambers to reach national decision
   makers. By making these claims, this article illustrates how epistemic
   communities actively collaborate with other transnational networks,
   rather than competing with them, and how they can promote a paradigm
   change by generating, rather than reducing, uncertainty.},

Title = {Assembling an experimentalist regime: Transnational governance
   interactions in the forest sector},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {22-48},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Transnational governance initiatives increasingly face the problem of
   regime complexity in which a proliferation of regulatory schemes operate
   in the same policy domain, supported by varying combinations of public
   and private actors. The literature suggests that such regime complexity
   can lead to forum shopping and other self-interested strategies, which
   undermine the effectiveness of transnational regulation. Based on the
   design principles of experimentalist governance, this paper identifies a
   variety of pathways and mechanisms, which promote productive
   interactions in regime complexes. We use the case of the EU's Forest Law
   Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) initiative, interacting with
   private certification schemes and public legal timber regulations,
   including those of third countries such as the US and China, to
   demonstrate how an increasingly comprehensive transnational regime can
   be assembled by linking together distinct components of a regime
   complex. We argue that it is the experimentalist features of this
   initiative and its regulatory interactions, which accommodate local
   diversity and foster recursive learning from decentralized
   implementation experience, that make it possible to build up a flexible
   and adaptive transnational governance regime from an assemblage of
   interconnected pieces, even in situations where interests diverge and no
   hegemon can impose its own will.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {99-120},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Inspired by forensic exhumations that have occurred in the context of
   transitional justice processes elsewhere, Spanish civil society
   associations since 2000 have helped relatives of the disappeared locate,
   exhume and honor those who were killed in the Spanish Civil War and the
   ensuing Francisco Franco dictatorship. In the process, they have
   creatively adopted, applied and reinterpreted practices originally
   developed for state-led democratic transitions to civil society
   initiatives. In this article, I explore the ways transitional justice
   concepts take on a social life beyond their juridical applications. In
   so doing, I take these exhumations as an opportunity to examine some of
   the tensions between the bureaucratic state-led models of transitional
   justice that inspired Spanish activists and the civil society
   reinterpretations that mark forensic practice in contemporary Spain. The
   practice of Spanish organizations offers new avenues for understanding
   and ameliorating the tense relationship between the bureaucratic and
   legal needs of forensic exhumations and the desires and expectations of
   victims.(2)},

Abstract = {The cohort of young people born between the early 1980s and early 1990s
   consitute a demographic bulge in the South African population. The sheer
   size of this cohort renders it especially important in terms of the
   changing political, economic, and social life of the country. The cohort
   grew up for the most part after apartheid had ended, entered the labor
   market at a time of high unemployment, is having children as marriage is
   in decline, and reached voting age just as the African National
   Congress's (ANC's) moral stature began to decline. All these factors
   might be expected to result in distinctive disaffection and a propensity
   for dissent. In terms of their attitudes and behavior, however, this
   cohort looks much like older (or immediately preceding) cohorts of South
   Africans. Where this cohort is likely to leave its mark is in
   entrenching some of the social, economic, and political changes that,
   until recently, might have appeared transient.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how hybrid regimes supply governance by
   examining a series of dilemmas (involving elections, the mass media, and
   state institutions) that their rulers face. The authors demonstrate how
   regime responses to these dilemmas - typically efforts to maintain
   control while avoiding outright repression and societal backlash - have
   negative outcomes, including a weakening of formal institutions,
   proliferation of substitutions (e.g., substitutes for institutions), and
   increasing centralization and personalization of control. Efforts by
   Russian leaders to disengage society from the sphere of decision-making
   entail a significant risk of systemic breakdown in unexpected ways. More
   specifically, given significantly weakened institutions for interest
   representation and negotiated compromise, policy-making in the Russian
   system often amounts to the leadership's best guess (ad hoc manual
   policy adjustments) as to precisely what society will accept and what it
   will not, with a significant possibility of miscalculation. Three case
   studies of the policy-making process are presented: the 2005
   cash-for-benefits reform, plans for the development of the Khimki
   Forest, and changes leading up to and following major public protests in
   2011-2012.},

Abstract = {The passing of the Russian NGO Law in mid-2006 set clear parameters for
   Russian NGO activity and civil society development. In this paper we
   assess the impact of the NGO Law on both NGOs and Russian civil society.
   Our findings illustrate that the NGO Law has led to a reduction in NGO
   activity and curtailment of civil society development. We conclude that
   Russian civil society appears to be dominated by groups funded and thus
   controlled by the state. This has implications for Russia's on-going
   democratic development.},

Series = {Advances in Electronic Government Digital Divide and Regional

Year = {2014},
Pages = {121-130},
Abstract = {Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are an absolute necessity in India as
   all levels of the government in the country (i.e., federal, state, and
   local) are facing budgetary deficits. PPPs in various spheres of
   economic activity can bridge the gap between the capacity of the state
   to grow and the factors which are pulling it behind. In a successful PPP
   model, all the stakeholders (i.e., the government, the people, and the
   private partners) pose a disciplinary mechanism to each other. The
   present chapter seeks to study the policy for PPPs in the Indian state
   of Punjab as also the institutional framework for the same. It also
   seeks to examine the feasibility of using PPP model for the much-needed
   development of the agriculture sector in the state. The fiscal situation
   of the state and its indebtedness along with the populist policies of
   the government do not leave any room for either the maintenance or the
   creation of any new infrastructure in the state. Both rural and urban
   infrastructure in Punjab can be strengthened through the PPP route. The
   chapter focuses on the problems of Punjab economy and the role of PPPs
   in fixing the same.},

Abstract = {Although a wide body of research examines whether gender influences
   judicial decisions, past studies do not analyze whether a critical mass
   of female judges affects the voting behavior of the US court of appeals.
   To address this gap in the existing literature, I examine whether a
   critical mass of female judges influences the voting decisions of court
   of appeals judges in civil rights and economic activity cases. Providing
   support for critical mass theory, I find that female judges are more
   likely to vote liberally in civil rights and economic activity cases
   when there is a critical mass of female judges.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the divergent developmental outcomes among
   postwar South Korea, Taiwan, and South Vietnam. While U.S. aid has
   correctly been identified as a key factor in the rapid postwar
   development of South Korea and Taiwan, the failure of aid to establish
   strong institutions in South Vietnam calls for a closer analysis of how
   different historical and geopolitical factors explain the greater
   political stability and institutional capacity of South Korea and
   Taiwan. In particular, the legacies of Japanese colonialism are seen as
   having played a key role in establishing the strong developmental states
   of South Korea and Taiwan, while the postcolonial South Vietnamese state
   was more fragile. As such, there was greater political resistance to
   land reform in the latter, and large amounts of U.S. economic and
   military aid were unable to quell domestic insurgency and establish the
   basis for economic development.},

Abstract = {LGBTQ-themed exhibitions mounted by some of Toronto's key art
   institutions in conjunction with World Pride 2014 offered a significant
   opportunity to think about what (if anything specific) it is that we
   want or expect LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer) art to
   communicate directly about human community, human diversity and human
   dignity in the twenty-first century. In critiquing some of the work on
   display in these exhibitions, this practice note suggests a need for
   more LGBTQ-themed art that does full justice to formative individual
   experience but also moves outward from a preoccupation with self to
   remind spectators of worlds elsewhere. The work of South African
   photographer, Zanele Muholi, and of Moroccan novelist and film-maker,
   Abdellah Taia, suggest fresh possibilities for a less parochial approach
   to exploring LGBTQ identities through various forms of cultural
   production.},

Abstract = {Elections for all 83 Russian governors were reinstated in Russia in
   2012, seven years after they had been suspended. The democratic reform
   coincided with renewed political activism in Russia since December 2011,
   but the reform was as much a belated recognition of the shortcomings and
   failures from appointing Russian governors. Pragmatic necessity and not
   democratic conversion was the determining factor. Based on the first
   elections in October 2012, the reform will have only a limited effect
   over the next few years on democratic change in Russia, at most
   placating liberal and regional demands while consolidating personal rule
   under Putin.},

Abstract = {In addition to participating in hostilities, girl soldiers are often
   raped, sexually enslaved and used as ``bush wives{''} by their
   commanders and fellow soldiers. As this issue of sexual violence against
   girl soldiers has become increasingly visible in recent cases before the
   International Criminal Court (ICC) and Special Court for Sierra Leone
   (SCSL), attempts have been made to prosecute this conduct within the
   established framework of international criminal law. Most recently, this
   issue has been addressed in the case of The Prosecutor v Bosco Ntaganda,
   one of the six cases that have come before the ICC from the situation in
   the Democratic Republic of Congo. On 9 June 2014, the Pre-Trial Chamber
   confirmed the charges in the Ntaganda case, and found that the rape and
   sexual slavery of girl soldiers in Ntaganda's armed group by other
   members of that group could constitute war crimes under Article
   8(2)(e)(vi) of the Rome Statute. This article considers what the
   Ntaganda decision adds to the jurisprudence on sexual violence against
   child soldiers, and what it demonstrates about the limits of the law.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on California's efforts to improve the alignment
   between K-12 and postsecondary schooling through the Early Assessment
   Program (EAP). Implemented in 2004, the EAP was designed to give high
   school students information about their academic preparedness for
   postsecondary education and to encourage teachers to teach for college
   readiness. I describe the EAP and its evolution and presence at
   California's community colleges. I then match EAP and other test score
   data for California high school juniors to administrative data from
   California community colleges to investigate the extent to which high
   school student participation in the EAP predicts their college course
   placement and influences their academic performance. I find that very
   few students enter the California community college system ready for
   college-level work based on the EAP exam, but that the EAP can better
   serve community college campuses in their efforts to place students in
   developmental coursework.},

Title = {Post-socialist housing meets transnational finance: Foreign banks,

   Estonia},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {21},

Abstract = {This paper asks how public policies have shaped the build-up of
   crisis-prone housing finance markets and whether they have mitigated or
   reinforced the associated risks for citizens in East Central Europe.
   Analyzing the mortgage lending booms and busts in Hungary and Estonia,
   the paper finds that different policy priorities did not matter too much
   for the build-up of the mortgage boom and the associated risks
   households had to face. Rather, early decisions for encompassing house
   privatization and the non-existence of mortgage markets have led to a
   pent-up demand for housing finance, while the transnationalization and
   EU convergence of the financial sector have provided the supply for
   mortgage lending from the early 2000s on. Policy-makers in both
   countries, albeit to different degrees, have supported the mortgage boom
   and have by-and-large failed to correct for the risks of their
   population. In the wake of the global financial crisis, however,
   policies started to sharply diverge. While the Estonian government has
   relied on market mechanisms and private market actors to cope with the
   crisis, the Hungarian government engaged in far-reaching interventionist
   policies to unmake some of its devastating consequences for indebted
   house-owners. The paper explains its findings by the combination of
   different welfare state traditions and patterns of party competition.},

Title = {From Merlin to Oz: The strange case of failed lending targets in the UK},

Abstract = {As a response to the crisis in the British banking system and reduced
   lending, the British government established Project Merlin, a series of
   lending targets aimed at boosting lending to the British economy, and
   small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular. Given the
   economic importance of the targets, however, this paper questions why
   the Merlin agreements were so ineffective. Three explanations are given:
   first, in light of the challenges in accessing wholesale funding for the
   largest UK-owned banks, there was a lack of capacity and incentive to
   lend more; second, the lack of decisive intervention by the British
   state to compel banks to lend was also a determinant; third, though, I
   argue that boosting actual lending figures was not the primary aim of
   Project Merlin. Instead, the targets were performative, rather than
   substantive. I argue that these three explanations have important
   implications for the varieties of capitalism (VoC) debate and the
   economic and political economic literature on foreign versus domestic
   bank ownership. To the first literature, the article explains the degree
   to which politics underpins the structure of even the UK's purportedly
   liberal market economy (LME), whilst to the second, it explores the
   limitations to political control over even domestically-owned banks.},

Abstract = {For fifteen years, in the north of the state of Israel, a women's
   organization existed in which Israeli Jewish and Israeli Palestinian
   women activists worked together for peace and justice in a careful and
   challenging dialogue across difference. ``Bat Shalom of the North{''}
   was the subject of research by the author in 1996. In this article she
   reports on her return in 2012 to re-interview former members. Applying
   the feminist concept of ``transversal politics{''} she analyzes the
   organization's trajectory, radicalization and eventual closure in the
   context of a failed peace process and increasing violence in the region.
   Their perspective on Israel's oppression of its Palestinian minority led
   the surviving members of Bat Shalom of the North in its final days to
   envision not a ``two-state solution{''} to the Israel Palestine conflict
   but a single, inclusive, multicultural and democratic country, in which
   subject identities are built not on a feeling of belonging to land,
   language or religion but on shared adhesion to human and democratic
   rights.},

Title = {Finding Your Feet in the Field: Critical Reflections of Early Career
   Researchers on Field Research in Transitional Societies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {223-237},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Fieldwork that takes place in conflict or transitional regions is
   becoming increasingly popular amongst early-career and more seasoned
   researchers, but is an area that retains an air of mystery and remains
   an exotic form of knowledge gathering. There exists a paucity of
   personal reflection on the challenges associated with conducting
   fieldwork in conflicted or transitional regions and a limited amount of
   insight into the practical steps taken in advance of and when immersed
   in the field. Such reticence to share honest fieldwork experiences,
   particularly the more challenging research that takes place in conflict
   or transitional settings, plays a part in creating a culture of silence.
   This paper attempts to counteract this silence by drawing on the
   challenges experienced by two early career researchers conducting
   fieldwork in Uganda and Palestine, focusing on the practical steps taken
   in advance of entering the field, and the challenges faced whilst
   engaged in fieldwork. Specific challenges are highlighted throughout,
   including physical access to areas in conflict, engaging with reluctant
   research participants, the emotional impact of fieldwork on the
   researcher, maintaining confidentiality, researching with vulnerable
   victims, and ensuring appropriate knowledge exchange between researchers
   and participants. The paper concludes by emphasising the requirement for
   greater reflection on the inherently personal challenges associated with
   conducting fieldwork in conflicted or transitional settings and
   highlights the view that fieldwork is a privileged position that carries
   great responsibilities which must be upheld to ensure the sustainability
   of future research. This paper hopes to contribute to the wider debate
   on conducting fieldwork and the challenges associated with working in
   conflicted or transitional regions.},

Title = {Seeking Romance in the Crosshairs of Multiple-Partner Fertility:
   Ethnographic Insights on Low-Income Urban and Rural Mothers},
Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {654},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Using longitudinal ethnographic data on low-income rural and urban
   mostly single mothers, I explore the romance-seeking behaviors of women
   whose intimate relationships are characterized by multiple-partner
   fertility (MPF). MPF involves mothers and/or their love interests having
   biological children with other partners, frequently in nonmarital,
   transient unions. Romance comprises mothers' feelings and social
   interactions related to being chosen, erotic love, and adulation of the
   other. Findings indicate most mothers selectively engaged in one of four
   types of romance-seeking behaviors: casual, illusionist, pragmatic, or
   strategic. Mothers' romantic actions are associated with their desires
   to have loving experiences outside the challenges of daily life in
   poverty and its corollary uncertainty. Moreover, mothers involved in the
   most complex forms of MPF openly compete with other women for ``first
   wife{''} status in a stratified partnering system called rostering-a
   term coined by respondents in the ethnographies reported here.
   Implications of these findings for future research are discussed.},

Abstract = {U.S. children today have increasingly diverse living arrangements. In
   2012, 10 percent of children lived with at least one grandparent; 8
   percent lived in three-generational households, consisting of a parent
   and a grandparent; while 2 percent lived with a grandparent and no
   parent in the household. This article reviews the literature on
   grandparent coresidence and presents new research on children coresiding
   with grandparents in modern families. Findings suggest that grandparent
   coresidence is quite common and that its prevalence increased during the
   Great Recession. Additionally, these living arrangements are diverse
   themselves, varying by the marital status of the parent, the home in
   which the family lives, and the economic well-being of the family.
   Suggestions for future research are also proposed.},

Abstract = {Human bodies have assumed centre stage in modern warfare, and few armed
   conflicts epitomize this more than the war in northern Uganda, where
   both rebel groups and government forces violated bodily integrity and
   altered human tissue to communicate messages, humiliate the enemy and
   their support base, and dominate both people and territory. The injuries
   and disabilities inflicted during wartime continue to affect people long
   after the conflict has come to an end. People whose bodies were `marked'
   continue to embody the war in everyday activities in terms of pain,
   disabilities and loss of mobility. In other words, the war continues in
   their bodies. Most marked bodies struggle to conform gender performances
   to expectations. Furthermore, a decline in the productivity of people
   with marked bodies and failure to reciprocate mutual beneficial
   interaction leads to ruptures within social capital networks, resulting
   in widespread stigmatization and discrimination. Yet, focus on the body
   seems to be largely missing in peace processes and transitional justice.
   In the aftermath of armed conflict, where so many bodies have been
   marked, disability mainstreaming should become a quintessential element
   in transitional justice. This goes beyond medical interventions, meaning
   that in all transitional justice thinking and practice, attention is
   paid to how marked bodies can be included, participate and benefit. To
   ensure inclusion of marked bodies and other victim groups, more
   micro-analysis is needed that distinguishes survivor groups in terms of
   their day-to-day survival concerns, challenges, experiences, needs and
   aspirations.},

Abstract = {Asia is known as a continent where human trafficking is particularly
   prevalent. Departing from the bulk of research on trafficking in Asia
   that focuses on illegal migration and prostitution, this article
   examines the embeddedness of human trafficking in legal temporary
   migration flows. This analysis uses survey and interview data to
   document the experiences of Vietnamese migrants who worked in East Asian
   countries. It identifies a continuum of trafficking, abuse,
   exploitation, and forced labor, and examines how exploitation begins at
   the recruitment stage with the creation of bonded labor. Guest-worker
   programs in destination countries put migrants in particularly
   precarious situations, which do, in some cases, qualify as trafficking.
   I argue that temporary migration programs may create the conditions that
   lead to extreme forms of exploitation among many legal migrant workers
   in the region.},

Abstract = {In its assessment of the origins and early development of the World
   Social Forum this article challenges traditional understandings of the
   Forum as representing `globalisation from below'. By tracing the
   intricate relations among elements of business, civil society and the
   Workers' Party in the first years of the Forum, this article reveals the
   major role played by a corporate movement stemming from the Brazilian
   democratisation process in the 1980s, and how this combined with the
   transformed agenda of the Workers' Party as it gained higher political
   offices to constrain the Forum's activities from the outset. In so
   doing, this article challenges not only widespread conceptions of the
   Forum as a counter-hegemonic alternative but also current critiques
   concerning its subsequent limitations. Furthermore, it reveals how
   traditional understandings of the World Social Forum and of global civil
   society are underpinned by flawed assumptions which typecast political
   activities in the global `South'.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-28},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The dominant approach to studying the effects of IMF programs has
   emphasized moral hazard, but we find that adverse selection has more
   impressive effects. We propose a novel strategic selection model to
   study the growth effects of IMF programs, which allows for the
   possibility of adverse selection. We find that adverse selection occurs:
   the countries that are most interested in participating in IMF programs
   are the least likely to have favorable growth outcomes. Controlling for
   this selection effect, we find that countries benefit from IMF programs
   on average in terms of higher growth rates, but that some countries
   benefit from participation, while others are harmed. Moral hazard
   predicts that long-term users of Fund resources benefit least from
   participating in programs, while adverse selection predicts the
   opposite. Contrary to previous findings, we find that IMF programs have
   more successful growth performance among long-term users than among
   short-term users.},

Abstract = {This paper outlines the contours of a new research agenda for the
   analysis of food price crises. By weaving together a detailed
   quantitative examination of changes in corporate profit shares with a
   qualitative appraisal of the restructuring in business control over the
   organisation of society and nature, the paper points to the rapid
   ascendance of a new power configuration in the global political economy
   of food: the Agro-Trader nexus. The agribusiness and grain trader firms
   that belong to the Agro-Trader nexus have not been mere `price takers',
   instead they have actively contributed to the inflationary restructuring
   of the world food system by championing and facilitating the rapid
   expansion of the first-generation biofuels sector. As a key driver of
   agricultural commodity price rises, the biofuels boom has raised the
   Agro-Trader nexus's differential profits and it has at the same time
   deepened global hunger. These findings suggest that food price inflation
   is a mechanism of redistribution.},

Abstract = {During the process of visa liberalisation Serbia made significant and
   unexpected adjustments in its Kosovo policy, which demonstrate the
   European Union's leverage. Serbia's compliance on Kosovo cannot be
   explained either by rational institutionalism, which accounts for
   domestic change based on cost-benefit calculations, or sociological
   institutionalism, which predicts domestic adaptation based on
   convergence of norms and identities. Applying discursive
   institutionalism, this empirical study of Serbia's Europeanisation
   identifies discursive denial as a strategy of the Serbian elite in
   pursuing costly policy implementation. It contributes a novel
   perspective on shallow' Europeanisation by highlighting a lack of
   discursive reinforcement of adopted rules.},

Title = {Explaining governance in global value chains: A modular theory-building
   effort},

Abstract = {In this article, we review the evolution and current status of global
   value chain (GVC) governance theory and take some initial steps toward a
   broader theory of governance through an exercise in `modular
   theory-building'. We focus on two GVC governance theories to which we
   previously contributed: a theory of linking and a theory of conventions.
   The modular framework we propose is built on three scalar dimensions:
   (1) a micro level - determinants and dynamics of exchange at individual
   value chain nodes; (2) a meso level- how and to what extent these
   linkage characteristics `travel' upstream and downstream in the value
   chain; and (3) a macro level - looking at `overall' GVC governance.
   Given space limitations, we focus only on the issue of `polarity' in
   governance at the macro level, distinguishing between unipolar, bipolar
   and multipolar governance forms. While we leave a more ambitious
   analysis of how overall GVC governance is mutually constituted by
   micro/meso factors and broader institutional, regulatory and societal
   processes to future work, we provide an initial framework to which this
   work could be linked. Our ultimate purpose is to spur future efforts
   that seek to use and refine additional theories, to connect theories
   together better or in different modular configurations, and to
   incorporate elements at the macro level that reflect the changing
   constellation of key actors in GVC governance- the increasing influence
   of, for example, NGOs, taste and standard makers, and social movements
   in GVC governance.},

Abstract = {We analyze judicial policy lines concerning the punishment of
   environmental crime using a unique European dataset of individual
   criminal cases, including case-specific information on offenses and
   offenders. We investigate policy choices made by lower criminal courts,
   as well as their follow-up by the relevant court of appeal. The
   sanctioning policy of the courts has proven to be varied as well as
   consistent. Judges carefully balance effective and suspended penalties,
   most often using them cumulatively, but in specific cases opting to use
   them as substitutes. Overall, both judges in lower and appeal courts
   balance environmental law and classic criminal law and aim at protecting

Abstract = {Both Bosnia in 1995 and Northern Ireland in 1998 were extremely fragile
   in the immediate aftermath of brokered peace negotiations. Each
   instituted a form of consociationalisma government that
   institutionalizes a voice for each ethnic groupas an element of brokered
   peace. In this article, I examine Bosnian postwar governance with
   comparative insights from Northern Ireland. Bosnia was the recipient of
   a large amount of international aid. While this aid was crucial to the
   initial state-building effort, the problems Bosnia now faces are due to
   its consociational governance structure. Some of the group-based aspects
   of consociationalism are in tension with individual rights, a problem
   that cannot be addressed by aid alone.},

Abstract = {This article develops the hypothesis that participation in American
   politics of minority women differs from political participation of white
   women. I propose that individuals with multiple subordinate group
   identities, namely, racial and ethnic minority women, will experience
   differences in political mobilization and interest in politics and
   demonstrate different participatory styles than white women do. On the
   basis of their identity in racial/ethnic identity groups, minority women
   operate as both racial/ethnic minorities and women in the American
   polity. As such, the analysis models intersectionality to account for
   historical narratives, cultural representations, and legal
   discrimination to show how both race/ethnicity and gender operate in
   tandem to influence how minority women participate in American politics.},

Abstract = {The article assesses the state of political participation in Central and
   East European post-communist democracies. Incorporating the most recent
   data, it compares the emerging trends in political participation to
   those observed in the established democracies of Western Europe. The
   findings reveal that post-communist citizens participate substantially
   less than their Western counterparts, and, contrary to some
   expectations, no convergence has been taking place. This is due to a
   host of factors, the importance of which seems to vary according to the
   type of political activity. It is subsequently shown that while
   political participation is lower than in Western Europe, it is not
   markedly more biased. The poor state of political participation
   therefore does not appear to seriously undermine the quality of the
   post-communist democratic process.},

Abstract = {This article explores energy security and integration within the
   European Union (EU) in the case of natural gas. It theorizes the
   underlying institutional dynamics of integration by drawing upon the
   English School as to how more deep-seated informal institutions
   condition policy-making by EU institutions and Member States as well as
   the operations of transnational actors such as energy companies. The
   informal institution of sovereignty constrains the push of the market
   institution towards a convergent type of integration. Together with the
   bilateral energy diplomacy and great power management institutions,
   sovereignty also limits integration in the external gas trade. Internal
   integration overall remains dependent on the wider European context as
   is also seen in the functioning of the environmental stewardship
   institution. The ambiguities among actors occasioned by the
   implementation of the Third Energy Package suggest a further integration
   need, but that is constrained by several further driving forces.},

Abstract = {The standard narrative of Russia's ``authoritarian backsliding{''} fails
   to grapple with the tremendous variation in subnational politics that
   emerged over the past two decades. This article offers a case study of
   the industrial city of Volzhskiy, which, although once a stalwart
   supporter of the Communist Party (KPRF), has evolved into a highly
   pluralistic system with democratic municipal institutions. Drawing upon
   analysis of local publications, protest data, and interviews with local
   politicians, this article traces the interplay of formal institutions
   and informal political processes in Volzhskiy's local-level transition
   to democracy. Volzhskiy's pluralism and local democratic outcome can
   largely be explained by (1) the emergence of a more diverse set of
   economic and political interests and constituencies, and (2) a KPRF
   organization that was strong and provided robust competition that
   created the conditions for cooperation among the competitors to form
   fair and open local political institutions, which fostered the city's
   pluralism.},
