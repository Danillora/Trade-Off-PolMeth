Booktitle = {AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM REVISITED: US POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT IN
   COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE},
Year = {2015},
Pages = {45-110},
Abstract = {In order to clarify the changing relationship between president and
   Congress, we need to account for the changing involvement over time by
   the political parties. Accordingly, these themes are here intermingled
   in an exploration of political development from the country's founding
   up to the present. Besides recounting an informative tale, this overview
   reveals what factors have set the stage for the shifting power
   equilibrium that has emerged. I then compare the situation in the United
   States with that in presidential Latin America and in parliamentary
   Europe. I find that the division of essential power resources between
   the executive and the legislative branches is indeed peculiar to the
   United States. Furthermore, the nature of the party system impacts on
   this balance. In the end, hence, the foundation of the special US party
   system becomes an object of analysis.},

Title = {Genocide Prevention and Western National Security: The Limitations of
   Making R2P All About Us},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Number = {4, 2, SI},
Pages = {12-25},
Abstract = {The case for turning R2P and genocide prevention from principle to
   practice usually rests on the invocation of moral norms and duties to
   others. Calls have been made by some analysts to abandon this strategy
   and ``sell{''} genocide prevention to government by framing it as a
   matter of our own national interest including our security. Governments'
   failure to prevent atrocities abroad, it is argued, imperils western
   societies at home. If we look at how the genocide prevention-as-national
   security argument has been made we can see, however, that this position
   is not entirely convincing. I review two policy reports that make the
   case for genocide prevention based in part on national security
   considerations: Preventing Genocide: A Blue Print for U.S. Policymakers
   (Albright-Cohen Report); and the Will to Intervene Project. I show that
   both reports are problematic for two reasons: the ``widened{''}
   traditional security argument advocated by the authors is not fully
   substantiated by the evidence provided in the reports; and alternate
   conceptions of security that would seem to support the linking of
   genocide prevention to western security-securitization and risk and
   uncertain-do not provide a solid logical foundation for operationalizing
   R2P. I conclude by considering whether we might appeal instead to
   another form of self interest, ``reputational stakes{''}, tied to
   western states' construction of their own identity as responsible
   members of the international community.},

Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},

Pages = {111-134},
Abstract = {This article evaluates the challenges that militate against the full
   engagement of New African Pentecostalism (NAP) in the process of social
   cohesion in South Africa. It argues that this new religious phenomenon
   in South Africa has been preoccupied with the promotion of internal
   social cohesion within its ecclesiastical boundaries to the neglect of
   national social cohesion. Employing the notion of `religious
   cosmopolitanism' (Cahill 2003) as theoretical underpinning, the article
   proposes a new concept termed Pentecopolitanism, as an ethical frame for
   New African Pentecostal engagement in democratisation and social
   cohesion in South Africa. The notion of Pentecopolitanism is envisaged
   to function as an antidote against sectarianism and fundamentalism
   within NAP and a framework for its constructive engagement with
   pluralism in the current South African search for national social
   cohesion. Pentecopolitanism is a philosophy which arises out of the need
   for recognition of the social function of religion, so as to enable
   human beings to discover their humanity through the humanity of others.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {50},

Abstract = {Following conventional models of coalition formation, parties should
   prefer coalitions that have a parliamentary majority, preferably with
   few parties that are very similar in ideological terms. However,
   empirically, we observe astonishing systematic deviations from this
   prediction. In some countries, coalition formation can hardly be
   explained on the basis of the rational-choice paradigm. An example of
   this is the Dutch system of consociational democracy where we observe a
   prominent role of parties that represent the social pillars. In this
   article, we analyze coalition formation in the Dutch provinces over the
   last 20 years and supplement established theories of coalition formation
   by a consociational democratic perspective. In accordance with this
   perspective, we find that more inclusive coalitions as well as
   coalitions that include the three pillar parties are indeed more likely
   to be formed. However, we detect considerable temporal variation.
   Coalition formation in the Dutch provinces can increasingly be explained
   with the help of conventional models, whereas norm-based deviations are
   less common than in the past. We attempt a pragmatist interpretation of
   this change. More generally, we join a recent move in the literature
   showing how more fine-tuned explanations can lead to a more complete
   picture of coalition formation.},

Title = {THE 2012-2014 PARTY REFORM AND THE STRUCTURE OF THE ELECTORAL DIVIDES IN
   RUSSIA'S REGIONS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2015},

Abstract = {The article analyses the results of elections to regional assemblies by
   the proportional system in Russia in 2012-2014 from the point of view of
   the concept of electoral and political cleavages, which author has
   developed in his previous works. The author proposes methods for solving
   problems which appear because of not-coinciding number of contestants in
   various regions - this generates a different structure of electoral and
   political cleavages in there. The author also traces how the `party
   reform' of 2012-14 has influenced the cleavage structure in Russian
   regions. He concludes that proponents of the reform reached their aim if
   they wanted to confuse voters, because the increasing number of
   contestants multiplied political dimensions and, as a consequence,
   increased a number of electoral cleavages. Higher level of political
   competition in some regions was conditioned not by the appearance of new
   actors but by weakening of the administrative pressure on voters. Author
   also argues that stricter requirements for contestants in 2014 have led
   to decreasing number of electoral and, especially, political cleavages,

Abstract = {Despite the fact that China has historically symbolized an
   ``Oriental{''} pattern of power-property relations, with everything in
   the country belonging to a sovereign ruler, this has been changing over
   the last 35 years. Steadily and voluntarily the state is ceding control
   of property to different social groups. This process entails several
   problems: legal vacuum engenders rent-oriented behavior of bureaucracy,
   reforms often turn out to be half-way and cannot solve a problem.
   Nevertheless, the process seems to be irreversible and likely to foster
   political and social changes in China in the near future.},

Abstract = {The article attempts to identify and explain the changes and continuity
   in the implementation of the neoliberal policy in Putin's Russia. Bereft
   of the opportunity to consider the whole array of factors that determine
   the process of neoliberalization, I.Matveev focuses on the internal
   springs of the changing economic and social policies such as the
   dynamics of state building and transformation of the dominant forms of
   the regime legitimacy. In the first part of the article he shows how the
   weakening of the state under Boris Yeltsin and then its
   ``strengthening{''} under Vladimir Putin influence the process of
   privatization and (re)nationalization; in the second part of the article
   the author demonstrates how the wide plebiscite legitimacy of Putin was
   combined with the acceleration of neo-liberal reforms in the social
   sphere. According to his conclusion, despite the increasingly more
   active state intervention into the economy, in the modern Russia it is
   not so much about the failure of neoliberal policies, but rather about
   the specific local version of ``real neo-liberalism.{''}},

Abstract = {This paper examines the impact of interactions with welfare institutions
   on the political participation of long-term unemployed youth in two
   cities. We assess the role of resource redistribution and of political
   learning on engagement in protest activities. We use a unique dataset of
   long-term unemployed youth to predict the probability that long-term
   unemployed youth participate in protest activities and become
   politically alienated as a result of their interactions with the state.
   Our study suggests that the impact of staid aid on political
   participation comes from providing services through the unemployment
   office and the social aid office rather than from direct payments.
   However, we do not find strong evidence revealing a process of political
   learning, as political alienation does not seem to mediate the effect of
   interactions with the state on protest. The most important finding of
   our study is that the connection between welfare institutions and
   political learning is context-dependent. We find a differential effect
   of interactions with the unemployment office and with the social aid
   office across cities.},

Pages = {14-27},
Abstract = {The study of political communication in Canada's provinces suffers from
   an absence of pan-Canadian information. This descriptive article bridges
   the gap by documenting some observable trends. It submits that negative
   advertising is more intense in larger provinces than in smaller
   jurisdictions. Permanent campaigning is the new normal as electioneering
   ramps up in anticipation of a fixed date election. Provincial parties
   and citizens avail themselves of new technology by communicating with
   digital video, which is not subject to the same financial, technical,
   content or regulatory constraints as television. Similarities of
   political communication across Canada are noted, including copycatting
   of federal-level practices.},

   THE INSTALLATION OF AN ENERGETIC PROJECT: THE CASE OF THE RURAL
   COMMUNITY OF ANDAYMARCA, HUANCAVELICA},
Journal = {REVISTA ANDINA DE ESTUDIOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {72-85},
Abstract = {The aim of the present study is to show in an ethnographic way the
   reconfiguration process of communal political leadership in two
   simultaneous situations: the insertion of a megaproject of energetic
   nature and the crisis of politic representation of traditional
   authorities. Nowadays in Peru, the presence of megaprojects promoted
   through private inversions have caused changes in the internal political
   dynamics of the localities where they are inscribed. In our case, the
   effect that has provoked the entry of energetic project ``Cerro del
   Aguila's Hydroelectric Central{''} in the rural community of Andaymarca,
   Huancavelica, will be treated. This enterprise seems to be the second
   with more energetic production in a national level. The main result has
   been in the political area, through the incursion of a leadership kind
   that mobilizes its own resources (social capital, cultural and symbolic)
   and specifies it through a charismatic domination, with the objective of
   creating local bonds and using it in an strategic way in two directions:
   towards the negotiations with the energetic project and towards the
   collective mobilization to capture State, as the district local
   government. In this way, the objective resides in showing how the
   communal leadership is activated and redefined and its importance in the
   actual role of the local leaderships.},

Volume = {17},

Pages = {318-339},
Abstract = {Research on human rights treaties has mostly reached depressingly
   similar conclusions - that such treaties and their resulting
   institutions have little or no impact on human rights. The International
   Criminal Court, however, possesses significant power to investigate and
   prosecute violations of international law that equip it with potentially
   more influence than previous human rights regimes. I suggest, however,
   that the impact of the ICC on human rights is conditioned by signatory
   governments' commitment to good governance and acceptance of the role of
   the ICC in addressing violations of international law. I develop a
   two-stage model of ICC ratification and human rights abuse that shows
   that while many states have ratified the ICC Treaty, not all are
   committed to stopping the crimes under its jurisdiction. Rather, state
   commitment to human rights depends first on its commitment to the rule
   of law within its own borders. Second, commitment to human rights
   depends on states' willingness to grant the ICC the powers necessary to
   carry out its mission. Through a number of statistical tests, I find
   strong support for these hypotheses on states' human rights and
   propensity for violence.},

Abstract = {The subject of this critical review is a new monograph by Zhan
   Toshchenko ({''}Phantoms of Russian society.{''} Moscow: Center for
   Social Forecasting and Marketing. 2015. 668 p.), which continues a
   series of his publications analyzing the deformation of the mass
   consciousness of modern Russian society. The new study is an attempt to
   overcome inefficiency of a number of approaches used to analyze Russian
   society in transition. In this case, the original methodology has been
   used, resulting in reasonable criteria used to select existing in it
   phantom types: authority, capital, and glory, as well as
   socio-psychological characteristics of personality. Toshchenko displays
   the sources of deformations in the public consciousness of the Russian
   society, which occurred over the past three decades. In the opinion of
   the author, they are related to a serious trauma of the society and gave
   birth to its anomie. Today, widely spread are simulation processes that
   replace real activity in all its forms and at all levels of social
   organization. It is important that the author of the book explores not
   only the reasons of the mentioned deformations, but he makes an attempt
   to forecast the further developments. At the same time the monograph
   combines academic objectivity with journalistic presentation rich in
   metaphors and images.},

   2015 attacks in Paris and Borno},
Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {466-477},
Abstract = {Written news coverage of an event influences public perception and
   understanding of that event. Through agenda setting and news framing,
   journalists control the importance and substance of readers' beliefs
   about the event. While existing research has been conducted on the
   relationship between media coverage and the geographic location of the
   country an event took place in, there is limited understanding of this
   relationship in terms of terrorist events. Utilising an agenda-setting
   theory and news framing theory lens to compare news coverage of the
   January 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, France, and Borno, Nigeria
   revealed significant variances in the overall coverage, headline style
   and discourse usage based on the event. In particular, the American news
   coverage positively framed France through detailed, sympathetic coverage
   and negatively framed Nigeria by overgeneralising and placing blame.
   Determining the origin and impacts of these variances is integral to
   forming a more comprehensive understanding of international terrorism
   and the most effective ways to combat it.},

Abstract = {Human security has increasingly shifted attention to the individual,
   while the state has become guarantor (or violator) of security given its
   role in governing the domestic environment. This article examines how
   variations in regime forms influence security, pointing to the
   importance of political security in the wider human security framework.
   To illustrate, the article examines the nature of political security in
   Central America, a region with weakly democratized states and histories
   of political violence. The findings suggest a link between democracy and
   human security that is mediated by state capacity and the ability to
   control non-state violence against individuals.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of the hypothesis proposed by
   V.Gel'man, according to which the post-Soviet Russia should be viewed as
   an ``crucial case{''} of electoral authoritarianism that sheds light on
   the origins of the strength and weakness of this model in a comparative
   perspective. Having thoroughly analyzed Gel'man's arguments in the
   context of the Russian political history of the last two and a half
   decades, L.Polyakov failed to find convincing evidence of either this
   hypothesis or even justification of classifying the country's political
   regime into the category of ``electoral authoritarianism{''} per se. The
   research conducted by the author rather demonstrates the uniqueness of
   the Russian ``authoritarianism{''} and that the conventional methods of
   description within the modern Western comparative politics fail to
   capture its specificity.},

Abstract = {This study examines effects of political cynicism and efficacy on online
   political engagement of Sri Lankan undergraduates. A survey was
   conducted among 155 Sri Lankan undergraduates that support the views of
   the Inter-University Student Federation (IUSF), an evidently
   anti-government student movement that claims to be dedicated to
   protecting free education in the country. Initial analysis showed that
   respondents were highly cynical (mean: 4.49 on a 1 to 5 scale). The
   study hypothesized that both political cynicism and efficacy exert a
   positive impact on online political engagement of respondents. The study
   also tested the effects of two moderators (extent of Facebook use, and
   the year of study). Results showed that political cynicism exerts a
   positive impact (standardized coefficient:.274, p:.000) on online
   political engagement, and this effect is positively moderated by the
   extent of Facebook use (standardized coefficient:.261, p:.000). Results
   also showed that internal political efficacy is not a significant
   predictor of the dependent variable.},

Number = {4},
Pages = {424-439},
Abstract = {While many regard equality as the moral foundation of democracy,
   republican theory grounds democracy in freedom as non-domination. The
   grounding of democracy in freedom has been criticized for relying on
   either an Aristotelian perfectionism or a Rousseauian equation of the
   people in their collective capacity and the people understood severally.
   The republican theory of freedom and democracy has the resources to meet
   these criticisms. But the most systematic elaboration of republicanism,
   that of Philip Pettit, achieves this by turning the relationship between
   freedom and democracy into an instrumental relationship in a manner open
   to objections. Instead, republicanism should offer a justification of
   democracy that also has a non-instrumental dimension. This revised
   republican freedom argument for democracy has advantages compared to the
   equality argument for democracy, including a better explanation of
   democratic procedures.},

   Moscow seminars in the 1960s and 1970s were a place for diversity of

   Georgia, whom the Soviet Union kept from traveling for 20 years, entered
   into dialogue with Plato, Kant, and Descartes. With that, he gave
   metaphysics a Russian language. As state repression receded in the 1980s
   and change moved within reach, the political significance of
   Ma.mardashvili's philosophy became obvious.},

   marginality. In so doing we explore the figure of the outsider in the
   second half of the 19th century in France, considering the complex and
   blurred boundaries that exist between the ``Same{''} and the

Abstract = {Facing a crucial legitimacy crisis, many Western European political
   parties have recently undergone various forms of organizational changes
   by adopting procedures for increasing intra-democracy: internal ballots,
   internal referenda, primary elections and so on. Direct democracy is now
   used in a wide range of decision-making procedures such as candidate and
   leadership selection (Cross and Katz, 2013). These reforms have provided
   new opportunities for participation to party members. What happens to
   more traditional elements of party internal structures when such
   instruments of intra-party democracy are adopted? And more specifically,
   how are such changes perceived by the party base? This paper explores
   the attitudes and behaviors of members with regard to intra-party
   democracy procedures. On the basis of a case study (Belgium) and of an
   original dataset, the paper explores the political consequences of
   intra-party democracy. We show that members' satisfaction with the party
   and their degree of previous internal activism affect the level of
   involvement in intra-party democracy activities. However, the
   dissatisfaction of the party base vis-a-vis of the membership role is
   growing. Intra-party democratization seems to limit the organizational
   function of the grass-roots membership to a `cheerleading' role.},

Abstract = {This article considers a series of recent cases where young transgender
   men have been successfully prosecuted for sexual offences in
   circumstances where their female cisgender partners claimed to be
   unaware of their gender histories. The article will (i) detail the legal
   background to these cases, (ii) offer a critique of the claims that
   non-disclosure of gender history serves to vitiate consent, constitute
   harm and provide evidence of deception, and (iii) provide three
   arguments as to why criminalisation is inappropriate in any event. The
   arguments against criminalisation that will be advanced are that
   prosecution (i) produces legal inconsistency and is potentially
   discriminatory, (ii) unduly valorises the sexual autonomy of cisgender
   people, and (iii) is contrary to good public policy. In developing these
   arguments, the article will highlight how the `intelligibility' of
   prosecution proceeds from a prior cisnormative framing of events.},

Abstract = {In Modern Political Analysis (MPA), Robert A. Dahl presents what he saw
   as the essentials of politics and political science. Spanning four
   decades of Dahl's scholarly career, the six editions of MPA address (i)
   the nature of politics; (ii) `influence', the constituent element of
   politics and MPA's term for what political scientists often call
   `power'; and (iii) similarities and differences among political systems.
   Seven `forms of influence' - power, coercion, force, persuasion,
   manipulation, inducement, and authority - are distinguished and
   analyzed. In exploring similarities and differences among the world's
   political systems, MPA presents an overview of Dahl's insights on
   democracy and polyarchy. The six MPA editions also provide an
   opportunity to observe how Dahl's thinking about the essentials of his
   discipline evolved over forty years.},

Abstract = {Central American countries entered the new century seeking to change the
   rules governing presidential re-election. All of the attempts studied
   have sought to relax the presidential term limits. In accordance with
   this behavior, this study seeks to understand the conditions that led to
   the success of presidential reform. For this purpose, we have developed
   a comparative qualitative analysis method that aims to determine the
   circumstances that shaped the experiences of those leaders who took
   steps towards achieving re-election modification.},

Title = {Complements or Competitors? The African Standby Force, the African
   Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises, and the Future of Rapid
   Reaction Forces in Africa},
Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {56-73},
Abstract = {In May 2013 the African Union proposed the creation of an institutional
   framework for a new continental rapid-response force called the African
   Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises. While the creation of the
   rapid-response force has offered hope as an antidote to the recent
   continental inaction in the face of insurgencies in places like Mali in
   2013, it has undergone critical scrutiny because it seemingly
   duplicates-and thus arguably draws resources away from-a similar
   mechanism, the African Standby Force, which has been in development by
   the African Union and regional communities since 2003. A contemporary
   debate is thus emerging: Certain observers favor the African Capacity
   for Immediate Response to Crises' new, ad-hoc, slim, and voluntary
   approach to collective security, while others argue that the African
   Standby Force's preexisting-though underdeveloped-regionally based,
   comprehensive, and institutionalized framework should receive top
   priority. This article offers overviews of both institutions and the
   various debates currently surrounding them. In the main, it argues that
   while critiques that the African Capacity for Immediate Response to
   Crises is duplicative of the African Standby Force are superficially
   cogent, deeper analysis shows that this is not the case. Rather, the
   African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises is a laudable stopgap
   measure for continental rapid-deployment capabilities until the more
   bureaucratically complex African Standby Force is fully operationalized.
   Rather than undermining the African Standby Force, the African Capacity
   for Immediate Response to Crises is instead highly complementary.
   Indeed, it is likely the case that some of the more successful
   components of the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises will
   ultimately be incorporated into the African Standby Force's
   rapid-deployment capabilities once the latter is ready for operations in
   2015 or beyond.},

Title = {Political disaffection or critical democrats? An analysis of attitudes
   towards direct democracy in Austria in the light of three theoretical
   approaches},
Journal = {AUSTRIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {44},

Abstract = {Direct democracy in Austria is usually discussed without including the
   citizens as relevant political actors. Based on a representative survey
   (n=2000) conducted in 2052, this paper describes the public opinion
   vis-a-vis direct democracy and addresses the question of which
   sociodemographic and political factors influence the support for an
   extension of direct democracy. Three theoretical approaches are compared
   with regard to their explanatory potential and normative implications:
   new politics, political disaffection and the theory of participational
   democracy. While each explains certain aspects, no theory can claim to
   offer a comprehensive explanation. Due to the overall high acceptance of
   direct democracy in the Austrian population only limited explanatory
   power is attained.},

Abstract = {Swiss parliamentary party groups have undergone a process of
   professionalization over the course of the last few decades. Swiss
   parties increasingly resemble party groups in established and more
   professionalized Western European parliamentary systems. Party unity has
   increased and party leaderships have started using instruments to
   strengthen party unity, in view of which party group members
   increasingly accept behavioural rules and norms. Our analysis suggests
   that Swiss parties have professionalized over the course of the last
   thirty years, and we demonstrate that this change has resulted from the
   ideological polarization in the Swiss political landscape, and conscious
   effort on the part of Swiss party group leaders. Thus, we contribute to
   the on-going debate about party change and the question of what drives
   the development of parties. The development of the Swiss parties is
   documented using data from three parliamentary surveys from the last
   thirty years, and two interview rounds with party group leaders, their
   staff and political experts.},

   a bearing on people's opinion about defence expenditure: religiosity;
   people's opinion regarding war being the solution to the India-Pakistan
   conflict; people's opinion about India's global image; and people's
   federal location in India pertaining to whether or not they live in

Title = {Indigenous ``Infanticide{''}: a legal- anthropological perspective},
Journal = {REVISTA ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {140-158},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In Brazil, some indigenous groups in the practice of the
   ``infanticide{''} indigenous consisting in killing or abandonment of
   children in the woods, since they may be suffering from some physical or
   mental disability, twins or children of single mothers. In this study,
   the objective is to analyze this practice in the light of the
   constitutional and infra Brazilian system to articulate it to the right,
   its interpretation of legal norms and rules, the sociology and
   anthropology in reading a particularly multi-ethnic society.
   The point of tension that sparked interest in the study, is the
   opposition of the right to life, constitutionally guaranteed in Brazil
   and by international treaties to which Brazil is a signatory, and the
   right to preserve the customs of indigenous peoples, also guaranteed by
   the Brazilian Constitution and internationally.
   Although Brazilian society was aware of the existence of the indigenous
   communities of different practices, ``infanticide{''} indigenous drew
   attention especially due to the proposal of Bill 1057 of 2007 entitled
   Muaji Law, for which it is intended to criminalize him that, being aware
   of the risk of infanticide, not notify the competent authorities.
   This Project of Law, due to the legal narrative, for purposes of this
   study, it was considered as a hearing instrument to the cry of dissent
   groups, which broke the monolithic unity of their culture, refusing to
   practice and/or consents with the practice of infanticide.
   In addition to seeking to establish the legal, social and cultural
   frameworks to achieve a communication line realized the complexity of
   the analysis, also articulated in the legal and cultural theoretical
   grid, cultural relativism and universalism of human rights.
   In the case of a job above all theoretical, the methodology used was
   fundamentally literature, however, we sought to empirical support for
   documentaries and news programs in order to identify possible
   interpretations collated to view these materials.
   Rather than analyze the practice of ``infanticide{''} and adopt either
   position between the universalism of human rights and cultural
   relativism, there is especially the right to be different, cultural
   relativism assumption, may not represent an obligation of the difference
   preventing intercultural dialogue (Pinezi in Lidorio and Souza, 2008).
   Another important aspect to consider is that even the most cohesive
   societies, culturally speaking, may have cracks that cohesion because of
   the nonconformity of its agents of transformation. In a multicultural
   society, recognition is not restricted to simple cognition on the other
   by the consciousness, but considers the reason as ``historically
   contingent{''}, admitting that their content varies over different eras,
   societies and cultures (Hegel in Feres Junior, 2010).},

Abstract = {The end of the Cold War meant fewer constraints on humanitarian
   intervention, and the third pillar of the nascent R2P norm suggests at
   least a moral imperative to intervene when another country's population
   is threatened. Yet US leaders continue to shy away from protecting
   innocents outside of the United States from harm - despite the fact that
   presidential candidates often campaign on restoring America's moral lead
   in the world and, in particular, on US responsibilities to avert mass
   atrocities. This paper investigates the extent to which US military
   intervention abroad is driven by domestic considerations. Using logistic
   regression analysis, we aim to explain decisions by Presidents Bush Sr.,
   Clinton and Bush Jr. to send troops into harms way.},

Title = {Explaining the size of assemblies. A longitudinal analysis of the design
   and reform of assembly sizes in democracies around the world},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {40},
Pages = {280-292},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Why would parliamentarians vote for a bill reducing the number of seats
   of their own legislature? After all, this would resemble `turkeys voting
   for Christmas.' This question is all the more pressing as the 2008
   economic crisis triggered debates about reducing the number of
   parliamentarians. However, our knowledge of (changes to) assembly sizes
   is limited. In this study we develop a novel theoretical framework and
   test it empirically. We advance three main explanations: the gap between
   the expected size (based on population size) and the actual one, the
   effective number of parties and perceived voter hostility stemming from
   economic recessions. We test the framework using OLS regression
   (1800-2008) and event history analysis (1945-2008) for all democracies.
   We find a strong connection between population and assembly size when
   these assemblies are originally designed. Increases in assembly size are
   influenced by population growth and the effective number of parties.
   Reductions are influenced mainly by having recently experienced an
   economic recession. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {What is state repression? This article explores in detail how state
   repression is conceptualized by the two most prevalent data sets
   employed by qualitative scholars: the Political Terror Scale (PTS) and
   the Cingranelli-Richards (CIRI) data set. The article uses disaggregated
   data on the characteristics of state's repressive strategy and compare
   changes in these subcomponents in years when the overall measure of
   repression increases or decreases. Following bivariate and multivariate
   analyses of eighteen West African countries with a history of
   fluctuating human rights practices, the article finds that both the PTS
   and CIRI scores are primarily influenced by military involvement in
   human rights violations. The article highlights the need for more
   scholarship on the mechanisms behind the finding that democracies are
   less repressive than other regimes and motivates more studies on how and
   when repression decreases.},

Abstract = {In the context of the American federalism, integrated parties provide
   the necessary coordination mechanism for state and federal politicians
   to be electorally successful. This argument rests on the assumption that
   voters are able to observe the benefits of voting a straight ticket. We
   test this individual level explanation by using the CCES data. Moreover,
   at the aggregate level, we measure the so-called `two-sided' coattail
   effects in concurrent multilevel elections in the U.S. since 1960. By
   using a simultaneous equation model, we estimate the reciprocal
   relationship between presidential and gubernatorial vote shares at the
   state level. While we find no consistent presidential coattails, we
   reveal robust and significant gubernatorial coattail effects on
   state-level presidential vote, underscoring the role of multilevel
   forces within parties in democratic federations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {This paper assesses the challenges that are posed to the new mining law
   and other Regulations that govern the mining sector in Tanzania. The
   main issues discussed in this paper include the conflicts between the
   local people and the mining companies regarding land ownership,
   compensation and forced eviction, conflicts between Small Scale Mining
   (SSM) and Large Scale Mining (LSM).
   The findings obtained by the authors, intimates that the major problems
   in the mining sector are due to lack of law enforcement and good
   governance in the sector as well as lack of awareness of the laws
   governing the sector by the local communities.
   Lastly, the authors concludes and recommend that, until and unless the
   laws are adhered to and kept into practice, the problems in the mining
   sector will not be easily resolved. Hence in order for the mining sector
   to benefit the indigenous and the investors, there should be enhancement
   of sustainable development;, people should be educated on the laws and
   the effects of mining on the environment and the relationship between
   SSM and LSM be improved.},

Title = {vulnerability and compensation: constructing an index of co-optation in
   autocratic regimes},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {439-457},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Co-optation is one of the most important concepts that have been
   discussed in recent years to explain the persistence of autocratic
   regimes. Institutions like parties, legislatures, and elections have all
   been shown to fulfil a co-optation function. However, a broader
   assessment of co-optation beyond an institutional focus has yet to be
   undertaken. This article addresses this lacuna and presents a
   comprehensive concept and operationalisation of co-optation in
   autocratic regimes. The article argues that co-optation is constituted
   by the compensation of the regime's vulnerability to threats posed by
   powerful societal pressure groups. The article highlights how
   compensation of vulnerability can be achieved through institutional
   inclusion or material benefits, and how this has to be tailored to the
   respective pressure group's requirements. I collect twenty-six
   indicators of vulnerability and compensation related to six societal
   pressure groups and aggregate them into an index of co-optation that
   reflects the structure of the theoretical concept. The index is
   evaluated by examining distributions within and across categories of
   autocratic legislatures, and by testing its effect on autocratic regime
   breakdown in a set of Cox survival models.},

Abstract = {Political elites in emerging democracies are likely to promise
   improvements on human rights. From an empirical perspective, however,
   emerging democracies tend to perform rather poorly in this domain. Given
   this tension between elite rhetoric and performance, it is important to
   examine the extent to which citizens in emerging democracies evaluate
   democracy and new democratic leaders' performance on the bases of their
   perceptions of respect for human rights. This topic remains largely
   unexplored and conventional wisdom suggests that economic satisfaction,
   not human rights concerns, drives individuals' support for democracy. We
   aim to fill this gap in the literature by investigating the extent to
   which specific and diffuse political support is related to individuals'
   perceptions of respect for human rights in the context of an emerging
   democracy. Taking advantage of two representative survey data sets from
   Mexico from 2003 and 2010, our empirical findings suggest that citizens
   are more likely to support their president, their government and
   democratization when they believe that human rights are respected. By
   examining the relationship between democracy and human rights
   protections at the individual level, our research is a pioneering effort
   to better explain the interaction between the prospects of democratic
   consolidation and perceptions of human rights.},

Abstract = {Representative democracy is party democracy. Parties vote together in
   the legislative arena; party labels act as information shortcuts in the
   electoral arena, tying together co-partisan legislators' re-election
   prospects. But the utility of party labels is weakened by waning party
   identifications in the electorate. Partisan dealignment therefore risks
   undercutting party loyalty on the part of backbenchers. Combining
   district-level data on electoral volatility and new data from the
   PARTIREP survey of legislators in 15 advanced industrial democracies, it
   is demonstrated that party loyalty is lowest where partisan dealignment
   is strongest - even after accounting for backbenchers' policy
   preferences, whether they represent the ruling party or the opposition,
   and their campaign strategies. Our results have important implications
   for the sustainability of current models of representative democracy.},

Abstract = {This article develops a framework for analyzing the dynamics of
   multilevel politics inspired by historical institutionalism. It suggests
   that this approach has much potential to re-focus an increasingly
   diversified scholarly landscape, comprising fields like European
   integration, comparative federalism and regionalization, by promoting a
   more nuanced understanding of the varieties of institutional dynamics in
   multilevel architectures. The article seeks to make a threefold
   contribution. First, it conceptualizes multilevel architectures as an
   institutional outcome of political restructuring which are subject to
   different patterns of authority migration over time. Second, it proposes
   typological criteria to systematically compare such patterns of
   institutional change by distinguishing their direction, pace and depth.
   Third, it speculates on the mechanisms that can explain divergent
   patterns of authority migration. Overall, it is argued that the
   historical ordering of institutional linkages between territorial
   authorities leads to differently composed multilevel architectures,
   which in turn shape the patterns and pathways of authority migration at
   later points in time. Case studies from North America and Europe
   illustrate the value of this analytical framework for the comparative
   investigation of continuity and change in and of multilevel systems.},

Abstract = {This article explores the relationship between theory and praxis by
   contrasting three different models of intellectual endeavor: totalizing,
   particular and decolonial. Attending to the critique that Gayatri Spivak
   raised against Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze in Can the Subaltern
   Speak?, this article advocates a dramaturgical reading of texts as a
   model for political theory to address subaltern agency. It reads such
   agency in the smile that Pier Paolo Pasolini registers in his 1967 film
   version of Sophocles' play, Oedipus Tyrannos. Dramaturgically read,
   Oedipus reveals another text, the tragic history of a yet insufficiently
   explored democratic alternative that goes against the established
   democracy and its complicity with inequality in the continued
   naturalization of slavery despite its foundation in equality. This
   subtext demands understanding Oedipus as a political production from the
   speechless agency of dissident servants, a more subversive aspect of
   democratic politics.},

Volume = {48},
Number = {13},

Abstract = {Growing polarization in the American Congress is closely related to
   rising income inequality. Yet there has been no corresponding
   polarization of the U.S. electorate, and across advanced democracies,
   mass polarization is negatively related to income inequality. To explain
   this puzzle, we propose a comparative political economy model of mass
   polarization in which the same institutional factors that generate
   income inequality also undermine political information. We explain why
   more voters then place themselves in the ideological center, hence
   generating a negative correlation between mass polarization and
   inequality. We confirm these conjectures on individual-level data for 20
   democracies, and we then show that democracies cluster into two types:
   one with high inequality, low mass polarization, and polarized and
   right-shifted elites (e.g., the United States); and the other with low
   inequality and high mass polarization with left-shifted elites (e.g.,
   Sweden). This division reflects long-standing differences in educational
   systems, the role of unions, and social networks.},

Abstract = {A ratification referendum is a procedure in which framers submit a
   constitution to the people for binding approval before implementation.
   It is widespread, recommended, and affects the contents and reception of
   constitutions, yet remains unstudied. Moreover, the reasons or
   justification for using the procedure remain unexplored. This is
   troubling because ratification referenda are optional, and thus should
   only be implemented for good reasons that, today, are no longer given.
   This article begins correcting this oversight by identifying those that
   brought about the first ratification referendum and explaining why they
   did so. I demonstrate that the Berkshire Constitutionalists called for
   the procedure during the events leading up to the creation of the 1780
   Massachusetts Constitution, and that they justified their actions by
   asserting that the people have an unalienable right to ratify their
   constitution through a referendum, for this provided needed protection
   against potentially corrupt elites. This argument remains the most fully
   developed justification for the procedure to date. My analysis not only
   reveals ratification referenda to be another product of early American
   political thought, but also points the way forward for future evaluation
   of the procedure, and forces reflection upon the importance of having
   solid grounds for the choices involved in structuring a
   constitution-making process.},

Abstract = {Few political institutions are as central to theories of lawmaking as
   the executive veto. Despite its importance, institutional continuity at
   the national level has precluded identification of empirical effects of
   the veto on legislative behavior. We address this limitation and present
   evidence from the states demonstrating how the veto affects the
   formation of legislative coalitions and, indirectly, executive influence
   over policymaking. We find consistent evidence that the presence and
   strength of gubernatorial veto powers affect the lawmaking behavior of
   state legislatures. Our analysis shows how institutional provisions
   condition executives' ability to affect policy outcomes in
   separation-of-powers systems.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to analyze the singularity of Alexander Hamilton's
   liberal republicanism. In this sense, first of all, we address the
   relation between war and the Republic as it is presented in different
   republican traditions as well as the fundamental assumptions regarding
   the nineteenth century liberal Weltanschauung, and Schmitt's critique of
   the latter. Within this horizon of understanding, we explore Alexander
   Hamilton's political thought from the perspective of the relation
   between the Republic as a political form and both trade and war.
   According to Hamilton, a community's internal and external expansion is
   the main cause of its development. With realism, and foremost, with
   republican consciousness, he assumes that this progress does not occur
   without conflict, and challenges, consequently, the most canonic version
   of nineteenth-century liberalism. Hamilton was a liberal who understood
   that the expansion of an economic model was not the result of social
   self-regulation, but the consequence of an active power both in the
   international and in the national level of politics. The Federalist
   writer was also a republican who understood the role that war plays in
   the legitimation of a newly founded Republic with imperial aspirations.},

Abstract = {The regulatory regionalism approach has increasingly claimed that a new
   mode of regional governance is emerging globally. Regional policy
   regimes, developed in broad social and economic territorial areas,
   affect the internal transformation of the state. The authors plan to
   provide comprehensive empirical evidence about the emergence of
   worldwide regulatory regionalism by identifying how regulatory agencies
   have diffused very successfully within the regional level in recent
   decades. The paper aims to identify, using an original methodological
   design, the ways in which such diffusion of agencies occurred, as this
   may have theoretical relevance for the study of regulatory regionalism.
   The authors' hypothesis suggests that transnational political
   interactions in each regional cluster triggered agency diffusion,
   contributing to the development of the regulatory state within the
   countries of each region. To test this hypothesis, the authors employed
   a data set of regulatory agencies including the OECD (Organisation for
   Economic Co-operation and Development), and most Asian and Latin
   American countries (+59) from 1950 to 2007, for 15 sectors related to
   finance, risks, utility and competition. Bayesian data analysis was used
   to estimate the parameters of interest.},

Abstract = {This article identifies the top 40 most influential environmental
   conflict cases in the US while also showcasing innovative mixed methods
   for more rigorous participatory collaborative work on environmental
   conflicts. University of Michigan students and faculty collaborated with
   Environmental Justice Organizations, Liabilities and Trade (EJOLT), a
   European Union mapping initiative, to identify US cases for their wider
   study. We began with an intensive scholarly and media literature review,
   combined with results from 31 semi-structured interviews with informants
   from a broad database of US environmental justice (EJ) departments,
   initiatives, and symposia. We then wrote short descriptions of 90 EJ
   conflict cases in US history, incorporating them into a detailed
   participatory online survey to garner expert and public input on which
   of them have been the most influential in shaping US popular opinion,
   policy, and political will on EJ issues. Seeking to provide a rigorous
   basis for the EJOLT mapping exercise, but also to instill an ethic of
   knowledge co-creation within the US Environmental Protection Agency
   (EPA)'s mechanisms for assessing EJ issues, we distributed the survey
   widely and posted it on the EPA's EJ Blog. It received over 1000 hits in
   the first two weeks. Our surveys remained active for about three weeks,
   for a total of 350 responses (101 from respondents who self-identified
   as EJ experts, and 249 from those identifying as members of the wider
   public). After eliminating incomplete or duplicate responses, we
   weighted to correct for that imbalance in the numbers, considering a
   total of 165 in our analysis. These responses comprise the list of 40
   cases (unranked) we launched on the atlas in March 2014, and describe in
   this paper; the top five including multiple oil- or petroleum-based
   cases, one clean water case, one climate change case, and one confined
   animal feeding operation case.},

Abstract = {This study suggests that certain election administration arrangements
   can have a modest but significant impact on the probability of voting.
   Using data from Module 3 of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems,
   supplemented by contextual data from the ACE Electoral Knowledge
   Network, I explore the effects of election timing and voter registration
   procedures on turnout in 30 democracies. I show that when voter
   registration is in the hands of an independent electoral management
   body, there is a greater likelihood of an individual voting. Contrary to
   conventional wisdom, election timing has little impact on the
   probability of voting. Weekend voting, polling hours, and the timing of
   the election during the year have no significant impact, even among
   young people, supposedly the beneficiaries of such arrangements. The
   results show the potential for certain election arrangements to
   stimulate turnout. They also reveal that facilitating voters by
   lessening voting costs is not a cure to the problem of growing
   abstention. These findings have implications for our understanding of
   voter turnout and the means by which declining electoral engagement is
   addressed.},

Abstract = {Over the last decade, in a major switch in position, conservatives have
   embraced the cause of reducing prison populations in the states and,
   increasingly, at the national level. The long-term crime decline and the
   increasing antistatism of the Republican Party contributed to this
   change, but it also has an important cognitive component: Policy makers
   have become more open to evidence of the damaging effects of mass
   incarceration. In contrast to previous studies, our case shows that such
   policy feedback only functions politically when a signal about a policy
   consequence is assigned valence and intensity by policy makers, whose
   calculations are heavily structured by the demands of party coalitions.
   On issues in which no core coalition member has a major stake, feedback
   can be tipped from reinforcing to undermining and vice versa, but this
   process depends on the efforts of entrepreneurs to change the way
   information is processed. In a highly polarized environment, opening
   policy makers to previously ignored evidence requires the cultivation of
   a reform cadre composed of ideological standard-bearers who can vouch
   for the orthodoxy of the new position.},

Abstract = {One of the most provocative recent findings in our understanding of
   political behavior is the link between physiological responses to
   environmental stimuli and political attitudes and behavior. This line of
   research holds much promise in explaining some of the foundational
   evolutionary origins of basic political orientations. Much of this
   recent research focused specifically on skin conductance response to
   threatening and disgusting stimuli, however, is based on analyses of a
   data collection sample of approximately 200 study participants drawn
   from the same community at a single point in time. Herein we attempt to
   reproduce many of the basic findings of recent research on skin
   conductance response and political behavior using data collected from a
   novel and unique dataset in a different context. In brief, we fail to
   reproduce many of the basic findings from this incipient line of
   research which suggests that the link between skin conductance and
   political behavior may be more contingent than previously assumed.},

Abstract = {Economic nationalism has returned to Latin America. This article
   examines what has allowed leaders to advance their nationalistic agendas
   and expropriate foreign investment, despite the institutional safeguards
   that investors have established. Case studies of Venezuelan and Bolivian
   hydrocarbon nationalization show that the deterrent power of the
   investment regime of the 1990s, institutionalized in bilateral
   investment treaties, is weakest precisely when it is most needed by
   investors. When a commodity boom increases profits in the sector, the
   host government is motivated to expropriate multinationals. Ironically,
   the price increase also enables governments to bear the treaties' costs
   by accepting international arbitration and paying any resulting
   compensation. Using data from 130 in-depth interviews conducted in
   Venezuela and Bolivia, this article demonstrates the limits of the
   constraints of globalization.},

Abstract = {The recent expansion of the global wine industry, especially in
   developing countries, has brought to light the apparent phenomenon of
   conspicuous production. This form of economic activity is characterised
   by investment decisions that seek status and reputation alongside or, in
   many cases, ahead of profits. This paper examines the wine industry and
   uncovers examples of conspicuous production occurring at different
   scales, from celebrities and individual investors through to national
   strategies. Although the empirical evidence is somewhat scattered, we
   argue this is a source of capital of significance in the wine industry,
   and possibly in other sectors of the economy.},

Volume = {42},

Pages = {367-385},
Month = {SEP 2},
Abstract = {Recent analyses of the continued dominance of the African National
   Congress (ANC) have centred on its organizational, electoral,
   governmental and popular bases of power. This paper extends this
   analysis by arguing that the ANC derives significant political power
   through its political communications, and particularly its political
   marketing. Through the lens of the latter, it examines the ANC's
   strategic political behaviour over time. It extends its analytical
   purview beyond election campaigns to include the process of creating the
   symbolic bases of the South African state through the discursive
   continuity of economic policy. This paper roots the ANC's political
   marketing within a wider historical, cultural, representational and
   political setting. It demonstrates the recursive practices and effects
   of the ANC's communications and the deep entanglement of politics with
   marketing. This paper makes an initial contribution to reconceptualizing
   the bases of the ANC's political dominance and sheds light on an
   understudied aspect of its political and cultural orientation.},

Abstract = {The results of Turkey's June and November 2015 parliamentary elections
   are put in perspective in light of economic voting literature and
   observed historical patterns. Usual and unusual factors that played
   roles in these elections are identified and their relative importance is
   assessed. it appears that a higher than usual number of strategic votes
   cast due to special circumstances were essentially behind the outcomes
   of both of these elections. The results also show that voters have
   consolidated in four camps more firmly than ever before and that the AK
   Party once more came close to a fifty percent vote share, which is the
   long run potential for conservative parties.},

Abstract = {To talk about affective tendencies is almost always to talk about
   intensities, and behind that linkage is a relation to melodrama, that
   modality of performance that attaches feeling states to their gestural
   inflation in bodily performance. In contrast, Raymond Williams' model of
   the structure of feeling places the historical present and the affective
   present in a space of affective residue that constitutes what is shared
   among strangers beneath the surface of manifested life. ``Structures of
   Unfeeling: Mysterious Skin{''} reads with Scott Heim's novel and Gregg
   Araki's film to think about how to think about the structural,
   historical, and affective overdeterminations of underperformed emotion,
   tracking the emergence of a cultural style that appears as reticent
   action, a spatialized suspension of relational clarity that signifies a
   subtracted response to the urgencies of the moment (the historical
   moment, the sexual moment, the intimate moment, the moment where
   survival time is being apprehended, absorbed, and encountered).},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {39},
Pages = {117-128},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Electoral agency models suggest that government efficiency improves when
   voters penalize poor performance, and party competition is balanced.
   Uncertainty in the electoral mechanism dilutes the incentive to produce
   efficiently. We test this proposition using panel data on local
   governments. The dataset includes a broad set of indicators on service
   output and quality, which facilitates the measurement of cost
   efficiency. We use historical data on local voting in national elections
   to measure partisan bias, while electoral volatility is measured on past
   variations in neighboring municipalities. The empirical analyses show
   that partisan bias lowers cost efficiency, particularly in
   municipalities with large electoral volatility. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Pages = {553-576},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This study examines the link between individual attitudes and voting for
   radical right parties in 16 European countries, using the European
   Social Survey (ESS). This study includes, in a single model, several
   different components of the radical right political platform in order to
   test which components are more strongly found among radical right
   voters. Using the initial assumption that the anti-immigrant message of
   radical right parties should be attractive to individuals with similar
   predispositions, I use the ESS to find evidence that radical right
   voters are attracted to these parties because of the political message
   of immigration attitudes and anti-democratic attitudes. Further,
   depending on the context, social conservatism is associated with radical
   right support. In sum, radical right support is based on multiple
   factors with immigration attitudes as the primary consideration, with
   populism and social conservatism playing a minor but significant role.},

Abstract = {This article examines state crime in the area of the use of irregulars
   in counterinsurgency. Irregulars are defined as local units who receive
   rudimentary training and act alongside more regular forces. They are
   also defined as more regular formal local units who act informally (and
   often unlawfully) as part of their counter-insurgency role (e.g. death
   squads). The article examines the important role that such irregulars
   have played in counter-insurgency in Iraq and Afghanistan and highlights
   the human rights violations that their use has encouraged. This area is
   an important area for future research.},

   trafficking of people and goods. If the illegal traffic is not taken
   seriously, not only the country will lose revenue from customs duties,

   Immigration Office in combating human trafficking and smuggling. This
   paper will also discuss the problem of illegal immigrants and human
   trafficking is complicated due to unscrupulous government and security
   apparatus. This paper also seeks actors involved and their role in
   paving the way for illegal immigrants. Finally, this paper argue the
   duty of POLRI in assisting the Immigration Office will run effectively
   if it involves a number of government agencies relating to the
   management and supervision of foreign territories, including the
   Ministry of Home Affair and the Armed Forces (TNI).},

Abstract = {This paper argues that Iceland enjoyed essential shelter, for its
   development and prosperity, provided by Denmark and Britain. Societal
   relations with Copenhagen were of fundamental importance in the
   preservation and evolution of Icelandic identity and culture, providing
   the foundation of the modern society and leading to the establishment of
   the Icelandic state. Danish financial backups created the basis for the
   island's economic prosperity in the 20th century. Moreover, Denmark
   provided partial political shelter in terms of significant diplomatic
   support in guaranteeing trade agreements with other states. Also,
   Denmark led by example and Iceland followed its foreign policy. On the
   other hand, Denmark failed to provide Iceland with protection of its
   land and waters and economic cover when it was in most need. Moreover,
   the economic cover it did provide was, at times, highly costly. Denmark
   had been downgraded to a small European power in the post-Napoleonic
   period. In practice, Britain was in control over the North Atlantic. It
   guaranteed Iceland's neutrality and connection to the outside world and
   markets when the Danish authorities failed in these areas, as long as
   British interests were also served. Nor did British protection come
   without cost. Accordingly, this paper confirms the common claim of
   small-state studies that small states are at the mercy of their larger
   neighbours. Moreover, our findings indicate that Iceland's growing
   autonomy did not affect its need for political, economic and societal
   cover.},

Abstract = {Over at least the past quarter century, observers, historians, and
   journalists have painted a damning picture of the treatment that African
   Americans have received from their government and fellow citizens, not
   only during slavery and the era of segregation but far into the
   twentieth century. Yet many of these observations and reports have
   simply been ignored and, although others received some attention for a
   time, none has become part of the country's standard public history. My
   premise is that the continued failure in the United States to
   incorporate these observations and reports into its standard history has
   a profound effect on its political culture. I therefore begin by briefly
   recalling some aspects of post-Civil War African American history and
   consider the American antipathy to confronting this history by looking
   at Charles Mills's account of ``white ignorance.{''} While some
   theorists have tried to supplement Mills's realist framework with a more
   sophisticated one indebted to Critical Theory, I move in a different
   direction, drawing out some of the implications of the distinctive
   approach known as philosophical hermeneutics. By doing so, I hope to
   demonstrate how a hermeneutic perspective can contribute to serious
   discussion among U.S. political scientists and political educators about
   the links between racial inequality and historical understanding and its
   absence.},

Abstract = {This study analyses why income inequality and party polarisation proceed
   together in some countries but not in others. By focusing on the
   relationship between income inequality, the permissiveness of electoral
   systems and party polarisation, the study offers a theoretical
   explanation for how the combination of income inequality and permissive
   electoral systems generates higher party polarisation. After analysing a
   cross-national dataset of party polarisation, income inequality and
   electoral institutions covering 24 advanced democracies between 1960 and
   2011, it is found that a simple correlation between income inequality
   and party polarisation is not strong. However, the empirical results
   indicate that greater income inequality under permissive electoral
   systems contributes to growing party polarisation, which suggests that
   parties only have diverging ideological platforms due to greater income
   inequality when electoral systems encourage their moves towards the
   extreme; parties do not diverge when electoral systems discourage their
   moves towards the extreme.},

Abstract = {In this article I criticize, first, democratic inclusion principles that
   are indeterminate with regard to democratic boundaries and indifferent
   towards the structural features of polities. I suggest that a democratic
   stakeholder principle passes these critical tests and can be applied to
   democratic polities of different kinds. Second, I compare
   birthright-based and residence-based membership regimes at state and
   local levels and consider how they can accommodate international
   migrants. Third, I argue that these two regimes are not freestanding
   alternatives between which democratic polities have to choose, but are
   combined in a multilevel architecture of democratic citizenship, in
   which the inclusion and exclusion dynamics of birthright and residence
   mutually constrain each other and every individual is included as a
   citizen in both types of polities.},

Abstract = {This study introduces a measure of framing distance, capturing the
   degree of frame overlap among parties. Additionally, it provides a
   causal mechanism explaining differences between parties in framing
   distance. Parties within PR systems have to take coalition
   considerations in their stride, and therefore mainstream opposition
   parties, which have previously governed, are unlikely to adopt large
   framing distances. Alternatively, challenger parties, those that have
   never governed, are likely to frame important issues differently.
   Nonetheless, challengers are expected to reduce their framing distance
   when performing well in election polls. Electoral success acts as a
   trigger for these parties to reconsider their goals (policy, office, or
   votes) and to become more office-seeking. These theoretical propositions
   are confirmed on the basis of the European integration issue, using a
   mixed methods approach. Pooled time-series regressions on party
   manifestos issued by 21 parties between 1987 and 2006 in three political
   systems (Germany, Netherlands, and UK) are complemented with case study
   analysis.},

Abstract = {By revisiting the work of Blais and Rae, this article develops a new
   classification of electoral systems focused on input rules. An Unknown
   Winning Number family is distinguished from a Quota family with known
   winning numbers for most of the counting process. Branching family trees
   are developed and used to help explain some Australian experience with
   accentuated disproportionality in two electoral systems which have been
   omitted from otherwise path-breaking recent analysis (Taagepera, R. and
   Shugart, M.S. 1989. Seats and votes: The effects and determinants of
   electoral systems. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press). These omitted
   systems are identified as effectively giving electors as many votes as
   seats available in a district. The input-rule family trees remind us
   that number of votes is an important component of electoral systems,
   although elusive and somewhat forgotten in much recent analysis. More
   conventional groupings of electoral systems are identified as output
   peer groups},

Abstract = {In the Asia-Pacific geopolitical dynamics, China's rise and its
   accompanying ``assertive{''} diplomacy are often cited by some studies
   as the cause of security concerns. The author argues that this
   interpretation of the Asia-Pacific security situation is wrong. The
   Asia-Pacific confronts various and complex security problems, which
   cannot be simply attributed to the rise of China. The occurrence and
   activation of so many security problems in the Asia-Pacific only
   indicate that the security architecture in the region is undergoing a
   profound transition. The old security architecture inherited from the
   Cold War era cannot effectively handle the security problems in the
   region any more. The Asia-Pacific needs a new architecture adaptive to
   the features of the post-Cold War era. The new security architecture
   should embody the spirit of cooperation and reflect Asian countries'
   interests and ways of handling regional affairs. More importantly, the
   new security architecture should feature ample accommodativeness, not
   only including the diverse cultures and paths of development of the
   region, but also encouraging and incentivizing all parties of the region
   to learn from each other so as to jointly create a sustainable security
   environment for the region.},

Abstract = {The 2010-2013 Fish Fight campaign, produced by Channel 4 in the United
   Kingdom and hosted by chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, is a transmedia
   experience designed to (1) draw the public's attention to the reckless
   discarding of caught fish because of the quota system intended to
   conserve fish stocks in the domain of the European Union; and to (2)
   pressure the authorities to change the European Common Fisheries Policy.
   The article analyzes the transmedia strategies of the Fish Fight
   campaign in order to demonstrate how the multiplatform media production
   contributed to (1) make the public aware of the wasteful discarding of
   healthy fish at sea under the European fishing quotas; and (2) to amend
   the European Union's fishing policies. The research findings point to
   the effective role of transmedia storytelling strategies in raising
   awareness in the political sphere through public participation in
   supporting relevant issues, influencing policy change.},

Title = {Using Bayesian Aldrich-McKelvey Scaling to Study Citizens' Ideological
   Preferences and Perceptions},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {59},
Number = {3},
Pages = {759-774},

Abstract = {Aldrich-McKelvey scaling is a powerful method that corrects for
   differential-item functioning (DIF) in estimating the positions of
   political stimuli (e.g., parties and candidates) and survey respondents
   along a latent policy dimension from issue scale data. DIF arises when
   respondents interpret issue scales (e.g., the standard
   liberal-conservative scale) differently and distort their placements of
   the stimuli and themselves. We develop a Bayesian implementation of the
   classical maximum likelihood Aldrich-McKelvey scaling method that
   overcomes some important shortcomings in the classical procedure. We
   then apply this method to study citizens' ideological preferences and
   perceptions using data from the 2004-2012 American National Election
   Studies and the 2010 Cooperative Congressional Election Study. Our
   findings indicate that DIF biases self-placements on the
   liberal-conservative scale in a way that understates the extent of
   polarization in the contemporary American electorate and that citizens
   have remarkably accurate perceptions of the ideological positions of
   senators and Senate candidates.},

Abstract = {The article discusses the conflict in the insurance industry, focusing
   on service failure and recovery processes in a Romanian insurance
   company. The Customer Complaints Management - and the associated
   challenges have been studied from a behavioral and also from an
   operational perspective in order to offer a better understanding of the
   potential conflict management tools that can be used in situations of
   service failure.The aim of this research is to offer a new and realistic
   perspective on the conflicts occurred between the insurance company and
   the policyholders emphasizing those aspects which are recurrent and
   specific for consumers' complaint behavior. In Romania, especially in
   the insurance industry, there are only a few companies that excel at
   handling service failures. Through this research, there are revealed
   some useful insights of how a firm can implement a cohesive conflict
   management strategy by valuing the knowledge assets in complaint
   management processes.},

Abstract = {Parliament's International Development Committee made a powerful case
   this year that DFID should put more money into parliamentary
   strengthening in developing countries. Arguing that parliaments were
   central to tackling corruption, improving economic development and
   building stable political settlements, they recommended that parliaments
   should be at the heart of DFID's governance work'. The report, though,
   also touched on wider issues of how DFID commissions and monitors its
   political programmes, suggesting fundamental changes to both. DFID
   recognises these challenges, and offered either full or partial
   agreement with most of the recommendations. The challenge that remains,
   though, is moving from the rhetoric of engaging with politics' to a much
   improved form of political and parliamentary programming.},

Title = {A republican account of the value of privacy},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},

Volume = {14},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article provides an account of the value of privacy in securing the
   republican aims of self-government and conditions of non-domination. It
   describes how loss of privacy might lead to subjugation to dominating
   power. The republican concept of domination provides the foundation of a
   broad and coherent account of the value of privacy. One that encompasses
   circumstances in which the subject (i) suffers interference as a result
   of the loss, (ii) is aware that he has suffered a loss of privacy, but
   suffers no subsequent interference and (iii) is unaware that he has
   suffered any loss of privacy, and suffers no subsequent interference.
   Liberal accounts explain the value of privacy in the first two
   circumstances by pointing to the possible effect of the loss on the
   autonomy of the subject, but because they focus on autonomy are unable
   to explain why privacy is valuable where an agent is unaware of the
   loss. The republican account provided here explains why loss is harmful
   in all three circumstances. The final part of the article argues that
   because privacy is a pre-requisite for effective participation in
   political life, and republicans consider such participation to be the
   essence of self-government and the means through which a polity can
   secure conditions of freedom, in a republican democracy individual
   privacy will be seen as a collective good.},

Abstract = {In legislative studies, a roll rate refers to the proportion of votes
   where a member or group of members is rolledvoting no on a measure that
   passes. Roll rates analysis is a potentially useful tool for evaluating
   arguments that the majority party in the House exercises influence by
   controlling what does and does not make it onto the agenda. Despite its
   promise, so far the use of roll rates to test these arguments has faced
   the problem of observational equivalencethat the predictions of partisan
   theories of agenda control are indistinguishable from those of arguments
   that have no place for parties. I address this problem by calculating
   party-less and partisan counterfactual roll rates data to pin down the
   predictions of these theories. This offers a powerful research design to
   evaluate observed roll rates from sample Congresses. The results provide
   intriguing evidence for partisan theories of the House agenda.},

Abstract = {Currently, Colombia is conducting a peace process that could glimpse the
   peace the country craves. This peace would bring the end of the armed
   conflict but not systematically the end of all kind of violence. To
   ensure the participation and influence of women in this process, it is
   essential to know the current role performed by the Colombian women's
   peace networks. This is the aim of this article.
   This article explores the main ways of political action undertaken by
   Colombian women in peacebuilding. In order to do it, we have analyzed
   the main repertoires of collective action, organizational structure,
   framing processes and impacts of two women's networks - Women's Pacific
   Route and the Initiative of Colombian Women for Peace-. This analysis
   was conducted using qualitative techniques. We have made thus three
   in-depth interviews with the main leaders of each organization studied.
   Our results present what are the differences and similarities between
   both women's networks through the observation of their political
   practices and their relationship with the concepts peace/ conflict; and
   gender/feminism. While for the Pacific Route the articulating axis is
   the feminist movement, for the IMP it is the institutional framework. On
   the other hand, we remarked on identifying civil resistance developed by
   women in the different Colombia's peace processes, the limits found by
   themselves, the strategies to overcome them and the political health of
   these movements.},

Abstract = {Putnam warned over a decade ago that the urge to associate with similar

   at the expense of bridging capital. This study examines balkanization
   with respect to political blogs, investigating to what extent opinions
   in posts and comment sections on blogs associated with the left and
   right are ideologically polarized. We also investigate whether extreme
   opinions tend to co-occur with uncivil discourse aimed at political
   opponents. Finally, this study compares political blogs with a newer
   information source that bridges the gap between old and new
   medianewspaper blogsasking whether polarization and incivility are
   reduced on that platform. A content analysis was conducted of blog
   discussions about a salient political eventOccupy Wall Street. In both
   posts and comments, political blogs were highly polarized and opinion
   extremity and incivility were correlated. However, content on newspaper
   blogs was largely unpolarized and civil.},

Abstract = {This article inquires into the complex process of thought in the human
   mind and its relationship with the identity-formation process at both
   the individual and the communitarian level. Two different traditions of
   discourse, the psychoanalysis of Wilfred Bion and the post-romantic
   philosophical perspective of Emmanuel Levinas are discussed as
   complementary sources of reflection for political theory, especially the
   kind that takes into account the inner world of citizens. Considering
   the bond between the concept of interself and some specific
   circumstances of Bion's biography-such as his enlisting in the two world
   wars-some of his contributions to the theory of thought are analyzed.
   Early identity formation is situated in the context of human group
   interactions and depicted through the notion of mind-group developed by
   Bion, specifically stressing two of the states with major political
   repercussions: the fight/flight and the dependency state of the mind of
   the group. Both are also connected with the exercise of some forms of
   political authority and some specific kinds of authoritarian leadership.
   Last but not least, a call for openness and for infinite alterity, both
   in a metaphysical and a materialist sense, are considered through the
   Levinasian concept of the other, which, in turn, tends to be the very
   foundation of respect and unselfish ties between citizens.},

Abstract = {In recent years, issues concerning the future of multiethnic Sweden and
   particularly the situation in multiethnic suburbs have become a salient
   feature in Swedish politics. One important actor in recent years'
   debates about the challenges facing multiethnic Sweden is the Swedish
   Liberal Party. Since the general election of 2002, the party has gained
   both publicity and electoral support by focusing on issues of
   integration of migrants and urban segregation in terms of assimilation
   and intensified demands targeted at the migrant others. In this article,
   the party's developments in the early 2000s in the areas of integration
   and urban policy are analyzed within the framework of two general
   processes in contemporary politics: the politics of racialization and
   the medialization of politics. The party's interventions in the area of
   integration and urban policy are built on an intimate as well as complex
   interplay between racialization and medialization. The agenda
   articulated by the party, further, has several similarities with the
   agenda of ``authoritarian populist{''} movements throughout Europe.},

Abstract = {This article analyses exposure to different sources of campaign
   information, and their effects on citizens' feeling of being informed
   about referendums. The analysis is based on an innovative rolling panel
   study that allows for a rigorous tracking of campaign dynamics in the
   run-up to the referendum. Using a referendum on a large-scale
   infrastructure project in the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg,
   empirical findings show that official information provided by the
   government had the greatest effect in reaching citizens and also had the
   strongest impact on their feeling of being informed. The article
   demonstrates that the state plays a crucial role in providing an
   appropriate information environment prior to a referendum. (C) 2015

Abstract = {In the contemporary political environment, the added value brought by
   leaders to the electoral performance of the parties appears to be
   significant and growing. However, the impact of leader evaluations on
   the vote choice is likely to vary from one voter to another. This
   article explores the influence of voter characteristics on the magnitude
   of leader effects in the context of the 2012 legislative elections in
   Romania. Five such characteristics are considered: objective political
   knowledge, subjective political information, party identification,
   political engagement, and time of voting decision. For this purpose, the
   paper employs data from the 2012 Romanian Election Studies (RES)
   three-wave panel survey. The analyses prove a significant influence of
   political knowledge and party identification and negligible effects of
   the other three voter characteristics considered. Thus, political
   knowledge appears to stimulate the manifestation of leader effects.
   Similarly, voters holding partisan ties appear to experience higher
   levels of personalization. The implications of these findings are
   discussed extensively.},

Abstract = {Between 6 and 10 August 2011, acts of violence and civil disobedience
   occurred in 66 locations across London and other cities in England.
   Initial responses from politicians and the press sought to explain why
   the riots were happening and what responses were necessary. This paper
   shows how the depoliticised actions of rioters were redefined as a
   politicised problem, symbolic of a sick society that could be cured by
   Conservative social policy. This paper explores the nuanced discursive
   and paradoxical mechanisms of right-wing newspapers. I argue that
   ideological consistencies operating beyond the foreground and immediacy
   of individual texts override the appearance of discursive contradiction
   across longitudinal contexts.},

   Effects of Targeted Social Assistance in Latin America},

Volume = {48},

Abstract = {In this article, we study how social assistance shapes election results
   across Latin America. Case studies in several countries have found
   electoral effects, yet it remains unclear whether and how effects vary
   cross-nationally, and whether electoral effects are due to mobilization
   or persuasion. We theorize that programs mobilize non-voters and convert
   the opposition simultaneously, but that the effects vary based on
   country-level political and programmatic differences. Using 2012
   AmericasBarometer data, we develop a unified cross-national model that
   confirms that public assistance makes recipients more likely to turn out
   and, once at the polls, to vote for the incumbent. Compulsory voting
   laws and program politicization magnify the electoral effects of social
   assistance, but effects do not vary by presidential ideology or program
   conditionalities. These findings are consistent with the perspective
   that Latin American voters are boundedly rational, retrospective agents
   whose behavioral choices depend on their resources and environmental
   context.},

Abstract = {The recent waves of immigration towards Europe are questioning our
   capacity to embrace Otherness, despite the well-acclaimed
   multiculturalism and hybridisation upon which Western societies have
   been built. Tension is building fast along the perceived `explosion' of
   borders, and many immigrants are excluded from civic and political
   participation through discrimination, racism and xenophobia. The
   marginal positions of such minorities render them easily identifiable as
   scapegoats, susceptible to blame for problems that are, in fact,
   domestic. This article will investigate the mechanisms of power that
   still inform and redirect our immigration policies by looking at how the
   idea of `Otherness' is embraced and understood. Desired outcomes include
   the opportunity to critically debate the relationship between
   citizenship and multiculturalism from a transnational perspective that
   privileges the practices of hybridisation and permeability against the
   ethnically oriented preservation of cultures.},

   Among Catholics},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},

Volume = {37},

Pages = {441-463},

Abstract = {This paper explains changes in partisanship among Catholics in the last
   quarter of the 20th Century using a theory of partisan change centered
   on the contexts in which Catholics lived. Catholics were part of the
   post-New Deal Democratic coalition, but they have become a swing
   demographic group. We argue that these changes in partisanship are best
   explained by changes in elite messages that are filtered through an
   individual's social network. Those Catholics who lived or moved into the
   increasingly Republican suburbs and South were the Catholics who were
   most likely to adopt a non-Democratic partisan identity. Changes in
   context better explain Catholic partisanship than party abortion policy
   post Roe v. Wade or ideological sorting. We demonstrate evidence in
   support of our argument using the ANES cumulative file from 1972 through
   2000.},

Abstract = {Under President Obama, over 80 percent of states have received executive
   approval for waivers from the No Child Left Behind Act in the absence of
   Congressional reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education
   Act (ESEA). These comprehensive ESEA waivers have been quite ambitious,
   in that they were designed to address broad changes in K-12 education in
   nearly all fifty states and not in response to specific-state concerns
   or to foster experimentation on a focused set of issues. In reviewing
   the actual state implementation, we found that the Obama administration
   has enjoyed substantial success in using the waiver process to leverage
   states to adopt policy changes. But there are limits, as seen in the
   difficulties the administration has encountered in leveraging changes in
   teacher and principal evaluation, and inducing changes in student
   learning and performance standards. The major obstacles to the
   accomplishment of administration objectives are internal state political
   dynamics.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {42},

Abstract = {South Africa's 2009 election featured competition between the ruling
   African National Congress (ANC), the steadily improving Democratic
   Alliance (DA), and the newly formed ANC splinter party, the Congress of
   the People (COPE). In 2009, national-level parties faced the same
   strategic imperative as in previous elections: to gain support among the
   Black majority. But the emergence of COPE had potentially important
   implications for election strategy. Competition was no longer only
   between the liberation party (the ANC) and the successor of an
   apartheid-era party (the DA). COPE had its own set of liberation-linked
   leaders that presented a new challenge to both the ANC and the DA. This
   paper examines the main parties' use of candidate lists, voter outreach,
   and campaign rhetoric to target the Black majority in 2009. It updates
   and expands previous studies of racial politics in South Africa,
   providing novel empirical data on the campaign tactics of the ANC, DA,
   and COPE.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},

Volume = {48},
Number = {6},
Pages = {691-727},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The responsiveness of policy to election results is a central component
   of democracy. Do the outcomes of autocratic elections also affect policy
   choice? Even when the threat of turnover is low, I argue that autocratic
   elections influence policy by allowing citizens to signal
   dissatisfaction with the regime. Supplementing existing work, this study
   explains how this opposition is communicated credibly and then shows
   that ruling parties use this information to calibrate policy
   concessions. In the first cross-country analysis of autocratic election
   outcomes and policy choice, I find that negative electoral shocks to
   ruling parties predict increases in education and social welfare
   spending and decreases in military spending following elections. In
   contrast, there is no policy effect leading up to elections, in response
   to violent contestation, or in resource-rich regimes, illustrating a
   potential mechanism for the resource curse.},

Abstract = {Scholars have noted the rise of religious lobbying groups in Washington,
   as these entities have sought to influence the policy process and the
   discourse surrounding political issues. This article seeks to determine
   whether progressive groups are evolving into sophisticated political
   actors, focusing on how they promote values that would resonate in the
   current economic climate. Using a qualitative framing analysis, I
   examine the issue campaigns of progressive and conservative Christian
   organizations around the budget to determine how they use faith-based
   arguments to defend their positions on social welfare spending and the
   role of government. Drawing from interest group and social movement
   literature, particularly the use of collective action frames, I look at
   the ways these groups define problems inherent in debates about the
   budget or national debt, attribute blame, propose solutions and mobilize
   people of faith. My findings demonstrate that progressive groups have
   capitalized on the salience of economic issues and implemented public
   campaigns that encourage lawmakers to view the budget as a moral
   document. They have helped to ensure their long-term survival by
   appealing to potential members and re-defining the budget as a religious
   issue that merits political action from people of faith. This study also
   adds to our understanding of religious organizations and how they
   operate similarly to other lobbying groups by framing issues for their
   target constituency and mobilizing against competing interests.},

Abstract = {This article explores how Frank Aiken's (1898-1983) later political
   career was shaped by his experiences during the Irish revolutionary
   period (1916-1923). One of the central arguments is that it was Aiken's
   experience of the internecine violence of the civil war which led him to
   exercise more caution (relative to the new generation of Fianna Fail
   ministers) in dealing with the outbreak of the `new' Troubles in
   Northern Ireland in 1969. Aiken's experience of UN diplomacy is compared
   with that of his successor Patrick Hillery, and his role both inside and
   outside the cabinet, in shaping official government policy towards
   Northern Ireland at the start of the Troubles, is examined against that
   of the new post-revolutionary generation, many of whom broke from
   Aiken's stance on armed struggle, failing to appreciate the consequences
   of a new civil war erupting north of the border.},

Abstract = {The 2012 challenge to the Affordable Care Act was an unusual opportunity
   for people to form or reassess opinions about the Supreme Court. We
   utilize panel data coupled with as-if random assignment to reports that
   Chief Justice Roberts's decision was politically motivated to
   investigate the microfoundations of the Court's legitimacy.
   Specifically, we test the effects of changes in individuals' ideological
   congruence with the Court and exposure to the nonlegalistic account of
   the decision. We find that both affect perceptions of the Court's
   legitimacy. Moreover, we show that these mechanisms interact in
   important ways and that prior beliefs that the Court is a legalistic
   institution magnify the effect of updating one's ideological proximity
   to the Court. While we demonstrate that individuals can and did update
   their views for multiple reasons, we also highlight constraints that
   allow for aggregate stability in spite of individual-level change.},

Abstract = {A wide range of literature on ethnic conflict and terrorism has argued
   that domestic competition increases the likelihood that a political
   organization will use violence in an effort to distinguish itself. Known
   as ``outbidding,{''} empirical evidence for such a phenomenon has thus
   far been limited. The bulk of the empirical analysis, however, has
   focused on the effect of domestic competition on the quantity of
   violence. This study instead argues that competition should have an
   observable effect on the quality of violence, as organizations seek to
   differentiate their ``brand{''} from others. Using information on the
   tactics and targets of terrorist attacks, the results suggest that an
   increase in the competitiveness of a political market leads to more
   severe or ``shocking{''} types of attacks.},

Abstract = {The Strategy for the Danube Region adopted in 2011 is the European
   Union's second macro-regional strategy after the Baltic Sea Strategy. It
   is supposed to facilitate transnational policymaking between Danube
   states and societies in fields such as the transport industry, economic
   development, environmental protection, and cultural cooperation.
   However, the EU has provided little in the way of financial resources
   and has created no new institutions. Even if regional cooperation has
   yet to improve, the regional actors nonetheless have adjusted to the
   strategy. Better coordination and greater cooperation are to be
   expected.},

Volume = {65},

Pages = {73+},

Abstract = {Anti-Americanism in Russia is part of a deep resentment and a collective
   negative identity. Its particular character lies in the historic
   conflation of anti-Western ideas with the communist ideology of the
   Stalin Era and the final decades of the Soviet Union. In the current
   image of America, all of those layers that accumulated in the collective
   subconscious during the Soviet totalitarianism can be exposed. The Putin
   system's propaganda uses this with virtuosity. Ever since the
   demonstrations against the rigged Russian elections in the winter of
   2011, and especially after Russia's annexation of Crimea and the war in
   Donbas, anti-Americanism has become a core element of authoritarian
   rule. Anti-Americanism provides the basis for the mobilisation of the
   population and the consolidation of the regime.},

Title = {The Economic Origins of Entrenched Judicial Review},
Journal = {STUDIES IN AMERICAN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-22},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article proposes a new explanation for the origins of entrenched
   judicial review, or judicial review supported by supermajority
   constitutional amendment requirements. The explanation is based on ex
   ante levels of economic inequality: Where economic inequality is higher,
   economic elites have more to lose from the advent of majority rule.
   These elites will have both greater incentives and greater ability to
   resist or check institutions responsive to popular majorities. We may
   then be more likely to see the adoption of less democratically
   responsive institutions, like entrenched judicial review, where more
   unequal wealth and income distributions are threatened by majority rule.
   The theory is consistent with the qualitative historical record from
   several former British colonies, including that of the United States. It
   also finds considerable support in an econometric analysis of the
   presence of entrenched judicial review in the first year of continuous
   democracy for those former European colonies that had become democracies
   by 2008, where pre-independence European mortality rates are used as a
   proxy for pre-independence economic inequality. These findings suggest
   that the adoption of entrenched judicial review in democracies may have
   been motivated at least in part because of its anticipated protection
   for higher levels of economic inequality.},

Abstract = {Since the establishment of the Xi Jinping administration, China's
   diplomacy has undergone significant changes while adopting many legacies
   of the previous times. It has increasingly manifested the diplomatic
   thinking of a great rising nation, strategic designs which keep pace
   with the times, and strong measures to tackle new challenges as well as
   to promote favorable changes for China's continuing development. With a
   review of the historical background and current situations faced by
   China, this paper closely examines the innovations and improvement of
   China's diplomatic thinking, the characteristics of China's current
   diplomatic strategy, and the new features of China's diplomatic
   practice. It is concluded that, despite the large advance in China's
   diplomatic thinking, strategies and practice, they need to be further
   theorized, institutionalized and operationalized, in order to fulfill
   the varying tasks under the rapidly changing domestic and international
   environments.},

Abstract = {A central topic in the comparative-politics subdiscipline is the study
   of democratic transitions. Despite a growing role-playing literature,
   there are currently no simulations that illustrate the dynamics of
   democratic transitions. This article proposes a role-playing simulation
   that demonstrates to students why it is difficult for countries to
   transition to democracy and why protests are a necessary but not
   sufficient condition to topple a dictatorship. As surveys and teaching
   evaluations subsequently showed, this exercise succeeded in clarifying
   the more difficult theoretical concepts as well as in making a
   potentially dry subject more accessible.},

Abstract = {Why do citizens vary in their perceptions about the frequency of
   corruption? We hypothesize that those most harmed by corruption-the
   socioeconomically disadvantaged-should perceive corruption to be more
   frequent. Using multiple cross-national surveys, we find that the poor
   and the uneducated tend to perceive higher levels of corruption than the
   wealthy and the well educated. However, this relationship only holds in
   countries at high levels of economic development. In poorer countries,
   the statistical relationship is much weaker and sometimes runs in the
   opposite direction.},

Abstract = {Historically, the supposed independence of unions from parties in France
   has been a myth, with the development of close relations between the CGT
   and the PCF, on the one hand, and looser ones between the CFDT in
   particular and the PS, on the other. These links weakened from the 1980s
   on, but appeared to be re-established, with some changes, when unions
   backed Francois Hollande in the 2012 presidential elections. The decline
   of the PCF and the rallying of unions behind Hollande appeared to signal
   the possibility of a social democratic bloc in France. However, in
   reality, this is a temporary and unstable phenomenon as few mutual
   benefits can be assured by either unions or the Socialist Party through
   the creation of more stable union-party links. The explanations for this
   are structural, ideational and contingent.},

Abstract = {This article critically engages with the work of Eric Voegelin, a
   thinker who, for the most part, has remained neglected. Against this
   neglect the claim is advanced that Voegelin' s thought should be taken
   heed of, not least from thinkers who register themselves in the radical
   tradition of political theory. At the same time, however, it is argued
   that any positive appropriation of Voegelin from a radical perspective
   has to put under critical scrutiny basic assumptions informing his
   thought, and above all his conception of the body. In particular, the
   argument put forward is that Voegelin's impoverished conceptualization
   of the body constitutes a real problem for his thought, and specifically
   one that underscores his dismissive attitude toward political
   radicalism. Subsequently, through a presentation of recent theoretical
   discussions of the body, a more positive conception of embodied being is
   sought for, which can lay open the radical dynamic of Voegelin's
   participatory ontology.},

Abstract = {The protection of Water Rights has been the main objective of the most
   relevant social movements in Bolivia in the recent times. Their
   continuous violation has caused a fracture in the social dynamic, giving
   way to a conflict that has contributed to an empowerment of the lower
   class facing abuses of the government. These social movements have
   mobilized not only to stop the occasional violation of Water Rights, but
   furthermore to lay the foundations of a Constituent Assembly, working
   towards the total reform of the Constitution, including in it a wide
   spectrum of protection mechanisms for Water Rights. All this has led to
   the rethinking of public policy in order to realize said rights,
   motivating a big inversion and jurisdictional protection. However,
   conflicts of access and protection persist and still are a tremendous
   public concern.},

Abstract = {The EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and Common Security
   and Defence Policy (CSDP) occupy a unique space in EU governance. Both
   policies have supranational elements, yet their formally
   intergovernmental status shields them from the increased scrutiny powers
   granted to national parliaments after Lisbon. National parliamentary
   scrutiny of these policy areas has thus received relatively little
   attention. Using an analytical framework of `authority, ability and
   attitude', this paper argues that attitude, meaning MPs' willingness to
   scrutinise CFSP, is the most important factor in explaining the
   empirical variation in the quantity and quality of national
   parliamentary scrutiny of CFSP. Drawing on qualitative research and
   interviews conducted as part of the OPAL project, the paper demonstrates
   that formal powers do not, in practice, equate to `strong' scrutiny,
   arguing that the strongest parliaments are those that make CFSP scrutiny
   a systematic, normalised and culturally accepted part of
   parliamentarians' everyday work.},

Abstract = {Dynastic politicians, defined as those whose family members have also
   served in the same position in the past, occupy a sizable portion of
   offices in many parts of the world. We develop a model of how dynastic
   politicians with inherited political advantages affect electoral
   outcomes and policy choices. Our model predicts that, as compared with
   non-dynastic legislators, dynastic legislators bring more distributions
   to the district, enjoy higher electoral success, and harm the economic
   performance of the districts, despite the larger amount of distributive
   benefits they bring. We test the implications of the model using data

Abstract = {Do campaigns encouraging constituents to contact their legislator
   influence public policy? We answer this question with a field experiment
   in which Michigan state legislators are randomly assigned to be
   contacted by their constituents about a specific bill or to a control
   group. The field experimental design allows us to produce internally and
   externally valid estimates of the effects on legislative voting of a
   campaign in which constituents are urged to contact their legislator.
   The estimated effect is substantial: being targeted by constituent

Abstract = {How are regulatory disputes between the major powers resolved? Existing
   literature generally characterizes such regulatory disagreements as
   system clash, in which national systems of regulation come into
   conflict, so that one sets the global standard, and the other adjusts or
   is marginalized. In this article, we offer an alternative account, which
   bridges early literature on interdependence with work from Historical
   Institutionalism in comparative politics. We argue that rule overlap
   creates opportunities for regulatory actors to develop transnational
   alliances in support of an alternative institutional agenda. Over time,
   the resulting cross-national layers have the potential to transform
   domestic institutions and in turn global rules. International regulatory
   disputes are less discrete international conflicts between sovereign
   jurisdictions than ongoing battles among regulatory actors within
   jurisdictions (and alliances across them). We examine two critical issue
   areassurveillance information sharing and accounting standardswhich
   allow us to contrast our argument against standard accounts emphasizing
   veto points and switching costs, respectively.},

Abstract = {While the act of adopting a new portfolio raises a number of interesting
   queries, little attention has been paid to portfolio adoption, what
   motivates and what conditions predicate it. The Canadian case provides
   an excellent laboratory to test some broadly held assumptions about
   portfolio adoption, particularly given the contrast of the ten
   provinces' unique political cultures with their shared jurisdictional
   roles. We illustrate our case using a dataset that contains information
   on 85 portfolio adoptions in the Canadian provinces since 1982. Findings
   suggest little by way of a clear set of partisan or institutional
   motivations for portfolio adoption, although there is some evidence that
   governments are more likely to adopt portfolios in the first 100 days of
   governing and they are more likely to do so when elected with larger
   caucuses, possibly because of the need to find larger roles for party
   loyalists.},

Abstract = {We investigate whether Maine and Arizona's Clean Elections laws, which
   provide public funding for state legislative candidates, are responsible
   for producing a new cadre of legislators who are unusually ideologically
   extreme. We find that there is essentially no important difference in
   the legislative voting behavior of clean funded legislators and
   traditionally funded ones in either Arizona or Maine: those who are
   financed by private donors are no more or less ideologically extreme
   than those who are supported by the state. This finding calls into
   question some concerns about the effects on polarization of money
   generally and public funding in particular.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the emergence of self-conscious Muslim identities a
   decade after 9/11 within a generally inclusive Scottish context.
   Qualitative fieldwork conducted among Muslims in Edinburgh between 2011
   and 2013 suggests that Islam has come to the foreground of Muslims'
   multiple identities as a force that unites an ethno-culturally diverse
   community in a historical moment of perceived threat and exclusion.
   Muslims challenge the global post-9/11 negative climate and find in
   Islam a powerful tool of individual and collective survival. The global
   stigmatization of Muslimness has local ramifications in, but is not a
   specific function of, Scotland. Instead, Scotland generally appears to
   be a place of relative tolerance in which proudly Scottish Muslims can
   express their Muslimness with a certain degree of freedom. Scotland
   promotes a uniquely Scottish experience to be Muslim and acts as a

Abstract = {Japan, like most of the developed world, faces demographic shortfalls
   brought on by a rapidly aging society with a long life expectancy and
   low birth rate. Where other Western countries have used increased
   immigration to help fight these tendencies, immigration rates in Japan
   remain much lower. Using nationally representative survey data, this
   article digs deeper into public opinion on immigration, testing contact,
   and group threat theories. We test a variety of social and demographic
   variables to see what is associated with attitudes regarding increased
   immigration and if there have been any obvious changes over time. We
   find that English conversation ability is strongly associated with
   positive perceptions toward immigrants in Japan. This provides some
   evidence of basic, superficial contact working to reduce the negative
   image of immigrants in the Japanese case.},

Abstract = {In contrast to the disadvantage that economists and international donors
   often see as stemming from smallness, political scientists have a
   relatively equivocal view of the normative implications of size on
   democratic performance. Largely, studies interested in the correlation
   between size and democratization focus on the persistence and quality
   (or depth) of democratic norms and claim either that small is beautiful
   or that it is despotic. In this article I take a different approach.
   Rather than attempting to measure the impact of size on democratic
   outcomes, I provide a nuanced description of how it shapes political
   life by drawing on the views, experiences, and reflections of
   politicians in the Pacific Islands. Based on this ``insider view{''} of
   politics, I highlight the centrality of family and kin to political
   dynamics and discuss their relevance to ideas like consensus and
   oversight, and persistent critiques about ostracism and corruption. I
   conclude by arguing that smallness provides mixed blessings - it is
   neither entirely beautiful nor endemically despotic.},

Abstract = {The Natal Indian Congress (NIC) was revived in 1971 in the context of
   what has become known as the `Durban moment'. This period also witnessed
   the emergence of the Black Consciousness Movement and an independent
   trade union movement inspired by the 1973 Durban strikes. Despite a
   government crackdown and opposition from anti-apartheid groups that
   asserted that ethnic identities were a relic of the past, the NIC
   attracted younger activists through the 1970s and by the early 1980s,
   had survived the banning and detention of its leadership to become
   involved in civic struggles over housing and education, and in
   mobilizing against government-created political structures. It also
   played a pivotal role in the United Democratic Front formed in 1983.
   This did not mean that the NIC was monolithic. The 1980s spawned vibrant
   and often vicious debates within the NIC over participation in
   government-created structures, allegations of cabals and, as democracy
   dawned, differing opinions of the future of an organization that first
   came into being in the last decade of the nineteenth century. In
   critically interrogating this crucial period between 1980 and 1994, when
   mass-based struggle was renewed, two states of emergency were imposed
   and apartheid eventually ended, this article adds to the growing
   historiography of the anti-apartheid struggle by focusing on an
   important but neglected aspect of that story. It focuses on the internal
   workings of the NIC and the relationship between the NIC, the emergent
   Mass Democratic Movement and the African National Congress (ANC) in the
   context of broader political and economic changes.},

Abstract = {To date, electoral systems are conceptualised as setting an upper bound'
   to, or defining a carrying capacity' for, the number of parties or
   lists, and their effect is assessed at the district level. This article
   adds to the empirical study of electoral systems by analysing a vast
   database of district-level electoral returns. The argument focuses on
   the demand and supply of viable electoral candidates, which are
   conditioned by the interplay of strategic entry (by the party rank and
   file) and strategic voting (by the electorate). Drawing on a database of
   almost 18,000 electoral districts taken from 15 West European countries,
   the empirical analysis yields a number of insights: most specifically,
   (1) district magnitude only becomes binding and effective when a higher
   social demand meets a lower carrying capacity of the electoral district;
   (2) the provision of upper tiers undermines the emergence of Duvergerian
   equilibria within the primary electoral districts.},

Abstract = {Montenegro is the only European post-communist country governed by the
   same party - the Democratic Party of Socialists - since the introduction
   of political pluralism. Thought-provoking as such, this appears even
   more puzzling in light of the radical transformation that the party
   underwent during this period. Once the pillar of the Montenegrin hybrid
   regime, the DPS played the key role in the country's democratization,
   subsequent to the 1997 split within its leadership. Moreover, being the
   most vocal advocate of a state federation with Serbia for more than a
   decade, it became the main political force behind the renewal of
   Montenegrin independence. This article seeks to contribute to a better
   understanding of this unique and understudied post-communist political
   phenomenon. It argues that the DPS's longevity in power has been
   determined by two factors. In the earlier non-democratic governing
   phase, it was the considerably high level of the party's
   institutionalization that brought about its political supremacy. In the
   following period, the party managed to monopolize the idea of
   Montenegrin sovereignty, thus acquiring a significant amount of
   political legitimacy. The article uses the explaining outcome process
   tracing method that attempts to craft a minimally sufficient explanation
   of an outcome by combining theoretical and case-specific mechanisms.},

Abstract = {This article presents the results of a pilot study of social networking
   among immigrants in different types of local contexts. Although
   systematic research and conclusive evidence is lacking, previous studies
   suggest that civil society is differently organized in urban
   environments than it is in rural environments. If accurate, this
   suggestion implies that variation in local context is a decisive factor
   in the patterning of social networking among immigrants and,
   consequently, a decisive factor in the degree of inclusion of immigrants
   into civil society. In our research material we observe (1) that among
   first-generation immigrants a differentiation of social networking along
   the rural-urban continuum does exist and (2) that the historical
   backgrounds of both the receiving community and the recent
   immigrants-including the immigrants' motives for immigrating-are
   important to the success of networking activities. These findings show
   the need for further research into the co-variation of social
   networking, local context, and civil society structures.},

Abstract = {The Bolsa Familia Program goal is to promote social development and
   poverty reduction, through the direct transfer of conditional cash, in
   association with other social programs. This study aims to analyze
   whether Bolsa Familia had an association with children's school
   attendance, which is one of the educational conditions of the program.
   Our main hypothesis is that children living in households receiving
   Bolsa Familia had greater chances of attending school. Data from the
   Ministry of Social Development and Combating Famine indicated that
   children living in households with Bolsa Familia had greater school
   enrolment levels. By using data from the 2010 Demographic Census,
   collected by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE),
   some descriptive analyzes and binary logistic regression models were
   performed for different thresholds of household per capita income. These
   estimates were made by comparing children who lived in households
   receiving Bolsa Familia to those children not receiving the program. We
   took into consideration characteristics about the household, mothers,
   and children. The results were clustered by the municipality of
   residence of the child. In all income thresholds, children benefiting
   from Bolsa Familia were more likely to be enrolled in school, compared
   to children not receiving the benefit.},

Abstract = {This paper is a case study of Eastern European immigrant women's social
   inclusion in Portugal through civic participation. An analysis of
   interviews conducted with women leaders and members of two ethnic
   associations provides a unique insight into their migrant pathways as
   highly educated women and the ways in which these women are constructing
   their citizenship in new contexts in Northern Portugal. These women's
   accounts of their immigrant experience embrace both the public realm, in
   using their own education and their children's as a means of integration
   but also spill over into `non-public' familial relationships at home in
   contradictory ways. These include the sometimes traditional,
   gender-defined division of labour within the associations and at home
   and the new ways that they negotiate their relative autonomies to escape
   forms of violence and subordination that they face as women and
   immigrants.},

Abstract = {What are the factors founding the specificity and the singularity of
   European Integration? To what extent does the European experience shed
   light on regionalization patterns observed in other parts of the world,
   and vice-versa?
   In order to be properly assessed, regionalization processes need to be
   contextualized. By this we mean that the spatial, temporal and cultural
   dimensions shaping the political interests, meanings and behavioral
   investments in regionalization are at the core of their understanding.
   The following pages develop the implications of this claim in the
   perspective formalized in particular by Charles Tilly and Robert Goodin.
   Variations in regional institutions across continents largely stems from
   the impact of local circumstances. What are these contextual effects and
   how do they operate ? This what we try to clarify in the European case.
   Effects of location and temporality jointly combine to explain in this
   perspective the unicity and singularity of regional integration in
   Europe.},

Title = {An overview of Law 19/2014 of 29 December, on transparency, access to
   public information and good governance},
Journal = {ACTIVITAT PARLAMENTARIA},
Year = {2015},
Number = {28},
Pages = {53-71},
Abstract = {In recent years, citizens have become aware that public information is
   vital to participating in public affairs, monitoring the institutions
   managing them, and preventing and fighting against corruption. This
   explains why social pressure to access this public information has
   increased gradually, and why, after a long wait, it has obtained an
   appropriate regulatory response.
   In this context, the new law on transparency, access to public
   information and good governance both on the part of the basic state
   legislator (Law 19/2013) and the Catalan Parliament (Law 19/2014),
   represents the adjustment of the domestic legal order to international
   standards. In particular, it means enshrining the right of access to
   public information as a new subjective right of citizens, which is
   usually deemed to be essentially fundamental. Law 19/2014 of 29
   December, on transparency, access to public information and good
   governance, has outweighed the basic state law in terms of power and
   ambition, and is set to have a major impact on institutions and society
   as a whole. It is undoubtedly one of the most important laws passed by
   the Catalan Parliament in many years, and one that will mark a turning
   point in Catalan public law.
   In the article, the author analyses two essential pillars of this law.
   The first is active advertising, involving a duty to publish public
   information automatically without citizens having to ask explicitly.
   Second is the right of access to public information, which is
   established as a new subjective right of citizens covered extensively in
   Catalan law, although with legal limitations allowing the denial of full
   or partial access when it could clearly damage other legally protected
   goods or interests, including the necessary protection of personal data.
   The interaction and balance between these rights will pose significant
   challenges, both in the theoretical and practical enforcement of the
   legal provisions.
   The article also highlights the relationship that transparency and
   access to public information have with ``good governance{''}, which is
   identified in the Law with the ethical behaviour of senior officials,
   quality public services and quality regulations, and ``open
   government{''}, in reference to increasing interaction between citizens
   and government. Other sections in this analysis of the new law are
   related to the regulation of lobbies or interest groups, and the
   establishment of a system of guarantees. This includes the creation of
   the Committee for the Guarantee of the Right of Access to Public
   Information and the provision of a specific sanctioning regime and
   techniques for internal and external assessment of the Law.
   In conclusion, the article discusses the challenges posed in the
   deployment and enforcement of Law 19/2014 by the Government, from
   investing in technological solutions to developing new formal and
   informal procedures, and creating awareness among and training officials
   and civil servants.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-43},
Abstract = {This article examines the contemporary theoretical approaches that
   combine Holocaust studies and genocide studies, and the historiography
   of the Holocaust with the German occupation of eastern Europe. It
   analyses the sources of the idea, long dominant in Israeli
   historiography and among Jewish historians in the United States, that
   the Holocaust was an event of unique historical significance, as well as
   the crisis that has beset this perspective since the beginning of the
   twenty-first century. The place of the national-martyrological view of
   the Holocaust has been taken by new ideas that seek to incorporate the
   Holocaust into a broader history of the twentieth century. The article's
   premise is that the current trend of writing about the Holocaust as part
   of genocide studies offers only a partial answer to the need to write an
   integrated history of the Holocaust. It must be supplemented by the
   development of an approach that incorporates Holocaust studies into the
   broader national context of the countries and societies in which it took
   place, particularly eastern Europe, where European Jews were murdered
   alongside millions of members of the other nations that lived in the
   region.},

Abstract = {Antecedents and consequences of candidate ambivalence are studied at the
   example of the 2013 German federal election. Applying a different
   ambivalence measure than previous German surveys, a rather high level of
   ambivalence is demonstrated. Despite synthesizing previous theoretical
   approaches, the individual-specific antecedents of ambivalence remain
   ill-understood. Future research should instead focus on temporal,
   contextual, or object-specific aspects.
   Individual ambivalence about a candidate affects the evaluation of this
   person and the voting decision. First, ambivalence reduces the extremity
   of candidate evaluation. Second, persons with ambivalent attitudes are
   more likely not to prefer any of the two chancellor candidates.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to interrogate the concept of global citizenship
   through the disruptive lens of the American expatriate. The goal of this
   inquiry is to use empirical research done on American expatriates,
   including the results of a survey conducted by the authors, to better
   understand issues of citizenship and politics amongst American
   expatriates. The theoretical literature on citizenship and
   transnationalism argues that immigrants and expatriates help challenge
   the hegemony of the nation-state, a claim that can be tested by
   investigating how expatriates view their own experiences. By juxtaposing
   the empirical work of researchers focused on American expats with the
   theoretical work of citizenship and globalization theorists, we find
   that political affinity and national identity continue to matter for
   those living outside the USA, but within a larger global context. Thus,
   if the path envisioned by those who embrace globalization is to be
   followed, how might concepts of citizenship and national policy towards
   their citizens need to change?},

Abstract = {All voting is strategic because the shared outcomes are not within the
   choice set of any voter, the elements of which can only be strategies.
   Voting behavior need not reflect the individual's ordering of outcomes,
   and the conventional distinction between sincere and sophisticated
   voting is misguided. In voting choice, the ordinal ranking of outcomes
   must be supplemented by intrapersonal evaluation of utility differences
   among these outcomes and also by predictions concerning the behavior of
   other participants in the nexus of interdependence.},

Pages = {47+},
Abstract = {This paper analyzes how competing networks of disaster studies emerged
   in different national settings, disciplinary contexts, and historical
   periods. It combines two different but interconnected qualitative and
   historical pieces of research on the transnationalization of disasters
   at various scales and places. It shows how seismology and
   American-centered disaster studies first shaped international
   understandings of disasters during the Cold War era, with
   hazard-oriented research projects focused on natural disasters. In the
   late 1970s, development studies and geography contested the former
   approaches. This criticism flourished in Latin America in the 1980s,
   where social scientists promoted notions of root causes and
   vulnerability. From the 1990s onwards, the social sciences increasingly
   shaped international disaster policies, rendering disasters less
   ``natural{''} and more ``social.{''} This, in turn, contributed to the
   development of disaster studies in other parts of the world, such as
   South Africa. This connected history of disaster studies reveals how
   disasters were interpreted differently by various disciplines.
   Furthermore, the comparison between regions enables changes to these
   configurations according to global political and scientific contexts.
   Taking into account different scales and places sheds light on the
   competition between sciences entangled in a conflict over the power to
   define disasters at different moments (the Cold War, developmentalism,
   and climate change).},

Journal = {ANALECTA POLITICA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Number = {8},

Abstract = {This paper is a result of a research that explores the social relations
   of paramilitar ex-combatants in places where they developed their social
   re-insertion processes. The methodology used the collection of
   testimonies and observation throughout five years of ethnographic work
   and interviews done to key informants in Moravia, Medellin - Colombia.
   This paper aims first to elucidate the conditions of production and
   reproduction of domination relations previous to the re-insertion
   process; second to understand the social perception of paramilitary
   power in neighborhoods posterior to their re-insertion process; and,
   third to identify the reasons that allow acceptance or rejection to this
   type of social domination. In order to do this, the established social
   relations between paramilitary ex-combatants and non-combatants are
   analyzed taking into account the post-conflict scenario. The results
   show that ex-combatants are simultaneously identified as violent
   subjects and warrants of the functioning of different parts of local
   life; that is, as non-formal agents of social control that create a
   non-formal and sense of order that co-exists in a non-conflictive form
   with the legal order. One of the main conclusions indicate that local
   counterinsurgency social control implemented by the paramilitary groups
   in have been exercised throughout time, even after the re-insertion
   process, because it is based on the population's fear and the socially
   known discourses.},

Abstract = {Using mixed methods this paper explores issue salience and the policy
   framing associated with the substantive representation of ethnic
   minorities. Its focus is party programmes in Westminster (1964-2010) and
   Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish elections (1998-2011). The analysis
   reveals a significant increase in issue salience driven by parties of
   the Left. This applies to both state-wide and meso-elections, thereby
   providing evidence of political reprioritisation in the wake of ethnic
   minority activism in the 1970s and 1980s. At the meso-level new
   political opportunity structures are shown to be leading to the
   territorialisation of policy. However, the analysis also reveals
   significant shortcomings, including parties' failure to adopt a
   systematic approach consistent with the post-1997 discourse on
   mainstreaming.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that social policies work towards the subject-making
   of subaltern citizens by defining the grammar of state-subaltern
   relationship. The Forest Rights Act of India (2006) defines the
   state-adivasi relationship through a two-way process: claim-making by
   the indigenes for forest rights, and reduction of the discourse by the
   state into a politics of recognition without redistribution. While
   adivasis have employed their agency in wresting social policies from the
   state through protracted struggles, they are also made subjects of the
   state as they go about the Forest Rights Act procedure. The paper
   further points out that adivasi struggles and the organisations
   representing them constitute a distinct adivasi society contra the
   middle-class civil society. Though the spirit of the Act envisages
   substantive redistribution, the state institutions and the monitoring
   Non-Governmental Organisations have yet to adopt redistribution as a
   core narrative.},

Abstract = {This article examines, under the light of international law, African
   states' fascination and fall out with the ICC. It examines the challenge
   to international institutions and to international justice for high
   crimes posed by the quasi-supranational African Union's (AU) emergent
   practice of ordering its member states parties not to co-operate with
   ICC arrest warrants against African heads of states/governments. The
   legal substance of the AU claims and the AU's own interpretations of the
   standards of sovereign immunity and universal jurisdiction are also
   examined. The article shows that emergent AU recalcitrance to ICC orders
   is difficult to dismiss even though it may be contrary to current
   international law, particularly article 53 of the Geneva Convention on
   the Law of Treaties which nullifies resort to domestic/local law as a
   justification for breach of the strictures of international law. In
   particular, AU claims that universal jurisdiction and sovereign immunity
   should be redefined to suit their concerns contradict recent
   international efforts to combat impunity for international crimes.},

Abstract = {This paper looks at one of the most important endogenous factors
   influencing the workings of decentralization in Zimbabwe. Successive
   waves of formal institutional change that took place during Zimbabwe's
   colonial and post-colonial history have been unable able to uproot the
   influence of traditional leaders. Due to their home-grown legitimacy,
   various traditional authorities continue to play an ever-present role in
   the lives of people in rural areas. But, as it is the case throughout
   most of Africa, the powers of traditional leaders have mostly been
   uncodified under modern law and these power relations tend to be rather
   informal and culturally inaccessible to most outsiders. Consequently,
   the scholarly literature has not been able to systematically acknowledge
   their pervasive influence. The article concludes with a reflection on
   how the influence of traditional authorities can be translated into the
   democratic and progressive empowerment of rural populations in the
   developing world.},

   secondary education is open primarily to influence from domestic sources
   of divergence and public finance is shaped more by international factors
   driving convergence. As well as examining these case studies, Cole and

   the development of Welsh devolution and the reality of Welsh polity

   Government's relationship with local and regional layers of governance

   and collaboration to a more explicit performance management approach and
   increased support for local government reorganisation. Cole and Stafford
   then explore the changing nature of intergovernmental relations and in
   particular the impact of party political incongruence on territorial
   politics within the Welsh context. The chapter concludes by examining
   the evolution of Wales's engagement with the European Union as a

   According to the author's assessment, rent problems in our country are

   by their nature relations. In justifying this argument, the author
   considers a set of factors conducive to the emergence of a rentier
   society in Russia, showing that, in contrast to the Western countries
   where such a society can theoretically be a stable formation, in the
   Russian conditions sliding into the rentier state is fraught with

   The paper assumes that the sense of local and national feelings of the
   Latin American societies are quite different; it is relevant therefore
   to understand in what conditions it is possible to talk about the
   predominance of global values. In order to do that, we have conducted a
   longitudinal study using empirical data from the World Values Survey in
   several Latin American countries. The theoretical discussion used the
   concepts of globalization and ``globalization{''}.},

Abstract = {this paper seeks to make a contribution to the empirical study of
   international retirement migration by exploring the meaning and the
   scope of residence, a phenomenon related to issues around integration
   and belonging. The study is based upon a national survey addressed to
   foreign European retirees (pensioners aged 50 years or over) of 16
   nationalities living in Spain for more than three months per year. The
   article points out the extent to which residence is a multidimensional
   or complex and polysemic concept that transcends its merely
   administrative aspects. Residence is more than official records, and not
   all its dimensions develop with the same intensity. The research also
   reveals that certain public policies could promote both the presence and
   the consolidation as residents of European elderly movers},

Title = {De-radicalisation interventions as technologies of the self: a
   Foucauldian analysis},
Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},

Pages = {110-129},
Abstract = {De-radicalisation has become increasingly prevalent in the UK as a
   strategy for tackling the threat of religiously inspired
   violence/extremism. Recent events, such as the tragic murder of Lee
   Rigby in May 2013, British citizens fighting in Middle Eastern
   conflicts, and the emergence of the Islamic State of Iraq and Sham, have
   rekindled the preoccupation of policymakers with the radicalisation of
   British Muslims. Indeed, the work of the Prevent strategy in UK
   counterterrorism post-2011 has primarily been recalibrated towards a
   greater focus on de-radicalisation interventions, which is perceived by
   policy-makers to be a more streamlined and effective way of dealing with
   radicalised/extremist individuals. And, yet, despite the greater
   attention paid to de-radicalisation, the discourse on de-radicalisation
   is characterised by the absence of detailed research, little or no
   empirical evidence for policy development, and confusion surrounding its
   conceptual framework. This article therefore offers an alternative
   conceptualisation of de-radicalisation to the one found in the Prevent
   strategy. Drawing on the works of Foucault, I argue that
   de-radicalisation is best understood as a ``technology of the self{''}.
   This article will enumerate the interplay between the three major types
   of technologies that constitute the technologies of the self:
   discursive, disciplinary, and confessional technology. It is argued that
   conceptualising de-radicalisation as a technology of the self allows us
   to reframe it beyond the narrow confines of counterterrorism policy and
   places it within wider governmental relations.},

   Advantage},
Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {101-119},
Abstract = {We study the conditions under which a regression discontinuity (RD)
   design can be used to recover the personal incumbency advantage, a
   quantity that has long been of interest to political scientists. We
   offer an expanded interpretation of the RD design that allows us to back
   out unbiased estimates of this quantity by focusing on open seats -
   elections with no incumbent running. Our focus on open seats avoids
   including in the personal incumbency advantage estimate the spurious
   advantage that stems from incumbents' higher than average quality - a
   result of electoral selection. A central result of our model is that the
   RD design double-counts the personal incumbency advantage because each
   of the two groups of districts compared in the RD estimand has an
   incumbent running for reelection at the time the outcome is measured. We
   provide a brief empirical illustration of our model that analyzes
   northern open-seat U.S. House elections between 1968 and 2008, and we
   also discuss how this setup can be used to study incumbent races, where
   the required assumptions are more complex. A version of our model in its
   full generality - and a discussion of the assumptions it requires - is
   presented in the Supplemental Appendix.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {25},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {409-420},
Abstract = {Decentralization reforms introduced to Africa have not always delivered
   the intended outcomes. Through interaction with the broader historical,
   political, social and economic context, reforms seem to have engendered
   political consequences beyond decentralization itself. Most of the
   literature on decentralization and development emphasizes questions of
   institutional design and policy, but here we expand the focus of
   analysis and incorporate the harder-to-pin-down political patterns
   marking the workings of decentralization in Africa. Through the
   case-studies of Ghana, Senegal, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Ethiopia and Uganda
   we seek to connect the debates on development with the scholarly
   literatures on comparative federalism, comparative decentralization and
   local democracy. The conclusion that emerges is that no magic formula
   which can turn countries into peaceful, stable and prosperous
   democracies overnight exists. And, importing formal institutions without
   regard to the local historical, political, social and economic context
   risks leaving us with elegant but dysfunctional iron houses in the
   tropical heat.},

Abstract = {I model the dynamic agency relationship underlying prevention. In each
   period, a principal sets a budget for an agent that has private
   information about a problem, which the agent can direct to solving the
   problem or divert into rents. Problems are persistent and rectifiable:
   they randomly generate observable disasters until enough resources have
   been committed to solving them. I characterise the principal's
   equilibrium trade-off between (a) preventing disasters while squandering
   transfers in informational rents to agents facing trivial problems and
   (b) limiting transfers and remediating costly disasters that eliminate
   agents informational advantage and prove the need for action.},

Title = {Examining the French Hijab and Burqa Bans through
   Reflexive Cultural Judgment},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {48-70},
Abstract = {How can we judge unfamiliar cultures while avoiding ethnocentrism and
   universals? It requires what I call reflexive cultural judgment. After
   considering the socially and politically situated knowledge and
   commitments that guide the judgment of others, those engaged in
   reflexive cultural judgment meditate on what they have learned in the
   intercultural engagement and cast a critical eye on their own supposedly
   universal principles to reveal cultural particulars that typically would
   not be as visible to insiders. To demonstrate this, the article examines
   French political judgment of Muslim women who wear the hijab (a head
   covering) and burqa (a face covering). Through content analysis of
   previously unanalyzed data on the National Assembly's 2009-2010
   discussion of the burqa, the article identifies particular French
   assumptions about gender and freedom that informed the ban. The author
   then casts a critical eye on her own political situatedness,
   highlighting the limitations of American liberal thought on freedom and
   religion.},

Abstract = {Ever since the full text of The German Ideology appeared in 1932 it has
   been subject to persistent misreading due to the fact that the
   idiosyncratic nature of this work-as merely a rough, unedited, and
   unfinished draft as well as a fiercely polemical text-has been
   neglected. As a result, the majority of scholars have tended to claim
   that Marx and Engels in this work propose an empiricist or positivistic
   conception of human history and society. A critical reading that is
   sensitive to the peculiar nature of this text reveals that these common
   interpretations are wholly ungrounded and that, on the contrary, the
   authors develop their polemic against the Young Hegelians from an
   outlook that is deeply indebted to the Hegelian philosophical legacy
   (even though paradoxically the latter espouses an absolute idealistic
   viewpoint).},

Abstract = {Language, ethnicity, and policy orientation toward Europe are key
   cleavages in Ukrainian society, but there is much debate about their
   relative importance. Based on a survey experiment of 1000 residents of
   Ukraine that manipulated three features of a fictional candidate running
   for parliament, I find that a candidate's ethnicity and language had
   little impact on reported vote choice, whereas economic policy
   orientation toward Europe was strongly associated with vote preference.
   Despite the intense politicization of both ethnicity and language and
   the violence in eastern Ukraine vote choice has not been reduced to an
   ethnic or linguistic census.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the conditions under which minority proposal rights
   emerge from majority voting in a legislature. I develop a legislative
   bargaining model in which rules persist, i.e., remain in effect until a
   majority agrees to change them. In each session, legislators first
   determine whether a minority leader can offer amendments, and
   subsequently they determine policy using these procedures and majority
   rule. The main result demonstrates that legislative majorities grant
   minority rights today in order to moderate policy tomorrow when they may
   become the minority. This mechanism operates without punishment
   strategies and private information and in the presence of polarized and
   unified parties; however, persistent rules are necessary for the right
   to substantively influence policies. Comparative statics indicate that
   weak parties, super-majority rule, patient legislators, and extreme
   proposers encourage the adoption of minority rights. More broadly, these
   results demonstrate the importance of persistent rules for the endurance
   of inclusive institutions and political compromises, and they suggest
   one reason for procedural differences between the House and Senate.},

Abstract = {With expansive digital networks supporting circuits of accumulation,
   facilitating both new forms of value capture and proletarian
   organization, Marxian scholars have shown renewed interest in questions
   of technology in class struggle. Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's
   Empire, the most conspicuous autonomist Marxist theorizing on the
   subject, presents networked technology positively, as part of the
   revolutionary body, the multitude. Against the affirmative view,
   critiques of technology and technological rationality, drawn from a
   thread of Frankfurt School critical theory, have been posed as
   challenges to Hardt and Negri's conception of technology in class
   struggle. After identifying a genealogy of what this paper calls
   foreclosure politics running through the works of Herbert Marcuse, Jodi
   Dean, and Christian Fuchs, the paper closes by suggesting a conception
   of technology in class struggle triangulated by critical theory and
   affirmative conceptions of use.},

Abstract = {There has long been an emphasis on the importance of decentralization in
   providing better quality public services in the developing world. In
   order to assess the effectiveness of decentralization I examine here the
   case study of Uganda, which has seen major decentralization of power
   over the last quarter-century. In particular the current government has
   introduced a five-tiered local government structure, decentralized both
   fiscal and political power to local governments and introduced regular
   local government elections. However, initial excitement about Uganda's
   decentralization programme has tapered off in recent years due to a
   number of problems outlined here. In particular, I show that
   decentralization in Uganda has suffered from a lack of independence from
   central government control, which has led to a lack of effectiveness in
   the provision of high quality public goods.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the changing nature of debates that focus on the
   philosophy of Alasdair MacIntyre. Whilst outlining the history of
   MacIntyre's engagement with Marxism and some of his key ideas, it argues
   that it is only recently that such debates have begun to rightfully
   recognise the continued relevance of Marxism to such discussions. I note
   that crucial aspects of MacIntyre's politics and philosophy,
   particularly his opposition to capitalism, are now integral to the
   contemporary debate which helps in generating a shared vision of radical
   politics. Nevertheless, I point out that key disagreements still remain
   as to the role of Marxism within such debates, the validity of
   MacIntyre's critique of Marxism, as well as the potentially problematic
   post-Marxist practice that MacIntyre advocates in After Virtue and
   beyond.},

Abstract = {For much of the 2010-15 Parliament the English Question was not a
   conspicuous feature of political debate in the UK. However, the issue of
   English votes for English laws (EvfEl) was thrust to centre stage by
   Prime Minister David Cameron in the aftermath of the Scottish
   independence referendum, when he announced that fulfilment of the
   promise of further devolution to Scotland must be accompanied by an
   answer to the West Lothian Question at Westminster. This article
   analyses these events and explores their possible consequences. It
   argues that a reform of parliamentary procedures along the lines
   outlined in the report of the McKay Commission looks increasingly
   likely, but that this will not mark a resolution of the broader English
   Question, and the future of the Union remains in doubt.},

Title = {Jurgen Habermas on public reason and religion: do religious citizens
   suffer an asymmetrical cognitive burden, and should they be compensated?},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {18},
Number = {5},
Pages = {547-563},
Abstract = {In his recent writings, Jurgen Habermas asks how the liberal
   constitutional principle of separation between church and state,
   religion and politics, should be understood. The problem, he holds, is
   that a liberal state guarantees equal freedom for religious communities
   to practise their faith, while at the same time shielding the political
   bodies that take collectively binding decisions from religious
   influences. This means that religious citizens are asked to justify
   their political statements independently of their religious views,
   resulting in a burden that secular citizens do not experience. To
   compensate, Habermas demands from secular citizens that they open their
   minds to the possible truth content of religion, enter into dialog and
   contribute to the translation of religious reasons into generally
   acceptable reasons. This article focuses on Habermas's assumption that
   religious citizens suffer an asymmetrical cognitive burden that should
   be compensated, and his claim that his approach to religion in the
   public sphere is less restrictive than that of John Rawls.},

Abstract = {Drawing on an ethnographic study, this article deals with the emergence
   and structuration of local memory mobilizations in Nantes and Bordeaux,
   two former slave-trade ports. The shared experience of racial
   discrimination appears as a strong incentive for involvement in such
   mobilizations. This observation leads to a central question: Why and how
   is the race question translated into a struggle concerned with public
   memory? The role of ``memory entrepreneurs{''} appears central in this
   matter. Two of them are presented in detail, and their specific social
   profile and function are analyzed. Their position at the interface
   between memory norms, identity production, and recognition claims at the
   political level makes them key actors in this process.},

Abstract = {However it may have originated, during the nineteenth and twentieth
   centuries, modern citizenship became an institution deployed for
   colonial and imperial campaigns to create governable (rather than merely
   subject) peoples. Many postcolonial nations and states inherited and
   then effectively instituted citizenship for governing - dividing,
   classifying, disciplining, regulating - peoples. We observe this
   development in previously colonized territories and frontiers carved up
   by colonial powers such as in the Americas, Africa, and Asia as well as
   those that were ostensibly never colonized and yet were subject to
   imperial interventions, such as the Ottoman and Chinese empires. Today,
   many seemingly intractable questions about territory, people,
   sovereignty, and political subjectivity that are played out in
   postcolonial, postoriental, or even ostensibly decolonized societies,
   inherit this empire and willingly or unwittingly serve its ends, unable
   to break the hold of its allure and seduction, if not domination.
   Working with this premise, this chapter draws on studies of
   extraterritoriality as a technology of government that enabled empires
   to literally make up people in both domestic and foreign territories.
   These studies are intended to illustrate the origins of the contemporary
   workings of citizenship and develop a thesis for further research.},

   A Survey Study in Hong Kong},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {44-62},
Abstract = {Public opinion research has suggested that the negative impact of
   scandals on public evaluation of the politicians involved is not always
   strong. Part of the reason is that people may hold varying perceptions
   regarding the nature, factuality, and importance of the scandals.
   According to the theory of motivated reasoning, people develop varying
   perceptions by processing information in ways that reconfirm their
   existing views. This study applies such insights to analyze how citizens
   react to political scandals surrounding government leaders in Hong Kong,
   where such scandals have arguably become increasingly prominent in
   recent years. This study constructs a theoretical model linking prior
   political attitudes, scandal-related perceptions, response evaluation,
   and evaluation of politicians. Analysis of survey data confirms most of
   the hypotheses in two cases. External efficacy and support for democracy
   substantially influence perceived factuality and acceptability of the
   scandals. Such perceptions shape people's evaluations of the responses
   by the government and the officials involved, which in turn affect
   evaluation of the officials.},

   his writings on politics in democracies and, in a more critical vein,
   casts light on some central concepts in his work that the insights and

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {456-469},
Abstract = {This article considers how the distribution of educational resources is
   relevant to facilitating republican freedom and the degree to which an
   egalitarian conception of educational justice is allied with the ideal
   of non-domination. I argue that the republican ideal of non-domination
   provides a credible account of some features of educational justice, but
   that it falls short of providing a fully adequate theory of educational
   justice. I present three challenges to the republican approach to
   educational justice. First, the ideal of non-domination is not fully
   applicable to addressing the distinctive claims of children. Second,
   even when modified non-domination provides an incomplete basis for
   identifying the full range of pedagogical objectives that matter from
   the point of view of justice. Third, non-domination is compatible with
   arbitrary and unfair exclusion of some children from valuable
   educational resources.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {77},
Number = {1},
Pages = {202-215},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {One of the most important demonstrations of power in Washington is the
   ability to recruit sitting government officials to become active
   proponents of one's position. Many have suggested money is the key:
   Campaign contributions buy friends, access, and perhaps even policy
   activism. We provide an alternative view based on a deceptively simple
   observation: Lobbyists rarely lobby alone. We show empirically that
   government policymakers respond to the overall structure of conflict,
   not the resources of individual lobbying groups. Our project is based on
   in-depth interviews with over 300 policy advocates and systematic
   information on each of more than 2,000 advocates playing a significant
   role in a random sample of 98 policy issues in the United States federal
   government from 1999 to 2002.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses participation of foreign fighters in contemporary
   conflict in Ukraine. The authors define the phenomena of foreign
   fighters in modern armed conflicts and briefly outline their historical
   development. The Ukrainian conflict is characterized and the challenges,
   possibilities and limits of research of foreign fighters in this
   conflict are explained. The authors deal with phases of the conflict in
   Ukraine from the point of view of engagement of these volunteers and
   describe foreign fighters on the Ukrainian side (mostly members of
   paramilitary far-right battalions) as well as on the side of pro-Russian
   separatists (with special attention paid to Russian fighters from the
   point of view of volunteering). The general impact of foreign fighters
   on Ukrainian crisis and on European security is assessed in the
   conclusion.},

Abstract = {Post-conflict, in its broadest sense, is the transition from an internal
   armed conflict outlawing war actions. This will involve the
   reconfiguration of scenarios and public safety priorities. Therefore,
   citizens' demands, expressions of violence and criminal conduct related
   to the maximization of profits and the imposition of social orders by
   non-state actors have a contingent quality. From this perspective, the
   institutionalization of criminal economic activities and social conflict
   are dynamic with sense of self-reproduction that are part of everyday
   life. They are independent of the political processes that are developed
   and considered latent risks to public safety.},

Title = {Reform plan of the Administration of the Government of Catalonia and its
   public sector, with special emphasis on transparency},
Journal = {ACTIVITAT PARLAMENTARIA},
Year = {2015},
Number = {28},
Pages = {72-85},
Abstract = {In June 2014 the Catalan Government approved the reform Plan of the
   Administration of the Government and its public sector based on studies
   and contributions made by outside experts and characterised by the
   effect of the Europe 2020 programme (included in the Catalonia 2020
   strategy), which aims to reform the administrations of all of the member
   states, striving for intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth.
   In Catalonia, this reform seeks to respond to new citizen needs and
   emerging challenges, and aims to guarantee the provision of quality
   public services in an environment that is complex, changing and
   resource-constrained, lay the foundations for new governance and firmly
   focus on innovation. Beginning with consensus, the reform seeks to
   gradually consolidate the institutional model, which hinges on three
   inspirational, cross-cutting principles: transparency, ethics and
   innovation, all while putting emphasis on the pillars that underpin any
   great organisation: human capital, organisation, procedures and
   technology, and the provision of goods and services.
   The reform revolves around the following nine inherently interconnected
   thematic main lines of action: MLA 1, transparency; MLA 2, ethics; MLA
   3, human resources; MLA 4, professional public management; MLA 5,
   digital Government and simplifying administrative procedures; MLA 6,
   innovation and talent; MLA 7, the organisation of the Administration;
   MLA 8, organisation of the public sector; and lastly, MLA 9, which deals
   with public-private partnerships.
   Although specifically included in the first MLA, transparency inspires
   and steers the entire reform, together with ethics and innovation. It is
   a principle and a value that permeates the whole Plan and works as an
   driver for cultural and organisational change for the Administration and
   its public sector, and centres on two ideas: on one hand, it empowers
   the public to know, make demands, evaluate and hold public authorities
   accountable; and on the other, it requires public authorities to
   introduce new ways of working to legitimise and generate trust in its
   performance.
   In closing, the article highlights the fact that transparency requires
   reviewing the role of the Administration in public resource management
   to generate a new working culture and relation with the public. In this
   sense, it provides a new perspective on public affairs, based on trust,
   both on the part of the Administration as well as of the public.},

Title = {Security: Missing from the Northern Ireland Model},
Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-43},
Abstract = {The Northern Ireland model is best defined as the framing of the
   political endgame of Northern Ireland's conflict culminating in the 1998
   Belfast Agreement, otherwise known as the Good Friday Agreement. The
   Northern Ireland model is popularly portrayed as a negotiated
   settlement. It focuses primarily on the bargain reached by Northern
   Irish political parties, assisted by British and Irish governments and
   mediated by US senator George Mitchell. Academics and officials alike
   use it to explain how the ``Troubles{''} ended and peace was achieved.
   Conspicuously absent from this model is security. It also grossly
   understates the difficulty in dealing with a modern insurgency (the
   Provisionals) and leans too heavily toward skewed post-conflict thinking
   that views insurgents as ``peacemakers{''} prevented from making peace
   because of a manifestly poor security response, particularly that of the
   police force and its intelligence agency (Special Branch). The
   perspective of politicians and diplomats who brokered the peace
   settlement prioritizes political negotiations at the expense of the
   security response; in so doing, the role of security is undermined and
   overlooked. Most contemporary academic works promote this outlook.
   Excluding security, however, thwarts a comprehensive analysis of the
   Northern Ireland conflict and renders any examination partial and
   unrepresentative. There is therefore a significant intellectual gap in
   our understanding of how peace was achieved, which this article
   redresses. Ultimately, it questions the Northern Ireland model's
   capacity to assist in other relevant conflict contexts in any practical
   sense by arguing that a strategy where security pushed as politics
   pulled brought about peace. In other words, security played a crucial
   part because it forced the main protagonists into a situation out of
   which the Belfast Agreement emerged.},

Year = {2015},
Number = {50},
Pages = {263+},
Abstract = {Party identification quickly became one of the most used indicators in
   election studies since its emergence in the 1950s. However, the same
   measure is used since the 1970s that excludes advances in social
   psychology as well as theoretically possible phenomena as negative or
   multiple identifications. This paper shows that party identification can
   be seen as in-group identification within the social identity approach
   and established measures can be used for its measurement. Drawing on new
   data, two measures (a single measure and a multi-item measure) were used
   to show the advantages of measuring party identification as in-group
   identification.},

Pages = {85-106},
Abstract = {This article interrogates the practicability and efficacy of arts-based
   methods for peacebuilding as opposed to the formal negotiating table
   within African grassroots communities. It problematises the application
   of western liberal peace models at grassroots level. The article reviews
   and locates itself within the broader discourse of alternative or
   informal peacebuilding. Using the case study of Rwandan post-genocide
   dramatic reconstructions, the article illustrates specific participatory
   theatre techniques extracted from the applied theatre field and how
   these can be employed for peacebuilding at grassroots level. The article
   argues for a safe, aesthetic space, created by theatre as critical to
   peacebuilding activities. To give a rounded overview, the article
   finally reflects on potential disadvantages and controversies of using
   participatory theatre for peacebuilding and concludes that creative
   arts-based methods offer practical, inclusive, inexpensive space
   conducive for organic peacebuilding at grassroots level.},

Abstract = {One of the biggest challenges students face in any undergraduate methods
   course is a lack of confidence in their mathematical abilities, leading
   to a struggle for both retention of information and for continued
   involvement in research-based courses. In my article, I present a new
   approach to improving self-efficacy in undergraduate methods students
   and show that self-reported measures of learning improved as well as the
   completion of senior theses and directed research opportunities
   increased in the subsequent semester over previous years. Specifically,
   instead of teaching the course through academic articles and lessons
   from a textbook, I used a paper from the same course written by a former
   student as an exemplar of how to write a research paper. The
   peer-modeling approach improved student evaluations of the course
   immediately following the semester, increased the number of students
   involved in independent research subsequent to the course, and showed a
   high self-reported level of retention and use of research methods over a
   year after the course was completed.},

Title = {GETTING SMART AND SCALING THROUGH: NARCOTICS/PROSTITUTES' TRAFFICKING AS
   ORGANIZED CRIMES IN COLONIAL AND POST COLONIAL WEST AFRICA,
   C.1920-C.1998},
Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2015},
Number = {10},
Pages = {3-22},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Conflict analysis and management are not a new phenomenon to students of
   history and social sciences the world over. Conflicts either on
   organizational or international scale have received mediation and/or
   alternative dispute resolution in different parts of the world. This
   article focuses on West Africa as a zone where organised crime has been
   going on since the first decades of the 20th Century although much
   attention has been paid to terrorist organisations like the Boko Haram,
   AQIM and Janjaweed only recently. Using secondary and primary sources,
   the article examines more detail the way crimes have been organised in
   the region in the colonial and post-colonial periods. It examines the
   mobility of narcotics and prostitutes trafficking in the sub-region.
   More crucial to this article is the way regional and international
   organisations have attempted to mediate and bring to an end such
   conflict situation. From the sources gathered so far, the article
   maintains that narcotics and prostitution mobility have made West Africa
   the hub and the middle passage where drugs and prostitutes passed
   through to other parts of the world. Yet such a situation has received
   scant attention in a deeper historical perspective, a gap which this
   article sets out to fill. Conversely and more particularly, the drugs
   comes from as far as Latin America and South Africa and they are rooted
   back to Europe and United States while prostitutes have been migrating
   within the region and sometimes responsible for the movement of the
   drugs. What makes West Africa so unique in this trafficking? Which are
   the routes used in the organisation of the drug and prostitute
   trafficking? What constitutes the network of the traffickers? By
   confronting such questions, the article hopes to add to the budding
   literature and volume of knowledge that exists on drugs and prostitutes
   trafficking.},

Abstract = {The ombudsman institution, in both the public and private sectors, is
   increasingly identified with the ethos of consumerism and the protection
   of consumer rights. The current trend is exemplified and reinforced by
   the EU ADR Directive and by the government response to a recent inquiry
   into complaints conducted by the Public Administration Select Committee.
   This article argues that the dominant consumerist ethos diminishes the
   ability of the ombudsman institution to fulfil its potential. If the
   ombudsman institution, in particular as manifest in the office of the UK
   Parliamentary Ombudsman, is to serve the public interest, it must
   instead promote human rights principles and constitutional morality,
   adopt a process that is marked by public reasoning and participation and
   seek by a whole-system approach to realise a vision that is integrated
   and truly democratic.},

Pages = {295-320},
Abstract = {The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) seeks
   near-universal health insurance coverage in the USA. Medicaid is central
   to this expansion: half of the newly enrolled population was initially
   scheduled to participate in the program by extending eligibility to all
   households with income at or below 138 percent of the Federal Poverty
   Level. However, in 2012 the Supreme Court ruled that states had a choice
   of whether to adopt the expansion. Currently, 23 states have opted out,
   undermining the ACA significantly. This article assesses how
   partisanship, in the overall context of the neoliberal agenda, has
   affected US state governments in making the decision as to whether they
   will participate in this key component of President Obama's reform bill.
   It contends that Democrats and Republicans have separate but
   interrelated visions for the neoliberal state. The article also
   discusses how a number of reluctant states are attempting to take
   advantage of federal expansion money by proposing market-based
   alternatives. Finally, it addresses the various vested interests
   affected by the Medicaid expansion decision.},

Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {301-320},
Abstract = {`Gender mainstreaming' has been regarded as one of the strongest
   approaches to deal with the issue of equality policy for women. In order
   to mainstream women in the political process, a number of NGOs have been
   carrying out different programs in Bangladesh for building awareness
   among women so that they could opt for participation in the political
   process. The paper analyzes the role of NGOs in the process of
   mainstreaming gender in politics in Bangladesh in general and in the
   enactment of the Local Government (Union Parishad) (Second Amendment)
   Act of 1997 in particular. Based on empirical data collected through an
   open-ended structured questionnaire and available secondary data, the
   study findings reveal that despite having no formal access to the policy
   process, NGOs augment participation of women in the political process
   through informal means as is exemplified by their training programs that
   enhance women's social and economic status.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2015},
Number = {5},
Pages = {75-93},
Abstract = {Analyzed in the article are the key trends of ethnopolitical and
   ethnosocial development in the largest post-Soviet states - Russia,
   Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. The criteria and foundations of such
   comparative analysis are formulated and the main problems of nation
   building in post-Soviet states are shown. Special attention is paid to
   the relationship between ethnic and civic components of identity, as
   well as to the identity policy in every state in question. It is
   mentioned that the formation of civic identity and civil society in
   post-Soviet countries is a very difficult process. To a large extent
   these difficulties are caused by the unfinished processes of
   nation-building and by the ineffective political and economic
   institutions. It is demonstrated that situation in the field of
   interethnic relations and in the sphere of national identity is quite
   different in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. The consolidation
   of polyethnic nation and the formation of civic identity in Russian
   Federation is a rather slow process; however, the country possesses
   important long-term traditions of identity policy and interethnic
   conflicts regulation. In Belarus, the Soviet identity dominated in the
   1990's and the 2000's, while nowadays the new generation wishes to form
   its own national identity. President Nazarbayev in Kazakhstan tries to
   shape a complex identity in order to stabilize the social and political
   situation. This complex identity includes ethnic, national and
   supranational (so-called Eurasian) components. It is concluded that the
   experience of formation of such complex identity is useful for Russia
   and other post-Soviet states. Just the opposite, the social and cultural
   situation in Ukraine is very difficult: the country undergoes a serious
   social and ethnic polarization, which invokes political confrontation.
   These processes result in the crisis of Ukrainian statehood and in
   different social, political and interethnic conflicts.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to determine the onset of a diversity of armed conflicts
   in the twenty-first century. The aforementioned conflicts emerged due to
   the contraction of the geographical conception of the State in its
   State-nation version, the appearance of historical conflicts of identity
   framed in ethnical and religious vindications, the commencement of
   illegal armed groups and terrorist tactics, and the increase of
   international uncertainty created by groups inserted in illegal
   economies. These new dynamics appear in the context of re-shaping the
   international system given the URSS disappearance and the end of the
   Cold War. The religion, ethnical re-valoration, as well as new versions
   of nationalism begin to be central part of the political changes.
   Furthermore, the States' loss of control over international criminality
   allowed the development of different organizations with broad capacities
   to produce and trade products demanded in the illegal international
   market. Such situation increased political fractures, the governmental
   incapacity of response and international loss of control. Hence, a study
   of the aforementioned topics evidences that instead of creating a
   reduction of the number of State, the twenty-first century shows an
   increase of complex political disputes based on new political meanings
   built from diverse identities. That tendency could threat States such as
   China, India, Russia, and even The United States, simply because the
   conception of identity acquired a differentiated political value with
   multiple possibilities and varied disputes that challenge the
   traditional Western referents in the world of the post-cold war.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2015},
Number = {4},
Pages = {64-74},
Abstract = {Substantiated in the article is the thesis of the quantitative and
   qualitative expansion of the ``liberal inclination{''} in the
   party-political field of Western democracies. This expansion is based,
   on one hand, on the development of liberalism as such; on the other
   hand, on the adoption of the liberal creed by social democratic and
   conservative organizations. Under these circumstances, the process of
   ``humanization{''} of liberalism is gaining momentum, while at the same
   time liberalism is shifting to the individual-group, ``solidarity{''}
   dimension. A quickly developing synthesis of party and group principles
   results in the hybridization{''} of liberalism, which substantially
   increases its social and political weight and significance. Opposed to
   the ``solidarity{''} trend, a rapid intensification of
   ultra-conservative anarcho-individualism is taking place. Both these
   extremes, as well as the political space between them, represent
   fundamentally different trends in mass perceptions, and their study of
   becomes increasingly important both for politics and for political
   science. In the struggle against the ultra-right fundamentalism the
   impact of different kinds of organizations and communities is
   increasing; the leading role among these is played by the international
   liberal think tank ``Policy Network{''}.},

   and hyperpolitics},
Journal = {PENSAMIENTO AL MARGEN},
Year = {2015},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {This paper analyzes the contemporary collective imaginary since the
   light of the new aesthetic metaphors of construction of politics as
   space dispute over the sense, as a struggle for ``sensitive
   partition{''} of reality (Ranciere). The dispute over the sense emerges
   when the concepts and the meanings that carry the universal legitimacy
   in democracy are empty, becoming ``floating meanings{''} (Laclau). In
   this way, from the current depletion of philosophy and political theory,
   both unable to account for collective action and to articulate a new
   policy that is expressed in networks, swarming crowds or complex, an
   alternative view to narratives of modernity is proposed and it outlined
   what might be called a `` posthegemonical{''} political; that is, a
   policy in which the meaning is not given, it must be built, being the
   populism the aspiration to conquer and redefine floating signifiers in
   the quest to build a new social majority and seize power.},

Abstract = {In Paraguay a poor person can feel insecure and yet be happy, at least
   that was demonstrated by opinion polls of this South American country.
   To understand this curious statement, this work had as a central
   objective to correlate factors such as: a) the citizen's increased
   perception of insecurity with b) high levels of poverty and inequality
   and, c) weak state capacity due to the expansion of private security
   forces in Paraguay. Among the main findings: 1) private security arises
   from the difficulties of the national police to protect the interests of
   citizens; 2) townfolks draw on private security because it is considered
   more efficient than public security forces due to the rampant corruption
   throughout the state apparatus; 3) the relationship between public and
   private forces is of safety type rather than policy type, meaning that
   private security agents exert functions that correspond to the national
   police; 4) State policies on public safety are reactive rather than
   preventive.},

   conceptual and practical approaches towards global governance defined by
   specific features of Russia's and China's history, economic development,

   Based on this comparative analysis, the author speculates on the future
   trends of participation of the two countries in the global governance

Abstract = {Although there was no focused administration of ethnic minorities in
   Finland until the last decades of the twentieth century, there was a
   variety of rationalities, techniques and practices of governance used
   for their conduct. In this article, I analyse how the governance of the
   Roma and the Sami - the two biggest minorities at the time - changed
   after the mid-1800s, when the new ethno-cultural understanding of
   population spread throughout administration and governing bodies. This
   Foucauldian analysis concentrates on the descent of this `event', the
   social and political conditions of its emergence and the actual changes
   it entailed in the governance of these minorities.},

Abstract = {Terrorism is often held to be ``violence as communication{''}. However,
   terrorism studies has had very little to say about how violence as such
   is specifically represented by insurgent ``extremist{''} or
   transgressive political actors. Informed by social movement theories of
   framing and the literature on virtualization, this paper sets out to
   offer a preliminary typology of representations of violence by such
   groups, and the ways in which subcultural engagement with mediated
   representations of violence may represent a missing dimension in our
   understanding of ``violent extremism{''} or ``violent
   radicalization{''}.},

Abstract = {The policy push in favour of fostering a global lingua franca has shed
   overtly imperialistic underpinnings and been recast, but many of the
   same objections can be levelled at new attempts to justify an old
   policy. Efforts to explain the impetus towards linguistic uniformity
   through rational choice theory obscure the power dynamics behind choice
   of language in multilingual contexts. Invoking democratic engagement as
   a benefit of uniformity overestimates the role of linguistic diversity
   as a drag on participation and ignores more important forces. A focus on
   equality of opportunity and social mobility through lingua franca
   competence as justification for the policy reveals a shallow conception
   of equality and underplays the longterm consequences for non-lingua
   franca communities were equality of opportunity for individuals to be
   taken seriously. Finally, seeing the justice issues that arise out of
   competition between languages as one of ensuring adequate compensation
   to the losers underscores how thin is the conception of equality
   animating the approach; it purchases an inadequate level of equal
   opportunity for individuals at the expense of inequality amongst
   language communities.},

Abstract = {In recent times, the disaffection with the political system has grown
   exponentially mainly due to unrest sparked by both the management of
   economic and institutional crisis as the reiteration of different
   episodes of public corruption. No doubt this has intensified the crisis
   of representation, as old as the representation itself, and exacerbated
   the critical role they play in today's political parties. Not
   surprisingly, these dysfunctions observed bring not only because of
   varying expertise at managing the public interest but also more
   structural reasons such as the fact that the weak institutionalization
   of democratic participation mechanisms has led to the State parties
   exhibits an extremely opaque and operating oligarchic, in turn, is the
   source of all kinds of excesses, including corruption or
   ``colonization{''} of most institutions. In short, the so pervasive
   power of the parties has undermined the rule of law and substantially
   limited the effective exercise of democracy to leave little room for
   citizens to decide on the progress of society. This situation calls for
   a greater balance of power between it and the political parties.},

Abstract = {Why do some protest movements erupt into rebellion, whereas others
   protest peacefully under similar circumstances? Addressing this
   question, this paper investigates the cases of Boko Haram (rebellion)
   and MASSOB (non-violent protest) in contemporary Nigeria. Conventional
   explanations of rebellion focusing on opportunity, inequality, and
   repression cannot explain why these movements have pursued different
   protest strategies. This paper tries to explain this puzzle by
   investigating the signifying work and meaning construction of both
   movements drawing on the framing approach from social movement studies.
   The framing analysis shows that the different protest behavior largely
   results from the differing cultural context of both movements, from the
   agency of the framers, and from successful frame alignment, which
   results in frame resonance and, thereby, the successful mobilization for
   collective action.},

Abstract = {In a contemporary context, the concept of power networks is used in the
   study of political society. The overlapping of political power and the
   varied networks of entities that shape the social context create a
   consensus on political communities' analysis. This paper aims to develop
   the study of some historical examples of the phenomenon of transatlantic
   transmissions of norms, beliefs and values that revise the sense of a
   Luso-Brazilian community. New approaches, namely on the perspectives
   that documentary films offer on political and cultural paths are made
   possible by a revised historiography and new cultural political
   approaches. In the late twentieth century, the image and the documentary
   film formed an important communication mechanism enhancing the cultural
   and symbolic imagery shared between Portugal and Brazil. However, the
   new political configurations under the globalization process confiscate
   and transform that imagery. Reshaped power transferred from institutions
   to individuals allows other readings of cultural and political language
   communities.},

   a project that applies the same data-driven discovery approach to

   in a constructive way, whether the audience is the general public,
   students, or researchers. Legislative Explorer (available at
   http://www.legex.org) visualizes the progress of more than 250,000
   congressional bills and resolutions introduced since 1973. Users of all
   abilities can engage with actual data to discover how bills become law.
   Filters designed by domain experts guide them toward key insights. It is
   our hope that Legislative Explorer promotes greater understanding of a
   much-maligned institution.},

   bail-out conditionality: The cases of Greece and Portugal},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {29-55},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper asks whether the Memoranda of Understanding on specific
   economic policy conditionality (MoUs), signed between bailed-out member
   states and the EU, have changed the latter's potential to intrude in the
   reform of national social and labour market policies and, if so, how.
   What have been the effects of the measures and reforms taken under the
   MoUs on national social and labour market policies? The MoUs of Greece
   and Portugal are analysed with a focus on pension systems and labour
   market policies. It is argued that the MoUs have been unprecedentedly
   intrusive in national social and labour market policies. The level of
   intrusiveness has varied, depending on the difficulty of implementing
   the MoU reforms, the extent to which the macroeconomic adjustment has
   been seen to be stalling, and the degree to which a given policy area is
   directly relevant to the adjustment in question. The effects of the
   reforms induced by the MoUs have sometimes been intended as moves in the
   direction of a necessary modernisation. However, the pressing demand to
   cut public expenditure and substantially improve competitiveness,
   combined with the increase in demand for social and labour market
   support due to mounting unemployment rates, have weighed heavily on such
   attempts.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to find parallelisms and dissonances
   between the ecological economy and Marx's work. By the way, ecological
   economy can be considered as an apology of capitalism under nowadays
   condition of devastation of nature or from its critique. Then main
   limitation of the ecological economists lies in the fact that they don't
   touch the essence of the social discomfort provoked by the dominant
   economic and social system.
   Nevertheless, also here are considered the insufficiency of Marx he when
   takes into account as limit of capitalism only the capital by itself and
   not the planet limits. In this synthesis we arrive to the political
   economy of the environment in which it is explained the environmental
   problematic, not only as a consequence of the predator relationship
   between man and nature, but underlining the exploitation of labor by
   capital.},

Title = {CORRUPTION MARKETS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2015},
Number = {2},
Pages = {78-96},
Abstract = {Authors develop a new conceptual approach to the corruption studies and
   effectiveness of anti-corruption regulations of public service. Basing
   our hypothesis on the study of effective models of conflict of interest
   regulation, authors assume that there is a ``missing factor{''} in the
   modern corruption studies. This ``missing factor{''} is a ``corruption
   market{''}, particularly, its size, type and nature. Conflict of
   interest regulations' aim at controlling key channels of corruption
   behavior, and corruption market in its turn determines prevailing
   channels of existing corruption behavior. Thus, misidentification of
   corruption market's type is the main reason for the failure of
   anti-corruption policies, no matter how new and effective models are
   imported. Corruption market's size is defined as the number and average
   price of corruption deals. The nature of corruption market depends on
   the side, setting the final price of corruption deal. Resulting from
   institutional characteristics of public administration, corruption
   markets are either seller's or buyer's type. Seller's corruption markets
   are sensible to the ethic regulations of the public service, and the
   only effective way of tackling buyer's corruption markets are
   ``cut-red-tape{''} reforms and compliance-based regulation of conflict
   of interest. Type of corruption market encompasses 3 dimensions: quality
   of institutions, scope of regulations and degree of regulations. Basing
   on the introduced model, authors identify and analyze 8 types of
   existing corruption markets. Each type of corruption market has its own
   transformational dynamics and, consequently, own opportunities for
   anti-corruption policies. A new conceptual model of corruption market
   evolution is introduced in the article. Transformations of corruption
   markets depend on several factors. The key factors are personalization
   of political regime, ``new public management{''} reforms of public
   administration, populist policies and creation of rentier states, and
   set up of the Welfare State.},

Abstract = {Today, democracy is understood as a form of state and government,
   political culture and a way of life, where respect for human rights and
   the involvement of citizens in the exercise of government prevail.
   Beyond its limitations and problems, it continues to be the most
   conducive way to achieve the overall development of nations. For this
   reason, most of the political and ideological projects that have
   developed in Western civilization and the world during the contemporary
   era, have defined themselves as democratic., Using a hermeneutic
   approach, this work intends reflect on the various meanings of democracy
   in the historical present and to determine what is involved in
   constructing a truly democratic and just society from both the
   theoretical-conceptual viewpoint and in concrete reality. Conclusions
   are that XXIst-century Venezuelan democracy is going through a deep
   crisis that could culminate in its symbolic and material destruction if
   its antagonistic elements, such as a culture of intolerance, disrespect
   for law by government agents and social polarization, among others, are
   not managed and promptly overcome.},

Abstract = {This article's main goal is to analyze how Dilma Rousseff's negative
   propaganda against her opponents was fundamental to assure her
   reelection inside a political context marked by a strong feeling for
   change. Based on an analysis of four focus groups held in Rio de
   Janeiro, with voters from classes C and B, between the 29th and the 30th
   of September, we will attempt to show how voting intentions, as well as
   rejection rates for Aecio Neves and Marina Silva, floated in the course
   of the campaign given the many attacks launched by the president. The
   analysis shows that negative propaganda offered an arsenal of arguments
   that were absorbed and processed by undecided voters or with volatile
   voting intentions, causing impact on the final vote decision. Negative
   propaganda against Marina Silva disqualified her government program and
   her attitude. Regarding the attacks on Aecio Neves, they reinforced
   attitudes already present in the electorate and helped deconstruct the
   politician's image as Minas Gerais's manager. Finally, the article aims
   to contribute to the knowledge on the determinants of negative
   propaganda when including as reasons for utilizing these strategies the
   relative strength of a ruler according to its popularity.},

Abstract = {Triggered by the ever closer regional integration and the rise of China,
   the geopolitical landscape of Asia has changed greatly since the end of
   the Cold War. Not only have a large number of new institutions for
   regional cooperation emerged, but China and some smaller countries are
   also playing an ever more active role in regional architecture building.
   Yet, the proliferation of various institutions indicate that the region
   lacks a unified or comprehensive institution, especially in the security
   domain. With the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) as well as
   China's many strategic initiatives competing for membership, major
   powers are slowly taking the lead in the building of regional economic
   architecture, while the new security architecture in Asia is evolving
   around how major powers, China and the U.S. in particular, seek regional
   leadership by working with each other, and engage all other countries to
   address their common challenges. Within this context, China must have a
   balanced strategy between its domestic development goals and
   international endeavors, and speeding up its domestic reform and
   opening-up will be the basis of its growing leadership in future
   regional architecture building in Asia.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {40},
Pages = {200-209},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This research note recasts the relationship between electoral
   proportionality and government responsiveness to public needs, and
   emphasizes the limits of studies that look at the ideological congruence
   between cabinets and voters as the dependent variable, and assume that
   this congruence translates into policy responsiveness. The translation
   of public will into policy is contingent on many other system
   characteristics, some of which are by-products of electoral rules. This
   note focuses on the effect of party fragmentation on the way cabinets
   adjust their spending behaviour to ideological shifts within the
   populace. Party fragmentation is a negative externality of proportional
   representation, with the potential to neutralize/overturn its positive
   effects on representation. Building on the ``wars of attrition{''}
   literature I show that multi-party cabinets have a difficult time
   reducing spending when the public wants it, which decreases the overall
   responsiveness of government to ideological shifts. The empirical tests
   using spending data in 17 Western democracies between 1962 and 1991
   support these claims. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {What makes lobbying coalitions successful? We contend that greater

   the credibility of its signals to a target audience. To test this
   theory, we analyze the relationship between the preference heterogeneity
   of state amicus coalitions at the agenda setting stage and the
   probability of the U.S. Supreme Court granting review in state-filed
   cases. The results suggest that petitions are more likely to be granted
   as the preference heterogeneity among members of amicus coalitions
   increases. Our theoretical and empirical approaches are easily adapted
   to the study of lobbying influence in other institutional contexts.},

Title = {Space matters: Geographic variability of electoral turnout determinants
   in the 2012 London mayoral election},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {40},
Pages = {322-334},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Electoral participation is an important measure of the health of a
   liberal democracy. The determinants of voter turnout have been examined
   across a range of elections, but geographical approaches are relatively
   rare and are mostly performed at large scale aggregations and for
   national elections. This paper addresses this gap by exploring
   geographic variability in relationships between the turnout at a local
   election and socio-demographic variables at a detailed spatial level.
   Specifically, we focus on the London mayoral election, an important
   element of the 21st century local government reform in Britain, which,
   until now, has seldom been analysed from a geographical perspective. By
   linking the turnout from the 2012 mayoral election to socio-demographic
   data from the 2011 Census and doing this at the level of London's 625
   wards, for the first time a more detailed picture of the spatially
   uneven nature of turnout is evidenced than in previous studies which
   have focused on larger aggregations, typically constituencies. Analysis
   is approached through spatial analysis using geographically weighted
   regression (GWR), which enables the investigation of local variations in
   voting patterns. The results demonstrate that electoral processes do
   vary over geographic space and that some of the variables that are
   traditionally assumed to affect the turnout in a specific way, do not do
   so uniformly over space or even change the direction to the opposite of
   the traditionally assumed effect in certain locations. Our findings
   present a starting point for a more detailed investigation as to why
   this heterogeneity exists and which social processes it relates to. (C)

Abstract = {An enormous effort has been dedicated to uncovering the original meaning
   of the First Amendment's Religion Clauses, but, surprisingly, little
   research has been directed to ward the founding era state constitutions
   on church and state. This article aims to open a field of inquiry by
   making the church state provisions of the founding era state con
   stitutions more accessible. It begins with a consideration of the
   distinction between the state declarations of rights and the state
   constitutions and the interpretive challenge this distinction poses. I
   then identify, categorize, and interpret the relevant church state pro
   visions of the founding era state declarations of rights and
   constitutions. The article concludes with a discussion of how a deeper
   knowledge of the founding era state church state provisions might shed
   light on the original meaning of the First Amendment's Re ligion
   Clauses, and it reveals the probable errors of particular originalist
   arguments made by leading scholars and Supreme Court justices.},

Abstract = {After twenty five years of the implementation of various mechanisms to
   strengthen political representation of civil society in Colombia, the
   following two scenarios are evident: first, a discreet participation of
   citizens in the electoral field and in institutional spaces to promote
   participatory planning of regional development; second, the number of
   social protests have been increasing since 2007 making visible various
   problems in the Colombian territory. This article explores these two
   scenarios which shows evidence of the discrepancy between the
   institutional channels and the social movements, this study or
   investigation period began in 1991 with the creation of institutional
   designs to promote and expand the participation of the civil society in
   the public arena, until the year 2014 in which it becomes even more
   apparent new sets or groups in collective action.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the question of the importance of holding a
   debate about the current project to set up a people's university in
   Brazil, It is argued that a point of departure can be suggested for an
   in-depth approach to this question on the basis of the Marxist concept
   of history - which means that a people's university can only exist in a
   future socialist State. According to Marx, the State represents the
   interests of the bourgoisie and as such, it is not in its interests to
   offer equal educational opportunities for everyone. The struggle for a
   people's university - and for people's education in general - must form
   a part of the struggle to replace the capitalist system with a socialist
   State. The big problem is to define how, in the light of current
   conditions, a pathway to socialism can be pursued. In this article,
   stress is laid on the importance of the ``historic bloc{''} put forward
   by A. Gramsci and this, together with the legacy of L.C. Prestes, draws
   attention to the need to take account of forms of transition or
   approximation to revolutionary power, thus paving the way for a
   socialist revolution.},

Journal = {SWISS POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {21},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article explores the evolution of debate quality in the Swiss
   parliament. Focusing on immigration debates, we employ a psychological
   construct-cognitive complexity (CC)-which captures both epistemic and
   accommodative dimensions of political argumentation. We find a decrease
   in CC in parliamentary immigration debates over time, but this decrease
   was driven by the rise of the SVP (Swiss People's Party). However, there
   was almost no ``spillover{''} of this new communication style to other
   parties. Moreover, we also find a constant difference between the
   Standerat and the Nationalrat, with the former scoring higher on CC and
   thus asserting its role as a ``chambre de reflexion{''} in immigration
   debates. Our diachronic focus on the quality of political debate takes a
   novel perspective on the dynamics of consensus democracy as well as on
   elite political culture. While our results indicate that the rise of the
   SVP has transformed the traditional consensual and deliberative pattern
   of Swiss policy-making style into one which is geared towards less
   accommodation and a higher simplicity of political talk, there is still
   remarkable resilience against this new style of political interaction.},

Number = {7},
Pages = {1273-1295},

Abstract = {Mass media is critical for the functioning of every contemporary
   political system. Thus, we can expect a variation in media freedom
   depending on the type of government since political regimes differ with
   regard to the political, legal and economic framework in which news
   coverage operates. This article investigates the effects of regime
   types, namely democracy and autocratic subtypes, on media freedom. It is
   argued that regime legitimation and governance are the driving forces
   behind diverging media policies in autocracies. From this theory,
   hypotheses regarding media freedom and regime type are derived and
   tested empirically, relying on statistical analyses that cover 149
   countries over a period from 1993 to 2010. The empirical results
   demonstrate that democracies lead to significantly higher levels of
   media freedom than autocracies, with other things being equal. Within
   the autocratic spectrum, electoral autocracies, monarchies and military
   regimes have the freest media, whereas the most illiberal media can be
   found in communist ideocracies, where the ruling party holds a
   communication monopoly. Media freedom in personalist and non-ideological
   one-party regimes is on an intermediate level.},

Abstract = {Trevor Paglen, whose work The Octopus was recently shortlisted for the
   Deutsche Borse Photography Foundation Prize 2016, is a multidisciplinary
   artist who focuses on surveillance and intelligence activities - what he
   terms the invisible war'. As well as his solo work, he collaborated with
   Laura Poitras in the making of Citizenfour, the award-winning 2014
   documentary film about Edward Snowden. Other recent projects include
   Code Names of the Surveillance State, a video installation in which
   National Security Agency and GCHQ surveillance-programme code names were
   projected onto public buildings, and Trinity Cube in the Fukushima
   Exclusion Zone. In this interview, he reflects on some of the questions
   with which he grapples in his work, from the nature of contemporary
   warfare to the tension between privacy and surveillance, and the role of
   the artist in understanding war in contemporary society.},

Abstract = {The article is based on the research project Continuity of Social
   Conflict in Croatia 1987-1991, organized by the Center for Peace Studies
   and the Organization for Workers' Initiative and Democratization,
   Zagreb. Our point of departure is the strike that took place in one of
   the biggest industrial systems in socialist Yugoslavia, ``Borovo{''}
   from Vukovar, in 1988. The strike was part of the wave of labor unrest
   of the late 1980s, a time of economic and political crisis in a country
   undergoing dramatic social transformation. Our main goal is to
   delineate, on a micro level of socio-historical analysis, the
   transformation of the unrest of the late 1980s, in our view basically of
   a class character, into the violent conflicts of the 1990s, now
   rearticulated in ethno-national terms. In this article, we look at the
   situation in ``Borovo{''} in the period following the 1988 strike, when
   first divisions between workers start taking place. We relate the
   fragmentation of the ``Borovo{''} labor force in this period to: 1) the
   structural reforms, including the dismantling of self-management and the
   consequent elimination of the last institutional possibility for the
   articulation of workers' interests; and 2) the shifting ideological and
   material conditions, involving deep contradictions between a nominally
   workerist state and the reality of its ``post-socialist{''} experience.},

Abstract = {In the immediate wake of the 2015 general election Leanne Wood, leader
   of Plaid Cymru, Stephen Crabb, the Conservative Secretary of State for
   Wales, and Carwyn Jones, Labour's First Minister in the Welsh
   Government, all made interventions in the constitutional debate about
   the future of the United Kingdom. Leanne Wood recalibrated her party's
   position on independence to advocate a UK confederation. Carwyn Jones
   pressed the case for a federation. And Stephen Crabb said the present
   devolution arrangements should be extended and given greater coherence.
   In making their arguments all three underlined how strongly they were
   influenced by developments in Scotland. But all three will have to
   confront the realities of English governance if the changes they are
   supporting are to have any chance of being implemented.},

Volume = {3},

Abstract = {Increases in substantive portrayals of working women, racial groups, and
   sexual minorities on television are a common explanation for some of the
   observed increase in social tolerance over the last few decades. In this
   study, I first document change in these portrayals from 1970 to 2000.
   After doing so, I determine if higher levels of recurring portrayals are
   associated with greater levels of social tolerance for those who report
   watching larger amounts of television. If no association is found, this
   would validate claims of non-existent or minimal effects. The findings
   show that frequent television viewers generally have more negative
   attitudes as compared with non-viewers when recurring portrayals of
   these groups are low. However, television viewers have similar or higher
   levels of social tolerance compared with non-viewers when recurring
   portrayals become frequent. This supports the argument that increasing
   televised portrayals of women and minorities on television can help
   increase social tolerance, but differences in the substance and quality
   of these portrayals likely condition this link.},

Abstract = {Taking seriously the idea that the ``the personal is the political,{''}
   I argue that intimacy, the opportunity to be a part of a reciprocal
   romantic relationship, is a matter of justice. We ought to care about
   the distribution of this opportunity. Justice demands as much. What has
   gone largely undertheorized is racial discrimination that takes place in
   the intimate sphere. Prioritizing individuals as romantic partners in a
   way that reinforces ideas of racial hierarchy or stereotypes, what I
   call ``sexual racism,{''} is unjust. Sexual racism is based on nothing
   more than a kind of blatant, even ugly (pun intended) kind of racial
   favoritism or disgust. These are not benign sexual preferences but
   problematic conditions that structure the very formation of romantic
   relationships. Renegotiating the boundaries of the intimate sphere, I
   argue that online dating websites ought to be sites of public concern.},

Abstract = {Introduced in the late 1990s, tax credits grew under successive Labour
   governments to become a cornerstone of UK social policy. Distinguished
   from traditional welfare policies by their target group and their mode
   of administration, and with goals that appeared capable of commanding
   support across the ideological spectrum, tax credits until recently
   seemed to hold the key to tackling poverty in a politically popular
   manner. But since 2010 the tax credit system has been systematically
   dismantled, initially qualitatively and latterly also quantitatively.
   This paper discusses the multiple factors that help to explain the rapid
   fall from grace in the UK of this liberal approach to supporting the
   incomes of poor working households.},

Abstract = {Many theorists promote a decentralized politics but very few of them
   practice this decentralization textually. In this essay, I engage with
   three techniques Benjamin employs to decenter his authority in the text:
   allegory, montage and the production of text as pure means. Taken
   together, these practices amount to what I am calling Benjamin's use of
   a black flashlight. Rather than illuminate his text with his own
   knowledge, seeking to win the reader over by persuasion and textual
   authority, Benjamin seeks to obscure and complicate any meaning. He
   attempts to have his text fail to deliver a final verdict to the reader.
   The obscure, pitch black light Benjamin sheds on his own and other texts
   leaves us as readers to our own devices, deprived as we are of the usual
   guidance of the author. In this way, Benjamin not only encourages but
   requires the reader's own intervention, a model for the anarchist
   politics he also describes in the text.},

Abstract = {This article describes how the investor community has intervened
   vis-a-vis the global fertilizer companies sourcing phosphate rock from
   occupied Western Sahara. The territory holds large phosphates deposits,
   and the export of such rock constitutes the biggest source of income for
   the Moroccan government in the territory it has annexed. Due to the
   particular nature of the conflict in that territory, such practice is
   associated with concerns of human rights breaches, international law
   violations and political controversy. A dozen companies purchase these
   phosphates from the Moroccan government, while their traditional and
   legal owners are increasingly active in trying to stop the practice.
   Investor engagement and company improvement are discussed with a
   particular focus on Australia. By the end of the 1980s, 39\% of all
   phosphate rock in Western Sahara ended up in Australia. After a massive
   shareholder campaign directed at the Australian importers, the country
   has basically ended its dependence on such phosphate rock. The article
   also looks at import cases in North America. The article outlines the
   different arguments and strategies of investors, based on public
   statements and on internal dialogues between international investors and
   the civil society organization Western Sahara Resource Watch over the
   last decade.},

Abstract = {The paper analyzes the link between personality traits and attitudes of
   Swiss citizens toward equal opportunities for immigrants. In particular,
   we examine the extent to which this relationship is moderated by the
   socio-structural context. We test the assumption that the direct links
   between personality traits and attitudes toward equal opportunities are
   strengthened by perceived ethnic diversity. Based on our empirical
   analyses, we are able to replicate central findings of the research on
   personality traits and attitudes toward immigrants for the Swiss
   context. While openness toward experience and agreeableness are
   positively related to a preference for equal opportunities,
   conscientiousness is negatively linked to these attitudes. Furthermore,
   our results reveal that the link between conscientiousness and attitudes
   toward equal opportunities is significantly moderated by the perceived
   share of foreigners in the neighborhood. This finding is especially
   relevant for future research on the effects of personality traits.},

Abstract = {The possibility that actors strategically condition their behavior on
   partially unobservable factors poses a grave challenge to causal
   inference, particularly if only some of the actors whose behavior we
   analyze are at risk of experiencing the outcome of interest. We present
   a crisis bargaining model that indicates that targets can generally
   prevent war by arming. We then create a simulated data set where the
   model is assumed to perfectly describe interactions for those states
   engaged in crisis bargaining, which we assume most pairs of states are
   not. We further assume researchers cannot observe which states are
   engaged in crisis bargaining, although observable variables might serve
   as proxies. We demonstrate that a naive design would falsely (and
   unsurprisingly) indicate a positive relationship between arming and war.
   More importantly, we then evaluate the performance of matching,
   instrumental variables, and statistical backwards induction. The latter
   two show some promise, but matching fares poorly.},

Abstract = {Ethno-regional voting cleavages have featured in a number of sub-Saharan
   African states during the third wave of democratization. While these
   voting patterns are well studied, there have been few attempts to
   understand if pan-ethno-regional coalition building based on targeted
   economic policies can be employed to secure national electoral
   coalitions. We examine the 2009 Malawian parliamentary elections where a
   newly-formed national party used its incumbent position to promote an
   economic policy based on food security in order to overcome traditional
   ethno-regional voting patterns. After presenting a formal model of an
   optimal allocation of an economic resource to induce vote-switching, we
   use district-level data in a system of equations approach finding that
   this strategic allocation did indeed contribute to the nation-wide
   electoral victory. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article analyses different criminological approaches to modern
   genocide. It starts from a critical review of authors (Rene Girard,
   Eugenio Raul Zaffaroni, and Alejandro Alagia) who explain genocide in
   terms of sacrificial violence; it contrasts these perspectives with Jean
   Piaget's empirically based distinction between two kinds of social
   relations: relations of constraint and relations of cooperation, and the
   different sanctions pertaining to each, developing tools to understand
   more complex ways of causality. Next, it reviews comparative studies of
   genocide, ignored in the works of the previous authors. The objective
   for doing it is to compare different causal explanations of genocide to
   add complexity to the previous analysis. Finally, it revisits Raphael
   Lemkin's pioneering vision of the role of annihilation in destroying
   identity. It argues that Lemkin provided some insights for a new
   criminological approach to genocide seen as a technology of power
   seeking to transform the social fabric with the terror of concentration
   camps.},

Abstract = {Popular accounts of business involvement in politics typically suggest
   that business interests enjoy relatively unfettered success in getting
   what they want from government. Scholarly work is more equivocal. In
   this article we use a random sample of 98 policy issues between 1998 and
   2002 to examine whether business interests and other advocates get what
   they want from the policy process, and how their rate of success varies
   when they face different types of opponents. We find that business'
   efforts to affect public policy typically draw challenges from other
   types of interests. In the face of opposition, business is less likely
   relative to citizen interests to achieve its goals. But business does
   appear to have an advantage in the relatively rare instances when it
   acts to advance its interests on issues that do not draw opposition or
   interest from other actors. Under these circumstances, it is much more
   likely than other types of advocates who face no opposition to realize
   its policy goals. Our findings clarify how the nature and framing of
   issues and a favorable political climate can prove essential to
   business' prospects for achieving policy success.},

Abstract = {Media accounts of presidential appointments have often characterized the
   ambassadorial appointments process as overtaken by patronage concerns,
   with the most attractive posts set aside for those responsible for the
   president's election, few of whom have diplomatic experience. Here,
   using original data on all ambassadors, envoys, and other chiefs of
   mission appointed during the 68th through 112th Congresses, I leverage
   the credentialing process of the Foreign Service to conduct an empirical
   test of the determinants of professional versus nonprofessional
   appointments. I find that Foreign Service appointments are more likely
   when there exists significant ideological distance between the
   appointing president and the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations
   Committee, when the difficulty of the posting is high, and when the
   attractiveness of the posting is low.},

Abstract = {Scholars studying opinion representation often rely on a survey question
   that asks about the ``most important problem{''} (MIP) facing the
   nation. While it is known that MIP responses reflect public priorities,
   less is known about their connection to policy preferences. This article
   directly addresses the issue. First, it conceptualizes policy
   preferences and MIP responses, specifically considering the possibility
   that the latter may be either policy or outcome based. Second, using
   aggregate-level data from the United States and the United Kingdom, it
   then examines the correspondence between public spending preferences and
   MIP responses over time. The results indicate that MIP responses and
   spending preferences tap very different things, and that using MIP
   responses substantially understates the representational relationship
   between public opinion and policy.},

Abstract = {In the past decade, a long list of studies has documented the positive
   relationship between democracy and social spending. Other studies have
   shown a negative relationship between ethnic fractionalisation and
   social spending. So far, the two strands of literature have developed
   independently of each other. In this article, we present a
   class-coalition argument that links them, arguing that ethnic
   fractionalisation influences the effect of democracy on social spending.
   We test the argument in a large-N study. In line with our expectations,
   the findings show that democracy leads to higher levels of social
   spending, but only in relatively homogenous countries.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5},
Pages = {699-711},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A source of the strength of Green parties has been their willingness to
   realign their distinctive organizational characteristics to suit the
   external environment, with the effect of pushing such organizations
   closer to a more conventional party type. Major organizational
   adaptations by Green parties have been much studied but only scant
   attention has been paid to the cumulative effects that minor' change
   renders to such parties. This article examines the impact of minor
   organizational change through an analysis of one of the oldest statewide
   Green parties in Australia. It finds that minor organizational changes
   exert a subtle but equally powerful force in moving such parties away
   from their amateur status to a more professional party type, even in the
   absence of reform to historical party structures.},

Abstract = {This essay aims at providing a skeletal overview of the main points in
   the debate between critical theory and feminism. It will concentrate on
   Benhabib, Fraser, and Young, as the three authors that maintained a
   closest relationship with critical theory meant as the tradition
   originated by the School of Frankfurt. The debates here considered
   concentrate in a relatively short period of time, and focus mainly about
   feminist critiques and responses to Habermas' theory of the public
   sphere. The closing paragraph will highlight a few themes - mostly the
   question of subjectivity - that may constitute a future common agenda
   for both feminism and critical theory.},

Abstract = {Today there is a wealth of research on women's legislative
   representation and the factors contributing to it. For example,
   proportional representation in large multi-member districts and an
   egalitarian political culture are commonly associated with high rates of
   women's representation. However, in the developing world findings are
   less solid and there is little consensus on the salience of various
   explanatory variables (for example, political culture or electoral
   system type) on women's descriptive representation. In this article, I
   explore the possibility that the divergent findings that characterise
   the discipline stem from the different dynamics at work in developed and
   developing countries. My results indicate that development by itself has
   a positive and significant impact on the percentage of female
   representatives. Development also interacts with other variables (for
   example, women's participation in the workforce and quotas) in
   determining the level of women's representation.},

Abstract = {One of the most notable challenges of getting colleagues to try out
   simulations in European studies teaching is the overcoming of start-up
   costs. In particular, the creation of a scenario from scratch or the
   adaptation of an existing game can be daunting. The article discusses
   these challenges and their origins in the fundamental assumptions that
   simulations make about both the world and pedagogy. In particular, the
   tension between the simple rules that are understood to capture
   real-world phenomena and the complexity that those rules produce creates
   not only an excellent learning opportunity but also a barrier to
   developing useful resources for simulation designers. The article offers
   a number of ways that such a barrier can be overcome, including the
   development of a simulation designer community, use of online guides and
   the creation of simulations that teach about simulation design. These
   ideas are illustrated with a number of practical examples.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a new interpretation of Tocqueville's thought, one
   that focuses on his account of religious psychology. From his
   observations of America, Tocqueville concludes that human beings have a
   natural hope for immortality-a hope that is driven by a paradoxical but
   ineradicable desire to affirm and forget oneself simultaneously.
   Tocqueville formulates this insight as a critique of the Enlightenment
   thinkers who laid the foundations for liberal democracy; I argue that he
   crafts his ``new political science{''} to provide healthy outlets for
   the religious hopes whose existence these thinkers largely denied and
   whose anomalous presence in the United States has accordingly led to
   unforeseen dangers. Tocqueville's analysis not only helps us understand
   and begin to remedy those dissatisfactions that characterize democracy
   today but it also reveals his theoretical depth, political moderation,
   and sober assessment of our moral psychology in a way not seen before.},

Abstract = {In his classic study, Who Governs?, Robert Dahl interpreted the patterns
   of political assimilation of white ethnic' immigrants and their children
   during the mid-twentieth century as a hopeful sign of the potential of
   democratic pluralism in the USA. While acknowledging that immigrant
   groups faced discrimination and structural barriers that might lead them
   to be silent, Dahl predicted that social mobility and assimilation would
   eventually erase these deficits in political participation among
   immigrants. Building from Dahl's analysis, we investigate the extent to
   which pluralism in the USA can and does work the same way for immigrants
   who are also racial minorities. We highlight factors that can lead these
   groups to become silent citizens, including lack of legal status, lower
   levels of political mobilization by institutions, and discrimination as
   structural impediments to minority participation. Our findings suggest
   that both resources as well as structural impediments structure the
   political behavior of Asian Americans and Latinos, determining whether
   they are vocal citizens or silent citizens.},

Abstract = {Theories of participation and non-participation are largely unable to
   capture and distinguish anti-system behavior, which ranges from
   deliberate silence to political violence. To better understand and
   measure these diverse forms of citizen participation, and to distinguish
   these from forms of alienation and marginalization, this article builds
   a new model of anti-system behavior in a way that facilitates the
   development of empirically observable variables and hypotheses. To do
   so, I draw upon sociological approaches to alienation - which examine
   intensities of rebellion and contestation - and combine them with the
   standard political scientific approach - which examines intensities of
   engagement based on resources. The problem, I argue, is that each
   approach only partially explains the motivations behind aberrant
   political behavior in modern democratic systems; they are in fact two
   sides of the same coin. I consider three cases of apparent silent
   citizenship: Muslims in Western Europe, Roma in Eastern Europe, and
   white working-class people in North America and Europe.},

Abstract = {Despite a growing convergence in the attitudes and behaviours of voters
   in the unified Germany, research shows that eastern and western German
   voters continue to differ over general ideological issues. How well does
   the party system in the unified Germany represent this ideological
   diversity? To answer this question, this paper analyses the extent to
   which (1) parties-in-electorates, (2) parties-in-parliament and (3)
   parties-in-government agree ideologically with voters from both regions
   between 1980 and 2013. Hypothetically, a lop-sided representation
   pattern, where the ideological location of parties converges primarily
   with those of western voters, suggests that existing ideological
   differences become institutionalised. Contrary to this scenario, we find
   that the German party system effectively articulates the ideological
   preferences of western and eastern voters. The same applies to
   parliaments and governments where the election outcome rather than any
   institutional bias affects the distance of parties to voters in the East
   and the West.},

Abstract = {This article examines the nature of the engagement between the European
   Union and the Global Fund created to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and
   malaria. The authors reveal that in relations between the EU and the
   Fund, influence is reciprocal although asymmetrical with the EU
   commanding more leverage. They also contend that the EU considers its
   engagement with the Global Fund as successful to the extent that the
   success of this interaction is contingent on the Global Fund's capacity
   for implementation. They conclude that the relationship between the EU
   and the Fund will continue for the foreseeable future.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {43},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {602-624},

Abstract = {Does the act of attending religious services cause individuals to
   participate in politics? There is no known literature that examines this
   question using longitudinal, individual-level data. Therefore, using the
   Youth Parent Socialization Panel Study, this analysis examines three
   theoretical possibilities: the indirect, direct, and null relationships.
   The results show that changes in religious attendance are primarily
   indirectly linked to political participation through civic activity, a
   factor highly correlated with political participation. There is also
   some limited evidence for a direct effect. As individuals increase their
   political participation over time, they are slightly more likely to
   participate in political activities and vote. But, the findings also
   imply that the previous literature has likely overstated the role of
   religious attendance in generating political participation. Once
   individuals start participating politically, they continue to do so
   regardless of changes in their attendance at places of worship.},

Abstract = {Prepaid medical care is an option that exists in different countries
   where prevention is the means to maintaining good health and avoiding
   greater costs in health. Prepaid medical care was established in Mexico
   in 1999 as a response of the market failures of the health insurances at
   the time. They were known as Instituciones de Seguros Especializadas en
   Salud (Specialized Health Insurance Institutions). This article reviews
   whether a policy transfer occurred during the regulation of this market
   in Mexico. It presents a model based on the theory of policy transfer
   and it reviews the health systems of United Sates, Chile and Colombia,
   countries which Mexico used to inspired the design of these
   institutions. The article finds that the design of the ISES presented
   failures in the transfer due to the lack of analysis of the constraints
   and limitations of the policy transfer process.},

Abstract = {During the first half of the 20th century, some of the strongest union
   movements failed to provide much protection against dismissal. This
   contrasts with countries with comparatively weak union movements, where
   workers benefitted from far-reaching statutory protection. This
   counterintuitive outcome can be explained by the unions' interest in
   maximizing institutional control by regulating dismissal protection in
   collective agreements. Yet such preemptive regulation was only possible
   under unique circumstances: it required a strong trade union Movement
   that could conclude collective agreements before the advent of
   employment contracts being regulated by statutory labor law. The
   regulation of dismissal protection by means of collective agreements had
   unintended consequences. As regulation progressed faster in statutory
   labor law, countries with weaker union movements soon obtained higher
   levels of dismissal protection.},

Abstract = {In the past 30 years, party membership has dropped significantly across
   Europe, whereas other forms of political participation have developed. I
   first show how political parties have sought to be more attractive by
   lowering the cost of membership and creating new selective incentives
   (such as the right to vote in internal ballots), leading to a
   convergence of party rules across European parties. To understand the
   logic behind such reforms, one needs to take into account the broader
   political context and I focus on the United Kingdom to show how
   competition between and within parties provided the justification for
   changes that mostly aligned them with organisational myths. The third
   part argues that such changes in opportunities to participate in
   political parties contribute to explain why membership has continued to
   fall. This article draws on extensive qualitative research (including my
   own) conducted in and on political parties in the United Kingdom and
   France to provide a new account of membership recruitment crisis that
   contrasts with the traditional emphasis on supply/demand.},

Abstract = {In the summer of 2009, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court
   of Costa Rica began monitoring compliance with its direct orders in
   amparo and habeas corpus cases. The court announced the early results
   from its analysis at a well-attended March 2010 press conference. The
   president of the court promised to continue monitoring and publicizing
   the results for the foreseeable future. We use a unique data set on
   compliance derived from this monitoring system to evaluate theoretical
   claims about the relationship between the transparency of judicial
   orders and compliance. We observe that vague orders, and orders issued
   without definite time frames for compliance, were associated with
   delayed implementation. We also find that orders issued after the press
   conference were implemented roughly two months earlier than orders
   issued just prior to the press conference.},

   advances and retreats of the same and sustainable development in
   Venezuela. From this analysis seeks to investigate the instruments for
   environmental management and different elements in making decisions

   attain one of the biggest challenges of the fundamental principles of
   management as it is environmental sustainable development. The research
   is within the qualitative paradigm, based descriptive documentary
   research. We conclude that defined sustainable development has been
   operationalized as development that meets the needs of the present
   without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own
   needs, believes, therefore, that it is essential the interplay between
   social, economic and environmental to improve the quality of human life.},

Abstract = {This article has the purpose to assess if and how party system
   nationalization affects individual voting behaviour. Previous studies on
   party system nationalization have focused on systemic processes,
   exclusively dealing with aggregate data. The authors address this topic
   from a new empirical perspective, arguing that party system
   nationalization could act as a context dimension interacting with the
   vote choice function. How does this specific context dimension moderate
   the explanatory power of individual-level characteristics? On which
   determinants of vote choice does party system nationalization have a
   greater impact? To answer these questions, the authors focus on 23
   European countries through the use of the 2009 European Election Study.
   The empirical analysis shows that in nationalized contexts the impact of
   the left-right dimension on party support is higher than in
   territorialized contexts, whereas that of class as well as of
   culture-related variables is lower. The authors also discuss the
   implications of these findings.},

Abstract = {This text explores the relationship between the baroque Modernity of
   Bolivar Echeverria and the problem of Latin-American identity. As key
   hypothesis it is to be showed that the concept of baroque not only is
   not involved with the assertion of a substantial Latin-American
   identity, but also disbands the assumptions which allow to arrive to
   this concern. In this respect the philosophy of Echeverria can be read
   as a theory of civilization that shows that the baroque identity, that
   is, the Latin-American identity, is a paradoxical identity which
   disbands the border between the same and the strange. The paradoxical
   nature of the Latin-American identity does not constitute a regrettable
   fact, which should be overcome, but the baroque is the condition of
   possibility of any emancipation project around the continent.},

Abstract = {In this article, we test Putnam's claim that online interactions are
   unable to foster social capital by examining the formation of bridging
   and bonding social capital in online networks. Using Burt's concepts of
   closure and brokerage as indicators, we observe networks formed through
   online interactions and test them against several theoretical models. We
   test Putnam's claim using Twitter data from three events: the Occupy
   movement in 2011, the IF Campaign in 2013, and the Chilean Presidential
   Election of the same year. Our results provide the first evidence that
   online networks are able to produce the structural features of social
   capital. In the case of bonding social capital, online ties are more
   effective in forming close networks than theory predicts. However,
   bridging social capital is observed under certain conditions, for
   example, in the presence of organizations and professional brokers. This
   latter finding provides additional evidence for the argument that social
   capital follows similar patterns online and offline.},

Abstract = {In mid 1967 the biggest rupture with the youth faction occurred within
   the Argentine Communist Party, until then the most numerous left-wing
   political party in the country. Since it was university groups that
   spearheaded this split, it is crucial to examine the inner workings of
   the process in this sphere. This article focuses on the University of
   Buenos Aires, given the central role of the capital city and its
   flagship higher education institution in the events. To account for the
   reasons for this political divorce I will refer not just to the
   documents where the conflict became explicitly fleshed out but also
   other sources that allow to reconstruct the circumstances giving rise to
   the split.},

Abstract = {In the 2010-15 Parliaments, the UK House of Commons Committee of Public
   Accounts held hearings and investigated some of the operations of the
   tax avoidance industry. Its reports have been highly critical of the
   role of big accountancy firms in designing, marketing and implementing
   tax avoidance schemes which have enabled their clients to avoid taxes.
   The Committee's recommendations set a reform agenda but drew a lukewarm
   response from the government. An examination of the Committee's reports
   provides an indication of the trajectories of future debates and
   policies.},

Title = {From Sticks to Carrots: Electoral Manipulation in Africa, 1986-2012},
Journal = {GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {50},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {521-548},

Abstract = {Over 90 per cent of the world's states currently select their national
   leaders through multiparty elections. However, in Africa the quality of
   elections still varies widely, ranging from elections plagued by
   violence and fraud to elections that are relatively free and fair'. Yet,
   little is known about trade-offs between different strategies of
   electoral manipulation and the differences between incumbent and
   opposition actors' strategies. We theorize that choices for specific
   types of manipulation are driven by available resources and cost
   considerations for both incumbents and opposition actors, and are
   mutually responsive. We also suggest that costs of manipulative
   strategies are shaped by the level of democratization. We test our
   hypotheses on a time series, cross-sectional data set with observations
   for 286 African elections from 1986 to 2012. We find that
   democratization makes cheap' forms of electoral manipulation available
   to incumbents such as intimidation and manipulating electoral
   administration less viable, thus leading to increases in vote buying.
   The future of democracy in Africa thus promises elections where the
   administration of elections becomes better and better but at the same
   time vote buying will increase. Not all things go together, at least not
   all the time. The future of democracy in Africa will mean more money in
   politics, more patronage and more clientelistic offers thrown around, at
   least in the short to medium term.},

Abstract = {China is now emerging as one of the most important development partners
   in the world. Based on its double identities as both recipient and
   donor, China has developed some specialties in terms of international
   development assistance. What new elements has China brought to the
   international aid architecture? This essay argues that the Chinese
   foreign assistance theory has four unique features, namely prioritizing
   development without setting any precondition; building win-win
   relationships with recipient countries through promotion of their
   independent development and national interests; insisting on equality
   rather than moral preaching, as well as keeping strategic patience while
   avoiding technical short-sightedness. Despite such specialties, China's
   foreign assistance is still practiced under international frameworks;
   the changes it aims to make should not be regarded as a ``quiet
   revolution,{''} but as an amendment to the existing international aid
   architecture.},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {The existing survey research in post-communist societies focuses
   disproportionately on the mass citizenry and largely ignores questions
   about elite support for judicial institutions. This study examines
   business elite's confidence in the post-communist legal systems and
   assesses the effects of judicial institutionalization on their
   perceptions. It argues that as post-communist constitutional courts
   develop, their institutionalization helps generate positive elite
   perceptions of the country's legal system. This study tests hypotheses
   regarding business elite confidence in the legal system with the
   Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey data. The results
   show that the level of constitutional court institutionalization is an
   important determinant of business elite's perceptions of the legal
   system. During the 1999-2005 period, businesspersons in countries with
   highly institutionalized constitutional courts are on average 23.5\%
   more likely to express high level of confidence in their legal systems
   relative to businesspersons in countries where constitutional courts are
   weakly institutionalized.},

Abstract = {This paper conceives of the Arab Spring as a leap forward that has
   relegated the established order to the status of a `walking dead.' The
   `old' Middle East is dead in so far as that the Arab elites hold no
   bargaining chip with which to consolidate a stable domestic rule. Hence
   they are walking dead or zombies, as they have no sense of purpose, will
   or chances regaining livelihood. This is because, firstly, the
   repressive character of Arab states has no sympathy to gain from their
   impoverished and powerless masses. Secondly, such oppressive practices
   are coincident with the IMF's austerity programs, which constitute the
   greatest obstacle to Arab economie's serving their key purpose: social
   cohesion. Unfortunately these two arguments are insufficient to support
   the belief that a bright new day has dawned for the regional people, the
   `old' Middle East is one of the proverbial `walking dead'.},

Title = {Nominating Commissions, Judicial Retention, and Forward-Looking Behavior
   on State Supreme Courts: An Empirical Examination of Selection and
   Retention Methods},

Abstract = {High-profile advocates are pushing states to move away from judicial
   elections and toward a ``merit{''} method because it purportedly
   produces the best quality judges. Quality, however, is difficult to
   measure empirically. Rather than attempt to measure quality, we examine
   whether certain types of state supreme courts are more forward-looking
   than others. States are likely to desire forward-looking behavior among
   judges because it can protect judicial legitimacy, help states to
   control policy, and could be more efficient than myopic behavior. Using
   a recent innovation in matching called covariate-balancing propensity
   scores, we find that the U.S. Supreme Court is equally likely to review
   and reverse decisions by judges regardless of their selection or
   retention methods. These results suggest that state supreme court
   justices, no matter their paths of getting to (and staying on) their
   courts, are roughly equal in terms of forward-looking behavior.},

   programmes based on dialogue (re-)create vital spaces of communicative
   action not always directly available at other levels. By enhancing the
   overall deliberative quality of the system, they can generate a shift
   away from discourses of violence in the public sphere and contribute
   significantly to peace-building dynamics. Conceptual frameworks
   developed by Jurgen Habermas are useful in understanding the
   opportunities and challenges faced by such initiatives both at the
   micro- and macrolevel.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the educational policy of the government of the
   National Front of Carlos Lleras Restrepo, under two aspects: first,
   identify the impact of changes in the education system in Colombia
   (primary, secondary and higher) to society. Second, determine the role
   of education through a gaze of national budgets and development plans.
   The central idea of this paper argues that the educational policy of the
   government of President Carlos Lleras Restrepo obeyed against
   nationalist political commitment and resolution of national economic
   needs. In this vein, the formation of the Colombian was subject to the
   interests of the political elite and the changes to the education system
   were not enough to meet domestic needs.},

Abstract = {Accusations of political bias in the mass media, academia, the courts
   and various other institutions are common in many democracies. However,
   despite the prevalence of these accusations and the public attention
   they have received, research on the effects of perceived ideological
   distance on perceptions of political bias is lacking. Focusing on
   perceptions of political bias in academia, and drawing on a survey of
   1,257 students in social science and law faculties in five Israeli
   universities, we show that the perceived ideological distance between a
   student and her set of professors increases perceptions of politically
   biased behavior of professors, and that the effects of `left-wing' and
   `right-wing' ideological distances are not symmetric. Possible
   implications and directions for further research are then suggested.},

Abstract = {The very human consequences of the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean
   Sea have dominated recent headlines, as the number attempting the
   treacherous crossing from Africa to Europe has significantly increased
   in tandem with the minor improvement in conditions at sea. The question
   of how to tackle this problem has also featured prominently on the EU
   agenda, given that its current border-patrol mission, Operation Triton,
   was not designed to respond to the humanitarian challenges posed by the
   phenomenon. In this article, Alessio Patalano considers the lessons that
   can be drawn from Triton's predecessor, Operation Mare Nostrum, a
   year-long effort led by the Italian navy to rescue migrants, which came
   to an end in October 2014.},

Title = {Inequality, marketisation and the left: Schools policy in England and
   Sweden},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {54},
Number = {2},
Pages = {326-342},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {It is argued in this article that the marketisation of schools policy
   has a tendency to produce twin effects: an increase in educational
   inequality, and an increase in general satisfaction with the schooling
   system. However, the effect on educational inequality is very much
   stronger where prevailing societal inequality is higher. The result is
   that cross-party political agreement on the desirability of such reforms
   is much more likely where societal inequality is lower (as the
   inequality effects are also lower). Counterintuitively, then, countries
   that are more egalitarian - and so typically thought of as being more
   left-wing - will have a higher likelihood of adopting marketisation than
   more unequal countries. Evidence is drawn from a paired comparison of
   English and Swedish schools policies from the 1980s to the present. Both
   the policy history and elite interviews lend considerable support for

Abstract = {The rise of China in Africa is often described as a major challenge to
   the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) democracy promotion
   policies. China is accused of providing important volumes of loans,
   development aid, trade and investments without ``political strings{''}
   attached, thereby undermining the US and the EU's possibilities to set
   material incentives for reforms. This article investigates Ethiopia and
   Angola as two cases where one would expect that the growing presence of
   China has made it more difficult for the EU and US to support reforms.
   Empirical findings presented in this article go against this argument.
   In both countries, the EU and the US face substantial difficulties to
   make the respective government address governance issues. However, the
   presence of China has not made it more difficult for the US and the EU
   to implement their strategies. Instead the empirical analysis suggests
   that domestic factors in Ethiopia and Angola, notably the level of
   challenge to regime survival both governments face, influence both
   governments' willingness to engage with the EU and US.},

Abstract = {We model two aspects of executives in parliamentary democracies:
   Decision-making authority is assigned to individuals, and private
   information is aggregated through communication. When information is
   relevant to all policies and communication is private, all decisions
   should be centralized to a single politician. A government that holds
   cabinet meetings, where information is made available to all decision
   makers, outperforms one where communication is private: A multimember
   cabinet can be optimal; it need not be single peaked around the most
   moderate politician or ideologically connected. Centralization is
   nonmonotonic in the degree of ideological divergence. In a large
   cabinet, all power should be given to the most moderate politician. Even
   when uncertainty is policy specific and a single politician is informed
   on each policy, power should never be fully decentralized. Our model
   provides a justification for centralized authority and cabinet meetings
   that enhance the quality of policy.},

Abstract = {Russia's policy, in Ukraine is interpreted in very different ways. Some
   see it as offensive and strategic foreign policy, others as defensive
   and situational, driven by domestic considerations. Each interpretation
   brings with it a different argument as to how the West should respond to
   Russia: by detente, by containment and deterrence, or by promoting
   regime change from within. The European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty
   Organisation, and the United States must agree on what they want to
   achieve in their policies towards Russia, Ukraine, and other post-Soviet
   states and to what extent they commit themselves to those goals. The key
   to regime change in Russia lies in the success of Ukraine's
   transformation. The conflict in Ukraine teaches us how necessary it is
   to agree in advance on the consequences of breaking the rules.},

Abstract = {Since its launch, David Cameron's flagship Big Society agenda has
   attracted hostility and incomprehension in roughly equal measure. An
   important criticism of the Big Society is that it contains a rather
   confused view of motivations. In attempting to correct an overmighty
   state, the Big Society urges involvement in different ways: through
   market mechanisms (where profit is the prompt to action), increasingly,
   through `nudges' and, finally, citizen exhortation (where civic duty is
   the motivation). These represent, I argue, dissonant views of the
   individual and what motivates them, with the former two representing
   `anti-political' positions, as they discourage debate, contestation and
   authorship. Yet, placing it in a longer line of initiatives aimed at
   prompting greater levels of citizen engagement and responsibility, I
   argue that the Big Society represents the most recent iteration of a
   process that has a much longer heritage in British politics. Governments
   from the late 1970s onwards have sought to mobilise citizens to take on
   ever greater responsibilities. From this perspective, attempts to
   mobilise citizens, particularly through incentives and nudges, should be
   seen less as prompts to civic participation and more as diverse
   governance techniques to prompt self-government and responsibilisation.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {161-179},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this work we address the proposition that because it emerges from the
   contract tradition and so relies upon the assumption of mutual
   advantage, John Rawls' theory of ``Justice as Fairness'' cannot
   accommodate persons with severe mental and/or physical impairments. We
   respond to this criticism by proposing a revision to Rawls' contracting
   situation, the Original Position (OP). Specifically, we propose to
   supplant the traditional understanding of mutual advantage-which we
   agree does constitute the necessary and sufficient condition for
   deliberation to come about in the OP, as it stands-with a more modest
   alternative: a Hobbes-inspired concept that we call minimal mutual
   advantage. We argue that when this revision is introduced into Justice
   as Fairness, it reconciles admirably the seeming tension between
   contractarianism's insistence on the rational, self-interested actor and
   the reality of societies in which not all members are capable of meeting
   a standard of reciprocity understood in terms of productive
   contributions to the general well-being. In so doing, minimal mutual
   advantage renders indistinguishable the disabled from the able in the
   OP, allowing Justice as Fairness to capture successfully problems of
   disability while leaving intact the more appealing aspects of liberalism
   that other approaches would dismiss.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {East Ukrainian Kharkiv was at the start of 2014 the scene of fierce
   clashes between pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian groupings. Political
   polarisation makes the city a preferred target for Russia's hybrid war.
   A look at the background to the tensions shows how important historical
   memory remains for the city's present-day self-image. Many conflicts in
   Kharkiv revolve around competing views of history. They can be
   politically instrumentalised. Despite the local quality of the ``wars
   over memory{''}, the situation also reflects the tense relationship
   between the periphery and the centre. In wars over memory, there are no
   winners. The decisive factor is not who maintains the upper hand over
   local or national historical memory, but how the country finds its way
   out of polarisation and back to dialogue.},

Abstract = {The eurozone crisis suggests a significant reinforcement of executive
   dominance in EU policy-making. Opaque emergency decisions taken at
   European summits as well as treaties established outside of the EU legal
   framework facilitate the side-lining of democratically elected chambers.
   This development entails the risk of a new wave of
   de-parliamentarisation in EU policy-making. An effective scrutiny of
   crisis management by national parliaments is, however, indispensable for
   taking national ownership of the reforms in the Economic and Monetary
   Union (EMU). This paper investigates national parliaments' involvement
   in the development of instruments to combat the crisis. Based on a
   quantitative dataset of crisis-related parliamentary activities in
   2010-2012, the article observes a very uneven engagement in the scrutiny
   of crisis management. Institutional prerogatives in EU affairs as well
   as macro-economic factors can partly explain the observed variation.
   Surprisingly, however, crisis-related parliamentary activity is not a
   reaction to Eurosceptic attitudes either in parliament or among the
   public.},

Abstract = {This article examines how electoral outcomes nurture democratic
   sentiment. Elections generate winners and losers, and voters alter their
   beliefs in ways that are congruent with electoral choices. Yet, while
   winning and losing shape democratic sentiment, comparatively less is
   known about the intermediary influences through which this relationship
   flows. Analysing data from the Federal Republic of Germany, this article
   probes for contextually driven effects using cross-level modelling of
   German General Social Surveys (Allgemeine Bevolkerungs Umfrage der
   Sozialwissenschaften). Four hypotheses are tested at the individual
   level, with the results confirming the following. First, winners'
   democratic sentiments remain firm in the context of electoral stalemate,
   but are mediated through their ideological proximity to the party for
   which they voted. Second, time conditions winners' democratic
   sentiments, but in discrepant ways in the east and west of the country.
   There is no evidence that the western relationship has systematically
   weakened over a 20-year period. The eastern relationship, meanwhile, was
   especially strong following unification, but stabilised thereafter. In
   demonstrating that winners' attitudes are influenced by political
   context and time, the article presents a more refined analysis and a
   more comprehensive account, and develops fresh lines of inquiry into the
   structure of mass democratic sentiment.},

Abstract = {The importance of institutions in shaping citizens' ability to punish or
   reward politicians for economic outcomes is well established. Where
   institutions divide authority, politicians can blame each other and
   citizens find it harder to assign responsibility for policy failures;
   where institutions clarify lines of authority, citizens can better hold
   politicians accountable. However, this argument assumes that citizens
   perceive policy responsibility as shared among political actors and this
   is not always the case. Looking at security policy, we argue that when
   policy responsibility is concentrated in a single actor the effect of
   institutions on blame attribution is different from what the economic
   voting literature predicts. Divided government in this context makes
   blame-shifting less effective and makes it more likely that citizens
   will punish incumbents. By contrast, the ability of executives to
   control the narrative around security failures by blaming the
   perpetrators, especially during unified government, can help them avoid
   blame.},

Abstract = {Researchers such as Hofstede (2002) and House, Hanges, Javidan, Dorfman
   and Gupta, (2004) have defined well-known cultural clusters such as,
   Anglo, Germanic, and Nordic cultural clusters. However, Iceland was not
   incorporated in these studies and therefore the research question of
   this paper is: In relation to Hofstede's five cultural dimensions where
   does Iceland differ in relation to 25 of the OECD member states using
   VSM94? A questionnaire was sent to students at the University of
   Iceland, School of Social Sciences by e-mail in October 2013. The five
   dimensions of national culture were measured using scales developed by
   Hofstede called VSM 94. The results indicated that Iceland differs
   considerably from nations such as Slovakia, Japan, India, Thailand and
   China, which were found high in PDI and the MAS dimension while Iceland
   was found to be high in IDV and low in PDI. When considering the 25 OECD
   countries, Iceland is more similar to the Anglo cluster, C3, Canada, New
   Zealand, United Kingdon, Australia and United States than the Nordic
   cluster, C1 i.e. Denmark, Sweden and Norway. Iceland is similar to those
   countries in relation to high IDV, low PDI but differs in the dimensions
   MAS and UAI where Iceland scores higher.},

Abstract = {The existence of both the Texas Supreme Court and Texas Court of
   Criminal Appeals makes it possible to test several important hypotheses
   of elections held between 1988 and 2008 using a variety of statistical
   tools related to the impact that subject matter jurisdiction (civil
   versus criminal) has on the outcomes of an election. In this comparative
   analysis, this article shows that the factors that influence election
   outcomes for seats on one court are different than those factors that
   influence outcomes on the other. New information is learned about the
   importance of demographic variables, judicial or legislative experience,
   and performance in the state bar poll.},

Abstract = {Due to budgetary constraints, officials at Jena's Friedrich Schiller
   University are discussing the possibility of not appointing a new Chair
   of Caucasus Studies. This would be tantamount to abolishing the field of
   study. It would not only eliminate a unique selling point and thwart the
   university's strategy of internationalisation. The abolition of Caucasus
   Studies would also stand in blatant opposition to recommendations from
   the German Council of Science and Humanities, the German Rectors'
   Conference, and the state of Thuringia's Ministry of Education, Science,
   and Culture, all of which called for the strengthening of small fields
   of study and the expansion of Caucasus Studies.},

Volume = {4},

Abstract = {This article argues that a concept of ``empire crime{''} can usefully
   extend that of state crime to better comprehend the unlawful
   ``extraordinary rendition{''}, detention without trial and torture
   associated with the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay and other sites
   where imperial ``exceptions{''} to US and international law are claimed
   and practiced. Other nation states have been complicit in this regime -
   the UK, Canada and Australia among them. Their state crimes in this
   respect are inextricably part of the ``empire crime{''} of the US-led
   empire of capital. This article considers one case in detail: that of
   David Hicks, one of the two Australians rendered to and detained at
   Guantanamo Bay with the connivance of the Australian and other states.
   The US state has variously denied, rationalized, exceptionalised and
   blamed the victims of the state crimes in this regime, and the
   Australian and other states involved have falsely denied knowledge and
   otherwise followed suit.},

Abstract = {Heterodox economists have criticised the ahistorical character of
   orthodox economics, focusing on its inadequate ontological foundation.
   This paper adds to the ontological critique of orthodox economics by
   arguing that organically based atomism, Marx's ontology specifying
   social relations and conditions under capitalism, explains the
   appearance of social atomism as a result of capitalism's organic
   interdependencies. It elucidates how organically based atomism, which is
   composed of original accumulation and alienation, abstract-alienated
   labour and the exposition of the value forms, and Marx's critique of
   commodity fetishism, can be used to criticise the ahistorical character
   of orthodox economics.},

Abstract = {This article examines the problem of succession in Hobbesian terms.
   Hobbes tried to solve it by means of principles of `artificial eternity'
   that fitted his political science. But, evidently, political decisions
   cannot be explained only by principles. Securing artificial eternity is
   a goal that has ever been in the forefront of political thinking and
   practice, often better captured by literary works than by scientific
   treatises. Accordingly, the present approach makes use of two such
   works, Calderon's Life Is a Dream and Kleist's The Prince of Homburg. It
   is argued that both plays have valid and compelling solutions to the
   problem of succession, and that these solutions are surprisingly
   similar: political succession is a matter of a successful merging of
   identities while preserving the personal nature of political authority.},

Abstract = {The development of a formerly poor state in a great European power to a
   rich state in a small European country is remarkable. But the interest
   of this article is mainly on the methodology which is based on the
   exclusive focus on three key periods in the history of the observed
   region. This methodology leads to a very specific understanding of
   development and economic growth. The periods chosen in this example are
   the five years before the First World War, as it was a period of
   development and growth that in the end led to the fundamental crisis in
   the 20th century. The second period consists of five years following the
   Second World War. This period was crucial, as many fundamental
   developments were laid in this time. The final period begins with
   another big economic crisis in 2008. The selection is based on three
   rationales. First, it allows a comparison of how the population deals
   with crisis. Second, it provides a cross-section of over hundred years,
   and third, the topicality of these years increase the relevance of the
   paper.},

Title = {Expressive Partisanship: Campaign Involvement, Political Emotion, and
   Partisan Identity},

Abstract = {Party identification is central to the study of American political
   behavior, yet there remains disagreement over whether it is largely
   instrumental or expressive in nature. We draw on social identity theory
   to develop the expressive model and conduct four studies to compare it
   to an instrumental explanation of campaign involvement. We find strong
   support for the expressive model: a multi-item partisan identity scale
   better accounts for campaign activity than a strong stance on
   subjectively important policy issues, the strength of ideological
   self-placement, or a measure of ideological identity. A series of
   experiments underscore the power of partisan identity to generate
   action-oriented emotions that drive campaign activity. Strongly
   identified partisans feel angrier than weaker partisans when threatened
   with electoral loss and more positive when reassured of victory. In
   contrast, those who hold a strong and ideologically consistent position
   on issues are no more aroused emotionally than others by party threats
   or reassurances. In addition, threat and reassurance to the party's
   status arouse greater anger and enthusiasm among partisans than does a
   threatened loss or victory on central policy issues. Our findings
   underscore the power of an expressive partisan identity to drive
   campaign involvement and generate strong emotional reactions to ongoing
   campaign events.},

Title = {The EU's Convergence Dilemma},
Journal = {BALTIC JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {36-55},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {As economic stagnation continues to mark the EU in the fifth year of the
   euro zone crisis, political support for integration is waning. The
   European Parliament elections of 2014 returned a hitherto unparalleled
   number of Eurosceptic MEPs, with EU-critical parties becoming the
   largest ones in several Member States. Much of this Euroscepticism is
   driven by economic polarisation between core and peripheral countries.
   While an increasing number of voters in the northwestern creditor
   countries resent having to foot the bill for what they consider economic
   mismanagement in the periphery, voters in peripheral countries
   increasingly rebel against what they deem to be an economically
   catastrophic Diktat from Germany and its allies. Continued political
   support for European integration will hinge on successful income
   convergence in the EU but the current dilemma is that such policies
   might not be politically feasible. Periods of rapid convergence would
   seem to suggest that success depends on two main policy strategies.
   First, a monetary policy that promotes credit for productive purposes,
   leaves inflation control to other instruments, and employs selective
   credit rationing to prevent asset booms. Second, a vertical industrial
   policy prioritising selected industrial sectors. The first policy
   conflicts with the present framework of euro zone monetary policy, but
   that framework was only installed in the first place because many
   peripheral countries were desperately in search of an external
   constraint on domestic distributional conflict. Industrial policies, in
   turn, require a sufficient degree of state autonomy from business elites
   in order to be effective, but it is highly questionable whether most
   states in the EU possess such autonomy. Though there are, as yet
   hesitant, signs of a reorientation of both monetary and cohesion policy
   in the EU, the question of the institutional and political preconditions
   for their successful implementation has been largely neglected.},

Abstract = {Previous research has shown that citizens tend to be more satisfied with
   the functioning of democracy when their ideological positions are more
   proximate to representatives'. This article argues that congruence in
   policy priorities between citizens and political elites should have a
   similar effect: citizens whose concerns are shared by elites should
   perceive them to be more attentive and responsive to public concerns and
   societal needs. Yet, the relationship might vary with differences in
   expectations towards democracy and representation. Specifically, it
   should be stronger in more democratic countries and older democracies.
   The hypotheses are empirically tested in a multilevel regression
   framework, where voter survey data from the 2009 European Election Study
   is linked with candidate survey data. The results indicate that citizens
   are indeed more satisfied with democracy if elites share their concerns,
   and the effect increases with democratic experience.},

Abstract = {While a growing literature deals with the effect of personality traits
   on political attitudes and behaviour, only a few studies evaluate the
   interplay between personality and the political environment. In this
   paper we investigate the effect of personality on party attachment in
   context. The novel approach we advocate involves positioning personality
   variables within a politico-institutional framework. In particular, we
   emphasize the interaction between the Big Five personality traits and
   direct democracy in explaining the strength of party attachment. Running
   Heckman Selection Models of unique survey data from a random sample of
   Swiss eligible to vote, we confirm some important previous findings
   regarding personality and party attachment, and demonstrate that the
   relationship between, in particular, agreeableness and party attachment
   varies substantially over environmental stimuli, e.g. direct democratic
   contexts.},

Abstract = {The article begins with a critique of the historical construction of
   concepts such as ``progress{''} and ``development{''} that have been
   used for centuries to justify colonialist and capitalist proposals and
   promises of welfare. For a large part of mankind, these promises have
   not been fulfilled. Therefore, a growing debate on ``alternative
   development{''} and ``civilizational change{''} has emerged. Within this
   debate, the indigenous peoples of the Andes and the Amazon have put
   forward another proposal: the ``good living{''} or Sumak Kawsay, that
   has been included in the Constitutions of Ecuador and Bolivia. Good
   Living is about values, experiences and practices from indigenous
   community, and it focuses on harmony among individuals living in the
   community, among peoples, and among them and nature. For example, in the
   Constitution of Ecuador Nature is a subject of rights. In the same vein,
   the Constitution intends a transition towards caring and sustainable
   economy, which includes the decrease of extractive economy and focuses
   on local and participatory policies. ``Good living{''} needs to be
   understood more as an experience than as a mere concept. Consequently it
   makes possible to build a world in which all worlds can fit, where all
   human beings can live with dignity.},

Abstract = {The article proposes a framework for generating Islamic-based knowledge
   on International Relations (IR) that takes advantage of the explanatory
   power of western IR theory without adherence to its philosophical
   foundation. To this end, the article proposes that Islamic engagement
   with western IR theory should commence at the foundational level. It
   articulates Islam as a foundational commitment held by Muslim IR
   researchers different from foundational commitments in the discipline.
   More pointedly, it focuses on agency, specifically, Islamic agency in IR
   as a theoretical effort that demonstrates that Islamic foundational
   commitments are necessary for Islamic-based knowledge production. The
   article concludes not by calling on Muslim IR researchers to
   ``abandon{''} the study of Western-oriented IR, but by calling on them
   to first bring on board their Islamic knowledge and worldview, and only
   then to assess Western conceptualizations of the social arrangements of
   IR accordingly.},

Abstract = {Many political scientists and economists have argued that coalition
   governments tend to accumulate more debt than single-party governments
   do, but the evidence for this proposition is mixed. This article argues
   that only some coalition governments are more likely to increase public
   debt than single-party governments: those in which parties are unable to
   make credible promises to their partners about future policy. It
   introduces the concept of `commitment potential' within coalitions and
   proposes a way of measuring it. The study evaluates its theoretical
   claims using data on 20 advanced democracies observed over a period of
   almost 50 years. It finds that multiparty governments with high
   commitment potential do not, on average, accumulate more debt than
   single-party governments, but that governments with low commitment
   potential do.},

Abstract = {A theory of linguistic justice needs to take into account the three
   distinct values of language as a medium for communication, as a source
   of individual identity and as an instrument for political
   self-government. Doing so would undermine Van Parijs' claim that
   political borders and peoples should be downgraded to a purely
   instrumental role for purposes of social justice. But it would widen the
   scope of egalitarian global justice by including a universal right of
   individuals to membership self-governing polities and it could provide
   more solid theoretical foundations for his defence of coercive
   territorial language regimes.},

Abstract = {Guillermo O'Donnell's work paid extensive attention to the issue of
   State's effectiveness mid power. For O'Donnell, the State and its
   different expressions are key elements of contemporary democracies. For
   the Argentine political scientist, the State should not be studied
   observing only bureaucracies and its instniments, but contemplating
   principally the effectiveness of the established legal order that it
   seeks to guarantee. With the help of O'Donnell's work this paper
   overviews several issues around State effectiveness: its infrastructural
   power; the inevitable, egalitarian and intra-subjective character of
   public order; and the links between effectiveness and capacity.},

Abstract = {Volunteer battalions are a response to Russia's covert invasion of
   Ukraine. While most of the formations can be considered as a war-related
   version of civil society within post-revolutionary Ukraine, there are
   volunteer formations that bear the marks of ``uncivil society{''}. Among
   them is the Azov Battalion. Its history is sketchy, its leadership and
   symbolism are fascist. But Azov, which has been upgraded to a national
   guard regiment, is atypical.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {49-60},
Abstract = {On September 2009 the European Union (EU) adopted a regulation banning
   the import of seal products into the EU or placing seal products on the
   EU market. The European Parliament was the main driving force behind the
   regulation and the EU has been criticised by affected countries outside
   the EU for not basing this decision on the available expert knowledge.
   The questions asked are how, given epistemic dependence, non-experts may
   challenge an expert based policy proposal. Can non-experts hold experts
   accountable, and if so in what way? Three main tests and ten subtests of
   expert knowledge are proposed and these tests are then used to assess
   whether the European Parliament did in fact argue in a way consistent
   with available expert knowledge in amending the Commission proposal for
   a regulation.},

Abstract = {In formal analysis of collective action, usually attention is focused on
   problems arising in aggregating the separate orderings into coherent
   collective results. Our concern is not with the aggregation problem.
   Instead, our focus is on the particular characteristics of the
   alternatives themselves. Alternatives in collective actions are
   fundamentally different from alternatives in market choice (apples and
   oranges). Regardless of motivation, collectivization forces attention on
   the distribution of benefits and costs among others in the sharing
   community. We first examine the formal structure of alternatives as
   these are confronted by a participant in the collective action. The
   second feature involves distributional patterns made necessary by
   collectivization.},

   contemporary European states - subject to powerful and converging

   forms of territorial convergence? Focussing on the case of Wales, the
   chapter introduces the material and constructed dimensions of
   territorial governance and political capacity in order to provide a
   multi-dimensional analysis. As well as providing this analytical
   framework, Cole and Stafford examine the development of devolution in
   Wales since its introduction in 1999 and place these devolved governance
   arrangements within the wider comparative context.},

Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {59-96},
Abstract = {When the United States activists called for people to
   Occupy\#everywhere, it is unlikely they were thinking of the
   headquarters of the Italian centre-left party. Parties and movements are
   often considered to be worlds apart. In reality, parties have been
   relevant players in movement politics, and movements have influenced
   parties, often through the double militancy of many of their members.
   OccupyPD testifies to a continuous fluidity at the movement-party
   border, but also to a blockage in the party's interactions with society
   that started long before the economic crisis but drastically accelerated
   with it. In this paper we present the OccupyPD Movement as a case of
   interaction between party politics and social movement politics, and in
   particular between the base membership of a centre-left party and the
   broader anti-austerity movement that diffused from the US to Europe
   adopting similar forms of actions and claims. Second, by locating it
   within the context of the economic and democratic crisis that erupted in
   2007, we understand its emergence as a reaction towards politics in
   times of crisis of responsibility, by which we mean a drastic drop in
   the capacity of the government to respond to citizens' requests. To
   fulfil this double aim, we bridge social movement studies with research
   on party change, institutional trust and democratic theory, looking at
   some political effects of the economic crisis in terms of a specific
   form of legitimacy crisis, as well as citizens' responses to it, with a
   particular focus on the political meaning of recent anti-austerity
   protests. In this analysis, we refer to both quantitative and
   qualitative data from secondary literature and original indepth
   interviews carried out with a sample of OccupyPD activists.},

Pages = {473-493},
Abstract = {The relationship between Indigenous peoples and the settler state
   remains fraught due to ongoing violence and mistrust. Numerous attempts
   have been made to ` reconcile' this beleaguered relationship over the
   past three decades. Indigenous peoples have advocated for the
   decolonization of the settler state and a suitable land base using the
   language of public investment. In response, settler governments reframe
   these requests as opportunities for economic investment that is
   guaranteed to produce self-esteem and social inclusion for Indigenous
   peoples. This article documents and problematizes an ideological shift
   whereby holistic decolonial approaches to reconciliation give way to an
   investment rationale that is used to bypass demands for Indigenous
   peoples' jurisdiction and self-determination. The ramifications of this
   shift are examined in three `eras of reconciliation' (Section 37
   Constitutional Talks, Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples,
   reparations for Indian residential school {[}IRS] Survivors) that also
   coincide with three types of investment: a) national; b) social; and c)
   therapeutic.},

   However, the 2014 Farm Bill contained only minor changes and SNAP
   enrollment expanded greatly in response to the Great Recession that
   began in December 2007. This chapter chronicles conservative policy
   ideas for reforming the SNAP program, including attempts to remove the
   program from the Farm Bill. Despite obstacles and opposition, the place
   of SNAP in the Farm Bill has so far allowed the program to continue
   without major changes.},

Abstract = {What is the significance of upsurge of protest and claims-making for how
   we understand citizenship in relatively new democracies? In Chile, some
   20 years after a paradigmatically successful democratisation, student
   protests for a more equitable education system have re-politicised and
   transformed debates about what democracy and citizenship should mean.
   Claims are being staked not only for educational reform but also for a
   new model of citizenship based on rights and welfare, in contrast to
   neoliberal models of citizenship as individualisation and consumption.
   In raising consciousness as regards the costs of neoliberal democracy,
   the student protests are reviving the country's radical traditions and
   past practices of an engaged, political active youth movement.},

Abstract = {Some of the contemporary writings provide a different outlook in
   adopting institutional analysis by claiming that society-rooted politics
   is foremost in shaping the third world's political institutions. This
   paper, drawing on an empirical study, puts special emphasis on
   understanding the nature of society rooted politics in designing the
   local government system in Bangladesh and how it has shaped local
   policy-making. By focusing on the policy-making of a municipal
   corporation, this paper identifies the actors and factors and their
   roles in the urban local governance process in Bangladesh.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {229-247},
Abstract = {Robert Dahl's writings contain a number of intriguing passages about
   leadership. The relevant sections appear in several of his key writings,
   including the Preface to Democratic Theory, Who Governs?, Modern
   Political Analysis, After the Revolution, and Democracy and its Critics.
   In these works, Dahl's conception of leadership evolves from an emphasis
   on `control' to `influence', and finally broadens to include
   `competence' and `expertise'. These sections are episodic and
   disconnected from one work to another; they repay close attention,
   nonetheless. This essay identifies these promising themes and sketches
   out some directions that a political theory of democratic leadership
   based on Dahl's insights might take.},

Abstract = {Drawing on over 200 measures of job approval of Iowa governors from 1969
   to 2014 from the JAR database and the Des Moines Register Iowa Poll,
   this chapter tests whether the popularity of Iowa governors is explained
   by the same set of political and economic factors as shown in previous
   research. While the results tend to fit with such research, when
   estimating popularity for each governor independently, the effect of
   economic factors is inconsistent across models. The chapter concludes by
   asking: If economic factors are not consistently predictive of electoral
   success of recent Iowa governors, what is missing from the model? More
   importantly, why were Iowa voters less apt to punish Governors Branstad
   and Vilsack for poor economic conditions, but seemingly more likely to
   do so with Governor Culver?},

Abstract = {The counter-jihad scene can be understood variously as a collection of

   to improve academic understanding of this collection of movements,
   parties, and ideas by analyzing the discourse presented by a collection
   of online advocates whom I describe as the counter-jihad nebula. The
   findings suggest a need to at least partially re-evaluate the role of
   the nebula within the wider counter-jihad scene as well as the
   relationship between the wider counter-jihad scene and mainstream
   political discourse as expressed through various media outlets.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the outcome of the 22nd osce Ministerial Council
   (mc) meeting, held in Belgrade on 3 and 4 December 2015, the year that
   the osce celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act, its
   founding document. The article argues that the mc meeting was
   characterized by entrenched positions and that it illustrated the
   distrust and deep divides among the 57 osce participating States. The
   article explains that the negotiation process was overshadowed by the
   ongoing Ukraine crisis and by a number of bilateral conflicts between
   states. The author specifies some of the bilateral conflicts and shows
   how they took direct influence on the negotiation process and how they
   led to the fall of important draft documents. As a result, the Belgrade
   mc adopted only 5 declarations, among them on combating violent
   extremism and radicalization and on combating illicit drug trafficking.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a theoretical
   framework to examine popular democratic conceptions in societies with
   limited experiences of democratic politics. Second, following this
   framework, we use new survey instruments to investigate the origins and
   consequences of popular democratic conceptions in mainland China, with
   particular emphasis on how the Chinese government indoctrinates its
   people with a guardianship discourse on democracy to disguise its
   authoritarian nature. Using national survey data, this paper
   demonstrates that the Chinese government has effectively taken advantage
   of its regulated education and media systems, as well as its lingering
   Confucian and Leninist traditions, to promote and indoctrinate its
   people with the guardianship discourse. A majority of Chinese citizens
   indeed understand democracy following this particular discourse and,
   thus, perceive the Chinese government as more or less a democracy.},

Abstract = {What were the ingredients of Robert A. Dahl's genius as a political
   scientist? First, he asked good questions. Those were ordinarily bold,
   broad questions central to political theory that appear at the openings
   of his works and orient them. Second, he was resourceful in creating or
   tailoring holistic concepts such as `democracy' and `power', as well as
   compositional categories such as `cumulative' vs. `noncumulative'
   resources, or `participation' and `contestation' as routes to
   democratization. Third, he evangelized for hypothesis testing and
   reliance on data-sets as the future of political science, and he acted
   on this advice.},

Abstract = {With the prevalence and accessibility of film today, we must wonder how
   film affects its audience. In particular, how does film influence an
   audience's perceptions of the government? Regardless of the content,
   research demonstrates that film has the power to shape perceptions of
   its moviegoers on a range of subjects. In this study, two recent films,
   Argo and Zero Dark Thirty, were chosen as case studies to explore how
   Hollywood portrays the intelligence community in film and shapes
   opinions about the government more broadly. This research found that
   about 25\% of viewers of the two films changed their opinion about the
   government after watching one of the movies. Additionally, many of those
   changes are reflected in an improvement in the sentiments about the
   government and its institutions. This exploratory research provokes
   interesting discussions about the ability of film to influence the
   perceptions of an audience.},

Title = {Austrian Corporatism - erosion or resilience?},
Journal = {AUSTRIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {44},
Number = {3},
Pages = {39-56},
Abstract = {Notwithstanding ongoing processes of liberalisation and disorganisation
   in all capitalist economies, Austrian Corporatism has been found to
   display a remarkable resilience across distinct institutional fields.
   The focus of this article is on the role of social actors in
   (re)producing or changing institutional structures and practices of
   Austrian Corporatism. In the four fields investigated, i.e., economic
   and social policy making, collective wage bargaining, employment
   relations at enterprise level and vocational education and training,
   collective actors have contributed to an institutional conversion of
   corporatist institutions towards new purposes in an internationalised
   context rather than to institutional erosion. However, during the
   government coalition of the Conservative People's Party and the
   right-wing populist Freedom Party (2000-2006) it became clear that the
   normative commitment to Social Partnership would reach the limits of its
   capacity if the power-balance shifted towards a more neoliberal stance.
   Non-market institutions are therefore seen as providing `borrowed
   stability' rather than a robust basis for the resilience of Austro
   Corporatism. Trade unions in particular are required to shift their
   orientation towards their membership and find new ways of combining
   their role as Social Partnership organisations and social movements in
   order to safeguard non-market institutions.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the civil war in Sri Lanka as a sustained national
   catastrophe lasting 26 years. It studies how violence is inscribed and
   political ideologies of sovereignty and separation are manifest across
   two main arterial routes, the road and rail links between the north and
   the south of the island. Sutured by military check points, these
   arterial scars and their wartime itineraries mirror the unfolding
   catastrophe that surrounds them. They represent in microcosm the social
   and spatial involution that follows the breakup of the nation.
   Catastrophes including the catastrophe of war become critical sites for
   reading these transformations.},

Abstract = {The classical conception of fundamental rights responds to three
   premises: the relationship of fundamental rights is bipolar, between
   state and citizen; the state monopolizes the force and against this
   force citizens are protected by the fundamental rights; the state holds
   the force in his own territory. Today, the three premises are being
   questioned. The state is not the only one who can interfere on
   fundamental rights, but also hybrid private-state subjects, private
   actors and diffuse powerful figures such as Internet communities. The
   power instruments also extend and decentralized themselves, and include
   not only coercion, but also money and power of information. Third, the
   scene of fundamental rights is the whole world. All of this hinder the
   effectiveness of fundamental rights, but three rules are still valid.
   Although the enemy of citizens would not be the state, he must have a
   face and be accessible, since otherwise it would not be possible to go
   against him. The power is not exercised only through coercion, but the
   citizen has to know whether it is subject to control and how it is
   exercised, so the scope of secrets must be reduced. Finally,
   cross-border actions can only deal with cleverness and experimentation,
   not only with the law but also through the engagement of the civil
   society.},

Abstract = {The crisis of political parties in contemporary societies and
   democracies is composed of different points of views, that require a
   joint effort for social and political science to try to understand the
   changing relationship between citizens and parties. Compared to the
   political mass models, which are typical of the second half of the
   twentieth century, parties undergo deep processes of transformation. The
   beginning of a critical season for the traditional forms of political
   organization goes back to those years; and this critical season can be
   configured as ideological, organizational and institutional. Between the
   twentieth and twenty-first century, the political parties has
   strengthened the structure of their political organization and the
   weight of their parliamentary activities within the institutions,
   becoming more and more ``state-centered parties{''}, characterized by
   the progressive reduction of the forms of territorial settlement and the
   growth of the importance of central organisms and the representatives of
   the assemblies, especially those elected in national parliaments. This
   results in significant changes of the organizational model and their
   political functions. In the face of these changes, will the parties
   still remain a key player for the functioning of contemporary democracy?
   We will focus on three fundamental steps: the analysis of the creation
   process of parties and of their function; the description of the most
   recent perspectives in political parties; the analysis of the
   relationship between the personalisation of politics and the passage to
   leader democracy.},

Abstract = {Aspects of the Ukraine crisis present enormous problems for the future
   of OSCE and other international conflict mediation. Annexation, ``
   hybrid{''} warfare, the proliferation of non- recognized separatist
   polities, the absence of a shared baseline of facts and, therefore, the
   sharp divergence of narratives, and perhaps most of all, the development
   of fortress mentalities - all of these have challenged the `` Helsinki
   acquis{''} on which the OSCE is based. Developments in the protracted
   conflicts - greater Russian control over three of the separatist
   polities to the point of crypto- annexation and the spread of the idea
   that democracy and human rights are no more than tools of Western
   imperialist domination - affect the way in which the OSCE and its
   mediators are perceived. The cycle of Russian assertiveness and Western
   response has created a selfreinforcing spiral that consolidates
   alliances among those who share a fortress mentality, is used to justify
   past actions, discourages `` weakness{''} in the face of pressure, and
   encourages ever more aggressive responses to it. In the face of this
   discouraging picture, OSCE mediators should build on the remaining areas
   of co- operation - especially on the Karabakh conflict - and emphasize
   OSCE impartiality. The OSCE has always been a `` big tent,{''} a forum
   of diverse equals, none of whom has a perfect record on democracy and
   human rights. Criticizing and being criticized is not, therefore, a ``
   double standard,{''} but a dialogue that enriches all participating
   States.},

Volume = {65},

Pages = {5+},
Abstract = {It is with good reason that historians write the history of Russia as a
   part of European history. But how do they deal with Asia? Since the 18th
   century, ``Asia{''} has served as an asymmetrical antonym of
   ``Europe{''} in depictions of Russia. The Asia of the tsarist empire was
   declared the object of a civilising policy understood as ``European{''}
   or seen as a threat to Russia's European identity, if not the whole of
   Europe. On the other hand, Soviet Asia has received hardly any
   attention. With regard to history, Russian Studies should explore the
   relationship of Russia and Asia on a basis structurally equal to the
   well-studied relationship between Russia and Europe.},

Abstract = {Starting from the doctrine of ideology proposed by Destutt de Tracy in
   the late eighteenth century, the paper reconstructs its historical
   relationship with the social science, of which it was originally meant
   to be the ultimate expression. The historical necessity of ideology as a
   political science of the social is found in its ability to mediate and
   legitimize power relationships. It is not for chance that the Marxian
   critique of ideology is a radical critique of the constitution of power
   in a capitalist society. The attempt of the social science to neutralize
   the problem of power through the abandonment of the value judgments
   leads instead to the declaration of the end of ideologies. In the last
   part, the paper analyses the way in which ideology, after its
   identification with the forms of total domination, returns as a
   neoliberal tool of legitimizing market as a society without history.},

Abstract = {The euro crisis is marked by the intensification of intergovernmental
   policy coordination, an increasing asymmetry in European
   parliamentarism, a growing integration and legitimacy gap in the EU, and
   the politicization of integration. The crisis has confirmed and
   reinforced existing dynamics, rather than producing structural breaks or
   new developments. It shows, however, a double divergence: between the
   Eurozone and the rest of the EU, on the one hand, and between
   ``North{''} and ``South{''} among the Euro area countries. Finally, the
   crisis is characterized by a parallelism of neofunctionalist and
   postfunctionalist integration dynamics.},

Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {50},
Number = {4},
Pages = {70-80},
Abstract = {The article details the dominant narrative on the EMU crisis, the
   so-called ``Berlin View{''}, centered around the macroeconomic Consensus
   that emerged in the 1990s. This Consensus rules out discretionary policy
   (in particular fiscal policy) as a tool for policy makers, that should
   let market adjustments take care of macroeconomic shocks. The Consensus
   not only shaped the response to the crisis, but it is also the
   foundation of the Maastricht institutions (ECB mandate and fiscal rule).
   The article contrasts this narrative with a more structural one,
   highlighting the non-optimality of the EMU. If this second narrative
   were correct, much more than austerity and fiscal consolidation were
   needed. Institutions mimicking the functioning of a federal state would
   be needed to avoid divergence and further crises.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the brand concept is a powerful tool for

   of political marketing that tend to deemphasize the significance of
   communication, popular culture, and personality in politics and argues
   that the brand as a concept can bring together the economic and the
   aesthetic, rational choice and cultural resonance. It proposes a model
   of brand distinctiveness and argues that this may be useful both in the
   analysis of party communication and in the normative evaluation of that

Abstract = {Volunteering rates in Switzerland vary substantially across language
   regions. In this article, we investigate the cultural roots of this
   variation by presenting and empirically testing two different
   conceptualizations of how linguistic culture is related to individual
   volunteering. Whereas the first perspective perceives the individual as
   belonging to a particular language community and its norms and values as
   crucial for individual volunteering, the other sees the linguistic
   culture mainly as an important context in which an individual lives and
   which therefore influences individual volunteering. Empirically, we base
   our analysis on new survey data from 60 Swiss communes and apply a
   Bayesian multi-level analysis in order to disentangle the linguistic
   group from contextual effects. Our analysis supports the view that
   cultural patterns of civic self-organization can indeed explain regional
   volunteering behaviour in Switzerland. Whereas the propensity to
   volunteer is generally highest in German-speaking Switzerland, our
   findings reveal that it is the group of French speakers that exhibits
   the highest propensity to volunteer when controlling for language
   region.},

   article is the first to analyze the text body of all politically
   relevant ``Denkschriften{''} (memorandums) published by the Evangelical
   Church in Germany (EKD) from 1990 to 2010 by using in depth content
   analysis. Based on the categories, data and analytical techniques of the
   Comparative Manifesto Project all memorandums were electronically
   processed in order to analyze the position of the EKD in the
   left-right-continuum of German domestic politics. Across all political
   fields our analysis indicates that the EKD is not to be found ``far
   left{''}, as various critics presume, but that it is in clear proximity
   to SPD and Greens in the left-right-continuum of German politics.},

Abstract = {This article conceptualizes some of the political practices and
   discourses that characterize recent protest movements such as Occupy and
   the Indignados. These movements' strategies are distinguished by the
   central role they give to the occupation and recomposition of public
   spaces and also by their refusal to engage with representative politics
   and public institutions. Critics argue that this so-called strategy of
   withdrawal illustrates a categorical misunderstanding of the political.
   But as notions such as ``withdrawal{''} or ``exodus{''} give only a
   rather partial account of these movements' practices and discourses,
   this paper aims to introduce an alternative, contemporary concept that
   has a much stronger explanatory potential: ``prefiguration{''} or
   ``prefigurative politics.{''}In order to flesh out and apply this
   concept, it reconstructs the political ontologies of two radical
   traditions that significantly influenced more recent protest
   movements-namely, early anarchism with its antithetic dialectics
   (Mikhail Bakunin) and contemporary autonomist Marxism (Antonio Negri).},

Abstract = {Efforts to combat terrorism have become a priority in the security
   agenda of most countries around the world, while the respective
   policies, tools and instruments have amounted to significant costs. In
   this article, we review the literature on counterterrorism (CT)
   effectiveness and draw a series of rather negative conclusions with
   regard to the reliability of our knowledge in this area. We find that
   the literature displays case and data selection biases, and the results
   produced are oftentimes contradictory, mostly due to the use of
   different indicators. We then propose a conceptualisation of CT
   effectiveness, which should help to resolve some of the issues outlined.
   The article concludes by outlining some future research directions that
   should improve our methodological grasp in the field.},
