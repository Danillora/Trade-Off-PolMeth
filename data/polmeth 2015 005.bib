Abstract = {The urban street is a significant canvas within the material cartography
   of the nation-state's spatial frontier. Between March and May of 2010,
   the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship, also known as the
   ``Red Shirts,{''} painted Bangkok red as one of the most cohesive
   assemblage of street protests in Thai political history. Each protestor
   donated ten cubic centimeters of blood to be poured at several sites,
   including the Government House of Thailand, the ruling Democrat Party
   headquarters, and the Prime Minister's residence. Other vials were used
   to paint murals along the walls of the Old City. The intensified
   aesthetic presence of Thailand's rural voting majority challenged a
   historic marginality in the Thai polity, and was one of many semiotic
   tactics that foreshadowed the violence of the eventual military
   intervention under the name ``Operation Reclaim Space.{''} The city
   itself was projected as a wounded body, while the Red Shirts-as

   approach to protest in Bangkok treats the development of the

   intensification of presence and the ``good health{''} prerogatives of
   acceptable citizenship in the global city.},

Abstract = {This article summarises the findings from a study of what constituents
   want from their local Member of Parliament. We make use of a survey
   technique known as conjoint analysis, wherein we present a national
   sample of British voters with profiles of hypothetical MPs who vary
   randomly in their characteristics, activities and behaviour. We find
   that voters like MPs who are independent from the party line and who do
   not focus exclusively on national policy work. MPs' gender and
   experience matter far less to constituents. Overall, voters want a
   Parliament made up of strong-minded MPs who see their role as that of a
   constituency representative. This has important implications for
   parliamentary democracy in Britain.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2015},
Number = {1},
Pages = {158-164},
Abstract = {The purpose of the article is concerned with the description of
   political processes in the Siberian regions. Political processes are
   analyzed as part of the modernization process. According to the authors
   it is possible to discuss and describe different stages of perception of
   the phenomenon of regionalism. First, regionalism has seen from the
   point of view of the resistance against the modernization process if
   modernization was described as the centralization of the state. The next
   stage connected with development of more sophisticated approaches to the
   phenomenon of regionalism. For example we can discuss the possible use
   of ``new regionalism{''} concept to describe the dynamics of regional
   processes. The authors use the path dependence theory connected first of
   all with different types of Soviet socialist industrial modernization to
   analyze the dynamics of the political process. In particular, the
   background of Irkutsk region political polycentrism connected with it.
   According to the authors of the article there are some links between
   some periods of Russian history concerned the relations between the
   Centre and regions/ These relations always have been characterized by
   the ideology of building ``vertical of power{''}. These ideas are
   clearly manifested in the modern designation of governors by the Centre.
   Unlike the ``alien{''} governors regional parliaments were the original
   ``training centre{''} for regional policy. The article also examines the
   possibility and potential impact of outside factors connected with the
   today geopolitical changes in the world and then with the socio-economic
   and political changes in the Eastern regions. Contemporary outside
   challenges can lead to the actualization of the ``Eastern vector{''} of
   Russian foreign policy that will affect the redistribution of the center
   of gravity in Russia from the Central Russia to the Eastern regions.
   Also we can say about upgrade and creation of new meanings and senses
   concerned power ideological concepts of ``moral conservatism{''} and
   ``nationalization of the Russian elite{''}. In terms of ``turn to
   East{''} these ideologies can be perceived and evaluated by Russian
   Eastern partners as corresponded with traditional Eastern values.},

   recruitment in the civil service of Georgia, in light of the wave of
   dismissals after the 2012 parliamentary elections, and to highlight
   common problems that are characteristic for competitions in state
   organizations. Based on data collected during research, this article
   claims that drawbacks of the current recruitment practices in the
   Georgian civil service demonstrate that this aspect of human resources
   management carries signs of ``team or leader affiliation and loyalty{''}
   approach. This tendency, which relies less on the assessment of
   applicants' competency and motivation, seriously hinders the development

Abstract = {This article is concerned with the impact that federal structures have
   on the development of welfare to work or activation policies. More
   precisely, it argues that the incentives and the risks associated with a
   division of responsibilities among different jurisdictions may
   constitute an obstacle to broad reforms that promote labor market
   participation of nonworking benefit recipients. This argument is
   illustrated with a case study discussing policy responses to a massive
   rise in caseloads among social assistance recipients in Switzerland. We
   conclude that the lack of a fundamental reform was the consequence of
   the incentives provided by the federal structure of the program. These
   incentives have both encouraged cost shifting among jurisdictions and
   discouraged involvement of federal level policy makers in a bigger
   reform.},

Abstract = {This research note tests the hypothesis that lobbying activities in
   Canada are primarily aimed at the members of the executive branch. It
   uses the data of the Canadian lobbying registry to measure the number of
   contacts between lobbyists and public office holders between the summer
   of 2008 and the summer of 2013. The results indicate that the majority
   of lobbying activities are aimed at the executive branch. However, it
   appears that the House of Commons is one of the most popular targets of
   lobbying activities. In fact, empirical evidence shows that numerous
   lobbying organizations are engaged in integrated strategies that
   consider both the legislative and executive institutions.},

Abstract = {This article explores the public life of a law enacted in the
   post-liberalization era for the tribal-dominated areas (or Scheduled
   Areas {[}SAs] of the Indian Constitution) of India. This law, the
   Panchayat (Extension to Scheduled Areas) (PESA) Act, 1996 has been
   termed by many grassroots tribal organizations as `progressive' and
   `historic', because it gives some crucial rights to the gram sabha of
   SAs. Apart from giving a contextual understanding of the enactment of
   the law and its provisions, this article evaluates the general pattern
   of the experiences of its implementation, and in this context, focuses
   in particular on the case study of Rajasthan. It aims to underline the
   basic argument that though the implementation of this law has been
   highly dismal, it has got a public life for itself and has created
   enormous awareness among the tribals for their rights, which has led to
   the emergence of `legalism from below' and deeper democratization in
   these areas.},

Abstract = {Can the people deliberate to set the agenda for direct democracy in
   large scale states? How might such an institution work? The 2011
   California Deliberative Poll piloted a solution to this problem helping
   to produce proposals that went to the ballot and also to the
   legislature. The paper reports on how this pilot worked and what it
   suggests about a possible institution to solve the deliberative agenda
   setting problem. The legislative proposal passed the legislature but the
   ballot proposition (Prop 31) failed. However, we show that the proposals
   actually deliberated on by the people might well have passed if not
   encumbered by additional elements not deliberated on by the public that
   drew opposition. The paper ends with an outline of how the process of
   deliberative agenda setting for the initiative might work, vetting
   proposals once every two years that could get on the ballot for a
   greatly reduced cost in signature collections. Adding deliberation to
   the agenda setting process would allow for a thoughtful and informed
   public will formation to determine the agenda for direct democracy.},

Abstract = {Nearly all studies that seek to uncover the effects of military service
   on the individual are plagued with the self-selection bias that comes
   with studying the all-volunteer force. To solve this problem, this paper
   takes advantage of the natural experiment afforded by the suspension of
   the French National Service program to produce unbiased causal analyses
   of the effect of national service on a range of civic engagement
   measures. Results generated using Instrumental Variables estimation
   indicate that there is little difference in individual-level civic
   engagement between service participants and their non-serving peers.
   However, when potential mediators are taken into account, the ensuing
   results imply that the substantial increase in the likelihood of having
   children associated with national service participation has a
   suppressive effect on service participants' overall level of civic
   engagement.},

Title = {More Misinformed than Myopic: Economic Retrospections and the Voter's
   Time Horizon},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},
Pages = {865-887},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Retrospective voting is often considered representative democracy's
   saving grace. But just how long is the retrospective voter's time
   horizon? Do voters make decisions by taking into account evidence
   accruing over the policy maker's full term in office? Or do they rely on
   information from the recent past alone? We address these questions
   through a unique survey design which leverages real-world heterogeneity
   in economic outcomes prior to the 2012 U.S. presidential election.
   Contrary to conventional wisdom, our findings do not support claims that
   voters are myopic. Although they are able to distinguish between
   short-and long-term benchmarks, voters are no more accurate in assessing
   the former than they are the latter. The choice of time horizon also has
   no consistent effect on the decision to hold the incumbent to account.
   Our results question assumptions of voter myopia, revealing voters to be
   more misinformed than short-sighted.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Empirical human rights researchers frequently rely on indexes of
   physical integrity rights created by the Cingranelli-Richards (CIRI) or
   the Political Terror Scale (PTS) data projects. Any systematic bias
   contained within a component used to create CIRI and PTS carries over to
   the final index. We investigate potential bias in these indexes by
   comparing differences between PTS scores constructed from different
   sources, the United States State Department (SD) and Amnesty
   International (AI). In order to establish best practices, we offer two
   solutions for addressing bias. First, we recommend excluding data before
   1980. The data prior to 1980 are truncated because the SD only created
   reports for current and potential foreign aid recipients. Including
   these data with the more systematically included post-1980 data is a key
   source of bias. Our second solution employs a two-stage instrumented
   variable technique to estimate and then correct for SD bias. We
   demonstrate how following these best practices can affect results and
   inferences drawn from quantitative work by replicating a study of
   interstate conflict and repression.},

Abstract = {This research tests the association between legislature size and the
   size of `non-elite' populations in the American states. The theoretical
   assumption is that larger legislatures will be populated by a more
   diverse group of members, who will better represent and advocate for
   non-elites. Data are drawn from three time periods, which captures
   considerable variation in important variables, and provides a robust
   test of association between the size of state legislatures and certain
   sub-populations. The research demonstrates that larger Lower Chambers
   are marginally associated with a lower percentage of adults without a
   high school diploma, easily associated with a larger percentage of the
   states' poor receiving Medicaid, and also related to smaller state
   prison populations. This is the case after controlling for demographic
   and economic factors that also predict the size of these
   sub-populations. The findings suggest legislature size plays a role in
   dominant contemporary policy arenas and that there may be societal
   benefits associated with larger-more diverse-assemblies.},

Abstract = {In 2012, Canada's federal government announced cuts to refugee health
   coverage. Evidence suggesting that the cuts represent a social policy
   failure has since been accumulating, including the 2014 Federal Court
   ruling ordering their reversal. This explanatory case study uncovers the
   problem definition process that led policy development by applying
   coding methods to governmental publications, transcripts of
   parliamentary proceedings and internal governmental correspondence
   obtained under the Access to Information Act. The systematic analysis
   identifies avoidable gaps that occurred and proposes an avenue for
   strengthening future federal social policy processes so as to avoid
   negative outcomes such as those that resulted here.},

Abstract = {Although previous research demonstrates that proportionality positively
   impacts the congruence between the positions of the government and the
   public after elections, recent work argues and shows that
   proportionality dampens policy responsiveness in between elections. Why
   this is true is unclear, however. This paper considers how
   proportionality matters for policy responsiveness, focusing on two
   primary suspects: (1) the friction associated with coalitions in
   proportional systems and (2) the comparatively weaker electoral
   incentives in those systems. In this paper we first assess the general
   effect of electoral systems, showing that results are robust across
   measures, and also that the impact of electoral systems increases
   exponentially alongside party fragmentation. We then examine two
   alternative mechanisms at work in proportional systems, and preliminary
   results point towards the potential importance of government
   fractionalization in accounting for weakened inter-election
   responsiveness. In the concluding section we consider implications for
   our understanding of democratic representation, and also for future
   research on opinion-policy congruence. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The removal of Ben Ali's regime in Tunisia signalled the start of the
   Arab Spring. The abrupt nature of the regime change raises questions
   about why it happened in the way it did. This article examines the
   contextual factors that precipitated the regime change through the lens
   of political security. The aim is to examine how political insecurity in
   society led to the emergence of opposition sufficiently organized to
   unseat Ben Ali. The paper develops a framework to consider how the loss
   of legitimacy by the regime opened the space for opposition. Attempts to
   restrict opposition failed to address underlying claims, leaving the way
   open for the opposition to unite following the self-immolation of
   Mohammed Bouazizi.},

Abstract = {Drawing on an original dataset covering more than 100 political parties
   in over 20 European Union Member States, this article analyses how
   political recruitment procedures affect the proportion of women
   nominated on party lists in the context of the 2009 European Parliament
   elections. The findings show that the inclusiveness of the selectorates
   in the early stage of candidate selection processes is a key determinant
   of the representativeness of lists regarding their gender composition.
   Moreover, it is found that neither territorial centralisation nor the
   inclusiveness of the selectorate in the later stage of candidate
   selection play a significant role. The key to the puzzle, therefore,
   lies in the composition of the initial pool of potential candidates and
   those who make initial nominations.},

Abstract = {Among the 30 titles from 2015, 22 are first translations, most of which
   come from contemporary literature. This literature likes to address the
   ``wild{''} 1990s with their halfhearted reforms and painful distortions
   of political and social life (striking examples are the novel Liudi v
   avguste {[}People in August] by Sergei Lebedev, which has been repressed
   in Russia, and Aleksandr Ilichevskii's novel Matiss {[}Matisse]).
   Vladimir Sorokin sketches a grotesque vision of a mediaeval future for
   Russia in the novel Telluriia. Appearing for the first time in German
   are long forbidden works by Olga Berggolts, Mikhail Prishvin, and
   Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky. Standouts among the new translations are Anton
   Chekhov's late short stories, as translated by Peter Urban, and Mikhail
   Osorgin's novel Quiet Street.},

Title = {From class to region: How regionalist parties link (and subsume)
   left-right into centre-periphery politics},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {21},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {866-886},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The primary dimension of political contestation for regionalist parties
   is the centre-periphery dimension but they are pressured to adopt
   positions on the left-right dimension by competition with state-wide
   parties. We argue that the relative economic position of a region is a
   key variable for explaining how regionalist parties adopt left-right
   positions and link them to the centre-periphery dimension. Based on a
   quantitative analysis of 74 regionalist parties - distributed in 49
   regions and 11 countries - over four decades, we find strong evidence
   that regionalist parties acting in relatively rich regions tend to adopt
   a rightist ideology, while regionalist parties acting in relatively poor
   regions tend to adopt a leftist ideology. A qualitative illustration of
   two paradigmatic cases, the Lega Nord (LN) and the Scottish National
   Party (SNP), appears to support our interpretation that left-right
   orientations are subsumed into centre-periphery politics through the
   adoption of two ideal types of regionalist discourse: one labelled as
   bourgeois regionalism' (Harvie, 1994) and one labelled as internal
   colonialism' (Hechter, 1975).},

Abstract = {Different types of interest groups use different lobbying strategies.
   This article presents an investigation of this already well-established
   hypothesis once more, but additionally proposes that the institutional
   framework of the country in which interest groups operate also
   influences their lobbying behaviour. More specifically, it is shown that
   groups working in the interest of the public are better integrated into
   the policy-making process when direct democratic instruments, such as
   referendums, occur regularly (as in Switzerland) than when referendums
   are the exception (Germany). The article demonstrates that Swiss cause
   groups - often also referred to as public interest groups' in the
   literature - use a more balanced mixture of insider and outsider
   strategies than their German peers, but also that this moderating effect
   cannot be found for specific interest groups, such as industry groups or
   unions.},

Abstract = {This study seeks to explain why the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions
   mobilized different constituencies. Using original survey data, we
   establish that while participants in both revolutions prioritized
   economic concerns and corruption over civil and political freedoms,
   Tunisian revolutionaries were significantly younger and more diverse in
   class composition than the predominantly middle-aged and middle-class
   participants in the Egyptian Revolution. Tunisian revolutionaries were
   also less likely to be members of civil society associations and more
   likely to rely on the internet as their source of information during the
   revolution. We explain these differences by reference to disparate
   incumbent regime strategies for coping with similar structural pressures
   for state contraction and political reform, which created different
   patterns of societal grievance and opposition mobilizing structures in
   their wake.},

Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {45},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship has found identity variables to be insignificant
   predictors of civilian targeting in war. Drawing on the European origins
   of the law of war, this article argues that previous scholarship has
   neglected the one specification of identity' that is most theoretically
   justified for understanding civilian targeting: whether a European state
   is fighting a non-European state. This article replicates and extends
   three recent statistical analyses - Downes; Valentino, Huth and Croco;
   and Morrow - of civilian targeting by including a variable capturing
   whether a European state fought a non-European state. The study finds
   that civilian targeting, and non compliance with the law of war more
   generally, is significantly more likely in European v. non-European
   dyads than in other types of dyads.},

Abstract = {This article develops and tests a set of theoretical mechanisms by which
   candidate ethnicity may have affected the party vote choice of both
   white British and ethnic minority voters in the 2010 British general
   election. Ethnic minority candidates suffered an average electoral
   penalty of about 4 per cent of the three-party vote from whites, mostly
   because those with anti-immigrant feelings were less willing to vote for
   Muslims. Ethnic minority voter responses to candidate ethnicity differed
   by ethnic group. There were no significant effects for non-Muslim Indian
   and black voters, while Pakistani candidates benefited from an 8-point
   average electoral bonus from Pakistani voters.},

Abstract = {The collapse of the communist regime at the end of the twentieth century
   resulted in a wave of democratization in Central and Eastern Europe.
   While trying to establish democracy, many states in this region had to
   demonstrate their ability to protect human rights and to deal with the
   past of the repressive regime. As these states decided to join various
   human rights instruments they also became subject to certain obligations
   towards their people. One of these obligations is the requirement to
   provide remedies in case of human rights abuses, and the right to know
   the truth is recognized as part of it. Therefore the goal of this
   article is to identify the abilities of the victim of the communist
   regime to access the files of former secret services in post-communist
   countries in the light of the right to know the truth. The answer is
   provided using an analysis of international documents, historic,
   comparative and systemic methods, providing and evaluating the practice
   of different states dealing with the files of former secret services or
   government files of the repressive past and academic literature.},

Abstract = {Why has Congress, once a widely trusted institution, experienced such a
   uniquely dramatic decline in the public's confidence, and what are the
   consequences for democracy? This article sets out to systematically
   address these questions. First, I discuss how we can gauge Americans'
   levels of trust in Congress. Second, I examine trends over time in
   public trust in Congress, looking both partisan differences within this
   measure, and also overall differences in comparison to other
   institutions. Third, I examine various ways in which the much-noted rise
   in party polarization in Congress might explain the downward trend in
   Americans' trust in that institution. Finally, I explore one potentially
   important consequence of declining trust in the legislative branch:
   Americans' willingness to obey laws. The results suggest that those
   interested in the problem of declining trust in government would be wise
   to focus their attention on Congress. Compared to other institutions,
   the problem in Congress appears more severe, more intractable, and
   carries greater political consequences.},

Abstract = {The paper investigates the performance of China's housing market and the
   reasons for its housing problems. Beyond market mechanical deficiencies
   of the infant housing development, local government's housing-led
   economic development model and central government's economic-prioritised
   housing policy strategy are the roots of its housing problems. The Xi-Li
   leadership is seemingly taking a step towards market-supporting
   strategies; this could be the turning point in housing governance since
   the 1998 housing reform.},

Title = {Campaigns and the Mitigation of Framing Effects on Voting Behavior: A
   Natural and Field Experiment},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {There is a widely held belief that the way a ballot proposition title is
   framed (the way the issue is presented) has an effect on its eventual
   success or failure on Election Day. Prior to California's 2010 General
   Election, the ballot language for two propositions was disputed and
   challenged in court. For both Proposition 22, intended to change the
   allocation of state and local tax revenues, and Proposition 23, intended
   to overturn California's landmark global-warming law, Fresno County
   failed to make the court ordered changes. The election proceeded with
   the unchanged ballot language in Fresno County and the newly adjusted
   ballot language throughout the rest of the state. This paper takes
   advantage of this natural experiment to evaluate the potency of framing
   effects in direct democracy elections, as well as, the role that
   campaigns (high salience versus low salience) can play in limiting those
   effects. As a further test, survey data using identical language
   collected in an area where neither issue was of high salience is used as
   a comparison. This additional test serves as a mechanism to isolate any
   potential framing effect of campaigns. We conclude that the way a ballot
   measure is framed has an impact on its Election Day success so long as
   it is a relatively low-salience measure. For initiatives with vigorous
   campaign activity, such as Proposition 23, framing effects are less
   effective and not statistically significant in this instance.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {301-320},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Accountability processes after crisis events sometimes entail harsh
   criticism from public and political players alike, forcing cabinet
   ministers to be on top of the political game and sometimes even resign.
   However, harsh accountability processes are just as likely to leave
   ministers undamaged. This article combines two existing theories that
   propose different factors to account for variation in outcomes:
   ministerial resignations as a consequence of cabinet formation and
   individual positions; or resignations as a result of blame management
   strategies involving individual actors within the cabinet and beyond.
   Ten crisis episodes in Sweden are analysed and compared. The findings
   suggest that individual political power bases and experience matter to
   how well blame management strategies can be employed, while the
   composition of the government gives structural constraints. The dynamic
   interplay and framing battle between incumbent decision makers, and
   external arenas and the skill with which individual ministers engage and
   frame responsibility, play a key role in determining their post-crisis
   careers.},

   Ideologies, and Voting Behavior in US House Elections},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {While there is a strong scholarly consensus that race continues to play
   a central role in American politics, research on the effects of the race
   of candidates on electoral behavior has produced decidedly mixed
   results. Using American National Election Studies data, Cooperative
   Congressional Election Studies data, and a non-linear systems of
   equations approach to estimation, I show that race-based misperceptions
   of candidates' ideologies have a significant indirect impact on voting
   decisions in elections to the U.S. House of Representatives. The
   indirect effects of race on voting behavior outweigh any direct effects
   of racial prejudice by a substantial margin. More specifically, the
   results suggest that white citizens will tend to perceive black
   candidates to be more liberal than white candidates who adopt similar
   policy positions, and that these race-based misperceptions disadvantage
   black candidates at the ballot box.},

Abstract = {The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) manages to control vast
   territories in Iraq and Syria despite proclaimed international efforts
   to damage its structure. ISIL's insurgency has come to a point where it
   exercises governance in controlled territories and is able to provide
   state-like services to the population living under its rule. Combating
   ISIL has been so far focused on targeted killings of its senior cadres
   or restraining it from launching more large-scale offensives. This
   article argues that a successful strategy to counter the group must
   focus on disrupting its governance capabilities. Once ISIL loses its
   viable economic system and sources of income coming largely from oil
   smuggling, it will have a hard time sustaining compliance of the
   population.},

Abstract = {This article studies the political function of religion in Eastern
   Kurdistan (Iranian Kurdistan) during the Iranian revolution, 1979, and
   early years after its victory. It tries to answer the questions as; what
   is the effect of ideological hegemony of religion and its conversion to
   a political tool on the political issues of Kurdistan? And whether the
   religious ideology is a factor to solidarity or disintegration among
   Kurds? It clarifies the understanding of political groups on their
   society as a traditional society and the circumstances related to the
   time and place. In this regard, the function of Maktab Qur'an (Qur'an
   School) as most important Islamist trend at that time is examined.
   Besides, the stance and the approach of central government, some groups
   and main parties in Kurdistan in relation to religion are studied. This
   paper also makes an attempt to study the Islamist idealism and the
   ideological conflict between religion and left movement, its results and
   effects on Kurdistan's events.},

Abstract = {Black Sea regional analyses often assume that Turkey holds the role of a
   regional leader pursuing its intra-regional interests. In contrast to
   this perspective, this article will present evidence verifying an
   absence of a Black Sea regional conception in Turkey's foreign policy.
   It will show how Turkey's vision related to the Black Sea is limited to
   maritime security and control of the Turkish Straits. As this study
   reveals, even if Turkey perceives itself as a regional leader, this
   region does not include the Black Sea; Ankara has far bigger ambitions,
   seeing itself in the center of the Afro-Eurasian geography. Such an
   approach to the Black Sea region makes it very unlikely for Turkey to
   promote regional integration, much less see itself as part of the region
   at all.},

Abstract = {Like their larger counterparts, even the smallest states in the world
   have delegated powers and competences to subnational units. The present
   article aims to examine why these microstates, which are themselves
   smaller than the average municipalities of larger states, apparently
   recognized a need for political decentralization, and why their
   decentralized jurisdictions have remained in place. Building on the
   literature on the origins and persistence of federalism, the analysis
   reveals that the choice for decentralization in European microstates was
   made largely according to patterns suggested by the general literature,
   whereas insular identities and colonial legacies provide the strongest
   explanations for the origins of federalismin theAfrican, Caribbean, and
   Pacific cases. On the basis of two case studies of St. Kitts and Nevis
   in the Caribbean and Palau in Oceania, it is found that the persistence
   of federalism can be explained by means of both historical-institutional
   and rationalist arguments.},

Abstract = {The recent financial and debt crisis has resuscitated the debate about
   European federalism - a theme that seemed not to have survived the
   painful constitutional adventure that ended with the ratification of the
   Lisbon Treaty in 2009. With the adoption of significant policy and
   institutional measures for tightening macroeconomic and budgetary
   coordination (including a constitutionally enshrined debt brake), the
   reforms of the monetary union have undisputedly brought the European
   Union further on the path towards an ever closer union. In an era where
   EU integration has been increasingly politicised, and Euroscepticism has
   been on the rise and exploited by anti-system parties, national leaders
   have to face a political hiatus and respond to increased needs for
   symbolic and discursive legitimation of further federalisation. This is
   all the more crucial for French and German leaders who have brokered the
   main decisions during the crisis of the eurozone. Against this
   background, the purpose of this article is not to assess whether, or to
   what extent, the recent reforms of economic and monetary union have made
   the EU more federal. Rather, the purpose is to tackle the following
   puzzle: How have EU leaders legitimised the deepening of federal
   integration in a context where support for more European federalism is
   at its lowest? To elucidate this, a lexicographic discourse analysis is
   conducted based on all speeches held by the German Chancellor Merkel and
   the two French Presidents Sarkozy and Hollande, previous to, or after
   European summits from early 2010 until the spring of 2013. The findings
   indicate that federalism is both taboo and pervasive in French and
   German leaders' discourse. The paradox is barely apparent, though. While
   the F-word' is rarely spoken aloud, two distinctive visions co-exist in
   the French and German discourse. The coming of age of a political union
   through constitutional federalism is pictured as ineluctable, yet as a
   distant mirage out of reach of today's decision makers. At the same
   time, the deepening of functional federalism in order to cope with
   economic interdependence is a ubiquitous imperative that justifies
   further integration. The persisting gap between the constitutional and
   the functional vision of European federalism has crucial implications.
   Insofar as the Union is held responsible for not delivering successful
   economic policy, political leaders will fail to legitimise both
   functional and constitutional federalism.},

Abstract = {It is argued in this article that threatening stimuli affect political
   participation levels among non-authoritarians more than among
   authoritarians. Focusing on socioethnic diversity, which is known to be
   particularly threatening to authoritarians and to relate negatively to
   political participation in the general public, analyses of individual-
   and macro-level data from 53 countries is presented which supports this
   thesis. Participation levels among authoritarians are largely static,
   regardless of a country's level of socioethnic heterogeneity, while
   non-authoritarians participate considerably less in countries with
   relatively high levels of socioethnic heterogeneity. This suggests that
   authoritarians participate to a proportionately greater degree in the
   most diverse countries.},

Abstract = {Issue ownership means that some parties are considered by the public at
   large as being more able to deal with, or more attentive to, certain
   issues. The theory has been used to explain both party behaviour -
   parties are expected to focus on owned issues - and voter behaviour -
   when a voter considers a party to own an issue, this affects the odds of
   voting for that party. The purpose of this article is, first, to provide
   a look backward at the existing research through a literature review of
   the studies that were conducted in the past decade-and-a-half. Secondly,
   it takes stock of the current conceptualisation and argues that issue
   ownership is a multidimensional concept. Thereafter the article
   discusses how this multidimensionality affects both the role of issue
   ownership in voter and in party behaviour. Finally, the article outlines
   a number of shortcomings of the extant literature and discusses
   potential avenues for future research.},

   the European Union (EU) and a transnational policy network (TPN) that
   deals with an issue that has grown in importance in the architecture of
   the EU's energy policy: fracking. The author argues that successful
   engagement between the EU and networks on shale gas was facilitated by
   the fact that the TPN or the members of the TPN were in possession of
   technical and scientific information that is highly needed by
   institutions in Brussels. Also, the article reveals that the fact that
   EU energy insecurity has been high on the EU agenda increased EU's
   interest in actors that could provide vital insights into potential
   panaceas and palliatives to energy insecurity.},

Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {This paper addresses the assertion that preferences for a comprehensive
   welfare state hamper and delay the emergence of a liberal-democratic
   culture in East Germany. Two questions are explored: first, has the
   impact of welfare-state values on support of the German democratic
   regime declined in East Germany since re-unification and adapted to the
   lower levels observed in West Germany? Second, are attitudes towards
   different welfare-state programmes equally important for citizens'
   approval of the German democratic regime? Empirical analyses on the
   basis of representative public opinion surveys conducted between 1991
   and 2012 confirm that the effect of welfare-state values in East Germany
   has converged to the smaller effect size observed in West Germany.
   Furthermore, attitudes to welfare-state programmes aimed at reducing
   income inequalities turn out to be a significant determinant of regime
   support in both parts of Germany. It is the higher demand for
   inequality-reducing governmental activities which still restrains the
   approval of the liberal-democratic regime among citizens in East
   Germany.},

Abstract = {Contemporary models of political economy suggest that reforms intended
   to reduce grievances should curtail unrest, a perspective at odds with
   many traditional accounts of reform and rebellion. We explore the impact
   of reform on rebellion with a new data set on peasant disturbances in
   19th-century Russia. Using a difference-in-differences design that
   exploits the timing of various peasant reforms, we document a large
   increase in disturbances among former serfs following the Emancipation
   Reform of 1861, a development counter to reformers' intent. Our analysis
   suggests that this outcome was driven by peasants' disappointment with
   the reform's design and implementationthe consequence of elite capture
   in the context of a generally weak stateand heightened expectations of
   what could be achieved through coordinated action. Reform-related
   disturbances were most pronounced in provinces where commune
   organization facilitated collective action and where fertile soil
   provoked contestation over land.},

Abstract = {The low-carb high fat (LCHF) diet, a buzz diet in Sweden, is stirring
   dogmatic conflict between dieters and representatives from the National
   Food Agency (NFA), even gaining international reputation. After
   gathering materials from social media and press reports covering the
   popular diet, a thematic analysis has been conducted. The aim of this
   study was to investigate how three non-conventional experts and
   influential promoters of the LCHF movement transact their criticisms of
   current nutrition authorities, and how they utilize social media for
   their purpose. The diet has been highly politicized, creating distrust
   against the established scientific community. Findings indicate that
   events on the national level led to an increased public awareness of the
   LCHF diet, providing the supporters with invaluable opportunities to
   criticize the established nutritional community. This enabled certain
   prominent advocates of the diet to gain momentum while using features of
   social media to further the diet's believability.},

Abstract = {In 1944, two seminal works of political and social theory appeared: FA.
   Hayek's The Road to Serfdom and Karl Polanyi's The Great Transformation.
   Both works focused on society's spontaneous resistance to the
   ``marketization{''} of life. Yet, the authors arrived at opposite
   normative conclusions. This article attributes the normative distance to
   a methodological clash over the role and limits of normative theorizing
   in the concrete and sometimes uncooperative world of politics. This
   clash, in turn, illuminates recent debates about ``ideal{''} and
   ``non-ideal{''} theory, and suggests limits to the applicability of the
   former},

Abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that women overcome the potential negative
   impact of gender stereotypes by emerging when they are stronger
   candidates than men. I leverage an original survey of state legislative
   candidates to determine whether women devote more time to their
   campaigns. I find that women on the whole, and those who had previously
   been elected to a political office in particular, invested more of their
   personal time into the campaign than men. This difference is driven by
   the fact that women are more likely to forgo employment during the
   election. These findings suggest that women are more likely than men to
   arrange their personal obligations in such a fashion that they can run
   stronger campaigns.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the reception and significance of the Spanish
   transition in political opposition to the dictatorship of Augusto
   Pinochet. Specifically, from the ``transnational history{''}, will
   determine the degree of influence that had the Spanish process in the
   formation and consolidation of political opposition during the eighties.
   This article argues that there was a use of the Iberian experience and
   his notion of ``transition model{''} as a way of legitimizing the
   transition type proposed by some opposition groups represented in the
   ``Alianza Democratica{''}, especially with regard to two key concepts:
   1) ``social consensus{''}, based on the unity of the ``democratic{''}
   parties and the need of reach certain agreements with the dictatorship
   and 2) ``negotiated rupture{''}, understood as the acceptance of the
   Pinochet legality.},

Abstract = {Theoretically the construction of legitimacy or border crime is admitted
   as a dynamic cultural result, able to feed off itself and with temporal
   and geographical boundaries. In this paper it is argued that the problem
   of criminal policy or design that marks the boundary between legal and
   illegal cannot circumscribe the penal and criminal procedure code, but
   requires: understanding crime as an illegitimate market keeping close
   relations with the legitimate as both exist in the communications space
   and the social construction of civilization and this is a result of
   cultural dynamics. Methodologically proceeded with: a theoretical
   discussion of these issues and statistical modeling and reports from
   different agencies working in this field in Bogota, DC management. The
   contrasting theory and evidence shed light on the problem is complex,
   the assumptions of economic motivations theories, among others are not
   met and is not easily solvable in a linear relationship expressed in the
   trinomial crime - delinquent - penalty. Your solution may be the
   anthropological and schemes proposed as solution game theory.},

Abstract = {This article deals with the issues of self-determination and multiethnic
   region-alisms in Dalmatia, Istria and Vojvodina - historic regions of
   today's Croatia and Serbia. The main aim is to explain the outcomes of
   regionalisms since 1990. The article analyses three important elements
   of regionalist mobilisation - the use of historiography, regional
   economic specificities and intergroup relations. Particular
   constellations of self-determination claims based on plurinational and
   multinational principles in the cases of Istria and Vojvodina
   respectively are the key theoretical contribution of the article. The
   article also finds that the lack of success of Dalmatian regionalism is
   largely due to the inability of regionalist parties to address multiple
   cleavages on the territory of Dalmatia.},

Abstract = {The legislative history of the sport have put us clear its
   manifestations and its importance in contemporary society in both
   educational system and in maintenance of health, as well as an
   ingredient of quality of life and citizen participation that leads to
   build a culture of peace. The methodology employed was a bibliographic
   review of sources and court decisions examining the liability of the
   Public Administration. In the Spanish State the Administration is
   responsible for all damage caused by normal or abnormal functioning of
   public services.
   The research concludes that the objective character of the system of
   liability of Public Administration entails that not required for
   appropriate compensation to the victim to prove fault, negligence or
   willful misconduct of the agent causing the damage, enough to prove the
   existence of a causal link between injury and normal or abnormal
   functioning of public services, with the exception of overwhelming
   force.},

Title = {Owning the issues of crime and immigration: The relation between

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {38},
Pages = {59-69},

Abstract = {It is still not well understood how the media affect anti-immigrant
   party voting. In this paper, we argue and demonstrate empirically that
   mere exposure to immigration- and crime-related news is positively
   related to the likelihood that a voter casts a vote for an
   anti-immigrant party. On the basis of a media content analysis (N =
   20,084 news items) in combination with a voter panel survey (N = 17,014
   respondents) conducted in 11 European countries we find for several
   anti-immigrant parties that - ceteris paribus - exposure to news about
   immigration or crime increases voters' probabilities to vote for these
   parties. We discuss our findings in light of prior research on issue
   ownership, and their implications for the role of the mass media in
   established democracies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {China and the Fifth Estate: Net Delusion or Democratic Potential?},
Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Number = {20},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Arguably, liberal democratic societies are seeing the emergence of a
   `Fifth Estate' that is being enabled by the Internet. This new
   organizational form is comparable to, but potentially more powerful
   than, the Fourth Estate, which developed as a significant force in an
   earlier period with an independent press and other mass media. While the
   significance of the press and the Internet to democratic governance is
   questioned in all societies, there is particular skepticism of their
   relevance outside the most liberal democratic regimes, which have a
   relatively free press and more pluralistic political systems, such as in
   North America and West Europe. Nevertheless, there have been vivid
   examples of where networked individuals have appeared to assert greater
   communicative power in the politics of governance, the media and
   everyday life, even in non-liberal democratic regimes, such as Hong
   Kong, and in some cases, China. This potential points to the need for
   more systematic empirical research in a wider variety of economic and
   political settings worldwide, particularly in states in which the
   Internet might offer a potential for more democratic governance and
   greater accountability of government controlled media. This paper
   examines cases in which networked individuals in China used the Internet
   to hold governmental and press institutions more accountable. The cases
   provide support for the relevance of the Fifth Estate concept in China,
   and also illuminates the process - showing how the Internet can be used
   to empower networked individuals in more autocratic regimes.},

Abstract = {The upheavals of 2011 have catapulted the Arab World-once thought to be
   exceptionally stable-back onto the agenda of regime studies.
   Democratization quickly moved to become the dominant paradigm for
   comparative research on the transformation processes that followed the
   popular uprisings in many countries of the region. The insights
   generated by such a perspective are however limited. Region experts
   emphasize that the Arab transformations have unfolded in a very
   multidirectional and multidimensional way. In fact, trajectories of
   change differ significantly over the region. This diversity cannot be
   attributed solely to the divergent structural dispositions of the
   countries in question, such as varying regime types or different ways of
   organizing access to power. Instead, recent publications stress that the
   high variance in the preliminary outcomes of the Arab transitions is
   primarily a result of the contingent power struggles between protest
   actors, regime elites and security forces that have played out
   differently from country to country. During the past 4 years, apart from
   the revolutionary activists, especially the national Arab armies and
   Islamist groups have crystallized as key actors in the transition
   dynamics. This article provides an overview of the relevant scholarly
   literature that offers innovative perspectives and contributes to a
   better understanding of the Arab Spring.},

Abstract = {In a seminal work, E.E. Schattschneider identified three functions that
   political parties can (and sometimes do) perform in representative
   democracies. His list included simplifying the alternatives, educating
   the public, and promoting accountable governance. This paper proceeds
   from the premise that disquiet about direct democracy is, in part,
   because it may interfere with parties performing these functions that
   contribute to democracy's success. Drawing from the contributions to
   this Special Issue, this paper considers how well these functions are
   performed in direct elections that are often not organized by parties
   and the challenges that ballot initiatives and referendums otherwise
   pose to party government. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Four years after its formal establishment, the European External Action
   Service (EEAS) remains in a state of complex and overlapping areas of
   competence. There are interlocking layers of political and
   administrative governance, where the service has to interact with, and
   answer to, different national and intergovernmental political masters as
   well as supranational actors, notably the European Commission and the
   European Parliament. The formal political decision-making power with
   regard to the EU's common foreign and security policy lies with the
   Council, whilst substantial competences, notably in the field of the
   European Neighbourhood (ENP) and trade policies, as well as development
   and cooperation, remain under the control of the European Commission.
   The EEAS's autonomy and institutional orientation are both much debated
   and empirically unexplored. Based on quantitative and qualitative data,
   this article undertakes a behavioural analysis of EEAS decision-making.
   Empirical findings suggest that there are competing institutional logics
   at work among different groups of staff which affect their respective
   administrative decisional behaviour. Supranational recruits tend to be
   more community-minded, whereas officials with an intergovernmental
   background have a propensity to be more member state oriented.},

   Evidence from a Stochastic Decomposition of Executive Budget Proposals},
Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},

Abstract = {Can American presidents use their budget proposal authority to achieve
   their own partisan policy priorities? This is an important, yet
   challenging, question to answer since formal executive authority is
   ambiguous, and budgetary powers are shared in the US separation of
   powers system. Indeed, the question remains open since prior empirical
   designs conflate external constraints (arising from political and policy
   conditions) with those that reflect executive partisan policy
   priorities. This study advances a novel stochastic decomposition of
   executive budget proposals in order to analyze the extent to which
   presidents can shape the legislative funding of US federal agencies
   consistent with their own partisan policy priorities. Statistical
   evidence reveals that presidents exert partisan-based budgetary
   influence over appropriations that cannot be ascertained from previous
   empirical studies that rely on either the observed gap between
   presidential requests and congressional appropriations or standard
   instrumental variable estimation methods. The statistical evidence also
   indicates that presidents are marginally more effective at converting
   their partisan policy priorities into budgetary outcomes under divided
   party government. Contrary to theoretical predictions generated from
   bilateral veto bargaining models, presidents are also shown to exert
   effective partisan budgetary influence even when their budget requests
   exceed congressional appropriations.},

Abstract = {Deep changes regard the political careers of democratic leaders. Until
   recently, becoming president or prime minister was the last step before
   retirement or withdrawal to an undemanding seat on the back benches. On
   the contrary recent heads of government are enthusiastically seeking
   alternative ways to capitalize on their prestige and contacts portfolio,
   often ending up in the world of business or international finance. There
   are many examples of such a trend, from Blair to Mulroney, from Schroder
   to Barak. This article provides an empirical analysis of the phenomenon,
   by examining a dataset of 441 leaders in 78 different democratic
   countries over a period dating from 1989 to 2012. Attention will be
   focused on the political background of the prime ministers and
   presidents, how long they stay in power, the average age of heads of
   government, what professional pursuits they are involved in after their
   term in office and what career model they follow. The article concludes
   by proposing a post-presidential model which indicates some of the
   current trends and illustrates how former leaders are gaining
   decision-making power and visibility.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on contemporary challenges to the human security
   framework through an examination of asymmetrical conflict generated by
   extremist insurgents, specifically Al Shabaab in Kenya. The political
   and security dynamics generated by extremist groups often find
   reinforcement in local contestations over power and territory, resulting
   in an interaction between local and `external'. It is the product of
   these interactions in the form of opportunities, resultant discourses,
   responses and what they offer to an expansion of normative ideas about
   human security and conflict that this paper focuses on. Using Kenya as a
   case study, this paper explores the interface between the growth of Al
   Shabaab, securitisation of governance and political elite consensus on
   the policy relationship between human security versus a state security
   model. This paper pursues the argument that the rise in the intensity
   and nature of Al Shabaab attacks in Kenya has influenced the
   interpretation of the country's security threats and the application of
   strategies. Rather than aiding the application of human security as
   central to national security, it has rolled back previous gains.},

Abstract = {Russia's recent actions in its neighbourhood have not only upset Western
   policies but have also reinvigorated arguments that Russia may be
   promoting autocracy to counteract democracy promotion by the European
   Union and the United States. They have also underlined a broader
   problem: that of how illiberal powers may react to democracy promotion,
   especially when their strategic interests are at stake. This article
   investigates these issues by studying Russia's interactions with the
   countries in its neighbourhood and democracy promoters. First, the
   article argues that even if Russia has contributed to the stagnation of
   democratization and ineffectiveness of democracy promotion in its
   neighbourhood, its actions do not constitute autocracy promotion and
   largely lack ideological underpinnings. Second, Russia's counteraction
   to democracy promotion stems from its ambitions of restoring its great
   power status, maintaining its regional influence, and perceiving Western
   policies as a threat to its interests. Third, when it considers its
   strategic interests undermined, Russia employs economic and military
   threats (sometimes incentives) against its neighbourhood countries to
   make the compliance with Western policies less preferable.},

Abstract = {While party unity in legislative voting is generally high in
   parliamentary democracies, debates provide MPs with the opportunity to
   express political views even if they deviate from the party line. Using
   the extensive parliamentary debates on the reform of the Irish abortion
   legislation in 2001 and 2013, we assess whether Teachtai Dala (TD) send
   signals to their constituents. In doing so, we take into account
   literature on the individual preference formation of political actors as
   well as institutional accounts that stress vote-seeking resulting from
   the electoral system. We also argue that personal characteristics like
   gender and family status should affect the positions of TDs on the
   abortion issue. In addition, we argue that the preferences of the
   constituents should particularly be taken into account by those TDs who
   only narrowly won a seat in the Dail. Our analysis, which is based on a
   content analysis of all speeches held during the abortion reform debates
   in the Dail in 2001 and 2013, provides support for our expectations.},

Journal = {POLITICAL QUARTERLY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {86},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {The failure of the Coalition government's attempt to reform the House of
   Lords has by no means taken further reform off the political agenda. The
   commitment to installing an elected upper chamber is still widely shared
   across the political spectrum, on the basis of perceptions that the
   House of Lords lacks democratic legitimacy. Against this view, this
   article considers recent literature upon non-electoral representation,
   deliberative democracy and bicameralism, which together highlight the
   possibility of an unelected second chamber playing a legitimate role
   within a wider (democratic) system of government. The article then
   considers the House of Lords from this perspective, reflecting on
   changes in the upper chamber since the 1999 reforms and evaluating its
   role within the wider political system. The paper concludes by
   suggesting that political debate should focus upon small-scale reforms
   to ensure that the Lords becomes more effective, representative and
   legitimate, within the constraints of its present role.},

Title = {Majoritarian democracy undermines truth-finding in deliberative
   committees},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {The aggregated judgments of many usually outperform individual estimates
   of vaguely known facts. Communication among individuals may, however,
   undermine this wisdom-of-crowd effect because it makes judgments
   mutually dependent. Deliberative democratic theory, on the other hand,
   suggests that communication promotes correct decisions. We investigate
   this puzzle about the positive and negative consequences of consensus
   formation on the wisdom of crowds using experimental methods. Subjects
   in small deliberative committees had to communicate and thereafter judge
   vaguely known facts. We varied the agreement rules in groups and
   compared the groups' change of performance from initial to final
   estimates. Interestingly, groups' performance worsened on average when
   they had to reach a majority decision. Groups came on average closer to
   the truth if they had to decide unanimously or if they did not have any
   restrictions to reach agreement. The low performance under majority rule
   is robust against different knowledge questions, group sizes and
   communication types. The majority rule may be worst because it makes
   people too focused to reach a majority so that valuable minority
   opinions are disregarded or not even voiced. This implies that
   majoritarian democracy may be less suitable for truth-finding than less
   or more restrictive quorum rules.},

Abstract = {The Thatcher reforms brought inflation under control and raised growth
   and living standards, by injecting competition into most areas of the
   economy. The recent banking crisis is not attributable to Big Bang but
   rather to the 1997 Labour government's removal of supervisory powers
   from the Bank of England. The fact that most large continental economies
   have failed to achieve supply-side reform puts the Thatcher achievement
   in stark perspective},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Existing research analyzes the effects of cross-national and temporal
   variation in income inequality on public opinion; however, research has
   failed to explore the impact of variation in inequality across citizens'
   local residential context. This article analyzes the impact of local
   inequality on citizens' belief in a core facet of the American
   ethosmeritocracy. We advance conditional effects hypotheses that
   collectively argue that the effect of residing in a high-inequality
   context will be moderated by individual income. Utilizing national
   survey data, we demonstrate that residing in more unequal counties
   heightens rejection of meritocracy among low-income residents and
   bolsters adherence among high-income residents. In relatively equal
   counties, we find no significant differences between high- and
   low-income citizens. We conclude by discussing the implications of
   class-based polarization found in response to local inequality with
   respect to current debates over the consequences of income inequality
   for American democracy.},

Abstract = {The Treaty of Utrecht of 13 Juny 1713 (Article X), in force today,
   transfered the Rock of Gibraltar to the United Kingdom. The territory
   ceded by under Treaty is exposed in an extremely clear manner in the
   text of the Treaty. However, the fact is that a simple glance of the
   political and geographical map of this area shows how the territory
   occupied by United Kingdom is not correlated with the area of the Treaty
   in 1713. This report concerns about the causes that have led to this
   incoherence between the area expressly ceded by the Treaty and the
   reality, and the negative impact that this situation has had for Spain.},

Abstract = {As the list of Republican-led states participating in the Medicaid
   expansion grows, it is becoming increasingly clear that partisanship and
   ideology alone cannot fully explain states' choices. This paper examines
   the political and practical dynamics influencing state Medicaid
   expansion decisions. Whereas resources and history have served to
   reinforce the effects of partisanship and ideology, several
   countervailing forces - including public opinion, interest group
   pressure, budgetary considerations, and need - are pushing even the
   reddest states toward expansion. The relative force of these competing
   pressures within a state can help explain not only whether or not the
   state expands Medicaid, but also the manner in which it does so, such as
   through a waiver or executive action. I present five case studies -
   Nevada, Arizona, Ohio, Arkansas, and Tennessee - to illustrate how these

Abstract = {Numerous scholars have concluded that there is a correlation between use
   of social network sites (SNS), particularly for news and information
   acquisition or community building, and the likelihood for
   e-Participation. This paper examines how the use of Facebook affects the
   participative behaviours of individuals active in political and interest
   organizations and those not active in organized politics. Through focus
   group discussions involving 56 Ugandans, we conclude that in low
   internet use, authoritarian contexts, the Civic Voluntarism Model and
   the benefits Facebook brings to participation in Western democracies are
   turned on their head. Besides overwhelming detachment from politics,
   even for politically-inclined citizens, low belief in citizens' online
   actions influencing change and fear of reprisals for criticizing an
   authoritarian president in power for 29 years, severely dulled the
   appetite for e-Participation. This high cost of participation means
   Facebook is growing citizens `civic skills but it is hardly increasing
   online participation even for politically interested citizens.},

Abstract = {Despite the importance of regional democracy, comparative analyses of
   voter participation in regional elections are rare. We examine
   individual participation in regional elections in Canada, Spain, and the
   United Kingdom and make three arguments: (i) standard models of turnout
   devised for national contests only partly explain regional turnout, with
   the personal characteristics of voters more important than contextual
   variables; (ii) territorial identity and the level of jurisdictional
   authority wielded by the regional legislature are important determinants
   of electors' willingness to participate in regional elections; (iii)
   when we contrast subjective perception and objective/aggregate findings
   we see that regional legislative authority matters more than perceived
   salience, and individual regional identity matters more than the views
   of fellow citizens, but that these effects are largely conditional on
   age.},

   his time as Minister of Tourism. The story of the conviction of the
   eighth Israeli president of sex offences turned into a high-priority
   media story, which stayed at the top of the Israeli media agenda for a
   relatively long period.
   This qualitative paper, is aiming to identify and analyze the various
   rhetorical techniques utilized by Katsav, to replace the new criminal
   identity attributed to him with a victimized self-identity. The
   victimized rhetoric which is based on justifications and accounts such
   as: ``Reverse character assassination{''}, ``Attack the attackers{''} or
   ``Contradiction technique{''}, had served the former president as a
   means to reduce his responsibility, to deny it and to build an
   alternative narrative that presents the alleged perpetrator as a
   persecuted victim. Never the less, the conviction and jailing of a
   president for sex crimes has greatly increased the awareness of sex
   offences in the workplace committed by people of power and authority.},

Abstract = {As a contribution to the study of empire and imperial ambition, the
   present study considers the greatest analysis-Xenophon's The Education
   of Cyrus-of one of the greatest empires of antiquity-the Persian.
   Xenophon's lively and engaging account permits us to watch Cyrus as he
   builds a transnational empire, at once vast and stable. Yet Xenophon is
   ultimately highly critical of Cyrus, because he lacks the self-knowledge
   requisite to happiness, and of the empire, whose stability is purchased
   at the price of freedom. Cyrus finally appears as a kind of divinity who
   strives to supply the reward for moral excellence that the gods
   evidently do not. Xenophon implies that any truly global empire would
   have to present itself as a universal providential power capable of
   bestowing on human beings a blessed happiness that as such transcends
   our very mortality.},

Abstract = {The decisive No vote in the Scottish independence referendum on 18
   September 2014 was not a vote for the constitutional status quo,
   although it confirmed that Scotland would remain part of the United
   Kingdom. The referendum outcome is likely to have far-reaching
   consequences for the power relations between London and Edinburgh and,
   perhaps more than expected, for the constitutional future of the entire
   UK. A tight timetable for the delivery of extra powers for the Scottish
   Parliament is in place, and the `elephant in the room', the
   constitutional status and governance of England, is now firmly on the
   agenda. There is also pressure for decentralisation in Scotland itself.
   And the huge `democratic awakening' which characterised this `national
   conversation' about Scotland's future, with massive democratic
   participation and a record turnout, demands that these changes will have
   to be brought about in a participative way - and not `top-down', as a
   Westminster or Holyrood `stitch-up'.},

Abstract = {Marx's method of critique via several philosophy of science categories
   reveals logical problems, as well as political biases, within different
   competing approaches of his period. Some principles subject to Marx's
   criticism include: metaphysics, ahistoricism, false universalisation,
   inversion, reductionism, idealism, obscurantism, incommensurability, and
   tautology. This paper examines these categories and their logical bases,
   the competing approaches Marx targets as politically biased because of
   their failure to either respect such principles or their violation of
   them, and the way in which, by extension, several traditions in modern
   social discourse reveal parallel political biases because of similar
   logical failures.},

Abstract = {On 15 November 2012, at the plenary session of the Central Committee of
   the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping was elected the Party's general
   secretary, whereas he also became the chairman of the influential
   Central Military Commission. Too eager to wait to be inaugurated as
   President of the People's Republic of China in March 2013, the new
   national leader announced that in the following decade he is guided by
   the main objective of his predecessor Hu Jintao to double the prosperity
   of the people by the year 2020 and to keep the country's economy stable
   and growing fast. Unfortunately, it will be difficult for the new leader
   of China to implement his intentions, since, presumably, the country's
   new leadership will be from the older generation, hardliners, and, most
   importantly, politically conservative. But the difficulties lie in
   carrying out economic reforms because of rampant corruption and shadow
   banking in the central apparatus and in regions.
   According to the World Bank's analysis, China has become the world's
   largest economy. But the large expenditures to military reform and
   environmental protection are not sufficient for Xi Jinping to accomplish
   the goal to raise significantly the poor living standards of Chinese
   people. China has also faced difficulties in complying with the basic
   principles of its foreign policy, especially after the annexation of
   Crimea and its incorporation into the Russian Federation by China's
   strategic partner, Russia. In the past, China has carried out campaigns
   against ``Americanization{''}, although with no tangible results. Thus,
   the leaders of today's China are faced with a number of dilemmas.},

Title = {Quotas and qualifications: the impact of gender quota laws on the

Abstract = {This article addresses concerns that candidates nominated because of
   gender quota laws will be less qualified for office. While questions of
   candidate quality have long been relevant to legislative behavior, quota
   laws requiring a certain percentage of candidates for national office to
   be women have generated renewed interest. Gender quotas are often
   perceived to reduce the scope of political competition. By putting
   gender identity center stage, they preclude the possibility that
   elections will be based on ideas' or merit' alone. Other electoral rules
   that restrict candidate selection, such as the centralization of
   candidate selection common in closed list PR systems, have been found to
   reduce the quality of candidates. Rules that open selection, such as
   primaries, result in higher quality candidates. We exploit the
   institutional design of Italy's mixed electoral system in 1994, where
   quotas were applied only to the PR portion of the list, to compare the
   qualifications of men, women, and quota women'. We estimate regressions
   on several measures of deputies' qualifications for office and
   performance in office. We find that unlike other rules limiting
   candidate selection, quotas are not associated with lower quality on
   most measures of qualifications. In fact, quota women have more local
   government experience than other legislators and lower rates of
   absenteeism than their male counterparts. Contrary to critics, quota
   laws may have a positive impact on legislator quality. Once the quota
   law was rescinded, quota women were less likely to be re-elected than
   non-quota women or men, which suggests that discrimination - not
   qualification - limits women's status as candidates.},

Abstract = {In this article, I analyse the gendered and ethnicized nature of denial
   writing by women writers during the decade of terror (1975-85). The
   1970s and 1980s can be characterized by two coup detats (1971 and 1980)
   and a series of assassinations of Turkish diplomats by the Armenian
   Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) and the Justice
   Commandos of the Armenian Genocide (JCOAG), which resulted in the
   proliferation of denialist narratives on the Armenian Genocide. I
   explore the prominent Sufi woman mystic Samiha Ayverdi's Turkiye'nin
   Ermeni meselesi (1976) and its translation into English, The Armenian
   question in Turkey (1980), in the way the texts draw their Turkish and
   international readers into reifying racist and essentialist assumptions
   about Turkish victimhood and Armenian culpability. I will analyse the
   second work, Sabiha Gokcen's Ataturk'un izinde bir omur boyle gecti {[}A
   life passed in the path of Ataturk], published in 1982, through the
   gendered and ethnicized silences in the narrative performance of the
   eternally grateful and selfabnegating daughterhood of Sabiha Gokcen to
   Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Sabiha Gokcen is renowned as the first female
   combat pilot in Turkey and in the world, and as one of the adopted
   daughters of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. The myths of nationalism and
   militarism propagated in her autobiography become further nuanced as we
   explore the text, taking into account her recently revealed identity as
   an Armenian, with the name of Hatun Sebilciyan, announced by the
   journalist Hrant Dink (1954-2007) shortly prior to his assassination in
   2007. In the conclusion, I analyse the persistence of myths of
   nationalism and militarism that reinforce the contemporary culture of
   denial in Turkey.},

   the ``Guerra of the Water{''}, which irradiated in the new insurrections

Abstract = {This article is a brief reflection after the Rethinking Marxism
   conference book session on Class Struggle on the Home Front: Work,
   Conflict and Exploitation in the Household, edited by Graham Cassano
   (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009). Domestic labor has long been a major concern
   for feminist scholars seeking to understand both the causes of women's
   subordination and the collective well-being of industrialized societies.
   The importance of this essay collection lies in its use of New Marxian
   Class Analysis to consider persistent themes in feminist theory: the
   valorization of women's household labor, migration and labor market
   hierarchies, and the role of women's participation in the paid labor
   force.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to ongoing debates on how bottom-up social
   cooperation can halt and reverse processes of environmental and human
   degradation, dispossession and impoverishment, by proposing a
   synchronization of resistance and of commoning practices. The article
   moves from the empirical case of social and ecological conflicts
   currently unfolding in the so-called Land of Fires, an area in Southern
   Italy infamous for the socio-environmental impacts of two decades of
   waste disposal, mismanagement and contamination. Within this context, a
   coalition of grassroots movements is struggling to resist livelihoods
   degradation through an alliance with anti-Mafia social cooperatives. We
   provide an in-depth analysis of emerging social and economic networks
   that connect the strategies of grassroots movements for environmental
   justice with the work of social cooperatives that reclaim lands and
   assets confiscated to Mafia. The interests of environmental activists
   meet the interests of social cooperatives at the crossroad of territory
   reclamation with the spheres of social and economic production and
   reproduction. Framing the case as a cultural and physical
   re-appropriation of territory, we provide an analysis of strategies and
   limits for a symbolic and practical project of social re-appropriation
   of the commons (De Angelis 2012).},

Abstract = {In the last 20 years an increasing number of scholars have centred their
   attention on the relationships between party national structures and
   party sub-national branches. A relevant part of the specialized
   literature has interpreted party change as the by-product of the
   denationalization of party politics. The aim of this contribution is to
   investigate to what extent eight relevant Italian parties have followed
   patterns of organizational change, after the reforms of the municipal,
   provincial and regional election systems; and the process of devolution
   of administrative powers begun during the Nineties. By focusing on two
   analytical dimensions (the level of involvement and the level of
   autonomy of party regional units), we analyse diachronically continuity
   and change in party formal organization, through an in-depth analysis of
   the statutes adopted from 1992 to 2012.},

Title = {The ``Mill Worker's Son{''} Heuristic: How Voters Perceive Politicians

Abstract = {Politicians often highlight how hard their families had it when they
   were growing up, presumably in the hopes that voters will see them as
   more supportive of policies that benefit middle-and working-class
   Americans. What do voters actually infer from how candidates were
   raised? And what should they infer? We use a set of candidate evaluation
   experiments (and an external validity test drawing on actual
   congressional election returns) to study how Americans perceive
   politicians raised in more and less affluent families. We then compare
   these perceptions to data on how lawmakers brought up in different
   classes actually behave in office. Although voters often infer that
   politicians from less privileged families are more economically
   progressive, these lawmakers don't actually stand out on standard
   measures of legislative voting. The ``mill worker's son{''} heuristic
   appears to be a misleading shortcut, a cue that leads voters to make
   faulty inferences about candidates' political priorities.},

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Why are large population movements conflict-prone in some regions while
   they remain peacefully integrated elsewhere? I argue that clashes
   between ethnically distinct indigenous populations and migrants - i.e.
   `Sons of the Soil (SoS) conflict' - erupt when there are large
   socio-economic and political horizontal inequalities between `dominant
   migrants' and locals. A comparative case study of two Chinese minority
   regions based on ethnographic fieldwork and population data provides a
   vivid illustration of the mechanisms linking migration to SoS conflict.
   With fewer HIs between migrants and locals, Inner Mongolia avoided many
   of the violent clashes that were commonplace in Qinghai, a province
   fraught with disparities.},

Abstract = {The article specifies new factors that define capabilities and potential
   of Russian regions' development. Alteration of the state foreign policy,
   related to the turn to the East, may involve a high demand on natural
   resources and some technology innovations on the part of the Far East
   and the Baikal region. In this case sociocultural and political factors,
   as well as image components of the region that need to be improved, may
   become important factors. As a result, an identification matrix is being
   formed, compliance with which may turn the region into a self-sufficient
   economic entity. The author analyzes the potential and capabilities of
   the Republic of Buryatia which has all the chances for the economy
   growth and implementation of its competitive advantages. An
   authoritarian model of a political regime in the current situation is
   not an obstacle for a foreign-economic activity, as it lets minimize
   political conflicts; and a sociocultural identity and work on the
   regional image have good prospects. In general, the author justifies an
   actual task in the regional development of Russia - necessity of an
   accelerated development of the state's eastern regions.},

Volume = {14},

Pages = {179-191},
Abstract = {The processes of secularization experienced by post-industrial societies
   have led to the transformation of public policy aimed at regulating the
   issue of religion. In particular, the transformation of religious policy
   has become necessary in those states where three situations converge:
   societies whose religious affiliation has traditionally been
   homogeneous, with low levels of secularization mainly due to government
   action, which have experienced massive diversification of religious
   affiliation amongst the population due to various migratory streams.
   These pages examine the role of the Observatorio del Pluralismo
   Religioso en Espana (the Observatory of Religious Pluralism in Spain) in
   the management of religious diversity, in keeping with the models of
   cultural pluralism: multiculturalism and interculturalism. The main
   conclusions are based on the evolution that has occurred in the
   management of religious pluralism from a multiculturalist perspective,
   primarily aimed at complying with the constitutional principles and
   regulatory framework governing practice of the Right to Religious
   Freedom. Evidence is also provided of intercultural management
   positions, highlighting actions aimed at positive interaction between
   members of different religious communities, and helping - through
   guidance to institutions (local authorities, educational institutions,
   health organizations, etc.) mutual - to manage potential conflicts from
   the perspective of the opportunity for re-understanding and respect.},

Abstract = {Extended party network (EPN) theory characterizes political parties in
   the United States as dynamic networks of interest groups that
   collaboratively support favored candidates for office. Electoral
   predictions derived from EPN theory have yet to be tested on a large
   sample of races. We operationalize EPNs in the context of organized
   interest contributions to U.S. House campaigns. We deduce that support
   by a partisan community of interests signals the ideological credibility
   and appeal of a candidate. EPN integration overcomes voter ambiguity
   surrounding challengers' ideological preferences, and resources provided
   by these coordinating interest groups promote a consistent message about
   the candidate. Using data from the 1994-2010 cycles, we apply network
   analysis to detect EPN support of challengers and find that EPN
   integration substantially improves the electoral prospects of
   challengers. The effect of EPN integration is distinct from that of
   campaign resources. The findings provide support for EPN theory, as
   applied to congressional elections.},

Abstract = {Unelected officials with coercive powers (e.g., police, prosecutors,
   bureaucrats) vary markedly in the extent to which citizens view their
   actions as legitimate. We explore the institutional determinants of
   legitimate authority in the context of a public goods laboratory
   experiment. In the experiment, an authority can target one citizen for
   punishment following citizen contribution choices. Untargeted citizens
   can then choose to help or hinder the authority. This latter choice may
   be interpreted as a behavioral measure of the authority's legitimacy. We
   find that legitimacy is affected by how authorities are compensated, the
   transparency with which their decisions are observed, and an interaction
   between these. When transparency is high, citizens are more willing to
   assist authorities who receive fixed salaries than those who personally
   benefit from collected penalties, even when citizens' material
   incentives are controlled for. Lower transparency reduces support, but
   only for salaried enforcers.},

   contribution and legacy, the second part of the article discusses the

   Anonymous Incorporation},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {59},
Number = {1},
Pages = {146-161},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Using two field experiments, we probe the efficacy of international
   rules mandating that incorporation services establish their customers'
   true identities. The standards were designed to prevent anonymous shell
   corporations central to money laundering, corruption, and other crimes.
   Posing as consultants seeking confidential incorporation, we randomly
   assigned six experimental conditions in emails varying information about
   monetary reward, international and domestic law, and customer risk to
   1,793 incorporation services in 177 countries and 1,722 U.S. firms.
   Firms in tax havens obey the rules significantly more often than in OECD
   countries, whereas services in poor nations sometimes prove more
   compliant than those in rich countries. Only the risk of terrorism and
   specter of the Internal Revenue Service decrease offers for anonymous
   incorporation, but they also lower compliance. Offers to pay a premium
   reduce compliance. The risk of corruption decreases response rates but,
   alarmingly, also decreases compliance rates. Raising international law
   has no significant effect.},

Abstract = {This dialogue seeks to confront and intertwine the conceptual logics of
   Hannah Arendt and Jacques Ranciere in order to renew the notions of
   political subjectivation and disidentification in the context of
   political struggles. The two voices agree to discuss converging and
   diverging conceptual lines but defend positions that are sometimes
   irreducible, which makes it evident how the conceptualization of
   political experimentations is only possible to the test of plurality and
   contradiction. The dialogue discusses the notions of subjectivation and
   the political subject, disidentification and identity, singularity and
   collectivity, the State and domination, emancipation and plurality.},

   of the situation that has pointed to the incorrectness of the general

Title = {South Sudan's December 2013 conflict: Bolting state-building fault lines
   with social capital},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {85-109},
Abstract = {The December 2013 violent conflict in South Sudan, the world's newest
   and most fragile state, has shown that a state-building trajectory that
   only emphasises formal institutional development is not viable. Like any
   state at its formative stage, formal institutions in South Sudan have
   demonstrated limited capacity to meet the high demands by citizens for
   `peace or postsecession'dividends. The state's limited capacity has
   further been eroded by political constructs claiming ethnic supremacy by
   both the Dinka and Nuer, the main parties to the December 2013 conflict.
   This article argues that the entitlement tied to post-secession
   dividends claims by the Dinka and Nuer has (re) produced a generally
   volatile social space for South Sudan by defining the mode of political
   settlement of the state, and undermining the generation of social
   capital for conflict management in the society. By constructing a nexus
   between state-building and social capital, this article shows that the
   state-building process in South Sudan requires the hybridity of formal
   and informal institutions. This helps in transforming the volatile
   social space created through the supremacy constructs of the Dinka and
   Nuer and high citizen demands placed on the fragile state.},

   about the Japanese who lived in Russia at the turn of the 19th-20th
   century Ya. Guzei shows how, as the dispute with Japan escalated into
   the armed conflict, ethnicity turned into the distinguishing feature of
   the Japanese in the symbolic field of the Russian Empire, transforming
   the previously unnoticed migrants into the nation hostile towards the

   to clear up a point of confusion in Dean's reading of postcapitalist
   politics and the work of the Community Economies Collective (of which I
   am a member) in order to arrive at a point we share in common: the
   immanent relevance of communism to contemporary politics, as evidenced
   by Occupy and other events. While Dean reads the Occupy experience as a
   demonstration of the need to return to the party as an organizational
   form, I explore the potential of activist research and the solidarity
   economy for demonstrating communism as a practical, sensible reality in
   a growing number of communities. These emergent communisms grow in
   visibility as we develop other ways of representing and valuing communal
   life as we live it.},

Abstract = {This note introduces the United Kingdom's Feminist Judgments Project and
   explains its method of (re) writing imagined legal judgments from a
   feminist perspective. It identifies the ways in which project
   participants put feminist concerns, feminist theory and feminist methods
   into legal practice, and considers the value as well as the limitations
   of this new form of feminist critique and praxis. It concludes by
   outlining some of the wider impacts and implications of the project.},

Abstract = {Combining the insights of several research fields in social sciences,
   this paper advocates a micro-sociological perspective on the
   appropriations of political ideas, taking the case of feminist ideas.
   The notion of appropriation, coined by socio-history of reading, enables
   to consider how political ideas are transformed and reshaped when they
   spread throughout different social spaces. It also allows to pay
   specific attention to the conditions and types of the ordinary reception
   of political ideas as well as to the politicization processes at play.
   In this sense, feminist ideas are a fruitful fieldwork to be
   investigated regarding the multiple forms of dissemination that they
   have taken since the 1970s.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the 2007-08 postelection violence in Kenya arguing
   that there were significant socio-spatial variations to the conflict in
   urban areas that can be better understood through an analysis of
   localised framing processes. It argues that, in some urban
   neighbourhoods, an underlying frame of autochthony is (re) produced
   through lived experience, facilitating the casting of ethnic others as
   either good or bad guests in times of political transition. The flawed
   elections of 2007 justified the violent eviction of `bad' guests in
   these settings. This frame of autochthony, however, is absent in other
   urban neighbourhoods, and so these spaces remained relatively calm for
   the duration of the crisis. The article further argues that the
   flexibility of the good guest/ bad guest frame enabled its
   reconfiguration at the local level, leading to variations in the fault
   lines of conflict across both time and space. It concludes that frame
   analysis can help to elucidate these micro-geographies of conflict.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses two problems: how can we identify a verisimilar
   policy space and how can we detect Nash equilibria in this space for
   parties' policy positions? We argue that the ideological party positions
   that voters perceive are fixed during the time span of one electoral
   campaign and that they constrain the policies parties offer the
   electorate in search of optimal vote shares. We apply the valence model
   developed by Schofield to party competition during the German federal
   election campaign 2009. First three issue scales are combined with a
   left-right scale to form one homogeneous space in which equilibrium
   locations of parties are sought. The results show that local Nash
   equilibria in this combined space depend heavily on the start values and
   are implausible. Fixing the ideological dimension leads to a stable and
   meaningful equilibrium configuration in which large parties move to more
   central positions and smaller parties move to more peripheral positions
   in the policy space.},

Abstract = {The article considers the city as a crucial space to understand and
   interpret the current material and symbolic restructuring of the world.
   In the context of the transformations that are changing its forms, its
   roles, its geographies in the era of globalization, the city is firstly
   framed within the transitions in act that are changing its landscape in
   respect to the modern metropolis. A disordered urban scenario is
   emerging, built up by global flows, rescaling processes, network models,
   neoliberal policies and technological and economical innovations. This
   is the scenario where the contemporary city seems to become matrix and
   crossroad of new political experiences. These are discussed here through
   a two trims framing: the redefinitions and the potentialities of the
   urban citizenship concept; the city as the privileged space for new
   practices of democracy.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},

Abstract = {Alexander Yanov argues in his new book ``Russian idea{''} that Russian
   nationalism is the main and ultimate source of the imperialistic foreign
   policy of modern Russia and its internal dictatorship. He insists that a
   specific mentality of Russian leaders based on the idea of unique
   Russian national identity causes inability of Russia to transform its
   political system along with the European patterns. The article puts
   Yanov's theory of Russian political history under the question. Russian
   nationalism is indeed only one of many different ideological faces of a
   genuine Russian political system. This system is not based on any
   ideological doctrine but is closely related to a standard behavior
   pattern which is typical for the largest part of politically active
   Russians. Modernization of the Russian political system does not imply
   abandoning Russian national identity but rather requires its elites and
   politically active citizens to modify their behavior standard in
   correspondence to the one typical for modern European politicians.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {The paper explores the role of radical right parties in the
   politicization of immigration. In scholarly literature, radical right
   parties are viewed as the owners of the immigration issue and as drivers
   of its politicization. Against this prevalent view, we argue that the
   significance of radical right parties in politicizing immigration is
   overrated: (1) Radical right parties only play a subordinate role in the
   politicization of immigration, whereas the contribution of mainstream
   parties to raising issue salience has been underestimated; (2) the
   politicization of immigration is not related to radical right strength
   in the party system. The findings are based on media data from a
   comparative project on public claims-making on immigration in Western
   European countries (SOM, Support and Opposition to Migration). We
   discuss our findings in comparison to the relevant literature and
   suggest avenues for further research.},

   American Democracies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {3-48},
Abstract = {Why has protest participation seemingly exploded across much of Latin
   America in recent years? How do individual- and country-level
   characteristics interact to explain the rise of contentious politics in
   countries like Argentina, Brazil, and Venezuela? I contend that the
   recent wave of protests in Latin America is the result of trends in
   community engagement and institutional development across the region's
   young democracies. Specifically, I argue that low-quality institutions
   in democratic regimes push an increasingly large number of civically
   active Latin Americans toward more radical modes of political
   participation, as governments' abilities to deliver on citizens'
   expectations fail to match the capacity for mobilization of active
   democrats. Drawing on cross-national surveys of Latin America, I test
   this argument, finding that an interactive relationship between
   community engagement and ineffective political institutions helps
   explain the recent spike in protest activity in certain cases and the
   vast differences in protest participation observed throughout the
   region.},

Year = {2015},

Pages = {130-144},
Abstract = {The article introduces new perspective on political symbolization as a
   state of political reality. Availability of symbolic influence in
   political context implies common knowledge; nevertheless, it does not
   reflect predetermined reaction to following information. Therefore, we
   have to discern between semantics (meaning of the language) and sense of
   the conversations (meaning of the speech itself). The article draws
   substance of political symbolization from the theory of the symbol,
   introduced by German romantics, who highly valued symbols as a matter of
   human aesthetics. Author exposes the contradiction between the use of
   the symbol's ``privileged status{''} in the dimension of aesthetics and
   neglect of its very essence within social sciences. Political
   symbolization is conceptualized in terms of multiplicity of unstated
   meanings in communication within political context. These findings of
   the article have the significant implication: political symbolization is
   a rare and unpredictable phenomenon; it becomes ``visible{''} as if it
   has been happening in the reality, but still in collective perception
   due to dispositions of interpreters political symbolization is presented
   more essential than the viscera of life.},

Pages = {191+},
Abstract = {Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia are expecting a growing demand for
   energy in the next few years. Azerbaijan can take care of itself given
   its own oil and gas reserves. Armenia is dependent on fuel imports from
   Russia and is planning to expand nuclear power. Georgia's energy mix
   varies seasonally due to its large share of hydroelectric power. In
   exchange for the transit of gas and oil, Georgia is remunerated with
   natural gas which it then uses for the production of inexpensive
   electricity. With the exception of hydropower, alternative sources of
   energy play little role in these three countries. There is hardly any
   investment in improving energy efficiency.},

Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {60-82},
Abstract = {The European Union welcomed the demonstrators' demands wholeheartedly
   during the Arab Spring, trying to maximize the assistance that it could
   offer to support genuine democratic transition, at least at a rhetorical
   level. This article reflects on the changes in the neighborhood policy
   by focusing on public perceptions measured in Europe and in countries in
   close proximity to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. European views on
   solidarity are compared to local public opinion on EU involvement in the
   region. Recipient views in Jordan, Egypt, Palestine, and Israel are
   explored by analyzing relevant results of the Arab Barometer and
   Neighborhood Barometer surveys. Findings indicate that the Middle
   Eastern public opinion tends to appreciate the EU's gestures with the
   exception of Egypt, but conditionality is more in line with European
   public opinion.},

Abstract = {Campaigns change how some people vote. How campaigns have this effect is
   less well understood. The prevailing view is that these effects occur by
   changing the content of voters' attitudes such as partisanship or issue
   positions (persuasion) and by changing the weights voters applied to
   these determinants of vote choice (priming). Recent research has
   challenged this view and suggests that the support for these priming and
   persuasion effects is overstated. Unfortunately, no research directly
   specifies and tests the specific psychological mechanism responsible for
   campaign priming. In this article, I draw on the differences in the
   forms of attitude strength and demonstrate that changes in citizens'
   uncertainty are responsible for these effects. The results suggest that
   persuasion and changes in uncertainty (but not ambivalence or
   importance) are responsible for the changes in voters' decisions during
   the campaign. Substantively, the largest effects occur because of
   changes in the uncertainty voters have about the nature of the
   candidates' character traits.},

Abstract = {Security policies are passing through a crucial time in which management
   strategies focused on crime, use of force and increasing clampdown on
   criminal matters, are inefficient in a scenario that promotes a
   normative spectrum linked to Human Rights seeking to insert the security
   as a condition for the construction of universal dignity in what the
   United Nations has called Human Security. This article is inserted in
   the current citizen security policy debates, to evidence how concepts
   such as Civic Culture and Culture of Peace are an inexorable
   prerequisite for the transformation to a Human Security approach, issue
   that goes through the possibility of promoting such change from
   perspectives that understand the conflicts in a broader and
   interdisciplinary manner. In order to this, the policy for security and
   coexistence for football in Colombia will be analyzed so as to have a
   practical and concrete example that will allow to evidence the expressed
   theoretical approaches and also because football has great social
   importance (economic, political and cultural) in Colombia.},

   conservatism is compatible with modernization, N.Rabotyazhev analyzes
   the views of Slavophiles, liberal conservatives of the beginning of the
   20th century and representatives of different currents within the
   post-Soviet conservatism. Having carefully considered modernization
   projects offered by the left and right conservatives as well as Izborsk
   club's theorists, he comes to the conclusion that the Russian
   conservatives are not fundamentally against modernization, but are in
   favor of another modernization that is not identical to Westernization.
   According to the author, although this approach can be justified, it is
   only liberal conservatism that is able to ensure successful
   modernization.},

Abstract = {Historical problems nowadays have become one of the major factors of
   international relations. It is also the case for East Asia. In China,
   there has been an ancient tradition of applying history for the needs of
   modernity, in order to resolve the objectives of domestic and foreign
   policy. The analysis of the PRC's position on historical problems with
   its neighbors demonstrates that the Chinese leadership pragmatically
   uses historical problems in order to achieve China's state interests in

Abstract = {In the framework of the European project Platform of Local Authorities
   and Communicators Engaged in Science (PLACES), we analyse the
   articulations between scientific communication, public perception of
   science, processes of citizen participation and apropiation of space,
   based on a case study of the inhabitants of Teruel city, Autonomous
   Community of Aragon, Spain. On the interrelationships between these
   issues, there are a number of contradictions, such as the difference
   between a high interest for information about science and technology and
   a low level of recognition and interaction with local institutions
   involved in those activities, the complex conceptualization of
   scientific space in relation to the ``public-private{''} pair, or an
   articulation of a claiming civic rethoric and an insufficient
   co-responsibility. We conclude that, in a local context, the dimension
   of territoriality and, in particular, the identification with the town,
   is a central mediation for activating citizen participation as part of
   processes of appropriation of space for setting up cities of scientific
   culture.},

Abstract = {This article serves as an introduction to a special section on the
   question of the legitimacy of non-state armed groups. Starting with a
   short discussion of the literature on armed groups as political actors,
   the authors emphasize the importance of the often-underestimated
   dimension of legitimacy. After having conceptualized legitimacy in more
   detail, the article addresses three key challenges armed groups usually
   face regarding the politics of legitimacy: first, they need to
   legitimize the use of violent means; second, for moral and material
   support, they depend on beliefs of legitimacy; and third, they need to
   simultaneously address various domestic and international audiences.
   Finally, the authors highlight a number of pending questions for further
   research on armed groups.},

Abstract = {Why did pro-welfare Social Democrats and Christian Democrats cease to
   support the welfare state in the 1980s and 1990s, and support measures
   such as tighter welfare programme conditionality rules and lower social
   security benefits instead? Building on the party position change
   literature, I argue and empirically demonstrate that parties with an
   activist-dominated party organization adapt their position to shifts in
   the party voter position. Parties with a leadership-dominated party
   organization adapt their position to shifts in the median voter
   position. Parties in which neither leaders nor activists dictate party
   policy shift in the opposite direction of the previous policy shift if
   they are excluded from office. Using a cross-sectional time-series
   regression analysis of 181 position shifts of European Socialist, Social
   Democratic and Christian Democratic parties in the period 1977-2003, I
   find strong evidence that party organization is a crucial mediating
   variable in explaining when these parties shift to the right or left.
   Demonstrating that differences in party organizations motivate parties
   to respond to different incentives, this study has implications for the
   relationship between party behaviour and welfare state policy-making.},

Abstract = {The republican ideal of freedom as non-domination stresses the
   importance of certain social relationships for a person's freedom,
   showing that freedom is a social-relational state. While the idea of
   non-domination receives a lot of attention in the literature, republican
   theorists say surprisingly little about equality. My aim in this paper
   is therefore to carve out the contours of a republican conception of
   equality. In so doing, I argue that republican accounts of equality
   share a significant normative overlap with the idea of `social
   equality'. However, closer analysis of Philip Pettit's account of
   `expressive egalitarianism' (which he sees as inherently connected to
   non-domination) and recent theories of social equality shows that
   republican non-domination - in contrast to what Pettit seems to claim -
   is not sufficient for securing (republican) social equality. In order to
   secure social equality for all, republicans would have to go beyond the
   ideal of freedom as non-domination.},

Abstract = {Political scientists have studied why so few women run for office in the
   United States, but explanations concerning the challenge of balancing
   work and life have received little empirical support. I present two
   forms of data to show how expectations about work-life balance affect
   the supply of potential women politicians. The common thread in these
   analyses is that time spent traveling to and from work is particularly
   burdensome for those who spend time caring for children. Because women
   do a majority of the child care and housework, commuting is particularly
   burdensome to women. Analyzing a novel data set, I find that women are
   less likely to run for state legislative office in districts further
   from state capitals. I validate these results with an original survey
   experiment run on undergraduates in the midst of choosing their own
   careers. I find that female students weigh proximity to home twice as
   heavily as male students do in a hypothetical decision of whether to run
   for higher office. These results suggest that equal representation of
   women in government would require men and women to share household
   responsibilities more equally.},

Title = {Scientific Evolution and Imperial Formation in Islamic and European
   Political Thought: Ibn Khaldun and Louis Le Roy},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {93-127},
Month = {JAN-APR},
Abstract = {Meditation on the ways in which scientific learning shapes great
   civilizations and empires also has a strong legacy in the medieval
   Islamic world, as seen in works by such luminaries as the
   fourteenth-century Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun. This paper looks at
   early Islamic debates on contributions by diverse nations to the
   evolution of the arts and sciences. Specifically, it reconstructs the
   lineage of Ibn Khaldun's ideas by tracing the trajectories of the motif
   of the seven leading nations of antiquity in the works of al-Masudi,
   al-Tawhidi, al-Biruni, and Said al-Andalusi. I argue that these ideas
   served as a foil to Ibn Khaldun's ideas on imperial formation and
   decline and the spread of Islam. Ibn Khaldun's treatment of the
   relationship between the rise of and fall of civilizations and the
   evolution of science represents one of the first systematic and
   sophisticated approaches to the interplay among science, economy, and
   politics, yet it has received little scholarly attention. At the same
   time, Ibn Khaldun's discussion lends itself to a comparison with the
   ideas of one of the foundational figures in the comparative study of
   civilizations in Europe, the seminal sixteenth-century French classical
   scholar Louis Le Roy. Despite the specific differences between the eras
   in which Ibn Khaldun and Le Roy lived and wrote, both writers portray
   the evolution of scientific knowledge as one of major components of
   empire-building. Likewise, they both provide valuable insights into the
   formation of human society, the history of ancient nations, the
   succession and sequence of empires in the course of human history, as
   well as into the role of language as one of the key parameters of
   imperial expansion.},

Abstract = {The crisis that especially since the 2008 has shown the deep weakness of
   the capitalistic economic model induces to reflect on the role of the
   radical left parties and on their capacity to propose alternative
   policies, interpreting the citizens' demands. Starting from these
   premises this article analyses three parties of the radical left party
   family-United Left, Left Freedom and Ecology and Syriza-that act
   respectively in Spain, Italy and Greece, three of the European
   democracies most affected by the social consequences of the crisis. The
   article proposes a diachronic comparison of the three parties' policy
   proposals, organizational model and strategies in order to explain their
   greater or lesser ability to attract consensus in the last years.},

Abstract = {The crisis started in 2008 has not only affected the economy and the
   social services, but has spread throughout the organizational framework
   designed by the Constitution and, especially, to the political parties,
   on which citizens demand greater democracy. In this sense, the Political
   Parties Act 2002 represents only a minimal improvement over previous
   legislation and a very limited development of the provisions of the
   Constitution. Lacking a more detailed development of central aspects of
   internal democracy as may be the method of election of the executive
   bodies of the party and the electoral candidates. The paper analyzes
   these aspects, collecting the existing case law from the Constitutional
   Court to the Provincial Courts.},

   Democracy in Myanmar},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-18},
Abstract = {This article presents a conceptual model of moral courage based on
   results of an exploratory, qualitative, and cross- cultural study of the
   moral courage of leaders of grass roots organizations working for human
   rights and democracy in Myanmar. Interviews were conducted in Myanmar
   and Thailand with 19 participants who as leaders of primarily small,
   local, and nongovernmental organizations regularly engaged in acts of
   moral courage. Consistent with a definition of moral courage based on a
   review of the literature on moral courage, an analysis of the interview
   data reveals a relationship between moral motivation and the
   demonstration of moral courage that is mediated by political, social,
   and psychological factors, as well as by activist knowledge.
   Demonstrations of moral courage result in both positive and negative
   outcomes for individuals, organizations, and society. Understanding how
   key elements of moral courage might lead to political and social change
   provides leaders of civil society organizations with a map of what is
   needed to stand up to oppression and effect change. By engaging their
   moral principles, commitment, compassion, and sense of urgency while
   recognizing the risks and potential hardships that they face, leaders
   can be empowered to stay the course and contribute to the development of
   civil society within a newly democratic country and a broader global
   context.},

Title = {International democracy promotion as a political ideology: upsurge and
   retreat},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {10-26},
Abstract = {The meta-narrative of `democracy promotion' rose to international
   ascendancy in the 1990s. The fall of the Berlin Wall marked its
   apparently unstoppable advance; the terrorist assaults of 11 September
   2001 its culmination and subsequent retreat. This article interprets the
   post-2001 retreat of democracy promotion as a foreseeable consequence of
   the 1990s overreach. A threefold argument is set out here. First, that
   in its ascendant phase, this meta-narrative displayed core features of a
   `strong' political ideology. Second, while events since 2001 have proved
   it partly wanting, foundational reassessments have been blocked by the
   prevalence of binary analysis, counterposing autocracy and democracy,
   and democracy promotion and prevention. Third, it reviews the merits of
   using tripartite schemas to understand the ` democracy prevention' or
   `antidemocracy promotion' responses elicited by the ideology and
   practice of democracy promotion. It is argued that, however clear in
   theory, binary polarities are never absolute opposites in practice and
   that contemporary `democracy prevention' cannot be seen as a
   straightforward mirror image of 1990s orthodoxy about democracy
   promotion. It concludes that tripartite classifications open the door to
   `second best' predictions and prescriptions. Such an approach permits a
   more pluralist and self-critical take on the prospects for advancing
   political freedom than binary analysis, and thereby repositions the
   debate in a more intellectually defensible manner.},

Abstract = {This paper shows how the rise of the Swiss People's Party (SVP) has
   affected welfare state reforms in Switzerland between the 1990s and the
   2000s. In the 1990s, welfare state reforms drew on ``modernizing{''}
   coalitions between FDP (Liberals), CVP (Christian Democrats) and SP
   (Social Democrats) combining retrenchment and ``recalibration{''}. In
   the 2000s the FDP and CVP increasingly sided with the SVP in right-wing
   coalitions pushing retrenchment alone. The article shows that changes in
   party competition have affected welfare schemes differently, with a
   policy gridlock in pension reforms, where voters of the SVP do not
   follow their elites, but unilateral retrenchment in unemployment
   insurance, where recipients can be portrayed as ``underserving{''}.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {There is a long tradition in comparative research on industrial
   relations of analysis concentrating on differences and similarities
   between countries, that is, focusing on aggregates measured at the
   national level. But what happens if there are no (more) differences in
   industrial relations systems between countries? If there are not
   differences the question arises if comparative research is becoming
   meaningless? Concentrating predominantly on statistical and
   methodological aspects, it is argued in this article that over recent
   decades industrial relations systems have changed in such a way that the
   national level has become less relevant as a unit of analysis. It is
   explained that this development in the nature of the field affects the
   measurement of its indicators which form the backbone of any comparison.
   On the basis of an empirical comparison of key industrial relations
   indicators in the European Union member states, it is concluded that
   comparative research has not reached a dead end, but rather that the
   field might have to reconsider the relevant unit for analysis. It is
   shown that the relevant unit for analysis has shifted increasingly from
   the national towards the sectoral level. One consequence of this shift
   is that from a methodological perspective comparisons between sectors,
   rather than between countries, are nowadays often more informative.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {425-435},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Enns and Koch (hereafter E\&K) use multilevel regression and
   poststratification (MRP) along with survey aggregation to measure state
   policy mood. As E\&K rely on direct information about public opinion, it
   would be preferable to Berry et al.'s widely used indirect measure
   relying on data about the issue positions and vote shares of members of
   Congress, if E\&K's measure were valid. Assessing the validity of E\&K's
   measure takes on special importance because the measure proves to be
   nearly uncorrelated with Berry et al.'s measure, implying that at least
   one is invalid. Because the ``true{''} policy mood of states is unknown,
   it is impossible to definitively assess the validity of E\&K's measure.
   Instead, we raise some concerns about E\&K's measurement methodology and
   present evidence pertaining to the indicator's face validity, convergent
   validity, and construct validity. Our analyses leave us doubtful that
   the E\&K measure is valid because its characterization of state moods
   departs significantly from conventional wisdom and current scholarship.},

Abstract = {Turkey's Kurdish question has witnessed novel developments since the
   commencement of meetings between government officials and the PKK in
   late 2012 designed to settle the long-running conflict. Rapidly changing
   regional patterns of alliances, as well as domestic constraints, have
   led to a gradual internationalization of the process. Although the
   Turkish government firmly rejects the idea of introducing a ``third
   eye{''} to the process, the widening gap between Turkey and its Western
   allies and PKK's increasingly positive publicity and rising reputation
   as a result of its campaign against ISIL challenges the Turkish position
   on this issue.},

Abstract = {Party relationships in the Swiss party system have become substantially
   more antagonistic over the past decades. This article analyzes the
   actors and ideologies that have triggered the emergence of a polarizing
   cultural antagonism, and shows that this conflict is not primarily about
   Switzerland's relationship with Europe. The implications of the
   emergence of the new cultural conflict for democracy are far from clear.
   Using an innovative approach to measure the congruence between voter
   preferences and party positions, I show that the representation of
   citizens' interests along the cultural dimension has improved
   significantly since the 1970s. The concomitant polarization of the
   economic dimension has not altered the quality of representation, on the
   other hand. I conclude by discussing the trade-offs between the
   political articulation of a traditionalist-communitarian conception of
   community that clearly resonates with an important part of the Swiss
   populace, and other components of liberal democracy.},

Abstract = {The definition for ``War on Terror{''} had, since its beginning, targets
   and objectives never seen before. According to President Bush, not only
   the north-American nation has suffered with the terrorists attacks on
   September 11, but freedom itself. As a result, the enemies should not
   only be defeated, yet brought to justice. The ``War on Terror{''} would
   be the efficient answer for these and other challenges. However, there
   are two publics for this matter, both of them with different aspirations
   and kinds of engagement: the north-American citizens and International
   Society. The justification and implementation of the ``War on Terror{''}
   in both domestic and international arena will be interpreted through the
   analysis of four speeches made by President Bush between September 2001
   to September 2002 in order to analyze the process of building a
   north-American strategy for terrorism. We believe that the way
   north-American government assimilated the idea of ``terror{''} to
   terrorist groups and the fight for freedom as a mission of democratic
   governments modified the perception about: the phenomenon of terror ism;
   who practices it; and the type of states that most likely support them.
   As a result, the ``war on terror{''} built a war of values.},

Abstract = {Local newspapers play an important role in the democratic process but
   they are under threat in a rapidly changing media landscape. This study
   examines the locally produced Election 2014 coverage of two different
   newspapers in New Zealand: the Otago Daily Times, a metropolitan daily
   with a strong emphasis on regional coverage; and the provincial daily
   Manawatu Standard. Content analysis shows some similarities between the
   publications (broadly similar story size and authorship patterns) and
   some of the differences (number of stories and amount of coverage)
   accounted for by circulation. However, the two newspapers also enacted
   `localness' in diverse ways. Nearly 80\% of election stories produced by
   Manawatu Standard staff had a city or regional focus, a finding
   consistent with 2011 election data. In contrast, befitting its
   metropolitan status, the overwhelming bulk of Otago Daily Times'
   election coverage was nationally focused, produced by its
   Wellington-based political reporter. However, despite its
   long-established commitment to Otago, more local staff and bigger
   news-hole, it produced considerably fewer election stories with a city
   or regional focus than the Standard. We consider the possible impact of
   other influencers on local election coverage, such as the newsworthiness
   of electorate races and competing regional stories, but conclude that
   despite its purported importance, local political news continues to
   occupy a tenuous position in the modern newsroom.},

Abstract = {The euro area debt crisis has pointed more than ever before to the
   importance of effective reforms and sustainable macroeconomics. Indeed,
   rising doubts that Eurozone countries with low industrial
   competitiveness will be able to repay high international liabilities
   render adjustment a cardinal issue for European cohesion. Evidently, a
   compelling necessity exists for well-designed Economic Adjustment
   Programs (EAPs). This article proposes an ideal EAP type of how to
   perceive the main stages of adjustment within the Eurozone, underlining
   their operational/cognitive links as well as the required catalysts for
   success implementation of adjustment strategy. The proposed holistic
   adjustment framework treats macroeconomic, microeconomic, financial, and
   structural reforms not as isolated issue areas but rather as
   interdependent and mutually vulnerable issue areas. Emphasis is placed
   on domestic political economy considerations and the necessary societal
   reform alliance capable and willing to carry out adjustment.},

Abstract = {In many ways, the 2015 parliamentary elections in Israel followed
   patterns that have been evident ever since the establishment of the
   state. The campaign positions of the parties, the politicians, and the
   voters related predominantly to defense and foreign affairs, and less to
   socio-economic policies. Religion-state issues in general, and the
   relationship between the Jewish majority and the Arab minority in
   particular, were also prominent. All these issues played a role in the
   20th general elections held on 17 March 2015, just as they did in the
   first general elections in 1949. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {For Tocqueville, well balanced souls were as important to freedom as a
   well balanced constitution. Such spiritual checks and balances were
   essential, in his view, for the preservation of political freedom and
   individual human greatness. Religion was the prime source of such
   spiritual checks and balances, offering a parallel source for the checks
   and balances to democracy provided by secular mechanisms such as
   associations and self interest well understood. Tocqueville envisaged
   religion from two different view points, utilitarian and perfectionist.
   From a utilitarian perspective, religion helped to limit democratic
   societies and preserve them from excess. From a perfectionist stand
   point, it encouraged human beings to become great. Not all religions,
   however, were equally capable of performing these functions.},

Abstract = {This article examines how the institutional characteristics of state
   legislatures and governors affect state policy priorities. We argue that
   differences in the nature of their respective constituencies lead
   legislators to press for particularized benefits while governors favor
   collective goods. Empirical analysis of state-level data from 1982
   through 2011 confirms that this is the case. The organizational
   arrangements of the two branches of government have an impact that is
   usually greater than that of state public opinion but generally less
   than that of state interest groups. The results from this analysis are
   important because they show that institutional structure has systematic
   effects that are independent of ideology, partisanship, and the other
   factors that are known to shape state policy making.},

Abstract = {When the U.S. Supreme Court exercises its power of judicial review over
   state laws, its decisions, like the legislation it considers, frequently
   speak to major policy debates. Despite the Court's routine involvement
   with state statutes, theoretical explanations of judicial review
   generally do not distinguish between state laws and federal laws. The
   characteristics of state legislatures lead legislators in different
   states to have distinct perspectives and incentives, and ultimately
   affect the types of laws enacted in different states. We suggest that
   because the level of professionalism of state legislatures affects the
   types of laws pursued by different states, it may also affect the
   likelihood that a state has a law struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   We find support for this expectation. Specifically, legislative
   professionalism is associated with an increased likelihood that a state
   has a law invalidated by the Court. This new evidence indicates that it
   is important to consider the legislative context in which state laws
   originate when examining the Court's review of state laws.},

Abstract = {Satisfaction with the workings of democracy seems to have declined in
   Canada, as it has in other established democracies. Political scandals
   are one frequently invoked explanation for that shift. But there is
   substantial scholarly disagreement about whether political scandals
   undermine democratic satisfaction. This paper uses evidence from a
   conveniently timed round of the CES (Canadian Election Study) from 2004,
   as well as the CES panel from 2004 and 2006, to explore this
   relationship more definitively than is usually possible. The results
   indicate that the scandal eroded satisfaction with the way democracy
   works but did not undermine support for democracy more generally.},

Abstract = {This essay argues that the global trade liberalization, particularly
   since 1995, strengthens some transnational corporations (TNCs) to become
   more powerful. In this sense, some statements argued by state-centric
   realism have to be revised; however, doing that does not mean that
   realism is fully out-of-date. The case studies suggest that mother
   country, such as the U.S., is a critical agent for TNCs to project their
   power and/or to protect their vital interest in the global market. In
   other word, sovereign state, especially the stronger one, is still
   important under some specific conditions. Ironically, most countries in
   the global south are increasingly retreating from the stage of
   international trade while TNCs from the North are detaining many
   efficient means of control over technology, capital and even political
   access.},

Title = {Explaining Attitudes toward Immigration: The Role of Regional Context
   and Individual Predispositions},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {38},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1174-1202},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {Existing research makes competing predictions and yields contradictory
   findings about the relationships between natives' exposure to immigrants
   and their attitudes toward immigration. Engaging this disjuncture, this
   article argues that individual predispositions moderate the impact of
   exposure to immigrants on negative attitudes toward immigrants. Negative
   attitudes toward immigration are more likely among individuals who are
   most sensitive to such threats. Because country-level studies are
   generally unable to appropriately measure the immigration context in
   which individuals form their attitudes, this article uses a newly
   collected dataset on regional immigration patterns in Austria, Germany,
   and Switzerland to test the argument. The data show that increasing and
   visible diversity is associated with negative attitudes toward
   immigrants, but only among natives on the political right. This finding
   improves the understanding of attitudes toward immigrants and
   immigration and has implications for the study of attitudes toward other
   policies and for immigration policy itself.},

Abstract = {In October 2010, the UK's Coalition Government announced a radical
   reduction in the number of public bodies in the UK. This research tests
   the impact of three factors identified in the termination literature as
   affecting agency survival: political turnover, age and agency type. The
   research found that advisory Non-Departmental Public Bodies were five
   times more likely to have been identified for abolition or merger than
   other agency types. The research also found that agency age was a
   factor, but that political turnover was not significant.},

Abstract = {We examine whether repeated scandals within one party generate
   collective sanctions for fellow partisans. Do voters punish a party's
   candidates because of multiple corruption scandals? Our data come from a
   unique survey conducted prior to the 2010 legislative elections in North
   Carolina, a state that had recently seen a number of high-profile
   corruption scandals involving Democrats exclusively. Although
   Republicans campaigned energetically against the party of corruption, we
   find the impact of that campaign was muted. Respondents who accurately
   identified at least one scandal rated the Democratic Party less
   favorably and thought Republicans would do better at responding to
   corruption. Nevertheless, vote choice was unrelated to knowledge of
   corruption scandals, and Republicans did not benefit from any effects on
   voter turnout. Importantly, respondents' partisanship only sometimes
   mediated attitudes and did not affect behavior. We conclude that voters
   might in theory prefer clean parties, but their political actions are
   uninfluenced by that preference, a finding that has unfortunate
   implications for democracy.},

Abstract = {Remittances are a significant source of foreign exchange for developing
   economies. I argue that remittances, due to their compensation and
   insurance functions, will increase the general income level and economic
   security of recipients, thereby reducing their perceived income risk.
   Over time, this will dampen demand from recipients for government
   taxation and social insurance. Therefore, I expect increases in income
   remitted to an economy to result in reduced levels of social welfare
   transfers at the macro-level. This dynamic can help us to understand
   spending patterns in developing democracies, and the absence of demand
   for social security transfers in countries with high levels of
   inequality and economic insecurity. I test this argument with a sample
   of 18 Latin American states, over the period 1990 to 2009, and subject
   the central causal mechanism to a battery of statistical tests. The
   results of these tests provide strong support for this argument.},

Abstract = {We study incumbency effects for individual legislators from two
   political parties (Christian Democracy and the Italian Socialist Party)
   in Italy's lower house of representatives over 10 legislatures (1948-92)
   elected using open-list proportional representation. Our analysis finds
   no reelection advantage for the average incumbent legislator. Only a
   tiny elite in each party successfully creates an incumbency advantage.
   We find incumbents advantaged for reselection by their political party.
   We interpret reselection advantage as a party loyalty premium. Our study
   depicts a political environment monopolized by party leaders who reward
   party loyalty but hamper legislators in appealing directly to voters.},

Abstract = {Party leaders have become more powerful and autonomous actors in recent
   years by developing a direct and personal relationship with citizens. As
   anticipated in the United States (Lowi, 1985), the rise of the `personal
   leader' seems to have occurred in many European democracies, both in old
   parties and in more recently formed parties, with a widespread tendency
   for them to be promoted and controlled by individual leaders.
   Nevertheless, party leadership remains quite a neglected theme in
   political science. Through a data set including similar to 500 party
   presidents in 13 democracies, this article focusses on the
   personalization of party leadership by comparing Italy with other
   Western countries. More particularly, new procedures for the selection
   of party chairs, the centralization of power in political parties, and
   the new role of party leaders in the legislative/governmental arena are
   analysed, given their importance to such a process. The article
   summarizes new data on the party leaders' characteristics, with regards
   to their political backgrounds, how they are elected, how long they stay
   in office, and whether they become prime minister or enter the
   executive. In this way, we are able to see how some new parties are
   created from the outset as highly personalized and centralized parties
   (Forza Italia being the paradigmatic case), whereas other older parties
   have also evolved in a personalized direction.},

Abstract = {Scholars have long emphasised the consensual nature of the
   intergovernmental negotiations in the Council of the European Union.
   Unlike other international organisations, where surface consensus has
   been found to be merely a cover for the dominance of powerful states,
   the EU literature describes a norm of generosity that works as a real
   constraining factor. In contrast, this article warns against
   descriptions of the EU as different in kind. Based on interviews with
   231 EU Member State representatives involved in day-to-day negotiations
   in the Council, it finds a strong bias in generosity on behalf of the
   three dominant powers: France, Germany and the United Kingdom. The Big
   3' are strikingly unwilling to make generous concessions, compared to
   other states. Furthermore, from a rational perspective, there are good
   reasons for expecting this pattern. The study also shows that extensive
   pooling of power in the form of qualified majority rule and hard law
   commitment is associated with less generosity, while there seems to be
   no socialising effect towards generosity from exposure to the Brussels
   community'. These findings cast a new light on the common narrative of
   the EU as a soft-bargaining' anomaly among international organisations,
   where national interests are upgraded into common interests by a process
   of norm socialisation. Instead, it seems that the purported consensus
   norm' has been far from successful in transcending fundamental power
   asymmetries between the EU Member States.},

Abstract = {Political campaigns are much more attack-filled in some countries than
   in others. What accounts for it? One answer hinges on the country's
   party system. We propose that two-party systems encourage more
   negativity than multiparty systems because parties in a multiparty
   system (1) must maintain good relationships with parties with which they
   may want to enter into coalition and (2) run the risk of supporters of
   the attacked party moving to support a third party. We test the
   relationship between party system and attack behaviour in New Zealand,
   which in 1996 changed from a single-member district, first-past-the-post
   system to a mixed-member proportional system. The result was a more
   fragmented party system, resulting in coalition and minority
   governments. Analysing over 250 adverts and party election broadcasts
   aired from 1969 to 2011, we find that advertising has become more
   positive since 1996, suggesting that party systems affect the tone of
   election campaigns.},

Abstract = {I explore how political property rights to revenues from governance
   relate to generality norms in governance. I do so by examining the rise
   of Western constitutional liberalism from the perspective of property
   rights economics and political economy. While it is true that Western
   political development has been the result of bargains between political
   elites (Congleton 2011), the implications of the fact that parties to
   these bargains historically were owners of the realm have been
   underappreciated. I argue the unintended consequence of these political
   bargains among owners of the realm was a de facto supermajority rule,
   approaching conceptual unanimity for those party to the bargains. In
   developing this argument I elaborate on the relationship between
   political and economic property rights, noting that while they were and
   will continue to be intertwined, there was a hierarchy of rights that
   became inverted over the course of elites' constitutional bargains.},

Abstract = {Dealing with constituent inquiries has long been a central component of
   political representation. Increasingly responsibilities for public
   policy are either divided or shared between regional and national
   legislatures and constituents frequently misdirect their inquiries. This
   article demonstrates how demand and supply factors determine the extent
   to which regional and national legislators across seven European
   democracies redirect inquiries on matters outside their jurisdiction, as
   well as the party to which they are forwarded. The choices they make
   have important consequences for our understanding of political
   representation in multi-level democracies; they may also matter to the
   quality of service responsiveness.},

Abstract = {This article explores in detail the conditions underpinning why
   Sub-Saharan Africa has avoided the Arab Spring phenomenon-despite the
   existence of extremely fertile grounds for political revolutions. Using
   a historical comparative method, the study draws chiefly from three Arab
   Spring countries (Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya), and identifies the key
   factors that aided the domino-effect of political revolutions in the
   Middle East and North African (MENA) region. It then contrasts these
   with the domino-inhibiting factors drawn from an examination of four
   Sub-Saharan African countries: Chad, Sudan, Cameroon, and Angola. The
   central argument emphasizes contextual regional uniqueness. While a set
   of factors unique to the MENA region aided a revolution domino effect, a
   combination of structural, domestic, and external factors equally unique
   to Sub-Saharan Africa have enabled the latter to evade the domino effect
   of the Arab Spring.},

Abstract = {The popularization of the Internet and the adoption of social media have
   brought major changes in the way of doing politics and managing the
   public arena. There is extensive scientific literature confirming the
   relationship between the use of new media and electoral political
   participation (Willnat et al, 2013; Lee and Shin, 2014; Ceron et al,
   2014.). The aim of this study is to determine the mechanism by which
   using social networks influences the decision to vote. Ecuadorian
   citizens (n=3,535) took part in an exploratory survey during the first
   half of 2013. The authors tested the measures and scales included in the
   questionnaire for validity and reliability; and they used a moderated
   mediation model (Hayes, 2013) based on regression. Results show that
   positive influence of using social networks on the decision to vote is
   not given directly, but rather through the search for information and
   need for political deliberation. In this mediation process, the indirect
   effect is in turn negatively moderated by age (the effect is stronger in
   young people). It is argued that despite the influence that networks may
   have on the behavior of voters, traditional factors related to the
   search for political information in more conventional means (e.g. radio
   or TV) seem to have a more significant effect. The authors explain both
   theoretical and practical implications. Finally, they address the
   study's limitations regarding the representativeness of the sample and
   suggest testing the model in other political and cultural contexts.},

Abstract = {The New Zealand Cabinet Manual is regarded as an authoritative guide to
   the conduct of the executive in that country, and it is now a public
   document accessible online. A similar Manual has been adopted in the UK,
   but these documents raise questions about the consequences of creating
   an authoritative written version of constitutional convention. For
   instance, could a Cabinet Manual prevent constitutional change or lead
   to biased understandings of conventions? Could the content of a Cabinet
   Manual have a decisive effect on judicial review? The present article
   examines the experience surrounding the New Zealand Cabinet Manual in
   order to address some of the critical questions that parliamentarians
   and academics have raised about the possible effects of such documents
   upon constitutional conventions. While the New Zealand Cabinet Manual is
   supposed not to affect constitutional convention, it has nonetheless
   helped to shape it.},

Title = {The Strategic Promotion of Distrust in Government in the Tea Party Age},
Journal = {FORUM-A JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Pages = {417-443},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper argues that distrust in government is not an inadvertent
   byproduct of economic change, scandals, and cultural and identity
   politics, but rather grows out of strategic efforts to promote and
   harness it for political purposes. Elites encouraging distrust interact
   with grassroots movements, which they can only loosely direct and
   control. Identifying four strategic benefits of distrust:
   organizational, electoral, institutional and policy, the paper discusses
   how Republicans and conservative movement organizations in the Tea Party
   age used distrust to develop groups and achieve coherence, try to
   influence primaries and win elections, argue for the constitutional
   powers of institutions they control, and seek to influence public
   policy. Paying special attention to health policy, we examine how, after
   distrust was successfully used to thwart President Bill Clinton's
   proposed reforms, it was employed to try to stop and then to exact a
   price for President Barack Obama's passage of the Affordable Care Act.
   While Tea Party rhetoric and current streams of distrust are often
   associated with racialized messages and anti-Obama sentiment, we contend
   they are likely to persist after Obama leaves office, particularly given
   the Tea Party's comfort with ungovernability and long-standing
   conservative use of government distrust.},

Abstract = {In this article, I consider the neglected question of justice between
   states in the distribution of responsibility for refugees. I argue that
   a just distribution of refugees across states is an important normative
   goal and, accordingly, I attempt to rethink the normative foundations of
   the global refugee regime. I show that because dismantling the
   restrictive measures currently used by states in the global South to
   prevent the arrival of refugees will not suffice to ensure a just
   distribution of refugees between states, a more detailed account of how
   responsibilities should be shared between states is required. To this
   end, I make three claims. First, I argue that the definition of
   `refugee' must be broadened beyond those subjected to persecution to
   include harms of action or omission by states that seriously jeopardise
   personal security or subsistence needs. Second, I argue that allocating
   a fair share of refugees to states should be based on state's
   integrative capacities. Finally, I argue that distributive justice
   between states must be balanced against the legitimate interests of
   refugees in their destination country and the duty of states to ensure
   they are settled in places where they are likely to flourish.},

Abstract = {The war against the Islamic State has seen some unusual alliances: the
   United States and European forces currently support the Kurdish
   positions in Bashur (Iraq) and Rojava (Syria). What would have been
   considered unlikely two years ago has, triggered by the threat potential
   of ISIS, become the most plastic show of neorealist concepts such as
   balance of power, alliance formation on the basis of shared enemy
   conceptions, and the relevance of geopolitical spheres of influence.
   This paper aims to uncover the reasons, consequences, and nature of the
   alliance between the United States, Turkey, the Syrian-Kurdish
   revolutionary movement PYD (Democratic Union Party), and the
   Iraq-Kurdish parties of the KDP (Kurdistan Democratic Party) and PUK
   (Patriotic Union of Kurdistan). The guiding hypothesis of the paper
   understands the ``state{''} to be an outdated concept for understanding
   the conflict. At the same time, this absence of centralstates and the
   multiplication of forces and actors can be seen as one trigger for
   increased Turkish assertion of strong-state postures both internally
   against the Kurdish Worker's Party (PKK) and externally against the
   Kurds in Iraq and Syria.},

Year = {2015},

Abstract = {This article provides a critical analysis of the Anti-Homosexuality Act
   (AHA) 2014 and the process by which it was enacted by the Parliament of
   Uganda. Drawing on Hansard (the Official Report), as well as other
   parliamentary documents, I examine how the legislation was shaped and
   formed during its parliamentary passage. I argue that, as a result of
   flawed scrutiny and insufficient debate, as well as procedural
   irregularities, Parliament enacted a statute that is not only unjust but
   also often ambiguous, incoherent or redundant in the context of Ugandan
   law. I conclude by suggesting that close scrutiny of the parliamentary
   process can provide a means of questioning and challenging the
   legitimacy of the legislation and the Parliament that made it. This is
   important in light of the nullification of the AHA 2014 by the
   Constitutional Court of Uganda and the strong potential for
   parliamentary supporters of the legislation to seek to revive or
   re-enact it in the future.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {296-312},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article traces the paradoxes within the modern international
   system, which is guided by liberal norms and values, in particular
   pertaining to human rights. This system is seen here as being ruled by
   an empty norm: power is present, but it is disembodied. Therefore, the
   entire international order is open to uses and abuses by the most
   powerful actors in the international sphere, especially the power
   states. Furthermore, when combined with the fact that the modern world
   has been completely appropriated by humanity as a universal integrated
   whole, whoever falls outside the dominant normative structure is, in
   effect, no longer even part of humanity. To analyse the means and
   effects of such tension between the universal and the particular, this
   article draws analogies with the medieval struggle between the secular
   and the religious authorities. It is argued that currently one can
   observe a return of the Respublica Christiana in the form of a
   rights-centred `international community'. And yet, contrary to earlier
   scholarly attempts to draw analogies with the Middle Ages, this return
   is seen here as a dangerous employment of political theology.},

Abstract = {Legitimate states have a general right to control their borders and
   decide who to admit as future citizens. Such decisions, however, are
   constrained by principles of justice. But which principles? To answer
   this we have to analyse the multifaceted relationships that may hold
   between states and prospective immigrants, distinguishing on the one
   hand between those who are either inside or outside the state's
   territory, and on the other between refugees, economic migrants and
   `particularity claimants'. The claims of refugees, stemming from their
   human rights, are powerful though limited in scope: they hold against
   eligible states generally rather than the specific one to which they
   apply for asylum. Economic migrants cannot claim a right to be admitted
   as such, but only a right to have legitimate selection criteria applied
   to them. Particularity claimants, such as those seeking redress for
   harms inflicted on them or reward for the services they have rendered to
   the state, must show why awarding a right to enter is the appropriate
   response to their claims. Finally, does justice enable us to establish
   admission priorities between these different categories of migrants?},

Abstract = {Party leaders are the main actors controlling campaign strategies,
   policy agendas, and government formation in advanced parliamentary
   democracies. Little is known, however, about gender and party
   leadership. This article examines gendered leadership patterns across 71
   political parties in 11 parliamentary democracies between 1965 and 2013.
   It shows that men and women have different access to, and experiences
   in, party leadership and that these gendered political opportunity
   structures are shaped by parties' political performances. Women are more
   likely to initially come to power in minor opposition parties and those
   that are losing seat share. Once selected for the position, female
   leaders are more likely to retain office when their parties gain seats,
   but they are also more likely to leave the post when faced with an
   unfavorable trajectory. Together, these results demonstrate that
   prospective female leaders are playing by a different (and often more
   demanding) set of rules than their male counterparts.},

Abstract = {The EURODAC Regulation establishes the database of the fingerprints of
   asylum seekers. In 2015, the new EURODAC Regulation came in force and
   some basic concepts that were not in the previous regulation have been
   changed. The article analyzes the responses to the new EURODAC
   Regulation from UNHCR and the Commission and the threats that this new
   regulation is creating. This article aims to find out whether the
   changes introduced in the new EURODAC will bring potential
   discrimination concerns and whether asylum seekers are treated as
   potential criminals and therefore causing stigmatization of those groups
   of people in society. The article gives an overview of the EURODAC
   database, fingerprinting and biometric systems, and comparison of old
   and new EURODAC regulation. The full assessment of the application of
   the regulation can be done after it has been in force for some time.},

Abstract = {The 1995 Beijing Platform for Action posed strategies to have in media
   and information technologies an ally for gender equality. ``Chapter
   J{''} identified core areas for this agenda: content and representation,
   access of women to decision-making positions at media and ICTs, gender
   mainstreaming in communication policy, access and use of women to media
   and ICTs. These strategies were reinforced by the World Summit on
   Information Society, that pointed out the prominent role of ICTs in
   women's human rights. The aim of this paper is to contribute to a
   constructive debate on gender and ICTs, by presenting some of the most
   significative trends in Latin America.},

Abstract = {In this article, I explore the ontological and epistemological
   assumptions of the ethical universalism that constitutes the basis for
   international intervention. I argue grounding ethical decisions upon
   abstract normativity diverts attention from what is at stake in specific
   situations and may lead to self-appeasement and de-responsabilization.
   In order to re-imagine political agency in an interconnected world, we
   must engage in a reflection about International Relations ontological
   and epistemological categories. I explore how pragmatism (especially in
   Friedrich Kratochwil's understanding), as well as the work of
   philosophers of science and feminist metaethical philosophers,
   delineates pathways for a non-foundationalist conceptualization of how
   we know the world, how we relate to it, and how we may endeavor to
   change it as ethical and political actors. I conclude by advocating the
   cultivation of an ethics of responsibility based upon contextualized
   judgments and reflexivity rather than abstract universal claims.},

Abstract = {The Palestinian Authority's (PA) claim to embody the spirit of the Arab
   Spring, through its recent state-building agenda - including its
   elevation to non-member observer status at the United Nations - is
   disingenuous. This conclusion rests on three key arguments outlined in
   this article. First, this article identifies a continuation of broader
   patterns of authoritarianism represented by the PA's lack of adherence
   to democratic practices, the deprivation of access for the Palestinian
   population to basic resources and the wider issue of the continued
   absence of Palestinian sovereignty. Second, it identifies the
   intensification of some authoritarian practices within Palestine,
   particularly in the areas of security and policing, for example by the
   use of force against protestors. Finally, this article identifies that
   civil-society groups and opposition supporters throughout 2011-2012 have
   more genuinely embodied evidence of resistance to authoritarianism in
   popular demonstrations against the PA.},

Abstract = {Provisions for a parliamentary investiture vote have become increasingly
   common in parliamentary democracies. This article shows that investiture
   provisions were largely introduced when new constitutions were written
   or old ones fundamentally redesigned. It also shows that the
   constitutions that endowed executives with strong legislative agenda
   powers also endowed parliaments with strong mechanisms to select the
   executive. It is argued that constitution makers' decisions can be seen
   in principal-agent terms: strong investiture rules constitute an ex ante
   mechanism of parliamentary control - that is, a mechanism to minimise
   adverse selection and reduce the risk of agency loss by parliament. The
   findings have two broad implications: from a constitutional point of
   view, parliamentary systems do not rely exclusively on ex post control
   mechanisms such as the no confidence vote to minimise agency loss;
   parliamentarism, at least today and as much as presidentialism, is the
   product of conscious constitutional design and not evolutionary
   adaptation.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {38},

Pages = {1086-1105},

Abstract = {Parliamentarians and their party groups can employ many different
   instruments to communicate policy statements to their electorate
   (debates in plenary, presentations of committee reports, oral questions,
   written questions, and interpellations). Therefore, the design of these
   instruments should be analysed in one common framework. This paper seeks
   to provide a first step towards this goal by mapping and explaining the
   centralisation of parliamentary policy statements in all western
   European countries with a parliamentary system. It is argued that, on a
   theoretical level, there are two different causes for a stronger or
   weaker centralisation of the instruments of parliamentary policy
   statements: the electoral connection and efficiency. Empirically, it is
   shown that there are striking differences in centralisation both within
   and between countries which are worth exploring further. Moreover, the
   results of the statistical models suggest that the electoral connection
   is the driving factor behind the centralisation of the instruments of
   parliamentary policy statements.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to explain the origins of the rules of parliamentary
   agenda control, which can be regarded as the single most important
   institutional determinant of parliamentary power. Based on the premises
   of distributive bargaining, the paper develops a causal mechanism for
   the delegation of agenda control to the government majority. Given that
   only anti-system or anti-establishment parties strictly prefer to
   participate in plenary proceedings, these anti'-parties potentially
   obstruct legislation. Such legislative obstruction by anti'-parties
   causes establishment parties to commit themselves to procedural reform
   and thus triggers attempts to centralise agenda control. The delegation
   of parliamentary agenda powers is successful if opposition to procedural
   reform is confined to anti-system parties. The causal leverage of this
   mechanism is assessed in a process-tracing of three reform attempts in
   two most different cases: the initially ineffective, but then successful
   introduction of a closure procedure in the United Kingdom and the failed
   attempt to facilitate the closure in Germany.},

Abstract = {Cameral procedures define the modus operandi of a parliament. This
   article examines how the electoral environment affects parliaments'
   rules of procedures and legislators' rights. It argues that when the
   electoral environment motivates legislators to act individualistically
   governments are incentivised to restrict cameral procedures to curtail
   legislators' behaviour. Materialising such incentives depends on the
   government's ability to pass restrictive procedural changes. To test the
   assertion, four decades (1967-2007) of amendments to the Israeli
   Knesset's rules of procedure were examined and support provided for
   co-variation of the electoral environment and restrictive Knesset's
   procedures. The analysis then details the factors that enabled Israeli
   governments to pass such restrictive measures. Indeed, governments seem
   to use the rules of procedure strategically in their attempt to improve
   their control and curtail legislators' behaviour.},

Abstract = {Why are women still a minority presence in American news media? Some
   accounts attribute the dearth of women as political newsmakers to
   sexism, but journalistic norms to attain the best source for a story
   suggest that sex should be irrelevant. To date, however, no study has
   systematically tested these competing hypotheses. Based on a new,
   original data set of more than 4,200 appearances by elected officials
   and non-elected political actors on the Sunday morning talk shows, I
   find that female elected officials, journalists, and political activists
   appear as guests less frequently than men do. But the gender gap does
   not result from overt sexism. Rather, the characteristics that
   contribute to repeated appearances on Sunday morning are consistent with
   journalistic norms to provide balance and credibility in reporting.
   Because there are few women in the positions and professions from which
   guests are selected, though, these norms also perpetuate a gendered news
   environment.},

Abstract = {Once legislators delegate policymaking responsibility to executive
   agencies, they have the ability to oversee and potentially influence the
   actions of these agencies. In this article, we examine, first, whether
   the actions of agencies reflect the preferences of legislators, and
   second, whether legislative professionalism enhances the ability of
   legislatures to influence executive agencies and obtain more preferred
   outcomes. We study these effects in the context of annual nursing home
   inspections performed by state administrators and make two predictions.
   First, as Democratic legislators will, on average, prefer a more
   activist role for government and for government agencies, we should see
   agencies issue more citations for violations of regulations when state
   legislatures are Democratic and fewer when they are Republican. Second,
   as more professionalized legislatures are better able to monitor the
   agency inspectors' actions and inspection outcomes, this effect should
   be intensified for legislatures with greater professionalism. We find
   support for both arguments: agencies faced with more Democrats in the
   legislature will be more activist, and this effect is strengthened for
   more professional legislatures.},

Abstract = {Case law is often used as evidence of a political action, similar to a
   pamphlet or speech. Yet, legal decisions are different from other
   sources in that when they function as precedent they have authority not
   only in the case at hand, but also in similar future cases. Recovering
   and using case law in the process of doing qualitative research is then
   inherently normative in the sense that researchers' actions may
   influence the outcome of future legal cases. This article argues that
   case law in the common law world is a unique type of source presenting
   normative entanglements and challenges not found in other historical
   documents, and that these normative issues have been overlooked because
   the concept of authority has received little attention in qualitative
   methodology. Consideration of the authority of our source material helps
   us to understand not only the context of the original source, but also
   to anticipate and appreciate the future uses to which others may put our
   work.},

Abstract = {What if democracy postulates not just a demos and the other things on
   which democratic theory these days focuses (constitutions, clear
   territorial boundaries, proper procedures, commitment to formal or
   substantive equality) but also public things, shared common things, over
   which to argue, around which to gather? Such things require communal
   attention, public commitment, and collective maintenance. And they
   return the favor by lending to us some of their objectivity: that is to
   say, interacting with public things grants to democratic subjects some
   of those things' durability and resilience. This insight is drawn from
   D. W. Winnicott's object-relations theory in which the idea of a holding
   environment is key. This essay, develops new readings of Lear's Radical
   Hope and von Trier's Melancholia from a public things perspective and
   argues that new narrations of democratic maturation are needed to
   counter recent efforts to infantilize the democratic need for public
   things. Tocqueville and Hannah Arendt are drawn upon as well in this
   analysis of the complex politics of collaboration and privatization in
   the context of the theft of native lands and the catastrophe of climate
   change.},

Abstract = {Stanley Milgram's assertion that his ``Obedience to Authority{''} (OTA)
   experiments replicated, in a laboratory setting, quintessential features
   of perpetrator behaviour during the Holocaust has been widely
   challenged. Most contemporary scholarship on this issue, known as the
   ``Milgram-Holocaust (M-H) linkage{''}, argues that Milgram's experiments
   failed to capture important factors such as ideology, policy,
   bureaucracy and technology, which more fully explain perpetrator
   behaviour. However, it is argued here that when the obedience research
   programme is viewed from a different angle - that of being an emerging
   policy-driven bureaucratic process in pursuit of ``scientific{''} goals
   with an impersonal means of inflicting harm - the interplay of factors
   such as ideology, policy, bureaucracy and technology did in fact play a
   central role in generating Milgram's high baseline completion rate.
   Hence, there is a much stronger theoretical connection between the OTA
   experiments and the Nazi state's perpetration of the Holocaust than the
   current scholarly consensus allows.},

Abstract = {Most recent work on the politics of interest representation assumes that
   lobbyists represent their clients' interests with fidelity. We test the
   validity of this assumption. Relying on a principal-agent framework
   developed by Stephenson and Jackson, Kersh and Lowery and Marchetti, we
   first discuss the nature of agency problems in lobbying and the utility
   of several potential solutions for those problems. We next develop and
   test two sets of hypotheses on how agency problems might influence one
   form of lobbying behavior - the prices contract lobby firms charge their
   interest organization principals. The hypotheses are tested with a
   purposive sample of clients employing major contract lobby firms
   operating in Washington DC in 2012.},

Abstract = {Do national federations foster or inhibit women's representation? In
   this article, we compare national legislative representation by women in
   federations and in centralized states. We analyze women's parliamentary
   representation for all democracies between 1995 and 2010. Descriptive
   statistics and multivariate regression analyses, in which we control for
   quotas, a country's type of electoral system, development level, the
   year the first woman was elected to parliament, the proportion of women
   in the workforce, and year of election, support the notion that federal
   states have approximately four percentage points more female legislators
   than do centralized states. In addition, our results indicate that
   federations have an indirect positive impact on women's representation:
   first, they facilitate the adoption of gender quotas; second, they allow
   women to enter parliament earlier than unitary states.},

Abstract = {Most scholars of the economy and the vote assume that voters are myopic
   and focus only on events during the election year. Some take an
   alternative view and posit that voters are more far-sighted and take
   into account earlier information. Who is right? This paper addresses the
   time horizon of economic voting focusing on US presidential elections
   between 1952 and 2012. The analysis considers whether voters respond to
   economic change at different points in the election cycle using two
   objective indicators income growth and the gross domestic product as
   well as a subjective measure of business conditions. The results using
   each of these measures reveal that voters do not react only to very late
   economic events or to what happens over the entire election cycle, but
   that they respond equally to developments during the last two years of a
   presidential term. The finding contrasts with the dominant approaches in
   the literature and makes clear that scholars should settle on functional
   form based on careful empirical analysis and not by assumption. (C) 2015

   Constitutional Thought},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Pages = {557-587},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the Publicola controversy, an early American
   debate that exposed lingering questions about the nature of American
   constitutionalism. The debate ignited when a young John Quincy Adams
   wrote a series of public letters that took direct aim at Thomas Paine's
   Rights of Man, the definitive Anglo-American panegyric to the French
   Revolution. Writing under the pseudonym ``Publicola,{''} Adams offered
   an extensive critique of Paine's understanding of America's
   contributions to constitutional theory. These letters in turn inspired a
   number of rebuttals, and the ensuing debate quickly transformed from a
   disagreement over the character of the French Revolution into a struggle
   to define America's fledgling constitutional order. The Publicola
   controversy offers a valuable window into a delicate and formative early
   stage of American constitutional development and highlights some
   persistent tensions in American constitutionalism that we struggle to
   reconcile even today.},

Abstract = {Increasingly the international community attempts to improve local
   public infrastructure in developing countries by creating more
   participatory local governance and social capital. We report on a
   randomized field experiment conducted in 24 communities (16 treated and
   8 control) in rural Sudan. We offer a clearer theoretical statement of
   how these programs might alter the political landscape of the recipient
   villages. We measure norms using lab-in-the-field techniques and we
   measure network density with a survey of our 475 lab subjects. We
   appraise the participatory character of local governance and civic
   participation with a survey of 576 households. The program did not
   affect either networks or norms, but civic participation and the
   participatory nature of local governance increased. Thus we attribute
   the increase in citizen participation not to social capital growth but
   to more open local governing institutions.},

Abstract = {How do issues enter the political arena and come to affect party
   competition? This study extends the literature on issue evolution from
   the U.S. context to multiparty systems. While traditional models assume
   opposition parties to be the agents of issue evolution, this study
   argues that within multiparty competition not all parties in opposition
   have an incentive to change the issue basis of political competition.
   The central propositions of our issue entrepreneurship model are
   twofold: First, political parties are more likely to become issue
   entrepreneurs when they are losers on the dominant dimension of
   contestation. We focus on three components of political loss in
   multiparty systems relating to the office-seeking, voting-seeking, and
   policy-seeking objectives of parties. Second, parties will choose which
   issue to promote on the basis of their internal cohesion and proximity
   to the mean voter on that same issue. We test these propositions by
   examining the evolution of the issue of European integration in 14
   European party systems from 1984 to 2006. The time-series
   cross-sectional analyses lend strong support to our model.},

Abstract = {We investigate whether the hiring relationships of candidates and
   political consulting firms better resembles the predictions of the
   adversarial or allied models of consultant-party interaction. We find
   that the highest-quality consultants are not allocated to the most
   competitive races, consultant-candidate relationships persist even as
   candidates' electoral prospects change, and firms who work for
   challengers face a higher risk of market exit than firms working for
   incumbents. The market focuses entirely on win-loss records and ignores
   the information on consultant performance available in candidates' vote
   shares. These findings depict a market driven by individual candidate,
   rather than aggregate party, goals.},

Abstract = {This review article explores how individuals are involved in global
   politics, and asks whether such involvement can only be easily
   understood when mediated through nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) or
   whether there are opportunities for recognising direct (global)
   political engagement differently. It investigates (albeit briefly)
   whether the political agency of individuals is meaningful in global
   politics, and whether analyses that might foreground such engagement can
   balance more structuralist approaches as well as those that seek to
   suggest that only collective action (organised through NGOs) can be
   effective on the global political stage. One might anecdotally see a
   role for individuals at crucial (global) political junctures, but the
   question is what opportunities might there be for making a more strident
   argument for the role of the individual in global politics? In different
   ways the five books explored in the review offer different paths to such
   recognition, and although none of the books completely help resolve this
   lacuna, all offer ways to think about the shape that such a project
   might take if it is to be successful.},

Abstract = {This article engages one of the important gaps in the literature on
   party system effects: the consequences of party system change. We
   discuss how existing empirical approaches to party system change do not
   actually capture the changeability of patterns of party competition,
   which is the most direct understanding of the term ``party system.{''}
   We propose a measure that does exactly this: the index of fluidity.
   Applying this measure to countries in South East Asia, we show that
   party system change is associated with harmful effects, including lower
   foreign direct investment and deterioration of the rule of law.},

Abstract = {The introductory article to the special issue discusses how the
   extension of voting rights beyond citizenship (that is, to non-national
   immigrants) and residence (that is, to expatriates) can be interpreted
   in the light of democratization processes in both Western countries and
   in developing regions. It does so by inserting the
   globalization-specific extension of voting rights to immigrants and
   expatriates within the long-term series of historical waves of
   democratization. Does the current extension enhance democracy by
   granting de facto disenfranchised immigrants and emigrants political
   rights or does it jeopardize the very functioning of democracy by
   undermining its legitimacy through the removal of territorial and
   national boundaries? The article offers a synthesis of the findings of
   the volume's contributions in a broad comparative perspective covering
   both alien and external voting rights in Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and
   Latin America. It shows that reforms toward more expansive electorates
   vary considerably and that their effects on the inclusion of migrants
   largely depend on the specific regulations and the socio-political
   context in which they operate.},

Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {Issue ownership has been an important concept in the analysis of party
   competition for several decades. Traditionally, issue ownership has been
   regarded as a stable phenomenon where parties are advantaged by
   different political issues. However, several recent studies have
   reported change in voters' perceptions of parties' issue ownership. To
   investigate the changeability of issue ownership and how it can be
   altered, this article investigates the impact of parties' communication
   attempts through a web-based survey in Sweden. Two major political
   issues are in focus: employment and healthcare. The results show that
   parties can indeed improve their ownership by communicating on an issue.
   Indications were also found that the effects decrease as other parties
   simultaneously communicate on the same issue, and when those who receive
   the messages are ideologically distant from the party. However, in
   several cases results are weak. Many important conditionalities
   therefore remain to be explored in future studies.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions can cabinet ministers affect the government's
   policy agenda? Existing literature provides conflicting answers to this
   question. In this article, I show that some politicians are more likely
   than others to influence policy. Specifically, I consider three types of
   ministers: loyalists, who are loyal to their party leader and prioritize
   office over policy; partisans, who are party heavyweights and aspiring
   leaders; and ideologues, who have fixed policy ideas and are unwilling
   to compromise over office perks. I argue that ideologues and partisans
   will affect policy more than loyalists do. Using a novel data set on
   ministerial backgrounds, and examining the area of social welfare policy
   in 18 countries, I find support for my theoretical expectations.},

Abstract = {The following article analyzes the links between the political parties,
   the trade unions and the social movements taking into account the
   comparative perspective of Brazil and Argentina in the period 2003/2011.
   In the case of Brazil, the period encompassing the two presidential
   mandates of Inacio Lula Da Silva, in Argentina Nstor Kirchner's
   presidency (2003/2007) and the first period of Cristina Fernandez de
   Kirchner (2007/2011). In both cases, there are government experiences
   that are part of a regional scenario where the neoliberal consensus is
   broken and where the main characters of political parties the Brazilian
   PT and Peronism in Argentina have a strong link with the trade unions
   and social movements which feel represented by them, and hence identify
   them as ``their{''} governments. We analyze thoroughly the complex set
   of loyalties and political identities that act as a boundary for the
   policy design and the responses generated from the inner levels.},

Abstract = {This paper reviews the problem of declining turnout and proposes as a
   solution a system whereby each elector would be legally obliged to vote
   in the first election for which they were eligible. Popular attitudes
   toward first-time compulsory voting are measured and probed by means of
   UK data. The main findings of the paper are that first-time compulsory
   voting is a politically and administratively feasible proposal that
   appears tentatively to command popular support and has the potential to
   help address a number of the problems associated with declining turnout,
   and in particular low rates of electoral participation among younger
   citizens.},

Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {45},
Number = {3},
Pages = {477-499},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article develops a game-theoretical model of European Union (EU)
   policy making that suggests that the amount of legislative activity
   depends on the size of the gridlock interval. This is consistent with
   Krehbiel's study of US politics. This interval depends on two factors:
   (1) the preference configuration of the political actors and (2) the
   legislative procedures used in a particular period. Actors' preferences
   and procedures are not expected to have any effect beyond their impact
   on the gridlock interval. The study predicts smaller gridlock intervals,
   and thus more legislative activity, under the co-decision (consultation)
   procedure when the pivotal member states and the European Parliament
   (Commission) are closer to each other. More activity is expected under
   qualified majority voting in the Council than under unanimity. The
   results find support for these propositions in an empirical analysis of
   EU legislative activity between 1979 and 2009.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to analyze the relation between the
   cultural legal opening initiated in Portugal with the Law of good reason
   (1769) and with the reform of the statutes of the University of Coimbra
   (1772) and the draft criminal code written by Pascoal de Melo Freire and
   delivered to review in 1789. Through the reelaboration of the
   understanding of the eighteenth-century penal problem based on the
   analysis of certain aspects of Cesare Beccaria's thought, its most
   emblematic representative, we seek to comprehend the reception in
   Portugal of the paradigm shift occurred in the 18th century within the
   criminal legal thought, highlighting the philosophical revision that
   inserted it, as a means of social control, inside the debate about the
   construction of modern state and its utility to the autocratic political
   agenda initiated by Pombal.},

Abstract = {Given the high levels of uncertainty and complexity of issues considered
   at the EU level, knowledge from sound and reliable sources of expertise
   is of a particular importance. To date, literature on the role of
   scientific knowledge and scientists in EU policy-making is relatively
   scarce. Furthermore, we know little about the scientists involved in EU
   policy-making: what attitudes do they hold regarding their contribution
   to policies shaped and adapted at the EU level? How do scientists
   perceive their role in EU policy-making? The article relies on new data
   from a survey of scientific members of the Commission's expert
   committees to gain insights into the perceptions held by scientists on
   how their knowledge is used: the literature on knowledge utilisation
   suggests that an agent can use knowledge as an instrument to increase
   its problem-solving capacity (instrumental knowledge utilisation), but
   also for more strategic purposes such as support for predetermined
   policy preferences (substantiating knowledge utilisation), or as a way
   of promoting power and influence (legitimising knowledge utilisation).
   The study finds that strategic uses of knowledge are not highly
   prominent in the process of proposal drafting. On the contrary, we find
   that the instrumental mode is perceived as dominant by scientific
   contributors. Future research need to show whether this mode of
   scientific knowledge utilisation is also relevant for other stages in
   the EU policy-making process.},

Abstract = {This article of analytical content, aims to interpret some significant
   elements considered for the analysis of pacifist empowerment. Starting
   from the theoretical and practical background that on empowerment
   generally presented in Latin America and in Mexico from the ideas of
   Paulo Freire, as well as the understandings of the concept have been
   exposed from the philosophical, participatory, gender, social, and
   development approaches.
   According to the purpose and object of research, the article falls
   within the qualitative methodology of hermeneutic type that allows us to
   identify, describe, analyze, and reflect on the pacifist empowerment,
   based on textual sources and Peace research categories, considering
   particular bibliography on the subject. The qualitative research
   approach was supplemented with the technique of observation and dialogue
   on the subject taught by Francisco Munoz in his last journey to Mexico.
   In the first part the results of the development and empowerment of the
   term approaches and their application is described in general terms. The
   conventional concept is discussed to understand the similarities and
   differences with the pacifist empowerment. In the second part the
   approach of pacifist empowerment having as theoretical support for Peace
   studies and particularly Munoz and his coauthors addressed approaches is
   discussed. Some understandings about the issue are outlined and the
   article concludes that the concept of pacifist empowerment is in
   theoretical construction from the perspective of peace studies, and his
   statement is proposed as a know-how transformer of the subject and
   collective action to decide and to influence structural, cultural,
   gender or any violence condition as a strategy of nonviolent social
   change to build more peaceful worlds.},

Volume = {50},

Abstract = {Many democracies are widely perceived to be suffering a serious crisis
   of representation, participation and legitimacy. As part of this
   crisis', the male domination of democracy - both in terms of its
   institutions and who participates - has been identified as problematic,
   even emblematic, of a more generalized democratic crisis. Increasing the
   participation of women is advocated as one solution. Using examples
   drawn from both long-standing and newer democracies (parliamentary and
   presidential), particularly from Europe and Latin America, this article
   explores the gender dynamics of the crisis of democracy'. The crisis'
   has two gendered aspects. First, and paradoxically, although democracy
   still privileges predominantly white, elite, heterosexual, men, more
   women now participate in democratic institutions, leading to claims that
   the male monopoly' has ended (Dahlerup and Leyenaar 2013). Second, the
   crisis of democracy' may provide opportunities to further enhance
   women's participation, as the demands of those favouring greater gender
   equality and those looking for solutions to the crisis' appear to
   coincide.},

Title = {Balancing act? Testing a theory of split-party US Senate delegations},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {38},
Pages = {19-27},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Why do some states elect split-party U.S. Senate delegations? Fiorina
   (1992) suggests that his own ``balancing{''} theory might account for
   the emergence of such opposite party pairs of Senators. Due primarily to
   data limitations, previous empirical assessments of whether balancing
   can appropriately explain the emergence of mixed delegations in the
   Senate have been limited to aggregate-level analysis. This paper builds
   on previous scholarship by offering the first individual-level
   examination of whether balancing theory can appropriately explain
   divided Senate delegations. We find that individual-level balancing is
   limited and that when controlling for individual and contextual factors
   thought to influence vote choice, there is no discernible evidence that
   voters are considering the makeup of their state's overall Senate
   delegation when choosing between Senate candidates on offer. Ultimately,
   our results suggest that candidate-centered campaigns, heterogeneous
   electorates, and idiosyncratic electoral forces are better explanations
   for split-party Senate delegations than is any type of strategic,
   non-proximate voting on the part of citizens. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {4-47},
Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {What explains democratic participation in United Nations peacekeeping
   operations? Although the division of the burden of UN peacekeeping
   operations has attracted a considerable amount of scholarly attention,
   neither the impact of domestic variables, nor the interaction between
   the domestic and international determinants of peacekeeping
   contributions has been systematically analysed. This article aims to
   fill this gap in academic research. First, insights from research on
   peacekeeping burden sharing, democratic peace theory and integrated
   decision models are combined in a multi-causal framework. Subsequently,
   two-step fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis is used to assess
   whether this model explains diverging contributions to the 2006
   enhancement of the UNIFIL operation. The results of this analysis show
   that contributions result from a complex interplay between domestic and
   international conditions. Two combinations of international level
   conditions allowed for large contributions. In the absence of
   significant military engagements, military capable states and states
   with a high level of prior involvement in UNPOs had an incentive to
   participate. Actual contributions, however, only materialized if such a
   conductive international context was combined with favourable domestic
   conditions: only states governed by a left-leaning government that was
   not constrained by either proximate general elections or a right-leaning
   parliament with extensive veto powers participated in the operation.},

Title = {A Network Analysis of Online Audience Behaviour: Towards a Better
   Comprehension of the Agenda Setting Process},
Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Number = {20},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {By constructing the network of media audience, this study sheds light on
   the predominant modes of exposure to online political information in
   Spain. Novelty data from a panel of thirty thousand individuals is used
   for the research. The preliminary results bring evidences for reviewing
   the line of reasoning that advocates for the prevailing fragmentation of
   the public sphere. More notably, the results contribute to proving that
   a substantial level of audience concentration still remains in the web.
   The highest levels of audience overlapping are found in those media
   outlets that are driving the media agenda in the offline sphere.
   Therefore the study proffers evidence that the structure of the online
   public sphere might guarantee the necessary shared informational
   experiences for a deliberative democracy.
   The implications of the current networked audience behaviour for the
   study of the agenda setting process are discussed along with the chances
   for a shared public agenda in Spanish society. Observational methods and
   content analysis have been used in the study of the agenda setting
   process so far. However, the current communication environment
   characterized by unlimited, decentralized and abundant sources of
   political information prompts the application of new analytical
   approaches. Networks are at the heart of online communication and
   network science allows for analyzing its structure. It provides the
   affordances to map and study audience aggregated behaviour when
   searching for political information. In doing in so, it also unveils the
   mechanisms that might still guarantee a public agenda in the digital
   age.},

Abstract = {State governments have considerable discretion regarding when they use
   federal grants to deliver goods and service themselves and when they
   pass those grants through to fund service delivery by local governments,
   nonprofit organizations, and other substate entities. This discretion
   influences the expenditure, and potentially the impact, of many billions
   of dollars every year. Unfortunately, we know very little about the
   decisions states make regarding the volume of federal grant aid they
   pass through, or about the types of subrecipients most likely to receive
   that money. Drawing on delegation theory, this study develops the
   argument that the amount and target of pass-through funding will be a
   function of the state's capacity to produce desired goods, shared policy
   preferences between state and local actors, and the relative capacity of
   substate actors to produce those same goods. We test these hypotheses in
   analyses of the pass-through of ARRA grants to subrecipients by state
   governments between 2009 and 2012. The results from those analyses
   suggest that delegation theory provides a useful way to understand both
   the volume of pass-through that states engage in as well as the target
   of those monies.},

Abstract = {Referendums often fail to live up to a deliberative standard, with many
   characterised by low levels of knowledge, disinterest and
   misinformation, negativity, and a focus on extraneous issues to which
   voters are voting. But social media offers new avenues for referendums
   to incorporate a greater deliberative dimension. Through a content
   analysis of BBC discussion forums, we test whether online discussion of
   the Scottish independence referendum has deliberative characteristics.
   Results suggest a mixed picture with conversation displaying some
   deliberative features (low incidences of flaming/discussion of
   referendum issues). However, low levels of discussion intensity,
   dominance by a few, little knowledge exchange, and high gender
   inequality illustrate that online referendum discussion lacks
   deliberative characteristics, implying that social media are not a
   panacea for referendum deliberation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The training of experts in mediation is a key issue to secure excellence
   in a professional field that implies the first access to justice in
   today's societies. The European Union has opted to leave Member States
   to determine the training requirements and, in this context, Spain has
   recently legislated to provide mediators with a legal framework that is
   uniform and enables all mediators to practice in civil, commercial and
   bankruptcy issues, throughout the national territory regardless of the
   existing regional legislation at the place of practice. In any case some
   key issues for the training and expertise of these experts may be
   identified today in an increasingly complex and diverse society that
   requires to become familiar with a number of different economic and
   socio-cultural contexts, to be aware of the legal framework in which the
   conflict may be settled, and to feel comfortable into the electronic
   environment.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {465-490},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {This article examines the effect of the recent economic crisis on
   political participation levels in Europe. As the civic voluntarism model
   and grievances theory predict different effects of economic downturn on
   political participation, the crisis provides a unique context to
   evaluate the explanatory power of these two theories. It is found that,
   when investigating a period of eight years (2002-2010), economic growth
   is positively associated with non-institutionalised political
   participation, which is in line with the civic voluntarism model.
   However, when focusing on the changes in political participation that
   occurred between 2008 and 2010 it is found that rising unemployment is
   associated with rising levels of non-institutionalised political
   participation, suggesting that grievance theory is especially useful in
   exceptionally negative conditions as suddenly imposed grievances can
   lead to various forms of protest behaviour. The article argues that
   these shock experiences can lead to momentary peak periods of
   mobilisation.},

Abstract = {Over the past 150 years, terrorist organisations around the world have
   adopted a similar range of core tactics to advance their cause,
   including the provocation of states into an overreaction to the threat
   posed by terrorism. In doing so, states fall into a deliberate trap set
   by the terrorists, with their own actions ultimately undermining their
   legitimacy to govern. Tom Parker argues that terrorist groups have been
   remarkably open and consistently candid about their intentions to
   capitalise on this weakness and that it is time that governments - and
   the societies they preside over - begin to benefit from their candour.},

   the last impetus to an ongoing upheaval that, in little over a decade,
   dislocated a centuries-old global Iberian world. To a limited extent, it
   also contributed to the unleashing of an era of civil war that resulted
   in the secession of most of the Spanish American dominions and fuelled
   the ideological battleground between conservative and progressive,
   centralist and decentralist forces. Portugal fared no better, troubled
   by domestic crises and the eventual unravelling of the Lusitanian Empire
   through the emergence of an independent Brazil.},

Abstract = {The European Union views the spread of economic prosperity and rule of
   law to countries emerging from dictatorship as among its primary goals
   when considering countries as candidates for membership. Existing
   literature often suggests that EU membership confers significant
   benefits on the accession countries, and these countries are willing to
   undergo costly and difficult reforms to reap these benefits. Through
   strict membership conditions, member states force accession countries to
   commit to democracy. Drawing on theoretical work in the fields of law,
   politics, and economics, this article reassesses the conventional
   wisdom. It argues that, under certain conditions, the reforms required
   of would-be members could have the perverse effect of undermining the
   establishment of legitimate law in transitional democracies. Using an
   agent-based model, the article elucidates a theory in which placing laws
   on the books around which no societal consensus exists can create
   perverse incentives for citizens and government officials and may lead
   to an erosion of the rule of law.},

Abstract = {In Somalia, the African Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) forces are engaged
   in a fierce counter-insurgency campaign against Al Shabab terrorists.
   Regional and international players such as Ethiopia and the USA support
   AMISOM. In northern Mali, French forces together with those of the
   Economic Community of West African States are involved in vicious
   battles with Islamists in the form of Ansar Dine, the Movement for Unity
   and Jihad and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. In northern Nigeria,
   security forces are engaged in bloody battles again the Islamist sect
   Boko Haram. In all three cases, success in a traditional realist sense
   is far from assured and traditional counter-terrorism measures are
   actually counter-productive since it refuses to acknowledge the
   underlying complexity giving rise to radical Islamist movements.
   Adopting a critical terrorism studies approach, with an emphasis on the
   emancipatory approach of the Aberystwyth School, this paper argues that
   traditional counter-terrorism would only serve to perpetuate the
   conflict in these countries further. The situation is exacerbated since
   there is a refusal to recognize the legitimate demands of the other
   through the creation of the stereotype of the irrational and cruel
   other. Traditional counter-terrorism studies are also problematic in
   that it refuses to acknowledge that the historic and economic conditions
   contributing to the emergence of Boko Haram. In a similar vein, the
   Tuareg Islamists of Northern Mali see their own identity as indivisible
   with that of their homeland Azawad; something which neither the Malian
   government nor international forces are prepared to acknowledge.
   Moreover, and in line with critical terrorism studies, the paper adopts
   an inter-disciplinary approach that examines the complexity of the
   problems these polities confront, including governance, history,
   anthropology and the manner African states are inserted into the global
   political economy.},

   recruited thousands of workers to engage in direct voter contact. We
   conceive of this strategy as a principal-agent problem. Workers engaged
   in direct contact are intermediaries between candidates and voters, but
   they may be ill-suited to convey messages to general-election audiences.
   By analyzing a survey of workers fielded in partnership with the 2012
   Obama campaign, we show that in the context of the campaign widely
   considered most adept at direct contact, individuals who were
   interacting with swing voters on the campaign's behalf were
   demographically unrepresentative, ideologically extreme, cared about
   atypical issues, and misunderstood the voters' priorities. We find
   little evidence that the campaign was able to use strategies of agent
   control to mitigate its principal-agent problem. We question whether
   individuals typically willing to be volunteer surrogates are productive
   agents for a strategic campaign.},

Abstract = {As part of the commemoration of the five hundredth anniversary of The
   Prince, by Niccolo Machiavelli, paradigmatic work that inaugurated the
   modern political world, it was our intention to approach a new and
   different reading of that book. We understand that it is a real
   theoretical and methodological challenge to approach a classic from the
   gender perspective, however, we think it may be a very interesting
   experience. To do this, we intend to start with a brief description of
   the context in which Machiavelli's work is framed, because we are
   convinced that the Renaissance has been a historic moment of remarkable
   value. Then we will analyze the gender system and the role played by
   women in the transition from feudalism to capitalism. After that we will
   study the ``virtu-fortune{''} tension exposed, repeatedly, by
   Machiavelli. There, our challenge will be to analyze the famous phrase
   ``Fortune is a woman{''} in light of the changes mentioned above and
   also reflect on emerging masculinities in Renaissance Italy and its
   relation to virtue. Finally, we present a series of notes as a closure
   and invitation to debate.},

Abstract = {Contemporary state building intervention in weak states is based on the
   assumption that once a capable state is instituted, it will be able to
   ensure peace. Extant literature on state capacity and civil war onset
   tends to confirm this assumption. However, the relation between state
   capacity and the onset of non-state conflict is not adequately examined
   in this literature. This article, which is based on findings from
   research under-taken by the author at the African Leadership Centre,
   aims to extend the existing knowledge on state capacity and civil
   conflict by examining the relation between state capacity and non-state
   conflict in subSaharan Africa using mixed methodological approaches. A
   statistical analysis of the correlation between three aspects of state
   capacity and non-state conflict is supplemented with a detailed
   qualitative analysis of selected states that experience non-state
   conflicts and those that did not. State capacity is dissected into state
   effectiveness, legitimacy and monopoly of the means of coercion. The
   result reveals that the legitimacy and effectiveness of the state are
   negatively correlated with nonstate conflicts in a statistically
   significant way. However, the qualitative analysis indicates that the
   role of state capacity in reducing non-state conflicts should not be
   over-stated. The occurrence or absence of non-state conflicts is
   influenced by the interplay of multi-faceted factors related to the
   level of resource scarcity, the strength of customary dispute resolution
   mechanisms, patterns of intercommunity interaction, nature of state
   policies and political actors' stake in a conflict.},

Abstract = {Many articles use regression discontinuity designs (RDDs) that exploit
   the discontinuity in ``close{''} election outcomes to identify various
   political and economic outcomes of interest. One of the most important
   types of diagnostic tests in an RDD is checking for balance in
   observable variables within the window on either side of the threshold.
   Finding an imbalance raises concerns that an unobservable variable may
   exist that affects whether a case ends up above or below the threshold
   and also directly affects the dependent variable of interest. This
   article shows that imbalance in RDDs exploiting close elections are
   likely to arise even in the absence of any type of strategic sorting.
   Imbalance may arise simply due to variation in the underlying
   distribution of partisanship in the electorate across constituencies.
   Using both simulated and actual election data, the study demonstrates
   that the imbalances driven by partisanship can be large in practice. It
   then shows that although this causes a bias for the most naive RDDs, the
   problem can be corrected with commonly used RDDs such as the inclusion
   of a local linear control function.},

   of reforms known as modernization. Three years after Medvedev's
   presidency ended, it still is not certain what these reforms amounted

   change take place at all? This article examines the reforms and seeks to
   clarify what Medvedev's modernization actually was.},

Abstract = {Do informal institutions, rules, and norms created and enforced by
   social groups promote good local governance in environments of weak
   democratic or bureaucratic institutions? This question is difficult to
   answer because of challenges in defining and measuring informal
   institutions and identifying their causal effects. In the article, we
   investigate the effect of lineage groups, one of the most important
   vehicles of informal institutions in rural China, on local public goods
   expenditure. Using a panel dataset of 220 Chinese villages from 1986 to
   2005, we find that village leaders from the two largest family clans in
   a village increased local public investment considerably. This
   association is stronger when the clans appeared to be more cohesive. We
   also find that clans helped local leaders overcome the collective action
   problem of financing public goods, but there is little evidence
   suggesting that they held local leaders accountable.},

Abstract = {Margaret Thatcher's death in April 2013 reawakened the political
   controversies around her premiership and the adulation and antipathy
   which she had always attracted. To many of her supporters and opponents
   she became a mythical figure. The ways in which this myth was
   constructed are analysed, and how they tend to exaggerate agency and
   downplay the role of contingency and the structural contexts in which
   Thatcher operated. Three aspects of her legacy are discussed, first her
   role in redirecting foreign policy and external relations, particularly
   with reference to the Falklands War, the revival of Atlanticism and the
   turn away from Europe; second her role in reversing economic decline,
   and how far her policies were responsible for irreversible social and
   economic change; and third her impact on the British party system and
   the conduct of British politics, particularly her role in changing both
   the Labour party and the Conservatives.},

Abstract = {Although the end of the Cold War meant fewer constraints on humanitarian
   intervention, U.S. leaders continue to shy away from protecting
   innocents outside of the United States from harm. This is despite the
   fact that presidential candidates often campaign on restoring America's
   moral lead in the world and, in particular, on U.S. responsibilities to
   avert mass atrocities. Hagan's Logic of Political Explanation aids in
   understanding why, once in office, a president's initial response is to
   avoid the controversy of a risky involvement. When this strategy fails,
   he shifts to a strategy of legitimating a policy of intervention and/or
   to a strategy that insulates his foreign policy choice from domestic
   political pressures. Hagan's model facilitates in understanding the role
   of the domestic environment, especially regarding political opposition
   and the public's attitude toward a crisis, in shaping presidential
   decision making on humanitarian intervention.},

Abstract = {The democratic deficit in the Middle East and the Muslim world is
   well-established. No study has, however, identified what it is about
   being a Middle Eastern or Muslim-majority country that impedes
   democracy. The explanatory deficit has given rise to an idea of Middle
   Eastern or Muslimexceptionalism. This article documents that when
   political and colonial history is accounted for, there is nothing
   exceptional about levels of democracy in these regions. Territories with
   comparatively developed precolonial state institutions were better able
   to resist European colonization and settlement. If they were colonized,
   territories with more developed state structures were more likely to
   experience an indirect form of colonial rule. Such territories,
   including the Islamic heartland in the Middle East, experienced less
   European settlement and colonial rule through local intermediaries and
   were therefore, in the long run, less likely to embark on a democratic
   regime trajectory.},

Title = {Southern Delegates and Republican National Convention Politics,

Abstract = {Throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the
   Republican Party dominated American elections in all geographical areas
   except the former Confederacy, which remained solidly Democratic.
   Despite this, Southern states were consistently provided with a sizable
   delegation to the Republican National Convention (as much as 26 percent
   of the total). This raises the question: Why would a region that
   delivered no votes on Election Day be given a substantial say in the
   selection of the party's presidential candidate? Previous research on
   the role Southern delegates played in Republican conventions has been
   limited to individual cases or to studies only tangentially related to
   this question. We explore the continuous and sizable presence of
   Southern delegates at Republican conventions by conducting a historical
   overview of the 1880-1928 period. We find that Republican Party
   leadersand particularly presidentsadopted a Southern strategy by
   investing heavily in maintaining a minor party organization in the
   South, as a way to create a reliable voting base at conventions. We also
   show that as the Republican Party's strength across the country grew
   under the System of 1896, challenges to the delegate apportionment
   methodand thereby efforts to minimize Southern influence at Republican
   conventionsincreased substantially.},

Abstract = {Trauma theory has long been confined to the domain of psychology with a
   concern for clinical situations and vignettes. The framing of trauma as
   an individual or psychological problem is unable to explain what causes
   changes in public attitudes toward trauma victims because it fails to
   recognize the collective dynamics and social dimension of trauma. The
   collective dynamics of trauma have emerged as a vital theme in recent
   works including constructivist sociological models of collective trauma
   representations and of the changing impact of international norms. This
   article engages with these models in the context of the Cambodian
   genocide by the Khmer Rouge and explores the shifts in public
   perceptions of formerly stigmatized survivors, considering that trauma
   recovery is a never-ending process with an uncertain outcome. It is
   argued that the public perception of what constitutes individual trauma
   and who is acknowledged as victim depends largely on cultural and
   political contexts. Field interviews with several victims of forced
   marriages, a mental health expert, and a former judge illustrate what
   needs to be done to help traumatized survivors find closure and obtain
   reparations.},

   capacity, and the other adversary would be inclined to attack
   preemptively if the country is developing a strong military capacity. I
   derive conditions under which it is an equilibrium for the nation to be
   ambiguous about its military capacity as a function of the hawkishness
   of the adversaries and the accuracy of the adversaries' national

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {77},
Number = {2},
Pages = {381-393},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this essay, I challenge the conceptual and normative arguments of
   Andrew Rehfeld's The Concept of Constituency. I argue that Rehfeld
   conflates two distinct concepts of constituency as a result of errors in
   his normative argument for random, permanent constituencies. In
   response, I carefully distinguish the two concepts of objective
   constituency (the grouping of citizens into geographic or other
   electoral rolls through parametric action) and subjective constituency
   (the formation of cohesive voting blocs to elect a representative
   through strategic and communicative action between constituents and
   candidates). Distinguishing between objective and subjective
   constituency allows me to identify the shortcomings in the normative
   analyses of democratic constituencies proffered by Lisa Disch and Thomas
   Pogge. I then propose the use of random, permanent constituencies, each
   of which elects five representatives through the single transferable
   vote. This facilitates the representation of racial and ethnic
   minorities, while encouraging constituency deliberation aimed at the
   national interest.},

Abstract = {Election forecasting has become a standard part of the tool kit for
   political scientists around the world. However, that focus is almost
   exclusively on forecasting national electoral contests. Here we offer
   another, unique, focus - the changing political color of the core
   nations of the European Union, the Fifteen. First, we offer a model that
   forecasts the fortune of classic right-wing rule for this region,
   labeled Euroland. Then, we examine those forecasts, as compared with
   France in particular. France holds special interest because, according
   to our forecasts for 2015, it could well swing right, while the rest of
   Euroland goes left. One suggestion, of course, is that the tradition of
   French exceptionalism will continue.},

   Facilitated Geographic Polarization},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {77},
Number = {2},
Pages = {394-406},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In the postwar era, Democratic voters have become increasingly more
   likely than Republican voters to live in urban counties. Public policies
   that shape geographic space have been a major contributor to this
   geographic polarization. This article examines the effect of the
   Interstate Highway System, the largest public works project in American
   history, on this phenomenon. Drawing on a database of US highway
   construction since the passage of 1956 highway legislation, it shows
   that suburban Interstate highways made suburban counties less
   Democratic, especially in the South and where highways were built
   earlier. Metropolitan areas with denser Interstate networks also became
   more polarized. Analysis of the Youth-Parent Socialization Panel Study
   (1965-97) reveals individual-level mechanisms underlying these changes:
   Interstates drew more white and affluent residents, who tended to be
   Republican, to the suburbs.},

Journal = {PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS},

Volume = {68},
Number = {2},
Pages = {229-247},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Caretaker periods mark the transitions between the termination of one
   government and the formation of another. Caretaker conventions exist to
   ensure that the country is never left without a fully functioning
   executive, and to prevent a government whose democratic mandate has
   expired from making decisions that will inappropriately bind the
   incoming government. This article examines the UK's current caretaker
   conventions and argues that the UK is particularly vulnerable to
   problematic caretaker periods. Historically, its constitutional
   traditions and party system have made these periods short and rare. As a
   result, the conventions governing these transitional periods have
   remained underspecified. This article discusses why caretaker periods
   are likely to become more frequent and prolonged in the UK, analyses the
   UK's conventions and suggests how they can be reformed to pre-empt some
   of the challenges inherent to these constitutionally exceptional
   periods.},

Abstract = {Jihadist groups often select for attack targets such as brothels and
   casinos, which Salafi ideology considers places of sin. However, they
   adjust to the expectations of the local population. In doing so, they
   seek to boost their standing and secure the solidarity of other
   Salafists. Wherever they cannot assume that fatal attacks on
   ``sinful{''} (haram) targets will meet with acceptance, they put greater
   emphasis on ``re-education{''} than retribution. Weaker terrorist cells
   in particular avoid attacks where a massive response from security
   forces can be expected. Therefore, at their core, jihadist groups behave
   rationally, as the example of Dagestan shows.},

Abstract = {Existing research emphasizes how United Nations Security Council (UNSC)
   approval helps convey information to domestic audiences that military
   action is conducted with good intentions, for desirable consequences and
   in a legitimate manner. This information transmission mechanism can also
   increase support for UNSC-endorsed military action in countries unlikely
   to provide major contributions to military actions. There is some
   cross-national evidence supporting the information transmission
   mechanism in the United States. Examining the causal mechanisms
   underlying foreign public support for US military action through a
   survey experiment with approximately 2,000 respondents in Japan shows
   that foreign public support varies depending on whether the military
   action has UNSC approval. The process of presenting draft resolutions to
   the UNSC also affects public support.},

Title = {Changing motivations, time of the voting decision, and short-term
   volatility - The dynamics of voter heterogeneity},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {37},
Pages = {28-40},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The notion of ``voter heterogeneity{''} - that different voters decide
   according to different sets of choice criteria has become widely
   accepted. But while in a given election some voters are
   candidate-oriented and others are issue-oriented, little is known about
   the temporal dimension of heterogeneity: are candidate voters at t1 also
   candidate voters at t2? We argue that individual voters' motivations can
   change over time and expect that the extent of inter- as well as
   intra-individual heterogeneity impacts the process of individual
   decision-making. Using panel data collected in the run-up to the German
   Federal Election 2009 we demonstrate that certain choice motivations and
   intra-individual changes in these motivations lead to later vote
   decisions and contribute to the explanation of vote switching. (C) 2014

   Evidence From a Randomized Policy Experiment},

Abstract = {Do affirmative action measures for women in politics change the way
   constituents view and interact with their female representatives? A
   subnational randomized policy experiment in Lesotho with single-member
   districts reserved for female community councilors provides causal
   evidence to this question. Using survey data, I find that having a
   quota-mandated female representative either has no effect on or actually
   reduces several dimensions of women's self-reported engagement with
   local politics. In addition, implications from the policy experiment
   suggest that the quota effect is not accounted for by differences in
   qualifications or competence between the different groups of councilors,
   but rather stems from citizens' negative reactions to the quota's
   design.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the moderating effect of direct democracy on the
   relationship between socioeconomic status and electoral participation. A
   sceptical position holds that direct democracy increases social bias in
   the electorate as issues are too complex and demanding. Participatory
   democrats in contrast invoke an educative effect of direct democratic
   institutions, thus decreasing social bias within the electorate. To test
   both arguments we use data from the Swiss cantons and estimate
   cross-level interactions of socioeconomic and direct democracy variables
   on electoral participation. First differences between effects in the
   least and most direct democratic cantons are not statistically
   significant. This result may be seen as relief for sceptics as well as
   dampener for proponents of direct democracy.},

Abstract = {Non-democratic regimes have increasingly moved beyond merely suppressing
   online discourse, and are shifting toward proactively subverting and
   co-opting social media for their own purposes. Namely, social media is
   increasingly being used to undermine the opposition, to shape the
   contours of public discussion, and to cheaply gather information about
   falsified public preferences. Social media is thus becoming not merely
   an obstacle to autocratic rule but another potential tool of regime
   durability. I lay out four mechanisms that link social media co-optation
   to autocratic resilience: 1) counter-mobilization, 2) discourse framing,
   3) preference divulgence, and 4) elite coordination. I then detail the
   recent use of these tactics in mixed and autocratic regimes, with a
   particular focus on Russia, China, and the Middle East. This rapid
   evolution of government social media strategies has critical
   consequences for the future of electoral democracy and state-society
   relations.},

Abstract = {During the euro crisis policy-makers tried to re-establish credibility
   with austere budgets. Studies of austerity have been plagued by
   measurement and endogeneity problems. We provide a direct test of the
   effect of austerity on confidence by calculating the immediate impact of
   austere budgets on government bonds. We build a unique database of
   budget dates and conduct event studies of 223 (future) Eurozone budgets.
   Since austere budgets are enacted in particular circumstances, we use a
   treatment effects design to measure markets' responses. Our findings are
   discouraging for the argument that austerity can provide a positive
   credibility shock. Markets do not welcome austerity. On the contrary,
   austere budgets are associated with substantial interest rate increases.
   These results underline how constrained governments are in debt crises.},

Abstract = {Poverty and social exclusion are among the most persistent social
   challenges in Serbian society and some of the most prominent
   determinants of divisions nationwide. Progress in reducing poverty and
   social exclusion from 2002-2007 has been largely reversed by the
   aggravation of the economic situation since 2009. This aggravation is
   multidimensional and refers to financial deprivation, as well as
   employment, education and health indicators. This article focuses on the
   Roma population and persons with disabilities, two of the most
   disadvantaged groups within Serbian society. Their educational
   attainments, (un) employment rates, health, housing situation, and
   consequent poverty and social exclusion are presented within the context
   of state measures aimed at improving their position. The available data
   suggest that there are numerous shortcomings in the policies directed
   towards Roma and persons with disabilities, especially but not only in
   their implementation. One of the reasons for the failure of the full
   implementation of adopted measures is the presence of discriminatory
   attitudes towards these two groups.},

Pages = {91-109},

Abstract = {The opportunity structure framework has become a cornerstone of
   presidency research over the past generation. Yet the way scholars have
   construed opportunity structure has been too narrow. Where they have
   stressed the partisan regime context in which a president is situated,
   other contextual elements often weigh more heavily on a president's
   calculation of what he can and cannot do. Further, the regime context is
   relatively static within any administration, but the opportunity
   structure a president faces will change rapidly. These choices are often
   the consequence of a president's earlier actions. His choices will set
   in motion new forces to which he will later have to respond. The
   presidency of Dwight Eisenhower serves to illustrate the value of a
   broadened and more dynamic conception of the opportunity structure
   approach.},

Abstract = {Against democratic deficits of European Union (EU) governance, recent
   literature emphasizes the communicative function of national
   parliaments. Yet, arguments from the broader EU politicization
   literature have been only rarely applied to public parliamentary
   debates. This article integrates arguments about supranational authority
   and partisan competition as key drivers of debates on the EU and tests
   respective implications by an automated text analysis that retrieves EU
   references in all 1,393 plenary debates of the German Bundestag during
   1991-2013. A panel analysis identifies authority transfers as the
   strongest predictor for EU salience in the plenary. EU references
   furthermore increase with supranational policy output, public EU
   visibility, and a differentiating public opinion. With regard to
   partisan emphasis, mainstream and particularly governing parties push
   European issues in the German Bundestag.},

Abstract = {The federal government relies on states and localities to implement
   federal policy. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and
   Conservation Block Grant Program is one case in point. As a part of the
   American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), over \$3.2 billion was
   directed to local government energy efficiency and sustainability
   efforts. However, local governments have struggled to achieve timely
   implementation-one of the key goals of the program as specified by the
   federal government. We find that using contractors and the complications
   associated with using these third-party implementers influenced
   achievement of this federal goal. The insights for intergovernmental
   grant implementation derived from this analysis provide a foundation for
   integrating the fiscal federalism and contracting literatures into a
   broader theory of third-party federalism.},

Abstract = {Poietic attribute of critical theory does not reflect a phenomenological
   or hermeneutic character. Thus, critical poiesis does not convey to
   regenerate meaning or to apply an interpretation for mere understanding.
   Rather, critical poiesis might be defined as a skill of differentiation
   among already existing meanings. This study interprets critical theory
   by going through critical poiesis, unlike its traditional definition by
   dialectics of theory and practice. Critical theory is interpreted as a
   poietic perspective, which emerges between epokhal and hyper-epokhal
   ontological crises. Therefore, first, by focussing on its relation with
   epokhal ontological crisis, roots and evolution of critical theory is
   being interpreted. Second, this study discusses the question of the end
   and sequel of critical theory by the trace of today's hiperepokhal
   crisis.},

Title = {European patterns of participation - How dissatisfaction motivates
   extra-parliamentary activities given the right institutional conditions},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Abstract = {This article focuses on explaining the variation in extra-parliamentary
   activities, such as signing petitions, demonstrating, displaying badge
   stickers and boycotting products in 20 European Union (EU) countries.
   The main questions this article will deal with are: first, how feelings
   of dissatisfaction with the government and feelings of being member of a
   discriminated group affect the level of extra-parliamentary
   participation, and second, how different welfare regimes condition the
   extend to which these groups chose to act. In a comparative multilevel
   design, using data from the European Social Survey (ESS) Round 4 (2008),
   the article finds that satisfaction/dissatisfaction with the government
   is an important predictor alongside the institutional macro-level
   variable. The article combines a critical tradition, which suggests that
   political participation is motivated by a feeling of dissatisfaction
   with an institutional perspective in which certain institutional
   conditions are seen as enablers for citizens to actively participate in
   political life. Our results show that the overall level of
   extra-parliamentary activity in the Scandinavian countries is higher
   than in the other European welfare regimes and that the connection
   between dissatisfaction with the government and extra-parliamentary
   activity is stronger. The article concludes that the welfare state and
   the political system in the Scandinavian countries enable dissatisfied
   and discriminated groups of people to get engaged in extra-parliamentary
   activities to a greater extent than other EU countries.},

Title = {Does Electoral Competition Exacerbate Interethnic or Interpartisan
   Economic Discrimination? Evidence from a Field Experiment in Market
   Price Bargaining},

Abstract = {Does political competition exacerbate economic discrimination between
   citizens on ethnic or partisan cleavages? Individuals often discriminate
   on group lines in ordinary economic activities, especially in low-income
   settings. Political competition, and thus mobilization of partisan and
   ethnic groups, waxes and wanes over the electoral cycle. This study
   therefore investigates discrimination over the electoral cycle in a
   commonplace yet consequential economic activity: market price
   bargaining. By conducting field experiments on taxi fare bargaining at
   three points in time around Ghana's 2008 election, the research reveals
   that drivers accept lower prices from coethnics regardless of temporal
   proximity to the election. However, only at election time, drivers
   accept lower prices from copartisans and demand higher prices from
   noncopartisans. In sum, political competition affects commonplace
   economic transactions between citizens on the partisan cleavage. This
   study is the first to show evidence of interpartisan discrimination in
   everyday behavior and expands our knowledge of electoral cycle effects.},

Abstract = {The rise of China/East Asia and the perceived decline of the US/West
   pose an emerging question about how international relations (IR) theory
   should respond to this change. Increasingly, there have been heated
   discussions among Chinese IR academics over a desirable Chinese
   contribution to IR theory (IRT), particularly the possibility of
   building a distinctive Chinese IRT. Inevitably, this drive towards
   theorizing from a Chinese perspective also creates a backlash among not
   only Western but also other Chinese scholars as they question the
   `nationalistic' if not `hegemonic' discourse of the scholarship. Drawing
   on the sociology of scientific knowledge framework, this article
   examines the linkages between the vibrant dynamics of the Chinese
   theoretical debates and the actual practices of Chinese scholars in
   realizing their claims. It suggests that this investigation can serve as
   a springboard into a better appreciation of the theory-practice and
   power-knowledge relationships in the context of Chinese IR.},

Abstract = {Political trust is one of the most researched areas in political
   science. Yet little is known about what causes political trust to vary.
   Past research has relied almost solely on survey data, and focused on
   exploring the correlation between political trust and various micro- and
   macro-level factors. This research note reports the findings from an
   experiment designed to examine the causal effect of one of the most
   commonly cited causes of political trust: political probity. Results
   show that political trust and trust in specific institutions change when
   participants read an article about political probity and complete a
   word-association task. The treatment we used is low cost,
   straightforward and may be used by other researchers to alter political
   trust in experiments.},

Abstract = {Networks of trade union activists working as part of the global union
   movement have played a central role in political change in Myanmar. In
   response to trade union advocacy, compliance with International Labour
   Organization (ILO) standards was made a key condition for the lifting of
   sanctions on Myanmar, leading the current civilian government to pass
   revised labour laws allowing the formation of independent trade unions.
   Union activists have taken advantage of this new freedom, with a rapid
   growth in registration of local union organizations since 2011. Based on
   recent fieldwork in Myanmar, including interviews with union leaders and
   ILO officials, this paper presents an empirical analysis of political
   relationships formed by local and international union organizations in
   the context of multi-level political change. In this case study of
   translating international norms into domestic political change, local
   and international trade union networks are shown to have a significant
   impact on achieving compliance with international labour standards.},

Title = {Global citizenship as a national project: the evolution of segye
   shimin in South Korean public discourse},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-68},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {The idea of global citizenship in contemporary South Korean public
   discourse has revolved mainly around a national endeavor to boost the
   county's stature and competitiveness amid economic globalization. Based
   on a review of two decades of published media references to segye shimin
   ('global citizen' in the Korean language), this article shows that the
   specific usages of segye shimin - mainly by elites from government,
   academia, and journalism - underscore how the `developmental
   citizenship' that marked South Korea's past authoritarian military
   regimes has carried on since the transition to civilian-led democracy.
   In contrast with the burgeoning academic discourse on cosmopolitanism
   that focuses heavily on moral responsibilities to humanity and the
   planet, South Korea's discourse of global citizenship has been closely
   aligned with neoliberalism and filled with exhortations to the domestic

   the country's advancement. While global citizenship discourse in South
   Korea has emphasized top-down national strategic imperatives, a
   bottom-up approach to cosmopolitanism is also emerging as the country

Abstract = {This paper examines the domestic response to the Great East Japan
   Earthquake that occurred in March 2011. The demand to (re)build a new
   `community' in Japan was triggered by the fatal destruction of towns by
   the earthquake and the tsunami, and the uncertain future of these towns
   - and of Japan - due to the subsequent prolonged crisis at the Fukushima
   Daiichi nuclear power plant. Drawing on the political theory of Jean-Luc
   Nancy, the paper examines what kinds of communities were realised in the
   aftermath of the disaster. It argues that two distinctively different
   types of communities emerged. The first type of community was based on
   the inside/outside logic, whereby Japan was imagined as one unified
   entity surrounded by a boundary which separated the safe inside from the
   dangerous outside. The second type of community was based on sharing.
   Immigrants in Japan identified themselves with the survivors since both
   of them shared the experience of losing home and the same home (called
   Japan). In this way, the immigrants challenged the idea of community as
   one unified entity and realised a new form of community.},

Volume = {33},

Abstract = {The literature on article 14 of the European Convention of Human Rights
   (ECHR) has identified how recent case law on its scope ratione materiae
   seems unclear and conflicting, and how this could indicate a change of
   approach whereby some discrimination grounds would be excluded from
   protection altogether. After describing this case law against the
   background of settled doctrine, this article moves on to exhibit how it
   is also accompanied by an undercurrent towards a subtle change in
   analytical approach, which seems to be taking hold irrespective of
   whether a clear narrowing of the scope of article 14 ratione materiae
   will take place. The article is critical of these trends, and asks why
   the changes described have occurred at this point in time in the life of
   the Convention. Placing current developments in context, it suggests
   three key explanatory factors related to the reform of the Strasbourg
   Court and calls for the gradual convergence between the Strasbourg and
   Luxembourg jurisprudence. In conclusion it is argued that the
   developments discussed exemplify the pitfalls of the current process of
   reengineering the European system for the protection of human rights,
   and how each step the Strasbourg Court takes in pursuance of the aims of
   the reform process must be accompanied by careful judicial reflection.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the role of racial bias in the implementation of
   capital punishment. First, our analysis of existing literature confirms
   higher rates of capital punishment for those who kill Whites,
   particularly for Blacks who kill Whites. Second, we compare homicide
   victim data with a newly collected data set including information on the
   victims of every inmate executed in the USA from 1976 through 2013, some
   1369 executions. These data reveal that Black males have been the
   primary victims of homicides, but their killers are much less likely to
   be put to death. While previous scholars have emphasized the
   over-representation of killers of White women, we shed additional light
   on another aspect of the racial and gender biases of the US death
   penalty. Capital punishment is very rarely used where the victim is a
   Black male, despite the fact that this is the category most likely to be
   the victim of homicide.},

Abstract = {Noting the insights to be gained from Wolff and Resnick's lucid and
   insightful comparative explication of neoclassical, Keynesian, and
   Marxian economic theories, this paper reflects on new theories of human
   behavior in late neoclassical theory that open doors to socially
   contingent understandings of subjectivity. In their Contending Economic
   Theories, Wolff and Resnick illustrate that different methodologies and
   entry points matter with respect to understanding crucial social issues
   such as income distribution, poverty, capitalism, and the class
   composition of profits. They offer an avenue for appreciating the
   nature, conditions, and consequences of class processes without
   insisting on a totalizing ontology, centered subjects, or economism.
   This approach to Marxian class analytics is compatible with many
   insights of poststructuralist feminism and, as exemplified by the work
   of many within AESA, has provided fertile ground for a reinvigorated
   class politics interested in proliferating differences that enable
   alternative class, gender, sexual, and racial ways of being.},

Abstract = {Ethiopia's federal design has a number of anomalies interesting for
   comparative federalism. The explicit right to secede provided to member
   states has become, however, real political dynamite in the country. This
   article deals with this right, its constitutionalization, its
   constitutional and ideological underpinnings, and its practical impacts
   on federal construction in the country for the last two decades. It
   challenges the political expediency views on its constitutionalization
   and argues that the inclusion of the right in the federal constitution
   is motivated by ideological reasons. By having a look at the powers
   member states are provided by this `generous' constitution, it reveals
   its staggering paradoxes. As far as the practical impacts of the right
   are concerned, the hefty controversy the constitutionalization of the
   right has continued creating in the country, the article argues, is a
   significant federal nuisance.},

Abstract = {Research on central bank independence (CBI) focuses overwhelmingly on
   domestic causes and consequences. We consider CBI in relation to global
   finance. A first step links decisions to reform central bank legislation
   to a perceived need to attract capital in the form of foreign direct
   investment or sovereign borrowing. A second step models investors'
   actual decisions as a function of CBI. We test our argument on a sample
   of 78 countries (1974-2007). Logit models investigate the determinants
   of central bank reform. Results show the effect of international capital
   through a direct-competition channel and through learning in the context
   of competition. Socialization of countries in networks of
   intergovernmental organizations is also a determinant of CBI reform. In
   addition, we show that CBI affects the flow and cost of capital in
   non-OECD countries, before CBI became globally widespread, and where
   political institutions allow the central bank to de facto be credible.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {80-94},
Abstract = {In recent years, state inefficiency in delivering some public goods to
   everyone has been the major argument set forth by those who argue that
   markets should play a more active role in providing those goods and
   services that are needed to secure human rights. Despite the relative
   consensus that markets cannot substitute the state, in many parts of the
   world pressures have been felt for privatising social security and water
   distribution, for example. This article argues that markets do not speak
   the same language as human rights and therefore reinforces that they are
   not fully prepared to play the role of a supplier of goods and services
   as human rights, and specifically of the rights to social security and
   to water. There are three essential reasons for that. First, markets do
   not state social preferences; second, they are not accountable; and
   finally, they are ineffective. In essence, markets commodify human
   rights and while filling them with exchange value they empty them of
   political significance.},

Abstract = {Does it matter that working-class citizens are numerically
   underrepresented in political offices throughout the world? For decades,
   the conventional wisdom in comparative politics has been that it does
   not, that lawmakers from different classes think and behave roughly the
   same in office. In this article, we argue that this conclusion is
   misguided. Past research relied on inappropriate measures of
   officeholders' class backgrounds, attitudes, and choices. Using data on
   18 Latin American legislatures, we show that lawmakers from different
   classes bring different economic attitudes to the legislative process.
   Using data on one least likely case, we also show that pre-voting
   decisions like sponsoring legislation often differ dramatically along
   social class lines, even when political parties control
   higher-visibility decisions like roll-call votes. The unequal numerical
   or descriptive representation of social classes in the world's
   legislatures has important consequences for the substantive
   representation of different class interests.},

Abstract = {Retrospective voting models assume that offering more information to
   voters about their incumbents' performance strengthens electoral
   accountability. However, it is unclear whether incumbent corruption
   information translates into higher political participation and increased
   support for challengers. We provide experimental evidence that such
   information not only decreases incumbent party support in local
   elections in Mexico, but also decreases voter turnout and support for
   the challenger party, as well as erodes partisan attachments. While
   information clearly is necessary to improve accountability, corruption
   information is not sufficient because voters may respond to it by
   withdrawing from the political process. We conclude with a discussion of
   the implications of our findings for studies of voting behavior.},

Abstract = {This article argues that political science in Argentina is expanding.
   Between 2005 and 2014 its development as a discipline and social
   relevance have grown. We base our argument on an examination of
   enrollment and graduation data, a selection and analysis of books, a
   bibliometric analysis of journals and a survey of the presence of
   political scientists in politics. In spite of unavoidable internal
   debates, political science in Argentina is undergoing its best moment
   ever.},

Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},

Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {30-55},
Abstract = {The post-genocide Rwandan government is simultaneously characterized as
   heroes in regional peacekeeping operations and violent criminals in the
   Democratic Republic of Congo. An analysis of the Kagame regime's reasons
   for contributing to African peace operations reconciles these
   contradictory images. Following the logic of extraversion, the Rwandan
   government's peacekeeping activities are an instrument for mollifying
   Western donors without terminating interference in the Congo.
   Peacekeeping showcases a strategic manipulation of international norms
   rather than a commitment to humanitarianism. The strategy has proven
   successful for the Rwandan government, improving the regime's diplomatic
   standing and increasing their access to military aid and training.},

   Examination of Two UK Political Parties},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},

Volume = {14},
Number = {1-2, SI},
Pages = {19-34},
Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to review the notion of branding and
   evaluate its applicability to political parties. As ideological politics
   is in decline, branding may provide a consistent narrative where voters
   feel a sense of warmth and belonging. The paper aims to build an
   understanding of the complexity of building a political brand where a
   combination of image, logo, leadership, and values can all contribute to
   a compelling brand narrative. It investigates how competing positive and
   negative messages attempt to build and distort the brand identity. A
   critical review of branding, relationship marketing, and political
   science literature articulates the conceptual development of branding
   and its applicability to political parties. The success or failure of
   negative campaigning is due to the authenticity of a political party's
   brand values-creating a coherent brand story-if there is no distance
   between the brand values articulated by the political party and the
   values their community perceives then this creates an ``authentic''
   brand. However, if there is a gap this paper illustrates how negative
   campaigning can be used to build a ``doppelganger brand,'' which
   undermines the credibility of the authentic political brand. The paper
   argues that political parties need to understand how brand stories are
   developed but also how they can be used to protect against negative
   advertising. This has implications for political marketing strategists
   and political parties. This paper draws together branding theory and
   relationship marketing and incorporates them into a framework that makes
   a contribution to the political marketing literature.},

Abstract = {Within the European Union (EU), security issues are increasingly framed
   as risks and threats that can be controlled by preventive measures. The
   eu has established several agencies, legal instruments and databases to
   facilitate the prevention of crime, terrorism and irregular migration.
   This article takes stock of the way in which the eu seeks to balance the
   preventive security logic with its own human rights framework. While
   human rights can jointly be considered an evolving normative framework
   in the eu, there is a need to identify which human rights are at risk
   and how (non-) compliance ought to be monitored.
   The article states some concerns about equal access to human rights as
   well as the lack of a strong general oversight mechanism. Continued
   structural attention should be given to ex ante human-rights impact
   assessments and there needs to be more emphasis on regular external
   evaluations of human rights compliance ex post facto. In relation to the
   external action of the eu, the eu must practice what it preaches and
   needs to reflect critically on the necessity and proportionality of
   precautionary security measures.},

   Micromanagement of Its Contentious State-Society Relations},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom holds that economic modernization would lead to
   political liberalization and, eventually, democracy. However, China has
   been an exception to that prediction. China's information revolution,
   the rapid popularization of information and communication technology
   (ICT) at its core, has brought two important changes to the country's
   state-society relations. First, the skillful diffusion of thought
   through ICT and the resulting openness of information have led to
   decentralization of information and diversification of public opinion in
   Chinese society. Second, savvy handling of communications through ICT
   has transformed the organization and forms of political mobilization and
   participation in Chinese politics. While China's political system is
   becoming increasingly unstable and repressive, it is imperative for the
   Chinese government to control the political outcomes of the country's
   dramatic economic and social transformation. Through conceptual
   discussions, policy analyses, and case studies, this article
   investigates why China's authoritarian government has been able to
   handle the ICT-related changes and manage the challenges generated by
   the country's rapidly evolving state-society relations in the digital
   age.},

Abstract = {Research on women candidates in the USA often considers the role that
   attitudes toward women in politics can play in shaping the electoral
   success of these candidates. However, besides anecdotal information
   about reactions to individual candidates, we lack systematic data that
   allow us to examine whether there is a link between the attitudes voters
   have about women in politics and their vote choice decisions when they
   are faced with a woman candidate. Relying on data from a two-wave panel
   survey of 3150 US adults in 2010, we test whether the political
   attitudes people hold are related to their voting decisions in mixed-sex
   ( woman vs. man) races for the House of Representatives. We consider the
   role of attitudes alongside traditional political forces such as
   political party and incumbency and examine whether the party of the
   woman candidate is relevant. In all, we find that some attitudes about
   women in politics are related to voting for women candidates, but the
   relationships are not a central influence.},

Abstract = {Following several decades during which violent civil conflict was common
   in African countries, the period from 1990 onwards was marked by a
   spreading and deepening of adherence to democratic principles.
   Nonetheless, many African countries still experience political
   instability and civil unrest. This raises the question of why these
   countries have not succeeded in resolving conflict in a sustainable
   manner. Drawing on economic ideas about contracts and institutions, this
   paper outlines a conceptual framework for thinking about the role of
   constitutional rules in achieving political stability. It also
   elucidates a critical requirement for sustainable democratic systems,
   namely that constitutional rules must become self-sustaining to
   safeguard such systems and to avoid relapses into violent civil
   conflict. The experiences of selected African countries are presented as
   brief case studies that illustrate the relevance of the conceptual
   framework and the notion of self-enforcing constitutional rules.},

Abstract = {The definition of political party has been one of the great themes in
   political science since the conversion of our discipline in the second
   half of the twentieth century. These conceptualizations have helped
   develop several theories dedicated to interpreting, explaining and
   classifying different party systems. The intellectual effort from
   political science has clashed with other conceptualizations from other
   related disciplines such as Law. The reasons leading to this disconnect
   between political science and legal definitions could be several.
   However, the consequences for the political system are clear. The
   article presents a case study from the Guatemalan political system. The
   article shows the problems associated with the conceptualization of the
   figure of political party. It is note that the legal definition raises
   the costs of participation hindering citizens access to public
   institutions. Our text presents the elements that Guatemalan
   organizations must possess to become parties. In addition, the paper
   evidences as such requirements not only raise such cost of
   participation, but also reduce competition by limiting the action of
   alternative actors -called comites civicos- which could strive
   presenting national candidates and thereby contribute to the
   revitalization of the electoral competitive structure in the country.
   The conclusion we reach is that Guatemalan political system presents a
   clear dissonance between the political science definition of political
   party and the legal definition. Therefore, the cost of participation
   raises and thus limits the overall level of competition within the
   system},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {This article explores two critical approaches to the study of the
   continuing relevance of the North-South divide. One is based on a
   postcolonial politics of difference and stresses the fundamental
   geographic divergences between the North and South. The other, referred
   to as the global capitalism school, argues that the North-South divide
   is rendered obsolete by social divisions, represented by the rise of a
   transnational capitalist class. I criticize the former due to its
   dismissal of the idea of capitalism as a universal force. In regards to
   the latter, to determine whether the primary fault line in global
   capitalism revolves around transnationally organized classes, I conduct
   an interpretive analysis of the world views of capitalist elites in
   Latin America. My findings demonstrate the complex, intersecting nature
   of different axes of identity, and contradict this literature by
   suggesting the continuing relevance of a place-based North-South divide.
   In other words, neither position can by itself elucidate the contours of
   our contemporary global economic system. What I propose is a framework
   that captures the intersectionality between the social and geographic
   within a universal story of capitalist globalization. The key is to
   conceptualize how global capitalism operates as a universalizing force,
   but not a homogenizing one.},

Abstract = {During the last decades, the devolution of many political powers from
   the state to the local governments has strengthened the role of the
   Italian municipalities in the provision of rights both for citizens and
   non citizens. As a consequence of this decentralization process, many
   rights recognized by the national laws can be concretely exercised only
   at the local level. The bond between the individuals and the territory,
   thus, has become increasingly important. This bond is formally embodied
   by the legal institute of residency - that is the enrolment into the
   registry office of a municipality -, given that, according to the
   Italian laws, the actual access to many rights is restricted to whom is
   enrolled. It is not a surprising fact, therefore, that, during the last
   years, many Mayors have tried to restrict the access to residency by
   means of administrative provisions as well as through informal
   practices. Migrants are the main target of these exclusionary
   strategies. For this reason, the local control on the enrolment
   increases the level of civic stratification: besides the legal status,
   also the ownership of residency fragments the local population in
   different strata. Against the local exclusion provoked by the Mayors'
   strategies, the idea of ethical territoriality suggested by Lynda
   Bosniak could work as a critical tool. More specifically, this idea
   could be invoked as a normative principle to claim rights and
   recognition at the local level. At the same time, a local perspective
   could make this principle more operational: starting from the local
   territories, the claim for rights and recognition can become more
   concrete and be extended to the national level.},

Abstract = {Bartels and Johnston have recently presented evidence suggesting that
   the legitimacy of the U.S. Supreme Court is grounded in the ideological
   preferences and perceptions of the American people. In addition, they
   offer experimental data purporting to show that dissatisfaction with a
   single Court decision substantially diminishes the institution's
   legitimacy. These findings strongly break with earlier research on the
   Court's institutional support, as the authors recognize. The theoretical
   implications of their findings are profound. If the authors are correct
   that legitimacy is strongly dependent upon satisfying the policy
   preferences and ideological predilections of the American people, the
   essence of legitimacy is fundamentally transformed. Consequently, we
   reinvestigate the relationships among ideology, performance
   satisfaction, and Court legitimacy, unearthing empirical findings that
   diverge markedly from theirs. We conclude with some thoughts about how
   the Court's countermajoritarian dilemma can be reconceptualized and
   recalculated, once more drawing conclusions sharply at odds with those
   of Bartels and Johnston.},

   and Business in the European Commission Expert Groups},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {151-165},
Abstract = {The elaborate system of expert groups that the European Commission
   organises is a key feature of EU everyday governance and also a
   potential channel of societal involvement in EU policy making. This
   article examines the patterns of participation in the expert group
   system of a broad set of societal actors-NGOs, social partners/unions,
   consumer organisations, and business/enterprise. The analysis is based
   on a large-N study of Commission expert groups. Taking on an ``executive
   politics{''} perspective, we identify main patterns of participation and
   analyse organisational factors that affect the inclusion of societal
   actors in the expert group system. We find that such actors are strongly
   involved in this system. Yet, there is a striking heterogeneity in the
   extent to which the Commission's administrative units include societal
   groups as experts in the policy process. The logics that underpin the
   inclusion of business organisations are not identical to the logics of
   inclusion applied to social partners and NGOs. The Commission as the
   core supranational executive is thus selectively open for societal
   involvement in its expert groups system, and this bureaucratic openness
   is patterned, clustered, and conditioned by structural factors that
   affect how the Commission as a multi-organisation operates.},

Abstract = {In its Decalogue, the Final Act of the Conference on Security and
   Co-operation in Europe reflects the centrality of the territorial
   settlement to public order in Europe. It also reflects the hope that
   human rights will become more deeply entrenched across all state parties
   to the Act. The intertwining of territorial provisions and human rights
   was no mere coincidence: it was at the heart of the compromise that
   enabled the parties to agree to the text as adopted. The events of
   2014-in particular the forcible seizure of Ukrainian territory-raise
   questions as to the continuing vitality of the compromise that was
   reached in 1975 and long maintained. The new foreign policy of the
   Russian Federation, by embracing a potentially far-ranging irredentism,
   places the territorial idea of the Final Act under stress.
   Simultaneously, a new domestic policy rejects not only the
   enforceability of human rights at the international level but also the
   applicability of human-rights obligations in the national legal order.
   The new foreign and domestic policies in Russia have emerged in tandem.
   Their relation to each other must be considered if their effect on
   public order is to be understood.},

Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {226-241},
Abstract = {This article examines Bangladesh in the context of the debate over the
   conditions under which Islamist groups are likely to subvert democracy
   or to be transformed by the democratic process. Bangladesh signals two
   conditions that play an important role. The first is the role of
   governments in promoting religion as a source of national identity.
   Successive governments in Bangladesh have consistently moved away from
   the promise of secularism that underpinned the creation of the country.
   The danger of establishing political legitimacy on the basis of religion
   is the absence of any authoritative interpretation of what religion
   requires in terms of public policy and how it can coexist with basic
   liberal freedoms and human rights. The second condition is the role of
   the government in providing and adequately regulating basic public goods
   such as education.},

Abstract = {The literature on the resource curse suggests that countries with large
   natural resource rents and weak institutions may experience rent seeking
   conflicts among different groups, potentially resulting in high
   inequality and welfare losses. While agricultural land has so far been
   categorized as a diffuse resource with low economic value, this
   categorization may no longer be appropriate, because demand for land is
   currently on the rise, and may continue to increase in the future. This
   study presents and discusses recent theoretical and empirical approaches
   to analyzing the effects of high-value agricultural land on rent seeking
   and rent distribution. Results suggest that the potential for small
   scale farmers to organize and obtain political power determines the
   extent of rent seeking and rent distribution, and that while more
   democratic institutions may increase the share of rents going to the
   farmers, they may have adverse welfare effects, because they may
   increase the competition for rents among groups, and hence the amount of
   resources spent on rent seeking.},

Abstract = {In the twenty-first century, two key frameworks have emerged by which to
   understand the dynamics and tendencies of the world system: one which
   sees a consolidation of U.S. hegemony and another which sees the
   emergence of a multipolar architecture of competing centers of capital
   accumulation. Radhika Desai's Geopolitical Economy offers a
   comprehensive, persuasive, and clearly argued case for the latter.
   Highlighting the framework of uneven and combined development (UCD) to
   explain the emergence of new centers of capital accumulation, Desai
   argues that U.S. imperial domination was never as complete or durable as
   often claimed, that its empire was only a shadow of the unique
   domination of the world system once exercised by the British, and that
   this is a definitively new era of multipolar capitalism; old categories
   such as ``globalization{''} and ``empire{''} need to be critically
   reexamined and in some cases discarded. This essay surveys Desai's case
   and adds evidence.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2015},
Number = {6},
Pages = {131-143},
Abstract = {Why is the disavowal of the problems of building a civic nation
   accompanied by growing attention to the issue of ``Russian ethnicity{''}
   characterize the dominating discourse in polyethnic, polycultural,
   polyconfessional Russian Federation, where the prerequisites for
   successful civic nation-building exist along with the rising danger of
   ethnic nationalism? How real is the project of civic nation-building is
   Russia and could the national integration be achieved in Russia - a
   country of ethnic, cultural and religious diversity? This article is an
   attempt to answer these questions. Among the key obstacles to conversion
   to the rhetoric (and practice) of building the civic nation of Russians
   are the understanding of the term ``nation{''} as an ethnolinguistic or
   ethnocultural substance and the essentialist conception of the
   phenomenon of nation specific for Russian political, media, educational
   and academic discourses. ``Ethnitisation{''} and ``essentialisation{''}
   of the concept of nation embody in the practices of ethnic, cultural and
   religious diversity management based on two statements: for the survival
   of an ethnolinguistic, ethnocultural or ethnoreligious group ``its
   own{''} nation-state is needed; the stability of a nation-state requires
   ethnolinguistic, ethnocultural and ethnoreligious homogeneity. The
   analysis of the egalitarian and multiculturalist approaches towards the
   issue of national integration in the society of diversity allows
   examining the possibility of implementation of the project of Russian
   nation that involves civic integration along with protection of ethnic,
   cultural and religious multiplicity. Such an implementation requires
   alteration of public discussions on ``national{''}, which implies
   discursive renunciation of: reduction of ``nation{''} to ``ethnicity{''}
   and essentialist approach to apprehension the phenomenon of nation;
   representation of political, economic, social problems in terms of
   ethnicity, culture, confession; rhetoric of dominance aimed at
   delineating of ``state-constituting{''} ethnic, cultural, religious
   group.},

Abstract = {Production, distribution, and consumption of digital use values occur
   today in a sociotechnological setting quite different from that
   characterizing the industrial economic system. Thanks to increasing
   access to hardware, software, and the Internet-the means of production
   in the digital economy-a growing multitude of digital immaterial labors
   contributes to the digital economy within a culture of sharing and (a
   culture of) nonexclusionary use of resources. As various online sharing
   platforms illustrate, digital immaterial labor constitutes a collective
   and collaborative productive force, an online general intellect, that
   cannot be reified in the means of production traditionally under the
   control of capital. This dynamic allows the online multitude to organize
   itself independently of the logic and management of capital. Capital,
   however, has been able to develop strategies, peculiar to this new
   socioeconomic system, that aim to control and profit from the collective
   intelligence created by digital immaterial labor.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the Europeanisation of EP election manifestos
   prepared by Slovak political parties over the course of Slovakia's
   decade-long membership in the European Union. To this aim, it conducts a
   content analysis based upon a novel coding scheme in which
   Europeanisation is measured primarily as EU issue salience and
   secondarily as the discussion of different EU-related (policy) issue
   areas. The results show that, in contrast to election manifestos
   prepared for other elections, the salience of EU issues is quite high in
   these Euromanifestos. On the other hand, average relative EU issue
   salience has decreased with each EP election held in the country. In
   terms of party EU political agenda, we provide evidence of relatively
   high convergence in terms of party EU political agenda, measured as the
   five most prominent issue categories in individual party Euromanifestos,
   particularly in 2004 and 2014. We also show that the five most prominent
   issue categories in the party EU political agenda represent almost half
   the natural sentences referring to the EU political level in the
   Euromanifestos analysed.},

Title = {Party Politics Triumph over Substantive Scrutiny and Principled Policy:
   Examining CzechMPs' Voting Behaviour in Regard to EU Affairs},
Journal = {NEW PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {97-125},
Abstract = {The paper deals with the European dimension of the competition and
   contention between Czech political parties and argues that domestic
   party interests undermine the formal oversight of EU politics by the
   Czech national parliament. Within the current institutional
   arrangements, national political parties assume stances - which are
   expressed through voting - towards the European Union (and European
   integration as such) as they act in the arena of national parliaments
   that are supposed to make the EU more accountable in its activities.
   Based on an analysis of roll-calls, the paper focuses on the ways the
   political parties assume their stances towards the EU and how the
   parties check this act by voting on EU affairs. The paper examines
   factors that should shape parties' behaviour (programmes, positions in
   the party system, and public importance of EU/European integration
   issues). It also focuses on party expertise in EU/European issues and
   asserts that EU/European integration issues are of greater importance in
   extra-parliamentary party competition than inside the parliament,
   suggesting a democratic disconnect between voters and parliamentary
   behaviour. The study's empirical analysis of the voting behaviour of
   Czech MPs also shows that the parliamentary scrutiny introduced by the
   Lisbon Treaty is undermined by party interests within the system.},

Abstract = {The critical essay considers from a point of view of a political
   scientist how biopolitics (in nutrition sphere) reflects sociocultural
   development of the world. Focusing on the studies by a prominent
   sociologist Sergey Kravchenko (Kravchenko S.A Sotsiokulturnaya dinamika
   edy: riski, uyazvimosti, vostrebovannoct gumanisticheskoi biopolitiki
   {[}Socio-Cultural Dynamics of Food: Risks, Vulnerabilities, Demand for
   Humanistic Biopolitics]. Moscow: MGIMO-University. 2014. 128 p.) the
   changes in the sphere of biopolitics in the contemporary world are
   discussed. On one hand, in the field of food production, one can observe
   the expansion of the assembly line as it occurs in other fields of
   production. On the other hand, in food production and consumption, such
   phenomena as `Coca-colonization' and `bananization', described by Sergey
   Kravchenko, are also observed. All of these mean deviation from national
   traditions, and even more - it turns into a challenge. Agreeing with
   Sergey Kravchenko on the necessity to make use of the humanistic
   approach in the sphere of biopolitics, the author of the essay proposes
   to consider this approach as part of global governance. For this
   purpose, the initiation of a series of negotiations is proposed.},

Title = {MYTH AS A CATEGORY OF SYMBOLIC POLITICS: ANALYSIS OF THEORETICAL
   JUNCTIONS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2015},
Number = {4},
Pages = {12-21},
Abstract = {The article describes theoretical junctions revealed by different
   definitions and usages of the concept ``political myth{''}. It argues
   that the main difficulty results from the fact that ``myth{''} is a
   ``universal{''} social phenomenon that is rather ``particular{''} in its
   manifestation: it is fundamental for any society, but its ``work{''}
   depends on perception of specific groups in concrete contexts. The
   article considers theoretical discussions about a narrative nature of
   contemporary myths, their exclusively verbal or non-verbal form, about
   arrangement of mythical comprehension of reality and mechanisms of
   mythologization, about connections between myths and ideologies. However
   most scholars agree that about capability to be shared and perceived as
   ``a natural order of things{''} should be considered a key
   characteristic of any myth. This category is fundamental for analysis of
   symbolic politics. However its heuristic potential depends on a
   particular research focus. In the frame of narrower approach that
   considers symbolic politics as a ``constructivist{''} activity of
   political elites aimed at manipulation of mass consciousness ``the
   myth{''} comes as a category of political practice; it points to
   ``artificial{''}, simulating character of the constructed signs. While a
   wider approach viewing symbolic politics as a social production of
   competing ways of interpretation of reality and struggle for their
   domination opens a perspective for considering myth as communicative
   process that involves both mythmakers and their auditory. It makes focus
   on a study of both political and semantic conditions that make
   particular myth a ``lens{''} that determines perception of reality. So,
   myth turns to be both category of practice in symbolic politics and
   instrument of its analysis which makes the work with this term rather
   complicated.},

Abstract = {This paper examines whether candidates in Japanese local elections are
   more likely to declare affiliation with parties as the population size
   of districts increases, and thus the importance of party reputations and
   resources for mobilization increases. To test this hypothesis, we use
   data from Japanese municipal legislative elections between 1999 and 2010
   where the vast majority of candidates run as independents. We exploit
   variations in the population size of districts before and after massive
   municipal mergers. We find that the percentage of candidates affiliated
   with political parties increased when the number of votes required for
   winning a seat increased as a result of municipal mergers. Our analysis
   also finds that candidates in municipalities that merged were more
   likely to join parties, compared to those in municipalities that did not
   experience mergers.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {131-148},
Abstract = {Van Parijs's Linguistic Justice for Europe and the World furthers a
   nascent examination of multilingualism within political philosophy,
   drawing on continental European contexts where multilingualism is the
   norm. Van Parijs argues, in effect for linguistic cosmopolitanism via
   English as the current world language, and this seems ostensibly to be a
   considerable improvement on `the untrammeled public monolingualism' of
   Anglo-American political theory. However, Van Parijs's account is flawed
   in four key respects. First, there is the fundamental problem of his
   reductionist account of language by which language is viewed only in
   terms of its communicative uses and reach and not in relation to its
   symbolic and identity functions. Second is his simplistic advocacy of
   English as a global lingua franca, which ignores issues of power and
   inequality, along with related delimited access to highstatus English
   language varieties. Third are the inherent limitations associated with
   his advocacy of linguistic territoriality, which recognizes
   statesanctioned languages but little else, thus failing to mitigate
   existing linguistic hierarchies. Finally, the wider argument for English
   as a global lingua franca is inevitably underpinned by a
   monolithic/hegemonic view of English itself. This monolithic conception
   of English stands in contradistinction, not only to the actual plethora
   of Englishes in the world today, but also, more importantly, to their
   widely varying status and use in furthering cross-communication and
   related notions of social and economic mobility. The latter thus fatally
   undermines Van Parijs's central argument linking social and economic
   mobility ineluctably to access to English.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to provide a better understanding of why
   some countries experience mass atrocities during periods of democratic
   transition, while others do not. Scholars have long regarded democracy
   as an important source of stability and protection from mass atrocities
   such as genocide, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. But
   democratic transition itself is fraught with the heightened risk of
   violent conflict and even mass atrocities. Indeed, a number of studies
   have identified regimes in transition as containing the highest risk of
   political instability and mass atrocities. What is overlooked is the
   question of how and why some regimes undergo such transitions without
   experiencing mass atrocities, despite the presence of a number of
   salient risk factors, including state-based discrimination, inter-group
   tension and horizontal inequality. Utilizing a new analytical framework,
   this article investigates this lacuna by conducting a comparative
   analysis of two countries-one that experienced atrocities (Burundi)
   during transition, and one that did not (Guyana). How countries avoid
   such violence during transition has the potential to yield insights for
   the mitigation of risk associated with mass atrocity crimes.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {40-56},
Abstract = {G.A. Cohen criticizes Rawls's account of justice because his difference
   principle permits inequalities that reflect the relative scarcity of
   different skills and natural abilities. Instead of viewing the `basic
   structure' as the primary subject of justice, Cohen argues that
   individual citizens should cultivate an egalitarian ethos, which would
   enable a just society to dispense with the use of incentive payments to
   induce individuals to use their talents in socially ideal ways. This
   study examines Cohen's critique, including his rejection of
   `incentives,' and vindicates Rawls's approach. Ultimately, Cohen's
   argument fails to grapple with the moral pluralism that characterizes
   modern, democratic societies, whereas Rawls's theory is constructed to
   accommodate such pluralism.},

Abstract = {Scholarship has identified the centrality of civil society organizations
   in the cultural/political debate over what should be remembered and why.
   The article analyses the narratives of 25 human rights activists from
   Argentina organized in response to the 1976-1983 military regime.
   Inspired by gender and postcolonial scholarship, the article explores
   how notions of family are named and dilemmas regarding who and what to
   be remembered are understood in the struggle for `Memory, Truth, and
   Justice'.},

Volume = {35},

Pages = {19-31},
Abstract = {The years between 2005 and 2014 were one of the best decades of
   political science (PS) in Brazil. The growth of the economy, the
   consequent increase in public spending on universities and scientific
   activity in general, and the policies pursued by the Ministry of
   Education played a key role in bringing this outcome about. Effective
   collective action within the Brazilian PS community was also a vital
   contributing factor. Consequently, Brazilian PS is now closer to the
   potential generated by the country's population and economy, as far as
   the Latin American context is concerned. In addition, the discipline has
   been nationalized, and its research agenda is now less parochial
   nowadays. On the negative side, however, the output of Brazilian
   political scientists still stands out for its relatively low
   international visibility. Moreover, Brazilian PS remains characterized
   by a scarce systematic application of well thought-out qualitative
   methods. Finally, a considerable uncertainty over the resources
   available to the discipline has recently surfaced, given the years of
   fiscal adjustment lying ahead.},

Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4, SI},
Abstract = {From 6 to 9 November, 2006, a group of experts finalised the text of the
   Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of international Human Rights
   Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity. The
   Principles have garnered praise for enshrining the rights of persons of
   diverse sexual orientations and gender identities. Yet, they have also
   attracted critique as to their improvement beyond what some have
   described as radial and aspiration vision. The present article assesses
   the Principles in the light of almost a decade of experience. It seeks
   to determine the extent of the Principles impact, legal rigour, and
   engagement with actual lived experience. The article discusses the
   backdrop of the Principles, recalls their purpose and contents before
   moving on to a reflection on, inter alia, their influence at the
   national and regional levels in addition to that within the UN system.
   It concludes that a substantial revision of the text is not yet
   required, but rather, a better appreciation of the application of the
   Principles is needed.},

Abstract = {This paper considers the way of investigation of stolicnost'
   (capitalness) phenomenon on the ground of analysis of entity's spatial
   position by forming schemes of spatial patterns (configurations) (by the
   S. V. Rogachyov's method). This approach complements necessary, but
   insufficient way of stolicnost' (capitalness) studying through identity
   concept. It implies using interpretation of space stage (in research
   design) which promotes more detail consideration of phenomenon. Also
   there were analyzed spatial patterns (configurations) of Staraya Ladoga,
   which were given appropriate assessment.},

Title = {The Impact of Online versus Offline Campaign Information on Citizens'
   Knowledge, Attitudes and Political Behaviour: Comparing the German
   Federal Elections of 2005 and 2009},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {507-524},
Abstract = {Against the background of the debate about how the internet changes
   democratic processes, this article assesses the impact of online versus
   offline campaign information on citizens' knowledge, attitudes and
   political behaviour using data from two pre-/post-election surveys
   conducted at the German federal elections in 2005 and 2009. Our results
   show that sophisticated and less sophisticated citizens alike gain
   knowledge when using online information. Moreover, we find that people
   exposed to online information develop less ambivalent attitudes towards
   candidates and parties but do not take on more extreme issue positions.
   Online information is ineffective in stimulating turnout but compared to
   traditional news media, the internet gives smaller parties the chance to
   gain votes. We conclude that overall online information can enhance
   election campaigns. However, the amount of change should not be
   overstated as the effects are similar to those of offline political
   information and depend on the campaign context.},

   and statements of different politicians concerned. The results of the

Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {49},
Number = {3},
Pages = {85+},
Abstract = {The Lisbon Treaty introduced the Early Warning Mechanism into the EU
   decision-making process, under which National Parliaments monitor the
   subsidiarity compliance of EU legislative proposals. Whilst it is argued
   that in doing so they meet a collective action problem, National
   Parliaments have triggered the mechanism twice so far
   (COM/2012/0130/'MontiII' and COM/2013/0534/'EPPO'). This paper analyzes
   how Parliaments managed to overcome the identified problem in these
   cases. It is demonstrated that they used to this end effective
   leadership and communication in the sense of inter-parliamentary
   cooperation in order to reduce uncertainty about the actions of other
   Parliaments and subsequently about the prospects of successful
   collective action.},

Abstract = {This article considers whether political science should abandon the
   subfields of American politics, comparative politics, and international
   relations (IR), for new subfields of conflict, political economy,
   institutions, and behavior. The focus here is whether the field should
   abandon IR. The article lays out the arguments in favor of abandoning
   IR, describing scholarly trends that cross conventional subfield lines
   and are pushing to dissolve IR. Next, it argues that the costs of
   abandoning IR exceed the benefits, as new subfield divisions would
   remove some artificial walls but create new ones. Abandoning IR might
   undermine objective theory testing, would disadvantage the study of
   international system and structure, and would undermine the ability of
   political science to inform foreign policy debates. The article
   concludes by recommending that the field keep IR and its current
   subfield boundaries but that the walls between subfields should be kept
   low and porous.},

Abstract = {This comparative study of two cases draws upon alternative theories of
   policy change to explore the dynamics of tuition policy formation in
   Canada. The research examined five key dimensions in the policy
   episodes: (a) goals of policy change, (b) the politics of policy
   formation, (c) policy coalitions and their stability over time, (d)
   influence of elected officials and non-elected policy actors, and (e)
   the effects of environmental conditions such as changing public opinion,
   change in government, and provincial fiscal climate. Analysis revealed
   important agenda-setting activities, as well as insights into how policy
   coalitions influence decision-making in this policy arena.},

Abstract = {Although popular fictions are often separated from scholarly analyses,
   both discourses frame our understanding of the economics of household
   labor. This essay examines the ability of Class Struggle on the Home
   Front not only to bridge such arbitrary divisions but also to free the
   economic imagination in ways that allows us to reclaim the importance of
   household labor. In particular, this essay focuses on three interrelated
   contributions of the volume: the inclusion of class in narratives about
   work-family balance, the amplification of other scholars' work on these
   concerns in ways that push the conversation in new and imaginative
   directions, and the problematizing of oppositional thinking that
   privileges the masculine over the feminine in both literal and
   metaphorical ways.},

Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Pages = {485-502},
Abstract = {Most countries of the Arab Mashrek are multi-ethnic and multi-sectarian.
   In recent years, most of them have experienced violent clashes between
   groups that frame their conflicts along ethnic-sectarian lines. This
   article investigates the Lebanese Ta'if Agreement of 1989 as a crucial
   case study of how to manage such conflicts through a transitory
   power-sharing arrangement. It presents several provisions of this
   agreement that adhere to three different approaches of how to deal with
   such conflicts: the consociational and the centripetal models of
   power-sharing as well as the integrationist paradigm. It thereby seeks
   to develop a theoretical argument about chances and risks of transitory
   power-sharing in deeply divided societies and derives some general
   lessons for managing conflicts in the Middle East.},

Abstract = {The global city is a new frontier zone. Deregulation, privatization, and
   new fiscal and monetary policies create the formal instruments to
   construct their equivalent of the old military ``fort{''}. The city is
   also a strategic frontier zone for those who lack power, and allows the
   making of informal politics. At the same time the border is a mix of
   regimes, marked by protections and opportunities for corporations and
   high-level professionals, and implies confinement, capture and detention
   for migrants. The essay discusses the transformation of the city in a
   frontier zone and analyses the separation between the capabilities
   entailed by territoriality and the geographic territory tout court. The
   analysis focuses on the effects of neoliberal policies that, far from
   making this a borderless world, have actually multiplied the bordered
   spaces that allow firms and markets to move across conventional borders.
   Cities are therefore one of the key sites where new neoliberal norms are
   made and where new identities emerge.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the structure of the Austrian Political Twitter
   sphere by studying the follower relations between very active users. We
   find 13 communities, which we understand as,publics' in the sense of
   thematically distinguishable spheres of communication. Based on network
   characteristics and qualtitive analyses of profiles, we identify eight
   clusters with more-or-less clear political tendencies and two clusters
   with nodes that share common localities, all of them in the periphery of
   the network. A media cluster and a community of civil society actors are
   at the network's center, mediating between the other clusters. We
   interpret our findings in relation to Austria's political constellation
   and discuss them with regard to the changes of political communication
   due to the increasing importance of social media.},

Abstract = {As the number of non-Christian religious adherents increases in the USA,
   we have an opportunity to examine the limits of the linkages between
   religion, race/ethnicity, and civic engagement. American Muslims found
   themselves a central focus of social and governmental attention
   following the attacks of September 11, 2001. Furthermore, Muslims have a
   tradition of non-participation in the politics of non-Islamic states and
   contain within the religious tradition tremendous ethnic diversity.
   These factors have the potential to work against the generally robust
   linkages between religious and political participation. Utilizing a pair
   of surveys conducted by Zogby International in 2001 and 2004, this
   article presents evidence that Muslims were motivated to greater
   political participation as they began to perceive a greater threat from
   both the federal government and their local environments across ethnic
   lines. However, this article finds that private religious devotionalism
   is playing a negative role in Muslim political mobilization, which runs
   contrary to what is generally found in studies of Americans from the
   Judeo-Christian traditions.},

   the Uprisings against Authoritarianism in the Arab world},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {424-439},
Abstract = {This article will show how a `new history', inspired from longue duree
   approaches, can be methodologically applied, and how it equips us with
   analytical tools that improve our capacity to understand the long-term
   changes that fostered the civil society-based resistance in the Arab
   world. Although we cannot predict the exact timing of such resistance
   efforts, the application of the longue duree method provides us with
   tools that help us understand why and how the many uprisings transpired.
   This complements, and partly contrasts with, most previous research,
   which had its main focus on discussion of short-term factors that were
   claimed to have caused the Arab mass-mobilized resistance in 2010-2011.
   The article draws upon and intends to contribute to the theoretical
   debate on contentious politics within social movement research,
   resistance studies, and civil society-driven democratization research.},

Title = {Stepping up: black political ambition and success},
Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {278-294},
Abstract = {What compels African-Americans to enter the electoral arena? And what
   influences their political ambitions for higher office? Few studies have
   focused on blacks' paths to office and ambition, and thus an empirically
   tested theoretical framework of minority candidate emergence and
   political ambition is far from complete. In this paper, I seek to answer
   a number of fundamental questions: How often do black candidates attempt
   to seek higher office, and how often are they successful? Does this
   pattern differ significantly from that visible for white candidates?
   Using two decades (1990-2010) of data on Louisiana from the Local
   Elections in America Project that allows me to track candidates' paths
   to office, I develop a theory of black political ambition that
   hypothesizes that race will play a direct and interactive role in when
   and where black candidates run for and win office. The results suggest,
   first, no statistically significant differences between black and white
   candidates' expressions of static political ambition, and
   African-Americans expressing desire for higher office (progressive
   ambition) more often. In other words, race does not seem to play a
   negative factor in determining political ambition. However, running for
   office and winning office are not the same, and black candidates are
   significantly less likely to win these offices. The gap, then, in
   racially diverse representation is not because African-American
   candidates are not interested or expressing political ambition, but
   rather because they are seeking office and losing. I conclude with
   implications of these findings for issues of representational parity of
   minorities more generally, and the electoral pipeline of black
   candidates in particular.},

Title = {The Democratic Dilemma Revisited},
Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2015},
Number = {50},
Pages = {487+},
Abstract = {Much research in political psychology has focused on the democratic
   dilemma, the idea that low levels of political interest and knowledge in
   the mass public would seem to provide a weak basis for a functioning
   democracy. Much of the literature seeks to resolve the dilemma by
   reflecting on heuristics that can compensate for the lack of knowledge.
   Here I argue that low information rationality of this type cannot fully
   resolve the democratic dilemma. Instead, cognitive approaches should be
   combined with motivational explanations in order to provide a full
   understanding of the dilemma and its resolution. Two of these
   synergistic models are explored in detail: the affective intelligence
   model and the ambivalence model. Exploring ideas from pragmatic
   philosophy the paper sketches a model of citizenship that seems
   particularly adept at resolving the democratic dilemma.},

Abstract = {Since the creation of Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), health
   policies became a strategic factor in South America to collectively
   balance the legacy of neoliberal policies in the region. The aim of this
   article is first to describe the social, political, and economic
   processes that explain the emergence of UNASUR and its focus on social
   policy through healthcare. We then analyze how by virtue of UNASUR's
   Health Council, healthcare became the spearhead of cooperation giving
   way to novel forms of diplomacy. In so doing, this article contributes
   to a broader understanding of the regional health diplomacy and the
   process of unasurization of health policies as the process of building a
   new health framework.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the role and
   importance of e-participation in the political process. The internet has
   introduced new ways and forms of political communication and citizen
   participation in social and political life. In the era of digital
   democracy, the capabilities of citizens in terms of participating
   directly in politics have been enriched significantly. Accordingly, the
   internet and the technologies of Web 2.0 in particular have been
   invested with increased democratic expectations for the renewal of
   democratic institutions. However, academic research broaches the
   democratic potential of social media with reservation and highlights the
   loose connection between online and offline political participation. In
   this paper, we explore the variables and factors that influence online
   political participation, taking into consideration the new communicative
   codes introduced by social media. The analysis of the paper is based on
   a literature review performed on recent studies in the field, which
   reveal a plurality of variables and factors that should be analysed
   thoroughly and combined for the articulation of valid conclusions in
   relation to the features and the political characteristics associated
   with the new forms of political participation. Finally, we aim to
   proceed to the formulation ofsustainable arguments for the political
   stake of democratic e-political participation, which continues to be the
   active involvement of citizens in shaping politics.},

Abstract = {In The Particularistic President we challenge the dominant paradigm
   asserting presidential universalism. Instead, we argue that presidents
   possess strong electoral and partisan incentives to pursue policies that
   prioritize the needs of some Americans over those of others. In this
   article, we review our larger argument and expand upon our analyses of
   two policy areas where presidents have unilateral authority over
   distributive outcomes: natural disaster declarations and military base
   closures. In the former, we find strong evidence that President Barack
   Obama favored both swing and core states in the 2012 election year. In
   the latter, we find evidence of both electoral and partisan
   particularism.},

Abstract = {External political efficacy, the belief that government is responsive to
   the demands of its citizens, has been declining in the United States
   since the 1960s. However, scholars do not yet fully understand the
   reasons for its decline. Nor have they found suitable explanations for
   why it fluctuates within the electorate. Drawing on the growing
   literature on the effects of income inequality on public policy, I posit
   that increasing income inequality factors into the decline of external
   political efficacy. Using multilevel regression models accounting for
   individual and contextual factors, I find increasing state-level income
   inequality has a substantial negative effect on external political
   efficacy. It is greater than most state and national-level economic
   measures or individual-level variables on external political efficacy.
   These results have important implications both for research on income
   inequality and political participation and also for research on income
   inequality and distributional public policy.},

Abstract = {Changes in the security environment after the Cold War and decreasing
   number of armed conflicts in NATO member states lead these countries to
   a gradual reduction in military expenditure. However, new security
   threats that these countries faced at the beginning of the 21st century
   brought a massive growth of military expenditure especially in the USA
   which lead to significant deepening of disparities between the USA and
   European NATO member states. The aim of the article is to investigate
   disproportionality of burden sharing among 28 NATO members and via
   multidimensional statistic methods identify free-riding in Alliances. A
   model based on theory of the demand for military spending provides the
   basis for an investigation of the disparities (identified especially in
   the characteristics of the economic and security environment) in
   determinants influencing military expenditure. Finding suggest that the
   Alliance is not mainly an economically homogenous body and individual
   economies thus allocate a significantly different amount of GDP for the
   needs of the armed forces in dependence on political priorities of
   individual governments, public finances or overall economic condition of
   national economies. However, the results of the classification model
   reveal the fact that group of countries identified as core states of the
   ``traditional{''} NATO member states (with above-average values of
   variables) do not allocate the long-term recommended amount of military
   expenditure of 2\% of GDP. These countries are suspected of dangerous
   free-riding.},

Abstract = {The federal structure is a defining feature of the Swiss polity.
   According to the disenchanted hypothesis, which argues that the Swiss
   political culture of accommodating competing interests has come under
   pressures, we should expect that cooperation among the cantons and
   between the federal and cantonal governments has deteriorated over the
   last 25 years. However, inter-cantonal coordination has increased
   substantially. In addition, the successful negotiation of the NFA shows
   that the federal and cantonal governments can reach comprehensive
   agreements. This study provides empirical analyses of the NFA reform and
   of inter-cantonal tax competition. The NFA analysis shows that the
   cantons successfully coordinated their interests vis-a-vis the federal
   government, and the findings of the spatial econometric tax competition
   investigation suggest that inter-cantonal coordination in the NFA had an
   attenuating effect on tax competition. Overall, the problem-solving
   capacity of the Swiss federal system is remarkably high-not
   disenchanted.},

Abstract = {At present, establishment of diversified Chinese quick transaction
   mechanism of minor criminal case has become an important project that
   the judicial organ have to confront due to the reason that the simple
   procedure set up by Criminal Law of our country is not efficient for
   transacting the increasing minor criminal cases. Since 2014, Standing
   Committee of the National People's Congress has authorized the Supreme
   People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate to launch reform
   of quick transaction mechanism of minor criminal case in 14 cities like
   Beijing according to the overall scheme of Central judicial system
   reform. Since the reform, Courts around have begun to focus on
   protecting the lawful rights and interests of the criminal suspect and
   the defendant when they are establishing quick verdict program of minor
   criminal cases so as to ensure the justice of the case, of which useful
   experience has been taken.
   But from the perspective of judicial practice, judicial process of
   places is not unified because more principled rules of quick transaction
   mechanism of minor criminal case are launched only by the Supreme
   People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate. Many problems
   occur in practice: application and scope are not inconsistent; time is
   too long in handle procedures before trial, which will influence
   efficiency; cooperation of public security unit, the inspecting
   authorities, and courts are not efficient; evidence system of minor
   criminal cases is not perfect...... These problems have restricted the
   function of quick transaction mechanism. Therefore, quick transaction
   mechanism of minor criminal case is to be standardized.},

Title = {The distribution of individual cabinet positions in coalition

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {54},

Abstract = {Multiparty government in parliamentary democracies entails bargaining
   over the payoffs of government participation, in particular the
   allocation of cabinet positions. While most of the literature deals with
   the numerical distribution of cabinet seats among government parties,
   this article explores the distribution of individual portfolios. It
   argues that coalition negotiations are sequential choice processes that
   begin with the allocation of those portfolios most important to the
   bargaining parties. This induces conditionality in the bargaining
   process as choices of individual cabinet positions are not independent
   of each other. Linking this sequential logic with party preferences for
   individual cabinet positions, the authors of the article study the
   allocation of individual portfolios for 146 coalition governments in
   Western and Central Eastern Europe. The results suggest that a
   sequential logic in the bargaining process results in better predictions
   than assuming mutual independence in the distribution of individual
   portfolios.},

Abstract = {Political parties play a major role in democratic processes around the
   world. Recent empirical research suggests that parties are increasingly
   less important to citizens. Simultaneously, classic and contemporary
   theories of representative democracy specifically still minimally
   incorporate accounts of party benefit. This article attempts to
   reconcile normative political theory on democratic representation with
   party politics literature. It evaluates party democracy's value in
   comparison with its next best theoretical alternative pluralist
   democracy with individual representatives - along two different paths.
   It argues that parties are not flawless, but party democracy is
   preferable over pluralist democracy. Parties increase predictability and
   the transparency of policy outcomes. This, in turn, facilitates better
   accountability between voters and their representatives. In addition,
   parties save politics from becoming a dispersed and even possibly a
   contradictory set of actions.},

Abstract = {In this article, we seek to re-consider the `presidentialization of
   politics' argument in the light of recent developments in Germany and
   the United Kingdom. The experiences of coalition government suggest
   prima facie grounds for the erosion of the presidentialization process
   in each country. Germany has operated with a Grand Coalition in which
   domination of the executive by the Chancellor would seem less likely,
   whereas the long history of single-party governments in the United
   Kingdom gave way to a rare experiment in coalitional power sharing
   between 2010 and 2015, circumstances which should limit prime
   ministerial power. However, it is our contention that the
   presidentialization thesis retains its purchase in these two countries.
   German Chancellors and British prime ministers have been increasingly
   able to mobilize power resources, which allow them to govern more
   independently of their own parties and their coalition partners, and
   this seems to hold across a variety of political circumstances.},

Abstract = {The present article studies the law and the state of nature in John
   Locke's later writings, to the extent that their definition makes it
   possible to understand the emergence of private property prior to the
   establishment of the State. In this respect, in the first place the
   article will analyze the abandonment in the mature writings of the
   opposition between the inclinations and the deontology of the law of
   nature characteristic of the early writings. In the second place, it
   will account for the material and historical dimension that Locke
   attributes to the state of nature, in accordance with the hedonistic and
   utilitarian bias assumed by the law of nature in this state, in the form
   of a mandate of self-preservation and the maximization of benefits.
   Finally, it will account for the persistence of the teleological
   character of both the law and of the state of nature manifested in the
   conditions of peace and abundance that make possible the emergence of
   private property prior to the establishment of the State. In this way,
   unlike the interpretations which propose an abandonment of theology in
   favor of an acquisitive egoism, it will demonstrate the articulation
   between theology and utilitarianism.},

Abstract = {Ilya Somin's Democracy and Political Ignorance proposes an original,
   epistemic argument for decentralizing and downsizing democratic
   government. Somin's argument does not produce a plausible real-world
   program for government reform, nor does he exhaust the universe of what
   voting is for, or possible democratic solutions to the epistemic problem
   of rational ignorance and cognitive limitation. But his proposal is of
   considerable interest as an advance in political theory. The historical
   example of the classical Greek world of decentralized authority and
   small city-states suggests that democracy does benefit, in epistemic
   ways, from decentralization, reduced scale, and simplification of
   procedural rules. The tradeoff is, however, increased responsibility on
   the part of individual citizens to undertake civic services of various
   kinds.},

Abstract = {There are three paths to constitutionalism in the modern world. Under
   the first, revolutionary outsiders use the constitution to commit their
   new regime to the principles proclaimed during their previous struggle.
   India, South Africa, Italy and France have followed this path. Under the
   second, establishment insiders use the constitution to make strategic
   concessions to disrupt revolutionary movements before they can gain
   power. Britain provides paradigmatic examples. Under the third, ordinary
   citizens remain passive while political and social elites construct a
   new constitution. Spain, Japan and Germany provide variations on this
   theme. Different paths generate different legitimation problems, but the
   EU confronts a special difficulty. Since its members emerge out of three
   divergent pathways, they disagree about the nature of the union's
   constitutional problem, not merely its solution. Thus the EU confronts a
   cultural, not merely an economic, crisis.},

Abstract = {The miners' strike of 1984-85 was a brutal clash between the miners'
   union, which was defending jobs, and the Thatcher government, committed
   to destroying `militant' trade unionism. This article argues that due to
   the divisions within the miners' union about the way the strike was
   started, the Thatcher government was able to exploit this disunity to
   mobilise criminal sanctions against the miners. This was a `lucky
   accident', since the government's preparation for an eventual showdown
   with strong trade unions had been based on civil legislation. The
   article combines a range of primary and secondary sources to analyse the
   extent to which fear over the erosion of civil and trade union liberties
   was brought to fruition by the strike.},

Abstract = {The British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) is one of Britain's most
   controversial Overseas Territories. Its indigenous people, the
   Chagossians, were exiled from their homes in the 1960s and 1970s so that
   BIOT could play host to a US military base on the island of Diego
   Garcia. Meanwhile, Diego Garcia has been tarnished by revelations
   regarding its role in the CIA's extraordinary rendition' programme and
   by allegations of torture. And earlier this year, an international
   tribunal ruled that the UK government had violated international law by
   pushing through a Marine Protected Area to cover the territory over and
   above the protestations of neighbouring states. In this article, I argue
   that allowing the resettlement of BIOT by the Chagossians would go a
   long way towards improving the way that the territory has been governed
   for the past five decades.},

Abstract = {Following is presented the interview with the Brazilian sociologist
   Theotonio Dos Santos. The main issue discussed was his stay in Chile
   during the sixties and the early seventies. Along the interview there
   was a look into the intellectuality of the age, the spaces for reception
   and diffusion of the ideas and the link between intellectuals and
   revolutionary process in Latin America and Chile. Before the interview
   there is a biography as introduction to Dos Santos, besides several
   cross-references are included to contextualize, clarify or amplify the
   interviewed statements. That way, next pages can be read as a double
   text, the first one presents the answer of the interviewed and the
   second one goes along the trajectory of the intellectual and political
   spaces Chilean and Brazilian.},

Abstract = {The overall implication of depicting cyberspace as a complex, adaptive
   ecosystem rather than its current representation as a bi-dimensional
   domain provides an avenue for further insight into the complexities
   associated with operating in cyberspace. This renewed perspective brings
   to the forefront the critical role of the civilian private sector in
   cyber warfare, due to the intermixing and heavy reliance of the United
   States Government (USG) on an infrastructure owned and operated by the
   civilian private sector. The implications of such a revisionist
   perspective leads to a theory of action, which suggests that given this
   heavy reliance of U.S.G entities to include DoD, on a
   cyber-infrastructure predominantly owned and operated by civilian
   private sector entities, authorization to wage offensive-styled
   cyber-attacks, as a defensive measure should not be limited exclusively
   to the DoD but also expanded to include authorized entities in the
   civilian private sector.},

Abstract = {This article examines policies of both China and the United States in
   the Middle East. It evaluates the effectiveness of Beijing's strategic
   hedging behavior against Washington's ``hard power{''} strategies by
   discussing several policy challenges in this region: energy security,
   the Iranian nuclear issue, terrorism, regional alliance structures, and
   the ``Arab Spring.{''} The results of this study show that the gradual
   retreat of the United States from the Middle East coincides with a
   stronger Chinese presence in the region on several fronts. In examining
   Sino-U.S. power competition in the Middle East, it contributes to the
   advancement of ``strategic hedging{''} as a still underdeveloped concept
   in the International Relations literature.},

Abstract = {The responsiveness of government agencies to elected officials is a
   central question in democratic governance. A key source of variation in
   responsiveness is agency structure. Yet scholars often view agencies as
   falling into broad structural categories (e.g., cabinet departments or
   independent commissions) or fixate on some features of design (e.g., for
   cause protections). I develop new estimates of structural independence
   based on new data on 50 different structural features of 321 federal
   agencies in the federal executive establishment. Using a Bayesian latent
   variable model, I estimate independence on two dimensions: limits on the
   appointment of key agency decision makers and limits on political review
   of agency policy. I illustrate the value of this new measure by using it
   to examine how structure affects political influence and how agency
   independence can vary over time.},

Abstract = {How can we explain institutional reforms that redistribute institutional
   power between the parliamentary majority and minority? This paper
   proposes an informal theoretical model to explain such reforms in
   European parliaments based on congressional literature and inductive
   explanations from case studies. The article argues that political
   parties as the relevant actors pursue institutional reforms based on
   their substantive goals, their current and expected future government
   status, transaction and audience costs of reforms, second-order
   institutions that regulate the relative influence of actors in changing
   parliamentary rules, and the institutional status quo. Hypotheses
   derived from this model are tested with a qualitative case study of all
   standing order reforms in the Austrian parliament from 1945 to 2014. The
   empirical analysis finds support for various hypotheses and their
   underlying causal mechanisms. As Austria constitutes a least-likely
   case, the evidence provides strong support for the theoretical model.},

Abstract = {A large literature argues that public opinion is vulnerable to various
   types of framing and cue effects. However, we lack evidence on whether
   existing findings, which are typically based on lab experiments
   involving low-salience issues, travel to salient and contentious
   political issues in real-world voting situations. We examine the
   relative importance of issue frames, partisan cues, and their
   interaction for opinion formation using a survey experiment conducted
   around a highly politicized referendum on immigration policy in
   Switzerland. We find that voters responded to frames and cues,
   regardless of their direction, by increasing support for the position
   that is in line with their pre-existing partisan attachment. This
   reinforcement effect was most visible among low knowledgeable voters
   that identified with the party that owned the issue. These results
   support some of the previous findings in the political communication
   literature, but at the same time also point toward possible limits to
   framing effects in the context of salient and contested policy issues.},

Abstract = {In recent years there has been a growing interest in the rights of
   children in various justice systems. The interpretation of international
   instruments, such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
   Child legalized in Iceland as law 19/2013, places a strong emphasis on
   strengthening the status of the child. The concept of child-friendly
   justice has emerged reflecting a vision of a justice system that has
   adapted to the interests and needs of children. A key element is
   ensuring the right of the child to participate, building on the notion
   that participation actively promotes their citizenship in a democratic
   society. The complexity of child protection cases makes it imperative to
   ensure that children get the assistance they need to communicate and be
   able to influence procedures. This article discusses the development of
   provisions in child protection laws on the appointment of spokespersons
   for children and represents the findings of a study done on such
   appointments with various child protection committees. The main results
   of this research indicate that the development of the law has been
   positive. The enforcement does not however reflect these develpments and
   there is a lack of formality, assessment and satisfactory argumentation.},

Abstract = {The literature on strategic voting has provided evidence that some
   electors support large parties at the voting booth to avoid wasting
   their vote on a preferred but uncompetitive smaller party. In this paper
   we argue that district conditions also elicit reactions from abstainers
   and other party voters. We find that, when ballot gains and losses from
   different types of responses to the constituency conditions are taken
   into account, large parties still benefit moderately from strategic
   behaviour, while small parties obtain substantial net ballot losses.
   This result stems from a model that allows for abstention in the choice
   set of voters, and uses counterfactual simulation to estimate the
   incidence of district conditions in the Spanish general elections of
   2000 and 2008.},

Abstract = {Does partisan competition explain why some legislatures are more
   efficient at processing legislation than others? This article argues
   that legislative parties' strategic incentives and capabilities are a
   function of their size, their ideological homogeneity, and the
   governor's party. It shows that the distribution of legislative seats
   between the parties influences legislative efficiency, depending on the
   level of polarization between the parties and the party of the governor.
   A small partisan seat margin reduces legislative efficiency when the
   parties are polarized and when the government is divided. It provides
   further evidence that polarization and divided government can either
   positively or negatively affect legislative efficiency, depending on the

Abstract = {Studies focusing on black-Latino intergroup perceptions in zero-sum
   environments (e.g., jobs) have found little perceived outgroup
   discrimination or a tendency for each group to perceive the injustices
   faced by the other group. In contrast, we examine the non-zero-sum
   criminal justice domain. Although we find some asymmetrythat is, blacks
   are somewhat more likely to see discrimination toward Latinos than
   vice-versa, we mainly find both groups acknowledge the discrimination
   faced by the other disadvantaged group, especially those who feel
   closely linked to the fate of their own group. Under such circumstances,
   blacks and Latinos recognize a common sense of deprivation and
   discrimination and are likely to regard the other group as facing
   comparable victimization, potentially seeing the other group as a
   coalition partner for remediating mutual concerns.},

Abstract = {The news media are the most influential sources of information, ideas
   and opinion for most people around the world. Who appears in the news
   and who is left out, what is covered and what is not and how people and
   events are portrayed matter. Research has consistently shown that women
   are underrepresented in the news and that gender stereotypes are
   reinforced in and through the media. The 1995 Beijing Declaration and
   Platform for Action recognised the relationship between women and media
   as a major area of concern in achieving gender equality in contemporary
   societies. This article presents Nordic findings from the 2015 Global
   Media Monitoring Project (GMMP), which is the largest and
   longest-running study on gender in the world's media. The findings show
   that women account for only 1 in 5 of the people interviewed or reported
   on by Icelandic news media and that women's overall presence in the news
   has declined compared to the last GMMP study in 2010. The proportion of
   women as news subjects is also considerably lower than in other Nordic
   countries. We argue that the number of women who are journalists,
   managers in the media industry and decision makers in society has
   increased, but this shift has not automatically changed the
   representation of women in the news, either in numbers or in their
   portrayal. This discrepancy indicates that the relationship between
   gender and the news media is complicated and needs to be approached from
   different perspectives.},

Abstract = {The United States has participated in most diplomatic discussions
   concerning the establishment of an international criminal court for the
   prosecution of mass atrocities, including the crime of genocide. US
   representatives supported the creation of an international penal
   tribunal during the drafting of the UN genocide convention. President
   Harry Truman signed the convention immediately following its adoption
   and, shortly thereafter, submitted it to the Senate for its advice and
   consent for ratification. The Senate failed to give its consent for 40
   years. This paper analyzes (1) the foreign policy of the United States
   concerning the establishment of an international penal tribunal under
   article VI of the genocide convention and (2) how the Senate served as a
   roadblock to ratification for four decades.},

Title = {A `Road to Work'? The reworking of deservedness, social citizenship and

Abstract = {The paper discusses the effects of the public work programme' on social
   citizenship in remote rural localities in Hungary, where it has
   developed into an extreme form of workfare in lack of other employment
   options. Drawing on extensive empirical material from two rural
   localities, the paper shows that, due to decentralisation, large
   variations exist in the ways the programme is implemented locally. The
   practices and approach of local officials, who as key welfare workers in
   a highly decentralised state primarily determine its local
   implementation, are strongly linked to local social relations, as well
   as dominant notions of deservingness/undeservingness on which local
   claims and negotiations of belonging are based. The study concludes
   that, whilst the programme fails to address, and even upholds,
   structural inequalities, the ways in which the programme is organised
   can, nevertheless, fundamentally affect both the material welfare and
   the locally constituted social citizenship of its participants.},

Abstract = {Recent studies document that voters infer parties' left-right policy
   agreement based on governing coalition arrangements. This article
   extends this research to present theoretical and empirical evidence that
   European citizens update their perceptions of junior coalition partners'
   left-right policies to reflect the policies of the prime minister's
   party, but that citizens do not reciprocally project junior coalition
   partners' policies onto the prime minister's party. These findings
   illuminate the simple rules that citizens employ to infer parties'
   policy positions, broaden understanding of how citizens perceive
   coalition governance and imply that niche' parties, whose electoral
   appeal depends upon maintaining a distinctive policy profile, assume
   electoral risks when they enter government.},

Abstract = {Much of the existing research on population aging has focused on its
   impact, including both opportunities and challenges, on developed
   countries, particularly those in Europe and North America. This article
   discusses how unequally population aging will distribute risks in
   securing socio-economic resources for the wellbeing of individuals in
   later life between developed and developing countries around the world.
   Based on a documentary analysis of relevant literature and findings from
   the survey data drawn from Organization for Economic Co-operation and
   Development (OECD), United Nations (UN), and World Health Organization
   (WHO), this article discusses four main areas of the unequal
   distribution of risks in later life: (1) burden of disease in
   epidemiological transition, (2) financial security in retirement, (3)
   familial resources for elderly care, and (4) care workforce for elderly
   care. While population aging is a global trend, its impact is not equal;
   over the next decades, today's developing countries will likely contend
   with double challenges at least in these areas.},

Abstract = {Is there a relationship between legislators' religious affiliations and
   the consistency of their voting records? Building on the theory of the
   personal roots of representation, we argue that a legislator's
   likelihood of switching positions depends on whether the issue is
   central to their personal values. We evaluate this claim using a data
   set including senators' religious affiliations and culture war votes
   from 1976 to 2004 and find that different religious groups vary in their
   voting consistency on issues such as abortion, public prayer, and gay
   and lesbian rights.},

Abstract = {While women have participated in a variety of militarized movements
   across time and space, the determinants of their participation have not
   been examined systematically. In this article, we seek to explain
   variation in women's involvement across different violent political
   organizations. Our research highlights the role that organizational
   attributes play in influencing women's presence in violent groups. We
   evaluate our hypotheses using an original dataset on women's
   participation in and characteristics of 166 violent political
   organizations across 19 African countries from 1950 to 2011. Our
   empirical results show strong support for our argument that
   organization-based opportunities for women's participation explain
   whether female members are present in a group.},

Abstract = {The end of the Second World War in Asia came so quickly that there was
   no time for the Allies to work out the shape of the new regional order.
   Indeed, the subsequent fall of the Nationalist Chinese regime and the
   isolation in Asia of the People's Republic of China meant that no such
   integrated order was established, with the US instead playing the
   dominant organising role. In this article, Rana Mitter explores how, in
   the years since the end of the Cold War, a rising China has started to
   use the previously downplayed legacy of wartime victory in 1945 to make
   claims about territory in present-day East Asia.},
