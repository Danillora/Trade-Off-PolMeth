Abstract = {The growing concern about economic inequality leads to a similar concern
   about political inequality. This article explores the seeming
   contradiction between the literature pointing to inequality in political
   representation in the United States and the literature showing that
   public policy does tend to represent public opinion in general.
   Low-income voters are much less likely to vote or to be politically
   knowledgeable than high-income voters, which limits their influence and
   creates an upper-income bias to effective public opinion. Considerable
   research suggests that low-income voters' opinions count for even less
   than would be implied by their low participation rate, a matter that
   should continue to be the subject of research. Seemingly contrary to any
   upper-income bias to policy making, major legislation usually moves
   policy in the direction favored by low-income voters (e.g.,
   redistribution, government programs). Upper-income voters and interest
   groups, however, are able to slow the pace of liberal change.},

Abstract = {This paper questions the main elements of the notion of
   ``protagonism{''} in the light of the French wars of religion: there
   were, during this period (1562-1598), no revolutions strictly speaking,
   but it is possible to investigate the numerous critical situations, the
   seizure of cities and massacres, and the overblown testimonies, in order
   to examine the participation of ordinary people in an extraordinary
   situation. The article queries what it was for this is the problem that
   prevented the people of the late-nineteenth century from fully making
   their mark on history and proudly embracing active participation in the
   multitudinous events of the wars of religion.},

Abstract = {Many scholars have recognized the important value that civic-engagement
   activities can have, not only on student learning, but also on the
   development of civic agency, which involves the capacity of individuals
   acting alone or in groups to enact positive change. From a political
   science point of view, the development of civic agency among college
   students is crucial in an era of growing political apathy among the
   nation's youth. In 2012, building on previous engagement work on and off
   campus, a group of students, staff, and faculty created an
   organizational structure called Breaking Ground at the University of
   Maryland, Baltimore County to help university personnel, broadly
   defined, think about and implement civic-engagement activities at many
   levels of university life. With support from the Provost's Office,
   Breaking Ground was able to offer grants to instructors who wanted to
   introduce civic-engagement activities as part of their curriculum. In
   2013, grant winners representing 11 courses from the first three rounds
   of competition were interviewed. The purpose of this article is to offer
   insights from this group as a means to help other college or university
   instructors introduce civic-engagement activities into their regular
   curriculum. Four main categories of ``decisions{''} that instructors
   make when designing an activity emerged from the analysis of the
   instructors' reflections of their experiences.},

Abstract = {The outcome of the 2011 Duma election and the protests that followed it
   seemed to call into question the Russian electoral authoritarian regime.
   This paper analyses the arguments surrounding this question,
   concentrating upon problems in the structure of the regime, the nature
   of the protests, and the attitudinal base upon which they rest. It
   concludes that the greatest challenge to regime stability and durability
   lies in the deficiencies in the way the electoral authoritarian system
   functions rather than in the protest activity.},

Journal = {POLITICAL QUARTERLY},

Volume = {86},
Number = {1},
Pages = {93-100},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {When the Liberal Democrats joined the Coalition government in May 2010,
   there was an expectation that they would have a restraining effect on
   the Conservatives, particularly in the area of European politics. But
   after almost five years as the junior party in the Coalition, the
   Liberal Democrats struggle to demonstrate their influence over the
   government's approach to Europe. Not only did they let the Conservatives
   lead the Coalition's European agenda, but they will be forever
   associated with the government that brought the UK closer to the exit
   door of the European Union. The article argues that this outcome is the
   result of a series of avoidable if surprising mistakes, such as the
   choice of ministerial portfolios and the party's attitude to the
   Coalition's monitoring mechanisms, as well as some unavoidable mistakes
   that could have not been foreseen when the Coalition was formed.},

Abstract = {The Sahara-Sahel region of northwest Africa has become a hotbed of

   reaches, other actors have stepped in. This article examines recent
   securitization initiatives by the United States and France. U.S. efforts
   concentrated on training national security forces, while France's are
   largely combat operations. U.S. training failed to prevent Mali from
   being overrun by terrorists. France's combat operations have scattered
   but not eliminated the Islamists. These securitization initiatives have
   not worked, I argue, because they do not address the root causes of
   terrorism, which are not military but social and economic.},

   generated processes that aimed to contribute to the peaceful resolution
   of violent conflicts that had erupted in the region in the early 90's.
   Its methodology consisted of sending international volunteers to
   collaborate with local peace groups and human rights organizations who
   may request their help. The Balkan Peace Team was able to strengthen
   empowerment processes of local organizations in areas of conflict where
   it was deployed. It also provided lessons to those organizations part of
   the project in order to increase awareness of the scope and operation of

Abstract = {In 2013, Virginia Republicans nominated two Tea Party conservatives for
   state-wide office: Ken Cuccinelli and Earl Walker Jackson, Sr. They
   differed in two significant respects: (1) Cuccinelli has more political
   experience, and (2) Cuccinelli is white and Jackson is black. For this
   article, we used this quasi-experimental opportunity to examine the
   racial resentment explanation for Tea Party support. We found no
   evidence of voting patterns consistent with this characterization of Tea
   Party supporters. There was no significant gap between Tea Party support
   for Cuccinelli and Jackson, and Tea Party supporters were far more
   likely to cast ballots for both candidates than they were to choose one
   or the other. In fact, we found that racial resentment is positively
   associated with support for Jackson. In this election, neither Tea Party
   support nor racial resentment negatively affected support for the black
   Republican candidate for lieutenant governor.},

Abstract = {During the 2009 election campaign, Twitter not only served as a source
   of news for the media but also became a public stage for active
   political users. In particular, hopes were raised about a pluralistic
   grass-roots sphere of public communication in which political
   information can be shared in a non-ideological, decentralised and
   egalitarian manner. To test whether Twitter led to new patterns of
   political interaction and to determine the beneficiaries, we present
   findings from a large-scale network analysis investigating about four
   million tweets by more than 33,000 users including citizens, journalists
   and politicians in the 2009 National Election. Our analysis identifies
   the most popular users, contents and topics in this political sphere,
   revealing the Pirate Party movement as the most influential group during
   the campaign. A network analysis of the participating actors confirms
   the strong position of established online activists and bloggers in
   contrast to traditional mass media, politicians and parties.},

Abstract = {When seeking guidelines for worst-case scenario, military intervention
   under the Responsibility to Protect looks to the just war tradition. We
   tried to pinpoint the most important criteria, drawing on the
   Responsibility to Protect report, subsequent RtoP development and
   relevant authors to create a background to which compare the NATO's
   operation in Libya. These criteria were not met during the intervention,
   as is shown in this article. The criterion of just cause could be seen
   as fulfilled, albeit this admission is done very grudgingly - the loss
   of life was not that large comparing to other tragedies that did not
   trigger intervention. The Libyan intervention is most questionable when
   it comes to right intentions and proportional means that suggest that
   the goal of interveners was to topple the regime not protect the
   civilians. These results bring the discussion of the weakness of the
   RtoP approach when it comes to defining, which populations should be
   helped under this doctrine and whether the nature of victims should be
   taken into consideration.},

Title = {Life and Death of a Directorate within the French Ministry of Foreign
   Affairs. Assessing the French Foreign Audiovisual Policy through its
   Bureaucratic Entrepreneurs},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {28},
Number = {112},
Pages = {199+},
Abstract = {How do we explain the dismantling of an administration? To answer this
   rarely-asked question, we focus on a governing body in charge of French
   foreign audiovisual policy, within the French Ministry of Foreign
   Affairs. We emphasize three ``ideal-types{''} of bureaucratic
   entrepreneurship that bear witness both to the story of an
   administration and the larger background of how the concept of an
   administration changed between the 1980s and the early years of the
   twenty-first century. A first heroic figure takes the form of a
   ``Schumpeterian{''} entrepreneur: Pierre achieved a pioneering
   ``bureaucratic feat{''} in the early 1980s when, within the world of
   French cultural diplomacy permeated by the notion of cultural
   legitimacy, he legitimized the illegitimate cause of television,
   renaming it a technological innovation, i.e. satellite broadcasting. The
   second figure is a ``manager{''}, Paul, who took over at the end of the
   1990s as the boss of an independent administration and the head of a
   network. He was an innovator in his recruitment and management methods,
   which were inspired by the private sector, and expert in the art of
   politicizing matters through his Minister. The third figure is Jacques,
   an entrepreneur on the defensive, who, in the years 2000, had to wind up
   the governing body in charge of foreign audiovisual policy, in a context
   of harsher competition between administrations, and following the new
   management reforms that aimed to redesign French foreign cultural policy
   and competition between administrations.},

Abstract = {In the last decade the discipline continued its consolidation as a new
   profession, its construction of an academic community and its ability to
   produce accumulative knowledge. Some highlights of these 10 years were
   the continued expansion of programs (at undergraduate and graduate
   levels), the creation of the Colombian Association of Political Science,
   the completion of three congresses and two disciplinary meetings, the
   expansion in the number of graduates and the acceptance of two Colombian
   journals to both ISI and Scopus. However, this expansion has also
   created challenges for the maintenance of the quality of teaching and
   expansion of new labor spaces. It is also important to further
   strengthen the methodological skills, given that the knowledge generated
   is eminently descriptive, qualitative, and not compared.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the idea of scholarly work as cultural
   production to help understand how the tensions of precarious,
   early-career academic employment are articulated on a day-to-day basis
   in the context of pressures to efficiently produce monetizable
   `deliverables.' Using a political economy of communication framework and
   an iterative methodological approach, the authors mobilize examples
   drawn from a collaborative set of activities they undertook as part of a
   broader research group of emerging Canadian scholars working in
   different international contexts between 2012 and 2015. The research
   conversation began in academic roundtables in 2013, and was furthered
   through a content analysis of articles collected from scholarly and
   general interest blog posts, newsletters, and magazines published online
   from July 2012 to April 2014. In this article, the authors explore
   emerging themes and document pressures to conform to neoliberal
   practices within the corporatized university, as well as suggest
   pathways for dissent and reinvention of academic labour.},

Journal = {CANADIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {92-111},
Abstract = {This article examines the effects of economic perceptions on party
   leader evaluations and on the overall feelings of voters towards the
   various parties contesting the election. We find that positive feelings
   towards incumbent parties and premiers and negative feelings towards the
   primary opposition parties and their leaders increase when voters feel
   that the provincial economy is strong. However, such `sociotropic'
   economic perceptions do not affect feelings towards third parties and
   their leaders. In this sense, economic perceptions are important for the
   battle between the governing party and its primary challenger: they
   prime voters to like either the incumbent party and Premier, or like the
   government-in-waiting and the Premier-in-waiting. On the other hand,
   voters' evaluations of third parties and their leaders seem to be based
   on factors other than economic perceptions.},

Title = {Decentralized Governance under Centralized Party Rule in Ethiopia: The
   Tigray Experience},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {25},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {473-490},
Abstract = {In the mid-1990s Ethiopia adopted a federal constitution promising
   regional autonomy and the creation and strengthening of local government
   units below the regional level. Some observers attribute the various
   shortcomings of Ethiopian federalism that have emerged since then to the
   original institutional/constitutional design. This paper, however,
   argues that what is not in the constitution has come to influence the
   workings of decentralization more than what is codified in it. The
   dominant national party in power, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary
   Democratic Front (EPRDF), either directly or through affiliates,
   controls political office at all levels of government, thereby limiting
   the room for local initiative and autonomy. The presence of a national
   dominant party limits the responsiveness and downward accountability of
   Wereda (district) authorities; it also undermines political competition,
   and by extension, good governance at the grassroots level. The paper is
   based on field research carried out in the Tigray regional state of
   Ethiopia. The conclusion is that when one party dominates the politics
   of the region and its institutions, extra-constitutional intra-party
   politics determine how things work, thereby subjugating localities'
   autonomy and impeding their ability to deliver on promises of
   decentralization.},

Abstract = {Human Social Systems (HSS) are complex systems. One of the best ways to
   organize complex systems is by means of their self-organization, since
   the latter has proven to be an optimal producer of order in this type of
   systems, regardless of their nature: physical, biological or social.
   This concept emerged due to developments in the sciences of complexity,
   in which life has been understood as the most complex system that
   exists, and that does not require central or external control in order
   to produce organized patterns. Life's order stems from the
   self-organization of its internal and external dynamics and
   interactions. This fact serves to question the use of centralized
   control mechanisms when organizing human social systems, and underwrites
   a critique of pyramidal structures and control hierarchies in classical
   political regimes from the standpoint of the sciences of complexity. The
   paper argues that human social systems are complex systems; hence, the
   best way of organizing them is by letting them self-organize, instead of
   imposing -in a top-down manner, or from the outside -control by means of
   political regimes with hierarchical, pyramidal, or vertical structures.
   The paper explores this idea with a focus on political theory.},

Abstract = {We adopt the principal-agent framework and the asymmetry of information
   between the principal and the agent in order to approach two subjects of
   much attention and expectations: i) the formal online release of
   governmental data as a means of furnishing information, and ii) its
   contribution to government economic and institutional transparency. We
   identify important characteristics of transparency as instruments to
   lessen the information asymmetry in relevant areas (or subjects) where
   corruption and inefficiency are generally present in political
   institutions. We focus on the central governments of sixteen Latin
   American nations. We determine that, while there exists a moderate
   release of data relevant to areas where corruption generally takes
   place, its contribution to providing meaningful information to the
   citizenry is minimal. Our findings also show the importance of policy
   that explicitly mandates that data corresponding to specific areas where
   corruption and inefficiency take place be shared over the Internet;
   adequate levels of national online technical sophistication are not
   sufficient. We conclude that modern information technologies, as tools
   to contributing to government transparency and lessen knowledge divides
   in the evaluated areas, are not meeting expectations. Our framework and
   findings seek to utilize political science theories to contribute to an
   early understanding of the role of modern data-oriented technologies in
   government transparency, and highlight the positive and negative effects
   that these can have in the betterment of governance and the
   consolidation of democracy.},

Abstract = {Given similar economic distress indicators, why do some states enter
   into International Monetary Fund (IMF) programs while others do not?
   Building on extant studies of IMF program participation that highlight
   the importance of various economic and political determinants, this
   article proposes an argument focusing on the political incentives of the
   IMF and a borrowing country when they engage in IMF program
   negotiations. Specifically, the study develops a domestic politics
   argument to highlight the interactions among sovereignty costs,
   competence costs, economic conditions and domestic regime types, and
   tests the argument using a cross-national time-series dataset of all IMF
   agreements between 1970 and 2006. It finds that when the economic crisis
   is mild, democracies are less likely than non-democracies to enter IMF
   programs, but that when the economic crisis is severe, democracies are
   more likely to do so than their autocratic counterparts. The article
   attributes this tendency to democratic leaders' electoral vulnerability
   and shows that these patterns become more pronounced as elections draw
   near.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2015},
Number = {3},
Pages = {9-26},
Abstract = {Author analyzes the causes and consequences of the Great Patriotic War.
   By describing Stalin and Hitler as historical actors in the field of
   ``Realpolitik{''}, the author reveals the similarities and differences
   between their ideologies, social roots, political and military
   objectives of totalitarian regimes personified by them. Democratization
   of the world order became the main outcome defeat of fascism. In Russia,
   this process from Khrushchev's Thaw until post-Soviet reforms including
   all its flaws and regressions resulted in failure of totalitarianism; in
   Europe - in the fall of fascist, authoritarian regimes and establishment
   of social statehood; in ``The Third World{''} - in the collapse of
   colonialism. The continuity between Nazi expansionism and Ostpolitik of
   the West during and after the ``Cold War{''} is shown in the article.
   Analyzed are the problems of correlation between war and politics,
   different ways and forms of their interactions. In this regard studied
   are the coup d'etat in Ukraine committed with the Western contribution,
   as well as anti-Russian policy of propaganda, diplomatic and sanctions
   ``wars{''}. While dealing with the following international crisis,
   Russia is forced again to protect its right for sovereignty and the role
   of an independent actor of the world politics.},

Title = {Assessing the Relationship between Presidential Rhetorical Simplicity
   and Unilateral Action},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {90-99},
Abstract = {Research from Shogan (2007) and Lim (2008) on the executive branch
   proposes that the American presidency has adopted an anti-intellectual
   approach to leadership, such that there is a concerted rejection of
   thoughtful political discourse from the president. This has been
   reflected by what appears to be a relative decline in both the
   linguistic and substantive complexity of presidential rhetoric. Shogan's
   (2007) work, while focused on examining whether Republicans are more apt
   to employ anti-intellectual leadership than Democrats, raises an
   additional topic worthy of empirical examination: the potential
   relationship between anti-intellectual leadership and unilateral action
   from the president. If anti-intellectual leadership is a defiant form of
   leadership that opts to publicly demonstrate the rejection of external
   expertise, the usage of anti-intellectual rhetoric from the president
   might be able to predict the usage of unilateral action. On the other
   hand, anti-intellectual rhetoric might be used as a straightforward and
   quick means to explain unilateral action, such that change in the level
   of unilateral action can predict the usage of simplistic rhetoric.
   Unfortunately, no one has yet to empirically test whether rhetorical
   simplicity predicts unilateral action, unilateral action predicts
   rhetorical simplicity, or there is a multi-directional relationship
   present. This project makes an initial attempt to remedy this gap in the
   literature. The project contrasts the monthly average simplicity level
   of the presidential weekly public address with the monthly number of
   executive orders emanating from the executive branch, using information
   spanning between February 1993 and May 2015. The initial findings from
   the vector autoregression and moving average representation analyses
   suggest that prior change in rhetorical simplicity predicts the usage of
   executive orders, and that an increase in rhetorical simplicity helps
   produce an increase in the number of executive orders offered by the
   president.},

Abstract = {In the past few years, a number of civil society coalitions have emerged
   in the illiberal city-state of Singapore. They are the unintended result
   of a controlled process of liberalization which was initiated by the
   government in the 1990s in response to growing demands for
   participation. In particular, the internet has contributed to a more
   assertive, independent and better organized civil society, which can be
   seen as a significant step in the process of political change in the
   city-state.},

Abstract = {This article makes a comparative analysis of the trajectories of welfare
   change in Italy and Spain since the outbreak of the financial crisis. We
   look at the differences in the types of institutional design to study of
   welfare reform in these two countries and assess how recent changes have
   affected welfare state institutions. The article also assesses the level
   of EU involvement not only through formal instruments around the
   European Semester, but also by means of agreements with the Troika and
   the European Central Bank. For this part of the analysis three sets of
   documents have been used: Commission Recommendations and Council
   Decisions in relation to Excessive Deficit Procedures; Commission
   country-specific recommendations based on Stability or Convergence
   Programmes; and Policy Measures to boost growth and jobs (National
   Reform Programmes). These documents allow an analysis of the contents of
   formal adjustment pressures. Other documents and sources (including
   newspaper articles) have also been analysed in order to look at the role
   of conditionality and `backroom' diplomacy.},

Title = {PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY: INSTITUTIONAL CRISIS AND NEW PROSPECTS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2015},
Number = {5},
Pages = {25-48},
Abstract = {The article is devoted to the study of problem of the evolution as of
   the democratic values in the structure of the mass consciousness of
   Russian citizens as of different forms of political and non-political
   participation. The authors stress that contemporary Russia faces the
   deep institutional crisis that, from one side, leads to establishment of
   the government ownership of many structures of the civil societies'
   structures, and from the other side that stimulates emergence and
   development of the varied self-organization practices of the civil
   initiatives and horizontal communication connections. From this point of
   view, the availability of formal democratic institutions, that are often
   imitational or ``frozen{''}, is better than their total absence, because
   one can find here the ability to return rapidly to the early democratic
   practices and to transform into the new actual initiatives.
   It is also noted in the article that the decrease of the interest of
   Russian citizens to the ``great politics{''}, that is fixing by mass
   polls especially among youngsters, is accompanied by latent polarization
   of the vast segments of various subcultures and non-formal
   organizations. At the same time, one can also find the opposite tendency
   - of ``socialization{''} of political movements. For this reason the
   authors conclude that the recession of the protest activity is not the
   same as the recession of the political and social activity in the state.
   Rather one can talk about the redistribution of the flows of activity
   that can be fixed as in the forms as in the objects of its realization.
   The authors also analyze the attitude of the Russian citizens to the
   different forms and practices of the ``social and state partnership{''}.
   As the authors note, Russian citizens almost totally perceive as the
   ``social and state partnership{''} the initiatives in the social sphere
   (health care, education, active aging, adaptation of the socially
   vulnerable groups) and such spheres of co-participation as the
   environment protection activity, civil rights and philanthropy
   initiatives. The option ``dialog between generations{''} has here the
   unexpectedly high rating (30\%). This could probably be caused by the
   belief that traditional institutes of retranslation of the generations'
   experience (school, family, media) couldn't solve this problem and
   should be amplified with civil institutes, public opinion leaders, new
   forms of communication etc. At the same time, constructive interaction
   between state bodies and social institutes is possible just if being
   based, firstly, on the partition of the influence spheres, that is
   convenient for both sides, and, secondly, when applying more actively
   than today to the institutions that functionally focus on such
   interaction (these are mainly local self-government bodies and various
   local communities). But as the authors note, that could be done not when
   their activity would be radically rebuild (one could remember lots of
   such rebuilding' attempts), but due to the overcoming of duality of the
   local self-government bodies, that leads to the situation of the
   ``self-management without self-organization{''}. The authors argue the
   need for establishment of the local authority bodies with the clearly
   defined powers and at the same time with the various canals,
   technologies and forms of socially independent action, that closely
   interact as with it as with each others. Special attention in the
   article is paid to the analyses of possible mechanisms of reaching of
   this goal, firstly, by the creation of the conditions of the real
   inclusion of persons into the process of the municipal management.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to contribute to a reflection on the
   endogenous nature of party regulation and on the ways in which law
   making can be used by political actors to foster a privileged legal
   environment. The article first provides a review of the literature about
   party regulation and its main approaches. Secondly, building on a
   comprehensive database of party regulation in Europe, it draws attention
   to the presence of functional definitions of political parties in party
   law and speculates as to why such nonprescriptive statements have been
   introduced. In the conclusions, it suggests that presenting themselves
   as `eufunctional' performers, political parties have strengthened their
   legal status and (self-) legitimized their institutional centrality,
   ensuring their organizational survival within the system independently
   from their declining capacity as vehicles of political representation.
   Further lines of inquiry and cross-fertilization between disciplines are
   suggested and encouraged.},

Abstract = {The physical anthropologists were involved in the Italian nation
   building process. In fact, they worked to build and diffuse the Italian
   national feeling. However, they assumed different positions on the
   spreading of Arian mythology. Different ideas of Italian identity and of
   Italian foreign and internal politics were linked with those positions.
   The Italian anthropologist Giuseppe Sergi fought against the hypothesis
   of building the Italian national identity on the concept of
   ``Arianity{''} by proposing a theory driven by the political
   environment. Instead, using anthropological dates, he sustained the idea
   of the superiority of the Mediterranean race and he tried to demonstrate
   the existence of a deep relation between Italian, Scandinavian and
   Britannic people against the Triple Alliance. At the same time, his
   theory was linked with the political discussion about the ``Meridional
   Question{''} : he criticized the choices in favor of the northern part
   of the country that characterized the Italian politics across the end of
   the XIX century and the beginning of the XX century by sustaining the
   possibility of a real development of the south. All those positions were
   based on racist theories. Moreover, Sergi used the anthropological
   analysis to sustain the opportunity of building the United States of
   Europe.},

Abstract = {A common feature of leading liberal-egalitarian political theories is
   the sharp priority they attribute to justice, and to distributive
   justice in particular. In this article, I argue that liberal
   egalitarians have yet to offer a persuasive argument for prioritizing
   justice, and distributive justice in particular, in this way. I focus on
   assessing arguments advanced in the seminal work of John Rawls and
   employ the pluralist liberalism of Isaiah Berlin to illustrate that
   Rawls' arguments are not even persuasive for reasonable liberals like
   Berlin, let alone for non-liberals. The upshot of my argument is not
   that liberals should abandon the pursuit of greater equality of wealth
   and income, but only that such goals should still be balanced against
   the claims of other fundamental values, such as individual liberty and
   the common good (contrary to those who want to give sharp priority to
   distributive justice).},

Title = {SYMBOLIC PARTY AS CULTURAL AND POLITICAL PHENOMENON: GERMAN EXPERIENCE
   IN RUSSIAN PERSPECTIVE},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2015},
Number = {4},
Pages = {22-33},
Abstract = {The article is devoted to symbolic parties as a typical phenomenon of
   segmented (fragmented) political cultures. On a material of German
   political history, the various aspects of this phenomenon are examined
   by the author, drawing parallels with post-Soviet Russia. Symbolic
   parties are understood as coalitions around significant political
   symbols expressing different segments (fragments) of political culture.
   Following German sociologist M.R. Lepsius, the author describes the
   social basis of symbolic parties as a ``sociomoral environment{''}. It
   is a complex socio-cultural formation which differs from the other
   environments (subcultures) through the symbols expressing specific moral
   frames of political ideologies. In the context of a segmented and
   fragmented political culture, the sociomoral environments are
   characterized by ``camp mentality{''} and a tendency to ``social
   secession.{''} In times of deep sociopolitical crisis, the symbolic
   parties become an expression of civil war of political symbols rather
   than a sign of politically diffuse socio-cultural environments. The
   article indicates the typical characteristics of this war, namely,
   ``savagery{''} of public political discourse, beastialization of
   political opponents, social militarism, deficit of monopoly on the
   legitimate use of symbolic violence, and others. The author considers
   the sociomoral environments as a subcultural basis of symbolic parties
   in Imperial Germany; moreover, a comparative classification of symbolic
   parties in the Weimar Republic and contemporary Russia is proposed in
   the article. In particular, in Weimar Germany the following symbolic
   parties are defined: democrats-republicans, imperialists-monarchists,
   communists-internationalists, and national socialists. In modern Russia,
   at least three major symbolic parties are identifiable:
   democrat-westerner, imperial nationalists, and communists-nationalists.
   Between Weimar Germany and contemporary Russia a substantial similarity
   is revealed, and this concerns not only a set of symbolic parties, but
   also the tendency of their interaction: the transition of ideological
   power from the symbolic party of ``democrats{''} to the one of
   ``imperialists{''}, though in the framework of the same constitutional
   order. However, in contrast to the ideological situation in Weimar
   Germany, in the post-Soviet Russia a limited civil-patriotic consensus
   was formed. Strengthening this consensus involves managing risks of
   authoritarian-totalitarian unification of the national political
   culture. Alternatively, this article refers to the experience of
   ``symbolic balancing{''} of the ideological extremes of ``left{''} and
   right ``in democratic countries. Moreover, the author discusses the
   E.Fraenkel's idea of ``collective{''} or ``dialectic{''} democracy which
   involves competent parliamentarism and interaction of political
   subcultures on pluralistic basis.},

Abstract = {The comparative literature on party systems has convincingly
   demonstrated that electoral rules, social cleavages and their
   interaction can explain much of the cross-national variation in the size
   of party systems. This literature, however, has thus far ignored
   campaign finance laws. This article argues that various campaign finance
   laws exert more or less restrictive pressures on party competition. It
   develops a new theoretical concept, fund parity. The study demonstrates
   the positive relationship between fund parity and party system size and
   employs additional tests to supplement the regression analysis in order
   to account for potential endogeneity issues. The findings underscore an
   intuitive - but heretofore untested - relationship: increasing parity
   makes party competition more permissive and increases the size of the
   party system.},

Abstract = {Scholars of Congress and other legislative institutions have posited
   that majority agenda-setting is one of the primary mechanisms by which a
   majority party demonstrates its power over legislation. However, this
   line of work has difficulty explaining why the floor median would
   delegate such power to the majority. In this paper, I develop a theory
   of lawmaking in an incomplete-information environment. The model allows
   for information transmission through both majority agenda-setting and
   minority speech making. This is one of the first models of parties in
   Congress that allows for the minority to have an active and vital role.
   Comparative statics show that, for a wide set of parameter values, the
   institutional arrangement proposed is optimal for the floor median when
   compared to strict majoritarian and minority-free settings.},

Pages = {32-45},
Abstract = {The article raises the question of why immigrants become or do not
   become citizens of their destination country. Political incorporation of
   immigrants through naturalisation is driven by several factors,
   including opportunities to naturalise on the one hand and the
   (perceived) added value of naturalisation on the other hand. We argue
   that naturalisation propensities are strongly driven by policies, while
   settlement in a country raises the value of citizenship and leads to the
   acceptance of higher costs. Based on data from the Austrian Mikrozensus
   we examine the factors that drive citizenship status of immigrants from
   the main countries and regions of origin in Austria. We find that
   indicators related to the settlement of immigrants as well as indicators
   for having easier access to citizenship, most notably higher
   socio-economic resources, reduce the likelihood of being a foreign
   citizen.},

Abstract = {This article explores some of the current themes round the perceived
   crisis in British politics in supposed an age of anti-politics'. Drawing
   on Bernard Crick's In Defence of Politics, it offers a critique of what
   is referred to as a dominant British political tradition and in so doing
   seeks to challenge demand-side' accounts that ostensibly defend the
   traditional arena politics of the Westminster system. Instead, it argues
   that developments around issues such as big data, social media and
   freedom of information have led to a more open society in recent years.
   It concludes by suggesting that if traditional political institutions
   wish to restore a greater degree of legitimacy, they need to do' or,
   more particularly, supply' politics differently, adapting to these
   changes by seeking out new modes of openness, engagement and
   accountability.},

Pages = {335-349},
Abstract = {Scholarship rightfully emphasizes how electoral institutions affect
   minority representation and policy outcomes. But how do racial and
   ethnic environments shape institutions? We address this question by
   examining how support for Latino candidates affects attempts to modify
   rules regarding governance and elections. To do so, we rely on new data
   from the Local Elections in America Project and the International
   City/County Management Association. We find that the percentage of votes
   that go to Latino candidates, as well as changes over time in Latino
   vote share, predicts the probability that a reform effort will take
   place. Both relationships are nonlinear and suggest a high degree of
   strategic behavior on the part of elite actors within cities.},

   Child},
Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4, SI},
Abstract = {UN treaty bodies have increasingly highlighted the need to end
   discrimination and violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
   and intersex (LGBTI) persons. While these recommendations are relevant
   to children, they take on an adult's perspective and therefore fail to
   take particular regard to how the situation for children may differ from
   that of adults. This article provides a children's perspective on LGBTI
   rights. It presents and discusses relevant articles of the Convention on
   the Rights of the Child in addition to jurisprudence of the Committee on
   the Rights of the Child, with a focus on the rights to
   non-discrimination, identity, self- determination, and health.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {27},

Abstract = {This paper challenges the contemporary Marx scholarship's emphasis on
   questioning whether Marx's critique of capitalism should be understood
   in normative terms. The emphasis on the normativity of Marx's critique
   of the capitalist system has obscured Marx's normative understanding of
   that system. Marx understands the material structures constitutive of
   the capitalist organization of society as based on implicit social norms
   that are dependent on subjects' recognition of them-norms that only
   assume a material form as a result of such recognition but that cannot
   be unrecognized without material transformation. Marx inherits this
   rational sense of norms and their bindingness from Kant and Hegel, a
   sense that consists in the explanation of intentional states in terms of
   normative statuses and of normative statuses in terms of normative
   attitudes.},

Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},

Abstract = {Is the Federal Constitutional Court, as often depicted, a mostly
   independent actor in the German political system? The present analysis
   shows for the first time to what extent public opinion has a systematic
   influence on the decisions of the Constitutional Court. Our evidence is
   based on the analysis of abstract judicial reviews and federal state
   disputes from 1974 to 2010. We show that the Federal Constitutional
   Court is the more likely to rule in favor of the opposition, the
   stronger the public supports the specific substantive position of the
   opposition. Two mechanisms that could bring about this correlation are
   finally discussed. While the court does not blindly follow public
   opinion it will nevertheless consider the acceptance of its decisions as
   an important source of legitimacy.},

Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Number = {1},
Pages = {55-74},
Abstract = {Parliamentary discourse in democratic states is both a form of
   implementation of freedom of speech and a way of increasing awareness of
   the quality and level of freedom of speech in democratic regimes. The
   Slovak Republic is a country with a distinct post-communist tradition of
   freedom of speech, where restrictions and censorship have stood opposed
   to demands by citizens for the real acknowledgment of this right. This
   case study analyses how the issue of freedom of speech has evolved in
   the parliamentary debates from 1992 to 2013. It utilizes content
   analysis to discover the contexts in which freedom of speech has
   appeared in parliamentary proceedings in the National Council of the
   Slovak Republic and what clues to lawmakers' understanding of freedom of
   speech may be derived from these contexts. It is concluded that despite
   the consolidation of democracy and membership in various international
   organizations that incorporate protections for fundamental rights and
   rising awareness on freedom of speech itself in the country, freedom of
   speech was of marginal importance for Slovak MPs, which indicates the
   absence of a need for reflection on both domestic and international
   issues. A consequence of this neglect is the widening influence of
   courts in determining the scope and extent of freedom of speech in
   Slovakia.},

Abstract = {After two decades of neoliberal governance, Latin American states have
   turned to the model of a ``popular civil society{''} through
   participatory devices, which seems to have generated new forms of
   citizenship in popular barrios and a ``surveillance democracy.{''} Based
   on two ethnographic research projects (2007-2011) on Venezuelan Consejos
   comunales, this paper aims to show that these new popular relationships
   with the state are the result of two sociological variables: dependence
   and autonomy. Within a new typology of popular relationships with the
   state-refused dependence, victimizing, conflict, and accepted
   dependence-it shows the complexity of popular politicization produced by
   a ``participatory state.{''}},

Abstract = {This article provides an analysis of the situation in Afghanistan during
   the Obama administration functioning in 2009-2013. The authors assess
   the effectiveness of the military aspect in Obama's strategy by using
   two methods: quantitative event-analysis and regression analysis. In
   drawing conclusions, the authors used their own empirical database. The
   article suggests and justifies the thesis that there is no seasonality
   in opposition forces' actions. Besides, the authors use quantitative
   methods to assess the effectiveness of the military aspect of the NATO
   strategy and reveal several unconventional tendencies of the Afghan
   conflict},

Abstract = {This paper aims to analyze critically the implications of new
   managerialism in public service through ethical, democratic and
   professional values. It starts with the supposition that contradictions
   exist between the values that public service seeks to promote under the
   managerialism model and the reality of its implementation. The method
   used is analytical, descriptive and normative, seen from the critical
   perspective of the parallel developments of managerialism and public
   service. The theoretical and methodological framework that serves as a
   reference for this critical analysis is provided by theories of
   organizational economics and public choice. The discussion concludes
   that there is a necessary conflict between the ethical, democratic and
   professional values of these new organizational forms promoted by
   managerialism through the theories of economics and organizational
   public choice and traditional public service values.},

Abstract = {The objective of this research note is to introduce Scope, Range, and
   Extent of Manifesto Project Data Usage (SRE). This is a content analysis
   of publications that use the Manifesto Project's Database (MANIFESTO
   Database), its resulting dataset, and a handbook for users and
   forthcoming coders. Up to now, a total of 273 articles published between
   2000 and the first semester of 2015 in eight high-impact journals
   (American Journal of Political Science, American Political Science
   Review, British Journal of Political Science, Comparative Political
   Studies, European Journal of Political Research, Electoral Studies, The
   Journal of Politics, and Party Politics) have been coded according to a
   140-variables scheme. The SRE dataset, which includes literature
   reference files divided in methodological and substantial ones, offers a
   condensed but exhaustive overview over topics, policy dimensions, and
   extraction methods used in each article. Besides, the range of
   countries, party types and families, times, and actors are covered.
   Furthermore, the extent of critique, validation, and reliability testing
   related to the MANIFESTO Database is reviewed. Thus, the SRE dataset
   provides old and new users of the MANIFESTO Database with a quick and
   convenient summary of existing research and shows different ways in
   which these data can be used. Moreover, the SRE dataset could be useful
   to those looking for information on methodology or case studies on
   certain countries. Finally, the SRE handbook offers key information both
   users and coders of the SRE dataset.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I argue that Philippe Van Parijs' argument for the
   principle of linguistic territoriality rests upon an unexamined and
   unvindicated assumption, to the effect that most situations in which
   smaller languages are threatened by larger ones can be assimilated to
   `colonial cases', that is to cases in which there is injustice as
   between the two linguistic groups, as opposed to `mere number cases',
   that is cases in which linguistic groups of different sizes coexist in
   the absence of injustice. Moreover, I argue that Van Parijs
   underestimates the amount of coercion that will have to be applied even
   within linguistically defined territories in order to avoid the erosion
   of the smaller language.},

   Southern Caucasus. Georgia has become an ally of Washington, Azerbaijan
   is favourably disposed to the United States, and Armenia cultivates good
   relations with America, although Russia is Erevan's guarantor of
   security in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Under President Barack Obama,

Title = {Political Culture of the Arab Community in Germany - A Field Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {191-207},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The objective of this research to know the views members of the Arab
   community hold towards the political culture in its three dimensions.
   Members of the Arab community in Germany (ACG) were asked as well as
   about the sources of political information and about their views about
   the current events in the Arab world (Arab Spring). After reviewing
   relevant literature and concepts of political culture the researcher
   developed a questionnaire which was distributed to members of the ACG in
   several German cities of different sizes, both in West and East Germany.
   The study used package (SPSS) statistical analysis of the study and
   adoption of percentages and frequencies, averages and standard
   deviations to examine the study questions and used Independent Samples
   Test to examine the hypotheses of the study. The results of the study
   indicate that the political culture of the Arab community in Germany is
   close and homogeneous and that the similarity of the political and
   social environment outweighs the differences of the many Arabian
   countries of origin. The reason for this is attributed to the fact that
   Germany as the hosting country is governed by the principles of
   democracy and political and cultural pluralism, , and this in turn
   reflects positively on the political culture of the members of the Arab
   community which is integrated rather than fragmented.
   On a political level the study has shown that communication between the
   formal and informal German institutions with members of the Arab
   community needs to be improved and that members of the Arab community in
   Germany need to be encouraged to get involved and participate more in
   political life in Germany regarding both, general elections and
   affiliation to German political parties.},

Abstract = {This article aims to elaborate on Turkey's stance towards the main
   developments in the South Caucasus after the rise of the AK Party in
   2002. The main focus of this article is to delineate the impact of
   Turkey's new foreign policy on the country's approach towards regional
   developments. Turkey's ambition to become a key energy hub influences
   its sensitive and strategic conception of this energy-rich region.
   Turkey's ``zero problems with neighbors{''} policy has proven to be an
   underlying principle, giving shape to Turkey's attempts to support
   regional pluralism and contribute to the establishment of peace and
   stability in the region through economic interdependence. The aim of
   Turkey is to achieve its political goal of enjoying a peaceful
   neighboring region, and its ultimate vision of becoming a key energy
   hub. However, the ``zero problems{''} ideal has faced challenges, which
   are underlined as the main factors currently influencing Turkey's
   policies and behavior in the region.},

Abstract = {The presence of a firearm in intimate violence situations increases the
   probability of fatal victimization. However, in Argentina no
   comprehensive research has been done on firearms use in femicides. This
   study explores the role of firearms in intimate violence in general and
   in femicide in particular in order to assess existing prevention
   measures. It proposes: a) to review the academic literature and the
   existing legislation on femicide in general, and in Latin America and in
   Argentina in particular; b) to highlight international concerns about
   the use of firearms in femicides; c) to analyze available statistics on
   intimate violence and femicide involving firearms use in Argentina and
   d) to reflect on legislative initiatives, policies and social actions to
   improve preventive measures to reduce the use of the most lethal tool to
   commit femicide: firearms.},

Abstract = {How do messages from political elites interact with individual traits of
   citizens to spur intergroup aggression? Building on research in social
   psychology, we expect that in places of protracted conflict, violent
   rhetoric from elites will be enough to mobilize antagonism toward an
   outgroup, especially among those who are generally less apt to be
   hostile toward the outgroup. We present results from two large survey
   experiments, the first conducted with young Jewish-Israeli adults across
   Israel and the second with a nationally diverse sample of adults in
   India. The results show that mild fighting words (e.g. battle, fight),
   combined with a reference to the outgroup, provoke significantly greater
   support for policies that harm the outgroup among some citizens. This
   effect is largest among individuals low in outgroup prejudice and low in
   aggressive personality traits, people who are usually less inclined to
   support policies that hurt the outgroup. Effects of violent rhetoric
   persist even with policies and rhetoric to help the outgroup. This work
   highlights the importance of considering both individual traits and
   contextual factors together to understand their full impact in the study
   of intergroup conflict.},

Abstract = {Lebanon stands out in the Middle East for its relative political
   openness, religious freedom, and the academic and professional
   achievements of Lebanese women. Yet, paradoxically, it has one of the
   lowest rates of women's political participation in the region. This
   paper is the result of an initiative undertaken by the Lebanese
   government in July 2012 to increase women's political participation.
   Through this initiative, sex-segregated workshops on women's political
   empowerment were held for male and female representatives of Lebanon's
   political parties. The goal was to start a productive conversation that
   would ultimately lead to progress from the 2012 status quo of women
   constituting only three percent of the National Parliament of Lebanon.
   In this paper, we will describe the process and content explored during
   the women's political empowerment workshops. Opportunities to affect
   change of the current level of women's participation will be highlighted
   and conclusions will be drawn to aid similar initiatives.},

Abstract = {The article deals with Mohandas K.Gandhi's theory of democracy and its
   related civic practices. It indicates the relation between Gandhi's idea
   of civic duty and his idea of democracy, and argues that few would
   dispute that Gandhi was one of the most original and transformative
   thinkers of democracy. The article maintains that among his many notable
   contributions, Gandhi is rightly credited with emphasizing on the ideas
   of citizenship duty, truth in politics, genuine self-rule, and ethically
   enlightened democracy. In addition to advocating self-sustaining
   villages and communal cooperation, Gandhi developed an idea of
   non-liberal democracy reducing individualism, economic greed, and
   laissez-faire by insisting on a duty oriented and spiritually empowered
   participative democracy. Nearly seven decades after his death, Gandhi
   stands as one of the most signifi cant and relevant nonWestern theorist
   of democracy.},

Abstract = {Switzerland's relationship with the EU is closely related to some of the
   transformations of domestic politics during the last decades. This
   contribution analyses the development of Switzerland's legal integration
   measures over time and explores their correlation with indicators of
   domestic political change, namely party positions and the salience of
   European integration in the electorate. It suggests that party positions
   and issue salience of European integration did not prevent the rather
   dynamic development of Switzerland's legal integration measures for two
   reasons: On the one hand, parties were generally in favour of the
   `bilateral way' and related policies and European integration lost
   salience over the twenty years under study. On the other hand, a
   considerable share of legal integration measures was conducted by the
   government and the federal administration following mechanisms foreseen
   in the sectoral agreements. These measures as well as domestic rule
   transpositions proved not to be related to indicators of domestic
   political change, whereas legal integration measures in need of approval
   by parliament were correlated to party positions and issue salience. The
   analysis builds on an empirical dataset including all sectoral
   agreements and all federal laws transposing EU rules in the period 1990
   - 2010. The results are based on descriptive analyses and Poisson
   regression estimates.},

Abstract = {In this article, we argue that countries with strong regional self-rule
   offer more incentives and opportunities to form networks of local
   collusion leading to higher corruption levels. In contrast, shared rule
   allows for more oversight on the national level which reduces political
   corruption. Using a recent dataset on regional authority, we test our
   hypotheses on a sample of up to thirty-six countries between 1984 and
   2006 and find robust empirical support for the predicted contrasting
   effects of regional authority: Self-rule enhances and shared rule limits

   protest camp set up in Caracas in April and May 2014, in the context of
   the cycle of protests that occurred in Venezuela. Background contextual
   factors of the cycle of protests are reviewed and the applicability, to
   this case, of 10 dynamics identified as central to networked social
   movements are explored. An analysis of Twitter user @PlzaResistencia's
   network, which was used for autonomous political communications and for
   spreading campers' slogans, is also included.},

Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},

Volume = {10},

Pages = {391-412},

Abstract = {The article conceptualises the notion of `the local' within the work of
   Friedrich Hayek and shows how various public policy measures in the
   United Kingdom, including privatisation, Total Place, Big Society and
   the Localism Act, can be seen to fit within this rubric. This framework
   is used to inform a conceptual and empirical critique of the form that
   localist policies have taken in the United Kingdom. The article argues
   that the emphasis on efficiency and the significance of competition to
   each of these measures has served to consolidate the rule of money
   without realising meaningful social gains, and that these forms of
   localism can therefore be seen to have contributed to the (re)creation
   of capitalist space in the United Kingdom.},

   in Belgium and examines definition of laicism/secularism in the
   constitutional or juridical texts to show the main characteristics of

Abstract = {For candidates and voters alike, U.S. politics is a gendered space in
   which women are often underrepresented. Participation from women is
   assumed to equalize representation and voice in the political process;
   however, little research has explored gender influence on campaign
   agendas, particularly in non-news contexts. This study applies a
   quantitative content analysis to explore the influence of (1) candidate
   gender, (2) journalist gender, and (3) voter gender on the presidential
   debate agenda. In examining the issue focus of debate questions, we find
   that participation from women candidates and women journalists does
   little to improve agenda diversity and that the agendas set by women
   journalists fail to satisfy the issue priorities of women voters
   participating in these same debates.},

Abstract = {Since the `defreezing' of traditional cleavages and the following
   dealignment, electoral volatility has been an important field of study.
   Notwithstanding the often aggregate-level analysis of electoral
   volatility, this study introduces the notion of ideological volatility
   to indicate an individual-level shift in vote decision between
   ideological blocks, thereby complementing the more common study of
   partisan volatility. Using CSES data, this study examines ideological
   volatility in 28 European elections between 2001 and 2011. Using a set
   of multilevel models, the analysis specifically confirms the
   conditionality of party attachment (dichotomous) and its dependency on
   the political system when explaining ideological volatility. The effect
   of party attachment on the likelihood to become ideologically volatile
   is more substantial when a political system is more diversified. (C)

Year = {2015},
Volume = {40},
Pages = {34-44},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Presidential popularity is the ``causal agent{''} of presidential
   effectiveness. High approval ratings mean more power and greater ability
   to govern. Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou enjoyed high approval ratings
   when he was elected in 2008, but his popularity declined rapidly soon
   after, to about 14\%. How do Taiwan citizens evaluate their presidents?
   What factors help to explain the Ma's declining popularity during his
   presidency? Consistent with conventional wisdom, this study finds that
   the country's overall economic conditions play a vital role in the
   popularity of Taiwan's president. Closely following is citizens'
   evaluation of the president's ability in managing cross-Strait
   relationship, national defense, and diplomacy. Ma's staffing of key
   cabinet positions has also had an effect on his popularity, which is
   unusual in the study of presidential approval. The personal integrity of
   the president, a trait that Ma has emphasized strongly, has not had a
   positive effect on his declining popularity in Taiwan. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {When Indonesia's President Suharto was forced to resign in 1998, the
   accompanying uncertainty triggered serious communal violence in five
   regions. As the nation's politics and economy stabilized from 2002, so
   did those provinces. Identity-based conflict is now the rare exception
   rather than the rule in democratic Indonesia. Yet puzzlingly, despite
   the consolidation of democracy, ethnic clashes and mob violence against
   religious minorities continue to occur. While such events are now far
   smaller than those in the first years of democratization and occur only
   occasionally, their persistence requires analysis given the potential
   for escalation and what it tells us about Indonesia's reform process. In
   this article I compare recent incidents with that of the initial
   post-authoritarian era, and find that identity-based collective violence
   persists because many important causes of conflict have not been removed
   by democratic consolidation. As found by numerous scholars, many
   illiberal characteristics of the authoritarian state have segued neatly
   into democratic Indonesia. I assert that this has left several main
   causes of group violence firmly in place. I further contend that the
   failure to remove these phenomena partly has its origins in the order of
   democratic reforms chosen in the years after Suharto's resignation.},

   the impact of social capital such as social networks and interactions.

Abstract = {The combination of studies on federalism and gender studies has fueled a
   burgeoning research that examines the impact of the territorial
   distribution of power on equality policies and on the strategies of the
   women's movement. This article explores how the main territorial
   dynamics of the State of Autonomies have affected three key areas of
   public action on gender equality, namely gender mainstreaming, electoral
   quotas and policies against gender violence. The results of the
   empirical analysis align with the so-called ``conditional approach{''}
   recently adopted by the literature that avoids oversimplifying the
   multilevel structure as either positive or negative for equality
   policies and identifies instead the specific characteristics of the
   institutional configuration that promote or limit them. In the Spanish
   case, inter-regional competitive dynamics have stimulated policy
   diffusion through learning processes and women's agency has often taken
   advantage of the multilevel opportunity structure. Nonetheless, a high
   degree of decentralization coupled with weak intergovernmental
   cooperation mechanisms has led to fragmentation and diversity in policy
   making in some areas.},

Abstract = {This article enriches the understanding of region-building processes in
   the post-Soviet space by explaining why countries engage into regional
   projects. Based upon the analysis of the drivers behind Armenia's and
   Moldova's commitment to Eurasian integration and association with the
   European Union, respectively, it develops a more nuanced approach to
   region-building. The article points to the domestic factors behind
   engagement in regional projects and shows that the range of variables
   explaining countries' choices is actually much broader (and their
   interaction more complex) than suggested by existing theories.},

   divided into four categories: the Combat Offensive PMC, the Combat
   Defensive PMC, the Non-Combat Offensive PMC, and finally the Non-Combat

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {499-523},

Abstract = {With New Public Management came the idea that public organizations
   should be led by professional managers, rather than by professionals.
   This has been referred to as new managerialism. This article explores
   how new managerialism may affect professional autonomy in a public
   organization that enjoys a high - and constitutionally protected degree
   of organizational autonomy. A framework distinguishing between
   organizational and occupational professionalism is adopted, in a 10-year
   case study of the Swedish National Audit Office (SNAO). The study shows
   how the autonomy of professionals at the SNAO was highly restricted,
   while management control systems were continuously expanded. At the same
   time, SNAO performance has been reduced. For example, the SNAO has been
   criticized for its high overhead costs. The study presented in this
   article, shows the complex interplay between professionalism, new
   managerialism, and organizational performance. Based on the findings
   from this study, the article maintains that it is equally important to
   consider how autonomy is distributed within agencies, as it is to
   consider how autonomy is distributed between the political sphere and
   the administration, when trying to explain organizational performance.},

Abstract = {Ilya Somin's Democracy and Political Ignorance uses a by-now familiar
   rational-choice lens with which to explain and analyze Americans'
   widespread political ignorance. Unlike some scholars who tout rational
   choice on purely predictive or heuristic grounds, Somin claims that it
   also offers a more accurate description of reality, in this case better
   explaining the findings of empirical public-opinion research. In this
   essay, I compare Somin's central concept of rational ignorance and the
   related concept of ``rational irrationality{''} with the earlier
   explanatory approach taken by Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter in
   his classic study, Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy. While Schumpeter
   developed his description of the mass democratic citizenry over 70 years
   ago-prior to any of the significant empirical studies of American public
   opinion-its broad approach remains at least as persuasive as Somin's.},

Title = {The Nature of Legal Change on the US Supreme Court: Jurisprudential
   Regimes Theory and Its Alternatives},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {59},

Abstract = {Jurisprudential regimes theory (JRT) posits that legal change on the
   U.S. Supreme Court occurs in a drastic, structural-break-like manner.
   Methodological debates present conflicting evidence for JRT, which has
   implications for the important law versus ideology debate. We confront
   this debate by first elaborating two alternative theoretical
   perspectives to JRTevolutionary change and legal stability. Our
   analytical framework focuses on two key substantive effects of
   jurisprudential categories on the Court's case outcomesrelative
   differences between categories over multiple time periods and
   longitudinal differences across time periods. Importantly, different
   pieces of empirical evidence can provide support for different dynamic
   processes. The extent to which law matters is not necessarily tied to
   one particular model of legal change. Empirical analysis of updated and
   backdated free expression data generates key findings consistent with
   JRT, legal stability, and evolutionary change. We discuss the
   implications of the results for understanding legal change and legal
   influence.},

Abstract = {Building on the unfinished research program of Gudgin and Taylor (1979),
   we analytically derive the linkage between a party's territorial
   distribution of support and the basic features of its vote-seat curve.
   We then demonstrate the usefulness of the corresponding empirical model
   with an analysis of elections in postwar Great Britain, focusing in
   particular on the transformation of the Liberals from a territorially
   concentrated to a dispersed party in the 1970s. We show that
   majoritarian biases increase with the number of parties, and
   majoritarian systems harm small parties when their vote is more
   dispersed than average, and large parties when their vote is more
   concentrated than average. Moreover, the evolving experiences of Labour
   and Conservatives demonstrate how a party's territorial support, and
   hence its expected seat premium or penalty, changes with its electoral
   fortunes. This model has a wide variety of applications in multiparty
   majoritarian democracies around the world.},

Abstract = {``Cybersecurity{''} has become a topic of great strategic importance
   concerning both national and international security, especially after
   Edward Snowden's disclosure of the secret surveillance programs of the
   U. S. government. With the largest number of netizens in the world,
   China holds its own views, beliefs, and assumptions on this topic. To
   understand the current disputes over international cybersecurity and to
   identify challenges and opportunities presented to international
   cybersecurity cooperation, it is of great significance to examine
   ``cybersecurity{''} in the Chinese context. This article deals with the
   following issues from a Chinese perspective: cyberspace and
   cybersecurity in general, China's vital cybersecurity interests and
   threatening challenges, and barriers to further progress in
   international cybersecurity cooperation. It is concluded that China's
   understanding of cybersecurity, which derives from its unique national
   conditions, does not limit its willingness to participate in
   international cybersecurity cooperation.},

Abstract = {Although many studies analyse government formation and termination,
   there is only scant attention to the duration of government formation
   processes. The few existing studies focus on the empirical evidence of
   parliamentary democracies in Western Europe until 1998. We present a new
   data set on 297 government formation processes in 27 European countries
   that allows us to test models explaining delays in the government
   formation process developed in Western Europe using new data from
   Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Our results suggest that these models
   perform much better in the Western European heartland of coalition
   studies than in the context of CEE. We highlight the implications of
   these findings and discuss potential avenues for future research.},

Abstract = {The fast development of ICTs pose new challenges to the European Union
   and its Member States. Every EU country has its own policies regarding
   technology transfer, ownership of state e-services, and the
   possibilities how the state-owned or licensed e-service could be
   exported. Taking into account the free movement of goods, the EU has
   created a platform to cooperate and export IT solutions. However, the
   lack of preparedness of infrastructures, legislation and stakeholders
   for cross-border exchanges poses a threat to IT transfer and should be
   taken into consideration in the EU as well. In the coming decades the
   number of outsourced ICT solutions, strategically important ICT
   solutions, public services and critically important information exchange
   platforms developed on behalf of the states, will grow exponentially.
   Still, digital development is uneven across the EU, they grow at
   different speeds and the performance is quite splintered. There are
   legal provisions which are outdated and therefore impede technological
   cooperation and export of IT solutions. A Member State may restrict the
   ICT licensing based on national security and policy reasons and the
   ownership of intellectual property might pose a threat to technology
   transfer or further development of the IT solution. There are examples
   of strategically important export of ICT solutions, the experience at
   which can be expanded to cover other EU Member States. Strong
   collaboration would enable mutual learning from past experiences along
   with the opportunities for better use of technology. Parallels can be
   drawn with military technology transfers, as the policies and legal
   framework was first developed and mostly used with them.
   This introduces a question of what are the conditions for exporting
   strategically important ICT solutions from one Member State to another,
   given that there is no common legal framework developed yet, and who
   should decide whether to transfer or not?},

Abstract = {The popularization of mobile devices in the everyday life of Mexico
   City's broad socio-cultural sectors, particularly the cell phone, calls
   attention to the fact that young people read and write permanently, from
   the moment they wake up to the time they go to bed. They receive and
   answer dozens of messages throughout the day, and they search and
   publish all kinds of information. Nonetheless, surveys that measure
   reading practices leave out questions about these experiences, and
   subjects, when questioned about their reading habits and preferences,
   don `t mention nor recognize them in their answers. These observations
   led us to ethnography traditional and emergent reading and writing
   practices and representations that young people studying Communication
   in a public university have. Its main results are reviewed in this

Abstract = {While recent literature reports that network diversity generates
   tolerance, empirical data suggest that in Israel, a highly diverse
   country, tolerance has been in scarce supply. The well-documented
   importance of personal value preferences (specifically, openness to
   change vs. conservation and self-transcendence vs. self-enhancement) in
   producing tolerant views leads us to hypothesize that values function as
   boundary conditions mitigating the impact of network diversity upon both
   political and social tolerance. Building on a representative survey
   conducted in Israel in 2011, we show that diversity contributes to
   tolerance more when people are open-minded; when conservatives encounter
   dissimilar attitudes, they are either less affected or respond with
   increased intolerance. Secondly, those who highly regard the opinions of
   others and express an individual predisposition for self-transcendence
   at the expense of self-enhancement are affected by network diversity to
   a greater extent. Further, the effect of diversity on tolerance is
   mediated by the perceived threat from the relevant group.},

   for nationalist party vote choice},

Abstract = {This article explores the individual-level correlates of nationalist
   party vote choice and the extent to which these correlates are
   conditioned by an individual's local context. We argue that the
   influence of individuals' policy positions on nationalism should vary in
   importance for predicting voting for nationalist parties in localities
   where voters feel threatened culturally or economically. To test this
   argument we use the case of support for the Bloc Quebecois in the
   Canadian province of Quebec and data from the 2011 Canadian Vote
   Compass. We show that voters' policy positions on nationalism become
   more important in predicting a vote for the Bloc Quebecois when the
   percentage of English speakers (our proxy for ethno-cultural threat)
   increases in their locality. By contrast, we find that the relationship
   between nationalism and support for the Bloc Quebecois is not
   conditioned by economic hardship in the place where an individual lives.
   To test the robustness of our findings, we reestimate our models using a
   different dataset from multiple elections the Canadian Election Study as
   well as an additional modelling approach. Our findings contribute to the
   broader vote choice literature by examining the role that local context
   plays in individuals' choice of parties. Furthermore, our findings lend
   support to arguments made in the literature on the importance of an
   ethno-cultural calculus among voters voting for nationalist parties. (C)

Abstract = {Whether the opposition in a democratic country is unified or fragmented
   is an important characteristic that may influence the accountability of
   government, as a recent study demonstrates that the degree of opposition
   fragmentation has consequences for the electoral performance of ruling
   parties. This study explores the determinants of opposition
   fragmentation using data from 18 advanced democracies. I argue and
   provide evidence that deliberative parliamentary rules that allow
   opposition parties to have greater influence in the policymaking process
   lead to higher levels of opposition fragmentation. Opposition parties
   deprived of political influence tend to reduce their levels of
   fragmentation in order to become more competitive. This finding suggests
   that there may be a trade-off between deliberativeness and
   competitiveness in democratic politics.},

Title = {Lone fighters: Intraparty competition, interparty competition, and
   candidates' vote seeking efforts in open-ballot PR elections},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {39},
Pages = {329-337},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In their seminal paper, Carey and Shugart (1995) argue that electoral
   rules predetermine whether election campaigns are predominantly
   characterized by competition between parties, or among candidates within
   parties. In particular, electoral systems that provide weak party
   control over ballot access, that allow voters to express a preference
   vote for individual candidates, and that select candidates on the basis
   of the votes they earn individually are supposed to offer strong
   incentives for candidates to cultivate a personal vote. In this paper,
   we investigate Carey and Shugart's original claims about the
   instrumental motivations of candidates in open-ballot proportional
   representation (PR) elections using survey data and election statistics
   from the 2007 Swiss National Council elections. As opposed to previous
   work, we develop and employ more direct and valid measures of intra- and
   interparty incentives to wage personal campaigns. Our empirical results
   suggest that the candidates' campaign focus and expenditures are closely
   linked to intraparty competition, but not interparty competition.
   Previously used proxies of intraparty competition, such as district
   magnitude or the number of candidates on a party list (or ratios
   thereof), turn out to be but remotely related to the candidates'
   campaign behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Since 2012, the Deportation Research Clinic, part of the Buffett
   Institute for Global Studies at Northwestern University, has been
   pursuing research on government misconduct under the rubric of what
   Jacqueline Stevens calls ``forensic intelligence.{''} The Clinic uses
   law and publicity, including scholarship, to create new realities, which
   in turn produce new facts and knowledge. Stevens draws on scholarship by
   S.M. Amadae, Noam Chomsky, Philip Green, Chalmers Johnson, Kenneth
   Osgood, Ido Oren, Michael Rogin, and Frances Saunders to explain the
   relation of ``forensic intelligence{''} to the ``national
   intelligence{''} paradigm now organizing mainstream political science
   research. The article concludes by describing how U.S. government and
   economic elites distort research and teaching priorities, and provides
   examples from Northwestern University.},

Title = {The Great Russia and Eurasia. Russian Geopolitics and Central Asia
   between the Great Game of the Nineteenth Century and the New Great Game
   of the Twenty-First Century},

Abstract = {In the 19th century, Eurasia has been the theatre of a Great Game
   between the Russian empire and the British empire. At the beginning of
   the 21st century, Eurasia is the ``Great Chessboard{''} on which a New
   Great Game is played between Russia and United States. In order to
   understand the genesis and the perspectives of this New Great Game, the
   present essay explores the intricate historiosofic, imagologic and
   geopolitical controversy between Russia and the West. Great Game has
   been carried out on three levels: the ``dark fight{''} between the
   intelligence agencies; the ideological war engaged by the propagandists
   of the ``russophobia{''} and the ``anglophobia{''}; the war episodes. In
   the 21st century, the geoeconomical competition for the control of the
   energetic resources of Eurasia has Russia, the United States, China,
   India and Iran as protagonists. The New Great Game is an imagologic
   conflict between global democracy, that according to the ideology of
   Eurasian atlanticism would have to expand in the post-Soviet space
   through the ``coloured revolutions{''} and ``sovereign democracy{''},
   and ``eurasianism{''}, that is the paradigmatic ideologeme of Russian
   geopolitical idea for the 21st century. In the context of the New Great
   Game, the Ukrainian question is emblematic: the West intends to complete
   the Orange Revolution of 2004, while Russia supports a kind of
   counter-revolution to complete the geopolitical project of the Eurasian
   Union.},

Abstract = {The 2007-2009 financial crisis has led to considerable debate about the
   role of financial industry actors in global regulatory processes. This
   article seeks to contribute to this debate by assessing when and why
   financial industry actors mobilise in order to influence securities
   markets regulations. Do these mobilisation patterns suggest undue
   influence by a small set of powerful industry actors, or do they reflect
   the engagement of a more diverse set of actors representing broader
   public interests? It is argued that variation in mobilisation patterns
   is a function of: (1) institutional opportunity (the openness and
   accessibility of regulatory politics); and (2) demonstration effects
   (how crises increase the salience of regulatory issues). Empirical
   analyses suggest that the financial crisis diminished the diversity of
   mobilising actors. This trend, however, is reversed when the news media
   disseminate information about the costs of weak financial regulation and
   thereby increase the salience of regulatory issues.},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom holds that in order to evade electoral punishment
   governments obfuscate welfare state retrenchment. However, governments
   do not uniformly lose votes in elections after they cut back on welfare
   benefits or services. Recent evidence indicates that some of these
   unpopular reforms are in fact vote-winners for the government. Our study
   of eight Danish labor marked related reforms uses insights from
   experimental framing studies to evaluate the impact of welfare state
   retrenchment on government popularity. We hypothesize that communicating
   retrenchment is a better strategy than obfuscating retrenchment
   measures. In addition, we hypothesize that the opposition's choice
   between arguing against the retrenchment measure, or staying silent on
   the issue, affects the government's popularity. Thus, the study presents
   a novel theoretical model of the popularity effects of welfare state
   retrenchment. In order to evaluate our propositions, we move beyond the
   standard measure in the literature and use monthly opinion polls to
   reduce the number of other factors that might affect government
   popularity. We demonstrate that governments can evade popular punishment
   by communication. They can even gain popularity if the opposition
   chooses not to attack. On the other hand, government popularity declines
   if the government obfuscates - and the decline is even larger if the
   opposition chooses to attack.},

Abstract = {Use of metaphors is a staple feature of how we understand policy
   processes - none more so than the use of policy stages'/'cycles' and
   multiple streams'. Yet even allowing for the necessary parsimony of
   metaphors, the former is often criticised for its lack of real world'
   engagement with agency, power, ideology, turbulence and complexity,
   while the latter focuses only on agenda-setting but at times has been
   utilised, with limited results, to understand later stages of the policy
   process. This article seeks to explore and advance the opportunities for
   combining both and applying them to the policy-formation and
   decision-making stages of policy making. In doing so it examines
   possible three, four and five stream models. It argues that a five
   stream confluence model provides the highest analytical value because it
   retains the simplicity of metaphors (combining elements of two of the
   most prominent models in policy studies) while also helping capture some
   of the more complex and subtle aspects of policy processes, including
   policy styles and nested systems of governance.},

Abstract = {Globalisation has been treated as a homogenising, even Americanising,
   process. Its complex nature means that its effects can be observed at
   various levels of analysis: economic, political, social, cultural and
   legal. The books under review here tackle different aspects of
   globalisation, with the overarching theme of US hegemony and how that
   has been employed in the reconfiguration of the global order. Two titles
   deal specifically with British decline, albeit without a perspective
   informed by political economy, the absence of which is argued to weaken

Abstract = {This essay provides a feminist analysis of Charles Mills' The Racial
   Contract. I begin by describing how The Racial Contract simultaneously
   embraces and challenges key feminist understandings of the ``male
   gaze{''} and the corporeal inscription of power. I also illuminate how
   feminist conceptions of intersectionality inform Mills' theorizing and
   discuss what an expanded intersectional account of the racial contract
   might look like. The rest of the essay demonstrates that both The Racial
   Contract and Mills' more recent ``Intersecting Contracts{''} raise
   important questions about the relationship between interrogating
   intersectional experience and fostering progressive politics. I draw on
   these texts to conclude that social groups who interrogate their
   experience of oppression are frequently motivated to embrace progressive
   politics and that these groups' process of interrogation is often
   informed by anti-progressive politics.},

   In this sense, and with the aim of contributing to the ongoing debate
   about the ``crisis of Marxism{''}, we believe that there is a need for a
   tour of the production of certain Latin American authors that, somehow,
   have echoed this problematic. We believe that the duo Nahuel Moreno-John
   Beverley can be interesting for relieving these debates, because it
   allowed us to address this issue from different perspectives, which
   contain in themselves, different definitions of marxism.},

Abstract = {This article is an examination of the rising prominence of House of
   Commons select committees during the 2010-2015 Parliament, which takes
   into account the impact of the Wright reforms. The new system of
   electing committee chairs and members is explored as a central reform
   that has burnished the autonomy, independence and credibility of the
   committees. In addition, the characteristics of the coalition government
   and circumstances entailed by a two-party executive are seen as factors
   that have made more robust the neutrality of the committees, which have
   been looked to ever more urgently as impartial scrutineers of government
   policy and personnel. As the system has been strengthened and received
   greater attention from the government, the public and the media, select
   committees have also come to present a platform upon which certain
   members and chairs have grown their profile. This phenomenon in turn has
   added to the desirability of roles on committees, which now present an
   alternative career route to the ministerial ladder.},

Abstract = {This article's point of departure is that the national
   self-determination doctrine remains one of the most paradoxical,
   contested, but successful doctrines which has largely contributed to the
   shape of our existing international system of nation-states. It argues
   that the doctrine which is intended to safeguard peace and human dignity
   is and always has been at the heart of many conflicts. Starting with the
   tension between the universality of the national self-determination
   doctrine and the particularity of the national group whose interests it
   promotes, the article explores other paradoxes contained within this
   doctrine. They range from political and legitimacy challenges to the
   very nation-state it creates, through the violations of human rights
   contrary to its very meaning, to the fact that national
   self-determination doctrine, far from being a national issue, is
   actually an international affair. While not rejecting the doctrine, the
   paper concludes with the final (ninth) paradox that perhaps the success
   of this doctrine should not be measured by how many states it can
   produce, but how it can make the existing states a safe home for more
   self-differentiating national groups.},

Abstract = {In the digital world, notions of intimacy, communion and sharing are
   increasingly enacted through new media technologies and social practices
   which emerge around them. These technologies with the ability to upload,
   download and disseminate content to select audiences or to a wider
   public provide opportunities for the creation of new forms of rituals
   which authenticate and diarise everyday experiences. Consumption
   cultures in many ways celebrate the notion of the exhibit and the
   spectacle inviting gaze through everyday objects and rituals. Food as a
   vital part of culture, identity, belonging, and meaning making
   celebrates both the everyday and the invitation to renew connections
   through food as a universal subject of appeal. Food imagery as a form of
   transacted materiality online offers familiarity, comfort, co-presence
   but above all a common elemental literacy where food transcends cultural
   barriers, offering a universal pull towards a commodity which is
   ephemeral yet preserved through the click economy. Food is symbolic of
   human solidarity, sociality and sharing and equally of difference
   creating a spectacle and platform for conversations, conventions,
   connections, and vicarious consumption. Food images symbolise connection
   at a distance through everyday material culture and practices.},

Abstract = {While the rise of right-wing populism in West European politics has
   received considerable attention in academic circles, the equivalent
   phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) remains understudied. I
   address this gap by examining the factors contributing to right-wing
   populist party success in CEE. I argue that the success of such parties
   is best explained by the presence of salient ethnic minority parties. I
   propose that successful ethnic minority parties heighten the salience of
   ethno-nationalist divisions within a state, creating electoral demand
   for parties of the populist right. Political elites capitalize on the
   fear generated by the presence of strong minority parties and channel it
   into electoral support for the populist right. Performing statistical
   analysis on an original dataset of 108 CEE elections, I find evidence
   that the electoral performance of right-wing populist parties is
   influenced by the performance of ethnic minority parties and their
   participation in government.},

Abstract = {The article focuses on group-based features of issue publics and
   advances the concept of residual group saliency as a way to organize
   members of issue publics. We accord veterans exemplar or prototype
   status, and civilians as periphery members of this issue public. As
   issue public exemplars, veterans anchor the ``right{''} attitudes and
   behaviors for the veteran issue public, and civilians, especially those
   with family ties to veterans, gravitate toward those exemplar attitudes.
   We argue that pressure to conform to these ``right{''} attitudes among
   civilians who are connected to a veteran is greater when there are more
   veterans in their environment. However, veterans and civilians who are
   not connected to a veteran are not responsive to such contextual
   effects, the former because they are already exemplars, and the latter
   because there is no motivation to evaluate the self in relation to
   veterans. We test and find support for these claims using data from the
   2010 Cooperative Congressional Election Study. We conclude with an
   evaluative discussion and suggestions for future research.},

Title = {Multiculturalism and contextualism: How is context relevant for
   political theory?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Many political theorists of multiculturalism (e.g. Joseph Carens, Bhikhu
   Parekh, James Tully) describe their theories as ``contextualist.'' But
   it is unclear what ``contextualism'' means and what difference it makes
   for political theory. I use a specific prominent example of a
   multiculturalist discussion, namely Tariq Modood's argument about
   ``moderate secularism,'' as a test case and distinguish between
   different senses of contextualism. I discuss whether the claim that
   political theory is contextual in each sense is novel and interesting,
   and whether contextualism is a distinct feature of political theory of
   multiculturalism. I argue that the forms of contextualism which concern
   the scope and methodology of political theory are sensible, but not
   novel or distinctive of multiculturalism. I then discuss the more
   controversial forms of contextualism, which I call political and
   theoretical contextualism. Finally, I apply the distinctions to Modood's
   argument. I argue that it is not a form of theoretical contextualism and
   that theoretical contextualism would in fact undermine arguments for
   multiculturalist policies of accommodation.},

Abstract = {In this article, I aim to qualify the contribution of the moral
   philosophy of Kant for the understanding of human dignity, in its
   contemporary acceptance. Indeed, I consider that only quick and
   non-contextualized readings of Kant's writings, may deduce from them the
   recognition of an intrinsic and absolute worth for all human beings. In
   order to reach this purpose, I first define the basic features of the
   current pattern of human dignity. The latter seems to be understood
   within the political and legal field (cornerstone of human rights and
   superior principle of the rule of law) and the axiological sphere
   (inherent and absolute worth). Then, I try to map if we can find those
   meanings and characteristics among some quoted expressions that Kant
   makes of ``dignity{''} and other related formulas ({''}end in
   itself{''}, ``humanity{''}). Thus, when those notions are
   contextualized, taking into account the motivations and outcomes
   underlying and resulting from Kant's moral philosophy, I come to the
   conclusion that Kant was not interested in the worth of human being
   (with its respect and rights) but rather in the authority of his pattern
   of morality.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to test if Twitter is opening communication flows
   between parties and paving the way for the appearance of network
   leaderships or if it is reducing them to representatives of the same
   party or ideology and empowering party leaders. The study is based on a
   dataset spanning from 1 January 2013 to 31 March 2014 which covers all
   relationships (4,516), retweets (6,045) and mentions (19,507) of Catalan
   parliamentarians. The data sustain that the political polarisation of
   Catalan parliamentarians' Twitter flows is deeper in the relationship
   and retweet networks than it is in the mention and that even if party
   leaders are still at the centre of communication flows, other
   parliamentarians are taking the floor and becoming network leaders.},

   Autonomy},
Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},

Volume = {43},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Nineteenth-century American political thinkers like Emerson, Thoreau,
   and Whitman advocated for and sought to exemplify a life of
   self-direction and critical self-reflection, or personal autonomy, as a
   means of contesting entrenched routines of democratic-capitalist
   normalization and as a way of resisting a host of institutional
   disciplinary pressures. Today, the ideal of personal autonomy within a
   diverse liberal society is branded by many as a form of comprehensive
   disciplinary normalization in its own right. In this essay I offer a
   reconsideration of this reversal in the appraisal of the value of
   autonomy within pluralistic democratic societies and argue that the
   abandonment of autonomy is a symptom of a mistaken understanding of the
   personal-ethical qualities upon which a democratic culture depends and a
   maladaptive concession to neoliberal norms. To confront these
   challenges, I draw upon a range of Emerson's writings to offer some
   ideas about how a reconstructed ideal of aspirational autonomy might
   inform contemporary politics without unduly constraining moral pluralism
   or undermining toleration.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},

Volume = {68},
Number = {2},
Pages = {211-224},

Abstract = {This paper tests whether local religious institutions have a dampening
   effect on the probability of communal violence. It argues that a dense
   layer of institutions strengthens horizontal and vertical contacts and
   networks within religious communities. Horizontal linkages help to
   bridge social, economic, and ethnic divisions. Vertical contacts enable
   religious leaders to stay informed about communal grievances among their
   followers and to coordinate conflict resolution attempts. In our
   analysis of more than 60,000 villages in Indonesia, we are able to
   document a statistically significant and substantively meaningful
   negative effect of the density of local religious institutions on the
   probability of mass fighting. This effect is robust to the inclusion of
   an exhaustive list of confounding variables and alternative measures of
   violence. We present additional evidence that this pacifying effect of
   religious institutions is weaker or absent in conflicts that evolve
   along explicitly religious cleavages.},

Abstract = {This contribution analyzes the public discourse on foreigners and
   Muslims in Switzerland between 2000 and 2009. In Switzerland, as
   elsewhere in Europe, the Muslim minority has emerged as the main concern
   for integration in public discourse. What makes Muslims special in the
   debate on immigration and integration? How does the public discourse on
   Muslims differ from the portrayal of foreigners in general? A
   quantitative content analysis of four Swiss newspapers was conducted
   covering three direct democratic campaigns. While the demographic
   composition of the Muslim minority has not changed substantially, the
   way Muslims are perceived in public discourse did. Certain ethnic
   groups, which are still categorized as foreigners in 2000, are mainly
   assigned to the Muslim minority in 2009. The latter is seen as a
   relatively homogeneous group raising other issues than foreigners. These
   results should lead to question the current academic and political
   debate on integration in Switzerland.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes endogenous and exogenous constructions of the
   political identities of Latin American members of the G20, namely
   Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. It examines effects of G20 membership and
   other aspects of international relations, with a constructivist analysis
   of their political identities as ``insiders{''} or ``outsiders{''} in
   multilateral economic governance. G20 scholars note the forum's
   heterogeneity of coalitions on diverse issues, so policy divergence
   between the three governments is to be expected. This study focuses on
   the social construction of their identities in the G20, partly as a
   consequence of in-group perspectives and effects of the forum as what I
   call a ``partial normative community.{''} It analyzes official
   government statements; the consequences of international alliances, or
   lack thereof; policy objectives and agenda-setting activities, including
   Mexico's G20 Presidency in 2012; and overall participation of the three
   governments in multilateral cooperation since the 2008 financial crisis.
   I analyze similarities and differences between them, demonstrating the
   strategic consequences of political identity constructions in the G20.},

Abstract = {Scholars have long noted how President Franklin D. Roosevelt used a
   network of formal and informal advisors and executive agencies. Few if
   any, however, have noted the advisory role played by Anna Rosenberg
   during the war years. Using both personal and presidential papers, this
   article explores the diverse ways that Rosenberg assisted Roosevelt,
   including conveying the demands of African American leaders, supervising
   troubled agencies, and most important, serving as the president's alter
   ego in labor-management relations.},

Title = {Talking Politics on Facebook: Network Centrality and Political
   Discussion Practices in Social Media},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {68},
Number = {2},
Pages = {377-391},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study examines the relationship between political discussion on
   Facebook and social network location. It uses a survey name generator to
   map friendship ties between students at a university and to calculate
   their centralities in that network. Social connectedness in the
   university network positively predicts more frequent political
   discussion on Facebook. But in political discussions, better connected
   individuals do not capitalize equally on the potential influence that
   stems from their more central network locations. Popular individuals who
   have more direct connections to other network members discuss politics
   more often but in politically safer interactions that minimize social
   risk, preferring more engaged discussion with like-minded others and
   editing their privacy settings to guard their political disclosures.
   Gatekeepers who facilitate connections between more pairs of otherwise
   disconnected network members also discuss politics more frequently, but
   are more likely to engage in risk-tolerant discussion practices such as
   posting political updates or attempting political persuasion. These
   novel findings on social connectedness extend research on offline
   political discussion into the social media sphere, and suggest that as
   social network research proliferates, analysts should consider how
   various types of network location shape political behavior.},

Abstract = {The Arab Uprisings continue to re-shape the political environment of the
   Middle East. As the epicentres of Egypt, Iraq and Syria draw the bulk of
   international attention, the impact of the last four years has been felt
   in more subtle ways, with a reconfiguring of alliances and relationships
   throughout the region. This article reviews the relationship between
   Saudi Arabia and the United States. There is a special focus on the
   challenges faced in the period of the Arab Uprisings from 2010 to 2014,
   with reference to the role of an ascendant Iran and the emergence of the
   Islamic State. Through an exploration of the three traditional pillars
   of the Saudi-US relationship; oil, geostrategic considerations and
   security, the article charts the current state of the alliance and
   explores the likely future trajectory of this lynchpin relationship in
   modern Middle Eastern affairs.},

Abstract = {The article aims to describe how the measurement and monitoring of human
   rights have been changed and weakened by the neoliberal resistance to
   social rights. In so doing, the study describes the political and
   ideological context which stimulated the broad conception of human
   rights included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It then
   focuses on the ideological turn which occurred over the 1970s from
   welfare democracy to neoliberal democracy and the neoliberal approach to
   human rights. Based on a neo-Gramscian approach, the study considers
   political and ideological reasons as key in explaining both the rise and
   fall of social rights and the changes in their measurement. As a case in
   point, the article analyses the work of the UN in measuring and
   monitoring human rights. In spite of the use by the UN committees of
   indicators and guidelines aimed at measuring and monitoring the
   progressive realization of all human rights, results show that the
   reluctance of many states to implement social and economic rights makes
   UN efforts ineffective. Both states' reluctance and instruments'
   ineffectiveness can be ascribed to the neoliberal delegitimization of
   social rights, which is likely to persist in spite of the recent
   economic crisis.},

Abstract = {Albert Weale's Democratic Justice and the Social Contract is an
   important book. It offers an innovative and original (proceduralist)
   account of justice. In so doing, it places what Brian Barry called the
   empirical method' at the centre of normative political philosophy's
   attempts to generate determinate answers to moral questions. This
   article - written from the perspective of someone sympathetic to both
   the commitment to mutual advantage and the empirical method - focuses on
   the kind of argument it is that Weale is offering and in particular on
   the nature of his constructivist project. It argues that Weale's
   commitment to equality lies outside the constructivist project and that
   this undermines his aspiration to genuine constructivism. The article
   goes on to consider, on the basis of arguments found in Democratic
   Justice and the Social Contract, various ways in which Weale might have
   grounded his egalitarian commitments from within the constructivist
   project.},

Title = {State fiscal capacity and state failure},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {167-187},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper develops a predatory theory approach to understanding state
   failure. Predatory theory expects that state revenue extraction is
   central to the ability of states to engage in any other activities.
   States that are able to maximize their revenue extraction subject to
   well-known constraints are therefore likely to avoid state failure. On
   the other hand, when state failure occurs, it should reduce state
   revenue extraction. These hypotheses receive mixed support in several
   two-stage least-squares time-series analyses that control for the
   endogenous relationship between state fiscal capacity and state failure.
   While state failure reduces state fiscal capacity, state fiscal capacity
   does not deter state failure onset or incidence. In the sub-Saharan
   African subsample, state fiscal capacity does reduce the incidence of
   state failure despite a reciprocal negative effect.},

Number = {2, SI},

Abstract = {East Asian financial regionalism was born in response to the Asian
   Financial Crisis of 1997-1998. The centrepiece of financial regionalism
   was the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI), an emergency liquidity mechanism
   created by the ASEAN+3. It embodied both a clear interpretation of what
   had gone wrong in 1997-1998 and an understanding of the need for
   institutions that would be politically viable despite Sino-Japanese
   rivalry. Enforcement under CMI relied on the `IMF link' - release of
   funds would be predicated on crisis countries' initiating negotiations
   with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as a means of reducing moral
   hazard, enforcing conditionality and diverting blame from the leading
   creditors, Japan and China. The global financial crisis of 2008-2010 and
   the eurozone crisis that followed have inspired important changes meant
   to address CMI's economic gaps, including accelerated adoption of `CMI
   Multilateralization' (CMIM), the creation of a new surveillance unit
   (ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Organization, or AMRO), and the
   establishment of a new precautionary line. Many observers have remarked
   that these developments weaken the IMF link, which had effectively
   subordinated CMI to the IMF. While the moves appear to demonstrate a
   more confident, autonomous regionalism and a relative devaluation of the
   US-dominated global financial institutions, this paper argues that in
   fact, the ASEAN+3 states have again unearthed the underlying politics of
   divided leadership and mutual suspicion. CMIM is now threatened by the
   renewed potential for internal divisions. Further complicating the
   picture, both China and Japan have recently established large bilateral
   swap lines outside of the CMIM framework with several of their ASEAN+3
   partners, raising the question of whether CMIM is moving towards
   political irrelevance even as it has arrived at a high water mark in its
   institutional development.},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {This analysis challenges claims that regime type determines national
   economic performance, and hypothesizes that the level of public
   deliberation, rather than broad categories of regime type, is the driver
   of national economic performance across political systems; specifically,
   that negotiations, disagreements, and compromises between decentralized
   decision-making partisans (e.g., citizens, business representatives,
   professional associations, labor, and public administrators) are the
   underlying causal mechanism explaining the non-monotonic relationship
   between different types of political system and economic performance.
   Countries with high levels of public deliberation more often experience
   stable growth outcomes, while other countries can make radical changes
   in economic policy with uncertain outcome. The variation in public
   deliberation within regime type is significant, especially amongst
   authoritarian regimes. One startling implication is that, in certain
   situations, impressive gains in economic growth can be achieved only at
   the expense of active negotiation and participation in the policy-making
   process.},

Abstract = {Charges are frequently leveled that the peer-review system is broken,
   and reviewers are overburdened with requests. But this specific charge
   has been made in the absence of data about the actual reviewing loads of
   political scientists. I report the results of a recent survey asking a
   random sample of about 600 APSA members with PhDs what their reviewing
   loads are like and what their beliefs are about the value of peer
   reviewing to them and others. Article reviewing loads correspond to
   rank, institution, and scholarly productivity in predictable ways. At
   PhD-granting institutions, assistant professors averaged 5.5, associate
   professors averaged 7.0, and full professors averaged 8.3 in the past
   year; everyone else averaged just under 3 reviews a year. To recognize
   the value we place on peer reviewing, we need a system that collects
   data on who reviews and presents them in a format usable by scholars and

Title = {News attention to voter fraud in the 2008 and 2012 US elections},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2},

Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {The nature and frequency of voter fraud figure prominently in many
   ongoing policy debates about election laws in the United States. Policy
   makers frequently cite allegations of voter fraud reported in the press
   during these debates. While recent studies find that voter fraud is a
   rare event, a substantial segment of the public believes that voter
   fraud is a rampant problem in the United States. It stands to reason
   that public beliefs are shaped by news coverage of voter fraud. However,
   there is very little extant academic research on how the news media, at
   any level, covers allegations or documented cases of voter fraud. This
   paper examines local newspaper attention to voter fraud in each of the
   50 states during the 2008 and 2012 US elections. The results show that
   local coverage of voter fraud during the 2012 elections was greatest in
   presidential swing states and states that passed restrictive voting laws
   prior to the 2012 election. No evidence that newspaper attention is
   related to the rate of actual voter fraud cases in each state was found.
   The findings are consistent with other studies indicating that parties
   and campaigns sought to place voter fraud on the political agenda in
   strategically important states to motivate their voting base ahead of
   the election.},

Abstract = {Numerous prominent theories have relied on the concept of audience costs
   as a central causal mechanism in their arguments about international
   conflict, but scholars have had greater difficulty in demonstrating the
   efficacy and even the existence of such costs outside the bounds of game
   theory and the political psychology laboratory. We suggest that the
   audience costs argument focuses too narrowly on the likelihood that
   leaders will be removed from office by domestic constituencies for
   failing to make good on threats. Instead, we argue that scholars should
   ground these arguments on Alastair Smith's () broader concept of
   competency costs. Our analysis of presidential legislative success from
   1953 to 2001 demonstrates the existence of foreign policy competency
   costs by showing that public disapproval of presidential handling of
   militarized interstate disputes has a significant and substantial
   negative impact on the president's ability to move legislation on
   domestic issues through Congress.},

Abstract = {Nuclear energy continues to be a major component of South Korean energy
   policy, despite the nuclear accident in Fukushima and several incidents
   in domestic nuclear power plants in 2011. There is growing unease among
   the Korean public regarding the safety of nuclear energy, but these
   grievances do not translate into demands for policy changes. This
   article introduces how different actors and their preferences affected
   the public agenda related to nuclear energy, comparing the protests
   against a nuclear waste storage facility in Buan County in 2003 and 2004
   with the reactions to the Fukushima accident and domestic incidents in
   more recent years. Using agenda-setting theory, this article aims to
   shed light on the dynamics of these events on actors, the
   decision-making processes and the reasons for the lack of concerted
   effort by citizens and civic groups to demand changes in the country's
   energy policies.},

Abstract = {Co-decisions between the Council of Ministers and the European
   Parliament are increasingly adopted as early agreements. Recent EU
   studies have pinpointed how this informal turn in EU governance has
   altered the existing balance of power between EU actors and within EU
   institutions. However, the implications of accelerated EU
   decision-making are expected to have repercussions beyond the EU system
   and in other institutions impinging on the role of national parliaments.
   This study examines the implications of an alteration of EU political
   time on national parliaments' ability to scrutinize their executives in
   EU affairs. A mixed method approach has been applied. This strategy
   combines survey data on national parliaments' scrutiny process and
   response to early agreements for 26 EU countries with a case study
   examination of national parliaments in Denmark, the UK and Germany. The
   burgeoning research agenda on EU timescapes is applied. This study finds
   that the clocks of most national parliaments are out of time with the EU
   decision-mode of early agreements, which severely hampers the national
   parliaments' ability to scrutinize national governments.},

Pages = {25-62},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Trying to explain French elections sometimes seems like trying to see
   through a blinding snowstorm. But a focus on choice and outcome in
   presidential contests provides a clear path to their understanding.
   These elections, paramount in themselves, frame the lesser contests.
   Here we develop a theory of French presidential elections, using a
   French-style Michigan Model of political behavior. The theory explains
   these presidential results as a function of long-term forces (for
   example, social factors and ideological identification) and short-term
   forces (for example, campaign issues such as immigration, the economy
   and Europe). The theory is tested against election survey data from the
   five most recent elections (1988-2012). In general, it accounts well for
   outcomes in these contests. In particular, it explains why Sarkozy lost
   in 2012.},

Abstract = {David Walker's famous 1829 Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World
   expresses a puzzle at the very outset. What are we to make of the use of
   Citizens in the title given the denial of political rights to African
   Americans? This essay argues that the pamphlet relies on the cultural
   and linguistic norms associated with the term appeal in order to call
   into existence the political standing of black folks. Walker's use of
   citizen does not need to rely on a recognitive legal relationship
   precisely because it is the practice of judging that illuminates one's
   political, indeed, citizenly standing. Properly understood, the Appeal
   aspires to transform blacks and whites, and when it informs the
   prophetic dimension of the text, it tilts the entire pamphlet in a
   democratic direction. This is the political power of the pamphlet; it
   exemplifies the call-and-response logic of democratic self-governance.},

Abstract = {Much of the extant literature on Thatcherism sees the approach of
   Thatcher and her Government as gradual and piecemeal. This article
   argues, using material from the Thatcher archive, whilst it is clear
   that a distinct Thatcherite policy took time to implement, a relatively
   coherent new Right programme existed from the 1970s. The article argues,
   however, that central to the impact of Thatcher was not so much policy
   but the way she reshaped politics. The Thatcher Government effectively
   rejected politics as compromise rather seeing it as a zero-sum game. In
   doing so Thatcherism politicized a range of social relations and
   transformed the nature of British politics.},

Abstract = {The 2002 presidential and National Assembly elections were the first
   after constitutional changes ensured the presidential election would
   immediately precede the legislative election. Using both qualitative and
   quantitative evidence, I argue that before the institutional reforms,
   debates in legislative elections had three characteristics: a focus on
   substantive policy issues, framing cohabitation as a shift in which
   party controlled the power to set the policy agenda and few incursions
   into the legislative election by the President. After the changes,
   debates in legislative elections were devoid of policy issues, framed
   cohabitation as a weakening of the President's power to set the agenda
   and featured more incursions by the President into the campaign. This
   caused voters to identify the parties more in terms of those parties'
   presidential candidates.},

Abstract = {China's performance regarding nuclear nonproliferation has experienced a
   tremendous change. From 1963 to the present, China dramatically moved
   from opponent of to proponent for nuclear nonproliferation. This
   literature only pays attention to this phenomenal change, without
   delineating the incremental stages in different phases that comprise the
   overall change. This article breaks down the overall change into four
   incremental shifts and specifically explains each of them. Close
   examination shows that these shifts were driven by different motives.
   The analysis leads to the conclusion that China's preferences in its
   nuclear nonproliferation decision making are driven by rational
   concerns.},

Abstract = {Intergovernmental conflict over the allocation of resource revenue in
   federal systems is not uncommon. However, there is remarkably little
   scholarship on how such political tensions are managed in different
   federations and whether, over time, resource politics can reshape
   federal dynamics. This article assesses these questions through a
   strategic comparison of resource federalism in Canada and Australia
   since the 1970s. We argue that the political and institutional
   strategies employed within the Canadian federation, with its greater
   commitment to fiscal and political decentralization, has been more adept
   at managing short term political tensions associated with resource booms
   relative to the Australian model, with its creeping centrism and
   entrenched system of horizontal equalization. The study also finds that,
   over time, resource conflict has the potential to shape the practice of
   federalism in resource-rich jurisdictions by providing political
   incentives to decentralize nonrenewable resource revenue collection.},

Abstract = {In both 2008 and 2012, about one third of the American electorate cast
   their votes early. While early voting programs are established by
   states, counties have considerable discretion with regard to
   implementing them. While some counties offer only a single early voting
   site, others offer dozens. Previous research suggests that site density
   may affect the degree to which programs increase turnout. I use
   county-level data from the 2008 and 2012 elections to measure whether a
   county's racial and ethnic composition predicts high (or low) levels of
   site density. Applying county-level data from the Election Assistance
   Commission and American Community Survey, I find that the percentage of
   a county identifying as Black has a significantly negative association
   with early voting site density. This relationship persists when numerous
   demographic covariates are included in ordinary least squares models.
   These site disparities suggest that early voting may not be achieving
   its full potential in heavily African American communities.},

Abstract = {This article argues that digital media are introducing a new

   challenges the dominant professionalized model of campaign management by
   devolving power over core tasks to the grassroots. After defining the
   practice through reference to the 2008 campaign of Barack Obama and
   online parties literature, we devise a measure of CIC that is applied to
   UK parties in the 2010 election. Our findings show that CIC is emerging
   outside the U.S. and adoption is associated with major party status,
   although it may be of particular appeal to political actors facing a
   resource deficit. The conclusions focus on the implications of CIC for
   new forms of party membership, indirect voter mobilization and the
   contextual factors influencing this new model of campaigning.},

Abstract = {This article presents the first systematic database, based on
   documentary information, about the circumstances around the kidnappings
   committed in Spain by ETA and its related organizations. Its main
   purpose, therefore, is to make the database itself publicly available
   for the academic community by offering free access to it in the website
   of our research group. We also provide a first utilization of the
   database by analyzing its different variables, which gives us a better
   understanding of the phenomenon of Basque nationalist terrorism, whose
   violent action has been present in Spanish society over the past
   decades.},

Abstract = {How are we to explain U.S. foreign policy-particularly policy making on
   national security-during the transformative years of the G. W. Bush
   administration? Who were the actors and what were the factors that
   produced what were some of the most controversial policies? This article
   argues that security choices and decisions have been the results of the
   work and methods of ``policy entrepreneurs.{''} It looks first at
   theoretical approaches to entrepreneurs and their influence over the
   formulation of national security policy, and secondly at who those
   entrepreneurs were and how they achieved their goal of transforming U.S.
   security policy. Two decisions are discussed: the invasion of Iraq and
   the legal redefinition of torture by the G. W. Bush administration.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The effect of state regulation of religion on governance has been
   explored theoretically by scholars, but it has not been tested
   empirically across nation states. The theory posits that secular states
   are more likely to benefit from better governance because of the absence
   of clerical involvement in politics, paving the way for the expansion of
   civil society and the passage of progressive political, economic, and
   social reforms. Using a unique dataset of more than 100 nation states, I
   find that countries with higher levels of state intervention on religion
   are more likely to suffer from inferior governance as reflected by
   higher levels of corruption and political instability and lower levels
   of rule of law entrenchment, bureaucratic effectiveness, and regulatory
   quality. Furthermore, states wherein there is no distinct separation
   between church and state are more likely to have lower levels of
   political openness and accountability.},

Abstract = {Turning out for elections can be treated as an indication of long-term
   support for a political system, if citizens perceive that system as
   legitimate. Applied to the level of the European Union this would
   suggest that levels of participation in elections to the European
   Parliament are crucial to the legitimacy of the EU's political system.
   Due to the multi-level character of these elections, however, causes for
   relatively low levels of turnout may be located at the national as well
   as the European level. We will use individual-level survey data to
   analyse the reasons for voter participation at European elections in
   Germany. Based on system-theoretic arguments we develop a model of voter
   participation including both European and national factors. The results
   of our binominal logistic regression models suggest that participation
   at European elections depends on individual characteristics like
   political interest on the one hand and perceptions of the performance of
   both the EU and the national government on the other.},

   Political Dissatisfaction in Italy, 1973-2013},

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {This article analyses the long-term dissatisfaction of citizens with
   democracy in Italy in light of the economic and institutional
   transformations that have occurred over the last four decades. Using
   multilevel analysis, the results challenge previous research showing how
   poor economic performance in the form of unemployment and inflation has
   increased dissatisfaction. Most importantly, the article demonstrates
   that the widespread political dissatisfaction can be connected to
   fragmentation of the party system. In this regard, the impact of the
   electoral reforms that have been introduced are assessed. These favoured
   a recovery of satisfaction between the First' and the Second' Republic
   due to the emergence of bi-polar political competition. However, the
   effect has been contained by an inability to substantially reduce the
   number of parties. By drawing on compelling data, this study provides
   systematic evidence of the macro-foundations of Italian political
   discontent.},

Abstract = {Public sector unions are major interest groups in American politics, but
   they are rarely studied. New research would not only shed much-needed
   light on how these unions shape government and politics, but also
   broaden the way scholars think about interest groups generally: by
   highlighting interests that arise inside governments, drawing attention
   to long-ignored types of policies and decision arenas, and underlining
   the importance of groups in subnational politics. Here we explore the
   effects of public sector unions on the costs of government. We present
   two separate studies, using different datasets from different historical
   periods, and we examine several outcomes: salaries, health benefits, and
   employment. We find that unions and collective bargaining increase the
   costs of government and that the effects are especially large for
   benefits. We view this analysis as an opening wedge that we hope will
   encourage a more extensive line of new research-and new thinking about
   American interest groups.},

Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {97-117},
Abstract = {One of the most important reasons for the expansion of Eurosceptic
   parties is the worsening of the economic crisis. This and, more
   generally, the processes of globalization/denationalization have not had
   the same effects for all citizens; a new structural conflict, opposing
   the ``winners{''} and ``losers{''} of globalization, has arisen.
   Usually the mainstream political parties tend to take the ``winners'{''}
   side, while the peripheral parties tend to adopt a ``loser's{''}'
   programme and to use Euroscepticism as a mobilizing issue; the electoral
   constituency of the Eurosceptic parties is therefore formed, above all,
   by the ``losers{''} of globalization. The 2014 European elections
   represented an important turning point for the Eurosceptic parties; they
   obtained an unprecedentedly large percentage of votes, but no
   ``political earthquake{''}, ``sweeps{''}, or ``Europe's populist
   backlash{''} occurred. The Eurosceptic parties have never been able to
   form a joint anti-European front, because of their mutual mistrust.
   ``He's worse than me{''}, could be the statement that best epitomizes
   the relationships within the Eurosceptic right-wing camp.
   A further exacerbation of the economic crisis and/or the inability of
   the EU institutions in addressing it could lead such parties towards new
   and more considerable achievements.},

Abstract = {This article develops and utilises an ideal point index of judges to
   explain why they may cast conviction-based votes in contexts of
   institutional instability. In it, I modify the classic argument that an
   increase in institutional instability causes a commensurate increase in
   the likelihood of strategic voting. By instead proposing a curvilinear
   relationship between these two variables, the article proposes that,
   irrespective of the term length of the judges, an increase in
   institutional instability increases the probability of strategic voting
   only to a given point, after which, paradoxically, a greater degree of
   job uncertainty tends to favour conviction voting. This scenario
   provides incentives for the emergence of `judges without robes':
   attorneys who accept appointments as judges for a limited time, and who
   use the judicial arena to improve their personal prestige and portfolio
   of clients who will return to them for future consultation.},

Abstract = {Female gender and low income are two markers for groups that have been
   historically disadvantaged within most societies. The study explores two
   research questions related to their political representation: (1) Are
   parties biased towards the ideological preferences of male and rich
   citizens?'; and (2) Does the proportionality of the electoral system
   moderate the degree of under-representation of women and poor citizens
   in the party system?' A multilevel analysis of survey data from 24
   parliamentary democracies indicates that there is some bias against
   those with low income and, at a much smaller rate, women. This has
   systemic consequences for the quality of representation, as the
   preferences of the complementary groups differ. The proportionality of
   the electoral system influences the degree of under-representation:
   specifically, larger district magnitudes help in closing the
   considerable gap between rich and poor.},

Abstract = {Drawing on insights from Comparative Politics this article discusses
   social psychological processes in the context of foreign policy
   decision-making in small groups. This article examines whether certain
   types of governmental systems facilitate or impede the emergence of the
   antecedent conditions for Groupthink, which frequently leads to severe
   foreign policy mistakes ('fiascos'). Drawing on Arend Lijphart's
   typology of democratic systems of government, this article argues that
   majoritarian democracies feature structural characteristics pertaining
   to the organization and composition of decision-making groups in charge
   of foreign policy that promote the emergence of the antecedent
   conditions for Groupthink. Conversely, consensus democracies exhibit
   structural characteristics that render the emergence of Groupthink less
   likely.},

Abstract = {From 1917 through the present, sovereignty has been repeatedly recovered
   and reconfigured in Kazan and its hinterlands as the area was
   transferred from one complex polity to another. It is the frequent
   renegotiation of authority over multiple and redefinable units of
   political and economic control, rather than stability of institutions,
   that keeps the political class engaged in the reproduction of both the
   state and the Eurasian sovereignty regime.},

Volume = {23},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Challenging the existing literature, which tends to downplay the impact
   of good governance reform in post-Suharto Indonesia, the article
   suggests that greater intervention by international donors, combined
   with the process of decentralisation, has influenced the dynamics of
   political competition at the local level. It suggests that the
   increasing availability of international aid has provided local elites
   with an option to engage in a new form of patronage politics that relies
   less on old instruments, such as money politics and violence. By
   selectively committing themselves to good governance reform, Indonesian
   local elites can now seek a new source of power in the form of support
   from international donors, with which they can raise their profiles as
   `reformists' and consolidate power, only to engage in familiar, if less
   blatant, forms of patronage politics. The article highlights such a
   dimension of local politics with reference to the case of Kebumen's
   former regent, Rustriningsih.},

Abstract = {According to Jeremy Waldron, John Locke's argument for the instrumental
   irrationality of persecution is fatally flawed. In this paper, I offer
   evidence that Waldron has misread Locke, and that Locke's views about
   why persecution generally proves inefficacious have greater plausibility
   than Waldron allowed. Locke's argument for the irrationality of
   intolerance does not, as has been thought, rest on a tendentious
   ontological distinction between `the will' and `the understanding', but
   on an account of the adverse psychological reaction of victims of
   persecution to their plight. Persecution, Locke argued, provokes in its
   victims feelings of distrust and hostility that diminishes the chances
   that they will convert to the religion that has persecuted them. An
   appeal to the `victim's perspective' in order to dissuade would-be
   persecutors was a fundamental part of his case for toleration, and one
   that was noticed and employed by other proponents of toleration.},

Abstract = {A small but growing social science literature examines the
   correspondence between experimental results obtained in lab and field
   settings. This article reviews this literature and reanalyzes a set of
   recent experiments carried out in parallel in both the lab and field.
   Using a standardized format that calls attention to both the
   experimental estimates and the statistical uncertainty surrounding them,
   the study analyzes the overall pattern of lab-field correspondence,
   which is found to be quite strong (Spearman's r50.73). Recognizing that
   this correlation may be distorted by the ad hoc manner in which
   lab-field comparisons are constructed (as well as the selective manner
   in which results are reported and published), the article concludes by
   suggesting directions for future research, stressing in particular the
   need for more systematic investigation of treatment effect
   heterogeneity.},

Title = {The Limits of Epistemic Communities: EU Security Agencies},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {90-100},
Abstract = {This article examines the cases of the European Defence Agency (EDA) and
   EU Intelligence Analysis Centre (IntCen) to argue that although they are
   comprised of high-level security experts, they do not constitute
   epistemic communities. Research on other groups of security experts
   based in Brussels has shown that epistemic communities of diplomats,
   military experts, security researchers, and civilian crisis management
   experts, among others, have been able to influence the trajectory of
   security integration by virtue of their shared knowledge. Importantly,
   these security epistemic communities have been shown to significantly
   impact outcomes of EU security policy beyond what would be expected by
   looking only at member-states' initial preferences. In exploring two
   examples of ``non-cases{''} that are at the same time very similar to
   the other examples, the author seeks to shed light on why some expert
   groups do not form epistemic communities, and how this changes the
   nature of their influence. In so doing, the goal is to sharpen the
   parameters of what constitutes epistemic communities, and to add to our
   understanding of why they emerge. The argument advanced in this article
   is that institutional context and the nature of the profession matter as
   preconditions for epistemic community emergence.},

Abstract = {For some years now the clamor for democratisation of parties' internal
   functioning has been spreading across democracies. Among them, France
   has advanced impressively in the past few years. In 2006, the Socialist
   Party (PS) launched a closed primary to choose the socialist candidate,
   Segolene Royal, for the 2007 presidential election. Approaching the 2012
   presidential elections, the leftist coalition (PS and PRG) launched open
   primary elections to select its chief-executive candidates, with
   Francois Hollande finally emerging as a nominee.
   In this article, we shall examine how the socialist membership changed
   during the past three socialist congresses, analysing the outcome of the
   two above-mentioned primary elections. In particular, we shall observe
   the Le Mans (2005), Reims (2008) and Toulouse (2012) Congresses, and
   describe membership, participation, and competitiveness within the PS.
   The study was based on data collected from an administrative unit, the
   French departements.},

Title = {Russia and the World: 2016 IMEMO Forecast},
Journal = {NEW PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {93-122},
Abstract = {This forecast examines the major trends in Russia's relations with the
   world and in the Russian view of the world in 2016. The forecast looks
   firstly at Russia's role in the world in the context of the extant and
   emergent state of geopolitics. In a confused international environment,
   caught between the multiple, discordant and disorderly games of checkers
   of the present and the emerging design of a new grand chessboard for
   international relations, Russia and the West have been forced into
   cooperation. While far from easy and far from guaranteed to work - or
   last - this situation does offer the possibility of overcoming divides
   to pursue mutual interests. These interests become particularly apparent
   in the context of increased shared threats and the need to act jointly
   against them, the uncertainties created by rising powers, and the
   difficulties that Russia finds itself in. The key role of new
   mega-regional trade agreements in this emerging great game is also
   emphasised in the subsequent sections of the forecast, which deal,
   respectively, with foreign policy and political economy. The foreign
   policy analysis sees the US in flux in a presidential election year, and
   the EU caught at the crossroads of its own failure to capitalise on
   integration and a migration crisis of unprecedented proportions.
   Meanwhile, foreign policy in the post-Soviet space is characterised more
   by stasis than by substantial change, with frozen conflicts and stagnant
   reforms in Ukraine and limited room for manoeuvre for other players the
   order of the day. The Russian involvement in the Middle East, however,
   is anything but stagnant, with the military operations in Syria having
   dramatic effects in both the situation in Syria and global and regional
   geopolitics. The sustainability of this quest for influence, however, is
   questioned by the attitude of other players, but also by Russia's own
   internal weaknesses, notably its serious and deepening economic crisis.},

Pages = {44-54},
Abstract = {The dramatic events in Ukraine frustrate the world order that seemed to
   have just been established and do not offer any conceptual evaluations
   of it. The crisis is mostly considered to be of purely political nature
   and is discussed far less thoroughly than, for example, the Cold War
   used to be analysed. This article offers a review of the positions of
   certain American researchers who only partly share the Washington's
   point of view on the Ukranian crisis or disagree with it completely,
   though all fear the imminent changes. The study of their positions
   brings us to the understanding of concrete distinctions of the Russian
   and Western political cultures. All in all, Russia's geopolitical
   position, clearly underpinned by the determination to protect the
   country's national interests, clashes with the Western concept of
   democratic transformations, which, in turn, covers a desire for
   expanding the sphere of Western influence. The author attempts to
   demonstrate that the decisive concepts in interpreting the ``West vs
   non-West{''} conflict are those implying conservation, in the West, of
   the idea of nonWestern countries' modernization catching up with the
   West. This vision is not adequate to the reality of many non-Western
   countries, and first of all of Russia and China, being deeply involved
   in national modernization models borrowing the experience both of the
   West and of the non-West on the basis of the use of their own culture as
   resource of development. From this point of view, democracy does not
   present itself as a ready-made project, but is built by each country
   with due regard for possibility of its adoption by the masses. The
   problem is thus raised of the Russian traditional values being an
   annoying obstacle for the West. It is demonstrated that such values are
   inherent in the West likewise, and their renunciation would have led to
   anomy in the period of transition to the modern. Analyzing contemporary
   Western political and, still more attentively, political-science
   discourse, the author distinguishes in it - and criticizes - a visible
   trend of reducing the concept of Europe to the bounds of the EU. To sum
   it up, both political cultures - the Russian and the Western - contain
   common elements, but differing dominants. Their serious and reciprocal
   discussion may produce upheavals capable of preserving from irrevocable
   changes.},

Pages = {718-735},
Abstract = {After the Holocaust European antisemitism did not simply vanish into
   thin air and critical theorists drew attention to the new or secondary
   forms of antisemitism that arose in the postwar period. Among them
   Jurgen Habermas, a leading figure in the younger generation of critical
   theorists, is remarkable for confronting the legacy of European
   antisemitism in his his vision of a new Europe. His approach to the
   postnational constellation emphasised the importance of ongoing
   engagement with the history of European antisemitism and of
   reconstructing political community in ways that should make antisemitism
   less feasible in the future. While this paper endorses much of Habermas'
   analysis, it is critical of cracks in the edifice of his reconstruction
   which allow back in a certain form of European chauvinism and which make
   it possible to reach the premature judgement that the problem of
   antisemitism has been solved in Europe. The last part of the paper
   addresses the actual ways in which the cracks in the postnational
   edifice have provided footholds for the unwelcome return of the `Jewish
   question' to Europe and have made it difficult for critical theory to
   understand new forms of antisemitism emerging on the European landscape.
   The signs of an inversion of the cosmopolitan project - from critical
   engagement with the legacy of European antisemitism to an idealized
   image of European success in overcoming antisemitism -points to a
   misappropriation of cosmopolitanism that needs to be challenged.},

Abstract = {How does Jacques Ranciere construct a democratic approach to politics
   through his critique of Marxism as a ``metapolitics{''}? I will develop
   the hypothesis that Ranciere reconfigures the Marxist political subject
   by disconnecting it from its metapolitics, searching to think it rather
   in terms of improper excess, untimeliness and the force to forget. I
   will then define how Ranciere rethinks the concepts of time and
   knowledge, opening questions left in suspense in his thought on memory,
   strategy and power - questions that might belong to a more experimental
   and existential register. I will develop these questions through a study
   on the black movement in 1955-56 in Montgomery, Alabama.},

   Our Universities, which lacks services for disabled lectures and

   barriers as a difficulty very slightly solved but also concerning
   supportive staff; indeed, explicit discrimination in the statutes of
   some of these organisms persists towards this sector of people very

Abstract = {The British constitution's refusal to be limited by any specific
   determinable history must itself be seen historically: rising during the
   English Enlightenment, British franchise is described naturally and
   permanently in financial terms, specifically as incorporation into
   stable exchange - rather than as having any basis in its people. In a
   way that becomes more familiar with neoliberalism, British citizenship
   is based only in adjustment to the permanent good of `the economy'. We
   know that the British constitution must avoid any historical
   codification to be absolutely and automatically inclusive, and that
   since it has to maintain these terms of exchange, it must become ever
   more personal' and ever better at describing itself as neutral and
   natural - which means, beyond determinable time. This chapter suggests
   that self'-determination is simply the end of this empty financial time,
   and that the signs are readable outside Scotland as well as within.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},

Pages = {400-420},
Abstract = {Advocates commonly highlight the exploitation that hard-working
   undocumented immigrants commonly suffer at the hands of employers, the
   important contribution they make to the US economy, and the fiscal folly
   of border militarization and enhanced immigration enforcement policies.
   In this paper, I unpack these economic rationales for expanding
   immigrant rights, and examine the nuanced ways in which advocates deploy
   this frame. To do so, I rely on statements issued by publicly present
   immigrant rights groups in six places: California, Florida, Illinois,
   New York, Texas, and Washington, DC. I also draw on interviews with
   immigrant advocates in San Jose, CA and Houston, TX, press releases from
   two alternative national immigrant rights organizations, and an
   ethnographic photo-documentation of immigrant rights mobilizations in
   2012-2014. Economic rationales, I emphasize, can be found in each of
   these contexts, but are not mutually exclusive to other justifications,
   including narratives about civil, human, and family rights for
   immigrants. However, I argue that an economic framing of immigrant
   rights nonetheless runs the risk reifying work over conventional
   understandings of criminality, often relies on a narrow definition of
   economic worth, and could have negative consequences for coalition
   building.},

Abstract = {I test two potential mechanisms driving habitual voting: direct
   self-reinforcement of turnout and social ageing. I do so by critically
   examining a hypothesis proposed by Franklin who argues that the impact
   of electoral context on turnout declines as citizens experience more and
   more elections. I thus attempt to test whether the effects of context on
   turnout are indeed mediated by what is called ``electoral experience{''}
   or simply by age. As, in most cases, those two are nearly perfectly
   correlated, I utilize survey data from Switzerland where women were
   enfranchised late and thus many female respondents did not experience
   any elections until reaching relatively old age. My test suggests that
   it is not experience that mediates the impact of context on turnout. I
   find weak but suggestive ageing effects. Yet, those effects are
   surprisingly non-monotonic. The impact of context on turnout is
   relatively strong for the youngest eligible citizens to decline for
   those who have entered their 30s. It sharply increases, however, when
   people are, roughly, in their mid-40s to decline again late in life.},

Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {28},
Number = {112},

Abstract = {The Ukrainian protest movement of winter 2013-2014, known as Maidan in
   reference to the occupied main square in the center of Kiev, caused two
   types of protagonism to emerge among its ordinary participants. On the
   one hand, ordinary protagonism was displayed in the revolutionary
   routine, through the multiple activities organized in the public square
   (cooking, medical aid, safety patrols). It reflected peaceful forms of
   action that caused personalities to emerge on account of their long
   commitment, which was highlighted by the media and social networks. On
   the other hand, rebellious protagonism appeared when the protest became
   radicalized as a result of repression by the authorities. The
   opportunities for public recognition were enhanced when images of police
   violence against protestors were widely aired in the media. This type of
   protagonism relied on increased defiance toward the political elites,
   especially after the brutal days of February 18-20, 2014. It then became
   more of a political resource than synonymous with access to power.},

Title = {Accuracy gains of adding vote expectation surveys to a combined forecast
   of US presidential election outcomes},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {In averaging forecasts within and across four-component methods (i.e.
   polls, prediction markets, expert judgment and quantitative models), the
   combined PollyVote provided highly accurate predictions for the US
   presidential elections from 1992 to 2012. This research note shows that
   the PollyVote would have also outperformed vote expectation surveys,
   which prior research identified as the most accurate individual
   forecasting method during that time period. Adding vote expectations to
   the PollyVote would have further increased the accuracy of the combined
   forecast. Across the last 90 days prior to the six elections, a
   five-component PollyVote (i.e. including vote expectations) would have
   yielded a mean absolute error of 1.08 percentage points, which is 7\%
   lower than the corresponding error of the original four-component
   PollyVote. This study thus provides empirical evidence in support of two
   major findings from forecasting research. First, combining forecasts
   provides highly accurate predictions, which are difficult to beat for
   even the most accurate individual forecasting method available. Second,
   the accuracy of a combined forecast can be improved by adding component
   forecasts that rely on different data and different methods than the
   forecasts already included in the combination.},

Abstract = {George W. Bush was elected to the presidency in 2000 with a vision of
   compassionate conservatism. Attention has been devoted to his supply
   side fiscal policy and his expansionist foreign policy. However, less
   attention has been devoted to his social policy, particularly his
   expansion of the Food Stamp program. The 2002 Farm Bill, espoused and
   advocated by George W Bush, expanded access to Food Stamps and restored
   eligibility to immigrants. In this chapter, I argue the Food Stamp
   expansion allowed George W Bush to express his compassionate
   conservatism by examining the way he framed support of the program
   around traditional conservative themes such as the deserving poor and
   the need to reduce government waste and regulation.},

   elections. The United States has been held to deviate from other

   degree of divergence in the first two areas is generally overstated. In
   the third area, however-moneyit is true that the United States stands
   out. Yet the electoral consequences of this appear to be exaggerated.},

Volume = {43},

Abstract = {The U.S. Supreme Court is traditionally thought to hold little influence
   over social or political change; however, recent evidence suggests the
   Court may wield significant power, especially with regard to criminal
   justice. Most studies evaluate judicial power by examining the effects
   of individual rulings on the implementation of specific policies, but
   this approach may overlook the broader impact of courts on society.
   Instead, I adopt an aggregate approach to test U.S. Supreme Court power.
   I find that aggregate conservative decision making by the Court is
   positively associated with long-term shifts in new admissions to U.S.
   federal prisons. These results suggest the Court possesses significant
   power to influence important social outcomes, at least in the context of
   the criminal justice system.},

Title = {DAVID AND GOLIATH OF SOUTH EAST ASIA: HOW VIETNAM DEALS WITH THE RISE OF
   POWER OF CHINA?},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {42-65},
Abstract = {Chinese ambitions and recent activities in the South China Sea make
   small countries of South East Asia increasingly nervous. How do they
   reply to the rise of Chinese power? In this article, I argue that
   challenges Vietnam faces from China could be compared to the battle of
   David and Goliath. If these two actors clash in conventional manners,
   the result will be almost resolved for China. In order to offset
   potential losses, Vietnam belongs to those countries of South East Asia
   that have applied ``hedging strategy{''} into its foreign policy. In
   essence, my argument is that government in Hanoi will do its best to
   keep good relations as long as it is possible with both, China and the
   United States. There have been is indications that US-Vietnam relations
   have been improving since the end of the Cold War. However, any
   improvement with Washington has been follow by improvements with
   Beijing. Although it is extremely difficult to predict how will balance
   of power in South East Asia evolve and what impact it might have on
   alliance system in the region, we might conclude that ceteris paribus
   any other strategy, than hedging would be too limiting and too costly
   for Vietnam.},

Title = {Cynical or Deliberative? An Analysis of the European Commission's Public
   Communication on Its Use of Expertise in Policy-Making},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {37-48},
Abstract = {The European Commission has faced increasing criticism that its use of
   expertise in policy-making is undemocratic and politicized. In response
   to critics, the Commission has produced a number of publicly available
   documents where its expert policies and practices are outlined and
   discussed. Cynics view public communications of this nature with
   skepticism, as organizations tend to adopt ``smooth talk{''} and
   cosmetic rhetoric designed to placate critics and create a facade of
   compliance aimed at decreasing external pressure. An alternative
   deliberative approach, would expect the Commission to engage in a
   relatively open, reflective and reason-based interchange. The article's
   main aim is to assess the relative merits of these two approaches in
   capturing the Commission's framing of its public communication. Cynical
   expectations, prevalent among Commission critics, are confirmed by the
   Commission's silence on unpleasant topics including the undemocratic
   nature of existing expertise arrangements and the strategic uses of
   knowledge in EU policy-making. However, firm regulatory initiatives and
   the Commission's critical engagement with democratization demands and
   possible goal conflicts within their critics' agenda give significant
   leverage to a deliberative approach.},

Title = {Presidential Elections and Corruption Perceptions in Latin America},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {111-142},
Abstract = {This paper argues that perceptions of corruption in Latin America
   exhibit predictable fluctuations in the wake of presidential turnover.
   Specifically, presidential elections that result in the partisan
   transfer of power are normally followed by a surge-and-decline pattern
   in perceived corruption control, with initial improvements that fade
   with time. The causes are multiple and stem from the removal of corrupt
   administrations, public enthusiasm about administrative change, and the
   relative lack of high-level corruption scandals in the early phases of
   new governments. A statistical analysis of two widely used corruption
   perceptions indices demonstrates the pattern for eighteen Latin American
   democracies from 1996 to 2010. Both indices exhibit a temporary surge
   (of about two years) after turnover elections, while no such change
   follows reelections of incumbent presidents or parties. The theory and
   results are relevant for understanding public opinion in Latin America
   and for the analysis of corruption perceptions indices.},

Abstract = {The goal of a world free from nuclear weapons is directly related to the
   issues of international institutions and deterrence. Assuming that it
   would be possible, first, to move to significantly lower numbers of
   nuclear weapons and then to zero nuclear weapons, governing institutions
   would have to be resilient enough to respond in a timely manner and to
   uphold the bargain. But what factors determine and influence
   institutional resilience? And what would be the likely role of
   deterrence? This article first assesses what the general IR narratives
   tell us about determining factors. It then examines two empirical cases
   from the realm of arms control institutions (the CFE and the NPT
   treaties) and asks why these agreements are not as effective as
   intended. The next section discusses three additional factors of
   influence and identifies a shared interest in overcoming the deterrence
   principle as a key variable for institutional cooperation and as a
   factor that continues to influence resilience and effectiveness. The
   last section presents the conclusions.},

Abstract = {Repeated cross-sectional (RCS) designs are distinguishable from true
   panels and pooled cross-sectional time series (PCSTS) since
   cross-sectional units (e.g., individual survey respondents) appear but
   once in the data. This poses two serious challenges. First, as with
   PCSTS, autocorrelation threatens inferences. However, common solutions
   like differencing and using a lagged dependent variable are not possible
   with RCS since lags for i cannot be used. Second, although RCS designs
   contain information that allows both aggregate- and individual-level
   analyses, available methodsfrom pooled ordinary least squares to PCSTS
   to time seriesforce researchers to choose one level of analysis. The
   PCSTS tool kit does not provide an appropriate solution, and we offer
   one here: double filtering with ARFIMA methods to account for
   autocorrelation in longer RCS followed by the use of multilevel modeling
   to estimate both aggregate- and individual-level parameters
   simultaneously. We use Monte Carlo experiments and three applied
   examples to explore the advantages of our framework.},

Pages = {85-109},
Abstract = {The article undertakes a comparative analysis of party systems
   concentrating on the evolution of parties and party systems since the
   World War II and particularly in the last decades of the XX century
   following drastic redefinition of political regimes; it also analyzes
   modern trends in development of parties in countries that either
   underwent democratization or ended up with political regimes in which
   one or more parties operate. The comparison is based on a set of
   quantitative criteria evaluating the efficiency of party system.
   Outlined are three scenarios; for each scenario analyzed are functions

   Americans},
Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-72},
Abstract = {While the gender gap in voting has important political implications for
   understanding contemporary American politics, and continues to be a
   focus of a great deal of research, gender gaps in policy areas have also
   been identified and these gender gaps also have dramatic political
   implications, particularly in the context of understanding attitudes
   about race. Despite the advances in our understanding of the gender gap
   in voting, fewer investigations have explored potential gender
   differences in racial attitudes. The lack of research into racial
   attitudes among women and men is surprising in light of the election and
   re-election of President Obama and the continued ``racialization{''} of
   many national political issues. In fact, few studies have explored
   contemporary differences between women and men in levels of symbolic
   racism. Moreover, among the existing studies of possible gender gaps in
   racial attitudes, the role of perceived discrimination is surprisingly
   absent. In this investigation, potential differences between men and
   women in racial attitudes, specifically symbolic racism, are explored
   with a focus on demographic, attitudinal, and perceptions of
   discrimination as possible explanations. Results from a nationally
   representative survey demonstrate a significant gender gap in symbolic
   racism with women expressing less racially resentful attitudes.
   Furthermore, this gender gap in racial attitudes appears to be explained
   largely by ideology, party identification, and differences between men
   and women in their perceived experiences with discrimination.},

Abstract = {In the last years, the issue of mortgage enforcement proceedings in
   Spain has been the subject of an extensive debate drawing attention to
   the deficiencies of such procedure in a situation of severe crisis like
   the one Spanish households were experiencing. Particularly, it was
   highly criticized because there has been traditionally quite restricted
   possibilities of opposition for the defendant. However, the system of
   mortgage enforcement, including the limitation of grounds of objection,
   had been repeatedly declared in conformity with the Constitution by the
   Constitutional Court. In this context, the role of the Court of Justice
   of the EU has been crucially important in fine-tuning the national legal
   provisions in light of the European legal instruments (Directive
   93/13/EEC on unfair terms in consumer contracts). Nonetheless, the fact
   that the solution found in EU law emanates from the sphere of consumer
   protection law should not overshadow the fact that the principle of
   effectiveness is the main element at the basis of the reasoning of the
   Court, which in an expression of the principle of effective judicial
   protection enshrined in Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights
   of the European Union.},

   distinguishing between conventional-indicative and

   ontological difference and communicative similarity between religious
   and political rituals, shows that the mechanism of everyday
   ritualization contributes to the increasing importance of less
   substantive components of political action, reveals the role of rituals
   in transition moments of political life and considers specific features
   of such political rituals as sacrifice, holidays and anniversary
   celebrations. His research shows that, although the direct inspiring
   impact of rituals is nothing more than a ``contract illusion{''} of a
   symbolic effect, which can be destroyed by unconventional and
   perlocutionary ``Theking is naked!{''}, the importance of rituals for
   modern communities should not be underestimated because due to their
   complex nature they perform the function of stabilizing the social
   order.},

Journal = {POLITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {47},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-83},

Abstract = {This article examines two discussions of prostitution by
   eighteenth-century social theorist Bernard Mandeville and argues that
   how a society perceives and names risk reflects less about concrete
   dangers than about desires to preserve social order. Mandeville
   addresses his writings to anxious members of a commercial society who
   were specifying risk and assigning blame against a backdrop of
   widespread corruption. His calls for the legalization of prostitution
   expose the pervasive moral uncertainty and vice that animate a
   commercial society and raise questions about the purported social
   benefits yielded by the persecution of prostitutes, who Mandeville
   represents as simply one class of vicious commercial actors among many.
   His work suggests that the public designation of prostitution as a moral
   risk is a feeble attempt both to soothe generalized fear about the
   immorality of commerce and to buttress a cherished social order.
   Mandeville's writings thus can be interpreted as an early engagement
   with the politics of risk and blame.},

Abstract = {Though the Arctic is known as a region of peace, military activity and
   militarization continue to influence it. The literature on Arctic
   security asserts that no international organization exists that can deal
   with military issues in the region. This article challenges this
   assertion by arguing that the osce is the perfect organization to
   coordinate Arctic security because of its initial purpose of
   facilitating nato-Russia relations in Europe, which is precisely the
   same relationship that requires coordination in the Arctic today. Given
   that all eight Arctic states are members, the osce is almost a
   preexisting security organization for the Arctic. The article examines
   the security environment in the Arctic, the current institutional regime
   and the origins of the osce. Furthermore, it explores osce csbms as
   empirical examples of how the osce already builds military
   predictability in the Arctic.},

   local ethnoses' national identities. Ethnoses, which have formed own

   own future in context of geopolitical perspectives, produce own unique
   interpretations of space, where they are placed, or modify them
   depending on external conditions. This paper investigates Moldova's
   Bulgarians' spatial identity and ethnonational self-identification on

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {This article explores the nexus between conflicting geopolitical
   imaginaries and socioeconomic tensions in northern Mali, examining
   microlevel processes whereby extralegal and criminal economies have
   reshaped political and armed mobilization, especially among Tuareg who
   fought to draw the borders of an independent Azawad and jihadists
   affiliated with the MUJAO Islamist group who sought to abolish all
   borders. Secessionist, jihadist, and statist political projects must be
   interpreted in light of the dynamics of armed protection, extraction,
   and clientelist connivance underlying processes of territorialization
   and social mobility in a hybrid regional order whose peripheral location
   no longer serves as a geopolitical insulator.},

Abstract = {Jurgen Habermas, in his recent work on post-secular public reasoning,
   attempts to craft a model of democratic deliberation in which theistic
   and non-theistic selves can learn from each other and develop bonds of
   democratic solidarity. His proposed model raises questions about the
   abilities of democratically oriented individuals in the twenty-first
   century to reflect critically upon their own cherished beliefs, to
   comprehend the beliefs of others, and then to engage critically with the
   beliefs of others during deliberations about matters of common concern.
   I argue that these questions are best addressed by focusing on how
   individuals reason from within and through (rather than independently
   of) the cultural and ethical forces that make the subjects what they
   are. The work of many grassroots organizers today illustrates this
   lesson.},

Abstract = {Historically, terrorism -except in outstanding cases-has not opted for a
   single way to execute its plans. Often it has developed various types of
   action with the passage of time and changing of technologies. This has
   constituted a systematic execution of crime; however, not all countries
   that faced the phenomenon have been consistent in dosage and rating of
   it. This dosage is related to the intensity in the execution of
   terrorist actions, also it is related to the implementation of an alarm
   to avoid the materialization of the act as well as the construction of
   an action protocol by the state security forces so that this can be
   avoided. This protocol allows us to know and repel terrorist activity
   underway.},

Abstract = {United States political science has been heavily subsidized and steered
   by foundations and the national security state. It has been disseminated
   all over the world, marginalizing diverse and foreign perspectives.
   However, the purpose of political science, as defined by Aristotle, its
   originator, was to find out how to attain the good life for all in a
   self-governing community. This is still where political science should
   aim. We can attempt to learn from history and current practices how to
   embody our ideals in institutions and foster desirable social change.
   This had been a major purpose of the Caucus for New Political Science
   (CNPS); other collectives and organizations should join in this task.},

   several reasons, including the historical ones, Poland appeared to be

   country. So how does the Polish strategy in relation to Ukraine look,
   and how is it being implemented? In search of an answer to this complex
   question A. Smirnov considers the position of the Polish right-wing
   conservatives that represents a curious synthesis of the overall
   Western, European and national-patriotic dominants of political

   the 1970s. Interest was limited to foreign policy and history of the
   revolution. Narratives rarely went beyond research results already
   introduced in Western countries. It was only during Perestroika that
   South Korea and the Soviet Union established diplomatic relations; after
   that, the Soviet Union moved into the focus of research. Only since the
   1990s has South Korea's Russian Studies developed its own profile: it
   was now possible for Korean students to study in Russia. Second,
   Russian-language literature was no longer in short supply. Third, Korean
   scholars, supported not least by their government, now carried out
   research in Russia and with Russian sources. Since then, Korean
   academics have had access to international Russian Studies.},

Pages = {443+},
Abstract = {Iran is an important regional power in the Southern Caucasus. Its
   cooperation with Georgia is limited to economic matters.
   Armenian-Iranian relations are determined by the two countries'
   relations with Azerbaijan. Iran and Azerbaijan have been able to improve
   their economic relations. But political relations are marked by
   conflicts. Given the 20 million Azeris in Iran, Tehran fears Azerbaijani
   nationalism and irredentism. Iran is fine-tuning a range of instruments
   designed to undermine the integrity and security of Azerbaijan from the
   inside out. Baku wants to strengthen its position by turning to Israel
   as well as to the United States.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},

Abstract = {Marxism claims that since the emergence of capitalism, the working class
   has always been the representative of the advanced productive forces,
   forces of promoting the development of advanced productivity, and the
   most progressive, promising class. However, with the adjustment of the
   world's industrial structure and the development of technologies such as
   the Internet, the Internet of things, the most developed countries have
   experienced the social phenomenon of the emergence of a ``new middle
   class,{''}the new strata changes within the working class, and ``white
   collar{''} labor outnumbering ``blue collar{''} labor, etc. This has
   resulted in proclamations of the ``extinction{''} of the working class,
   the decentralization of the working class, and the middle stratum
   theory, etc. These claims seem to have posed a question and challenge to
   Marxist class theory. Meanwhile, the massive emergence of China's
   ``knowledge workers,{''} ``migrant workers{''} and ``private
   employees{''} has changed the traditional internal structure of the
   working class that mainly consisted of ``manual workers,{''} ``urban
   workers,{''} and ``state-owned enterprise (SOE) workers{''} before.
   Therefore, how to view the rise of ``new workers{''} in the world and
   China, and understand the ``recurrence{''} and ``reconstruction{''} of
   the working class in both China and the world in the new era have become
   important issues for Marxist class theory to address.},

Journal = {DESAFIOS},

Pages = {185-205},
Abstract = {More than a decade after Argentina's socio-economic, political and
   financial collapse in the period 2001-2002, over two hundred recuperated
   factories currently operate under the direct control of workers. In many
   cases the recuperations were a direct response to the growing number of
   bankruptcies and plant closures in the face of deteriorating economic
   circumstances. The article revisits the workers' struggle and examines
   the specific socio-historical context that facilitated the emergence of
   Argentina's recuperated workplaces during the 1990s and in the aftermath
   of the country's crisis. It further analyzes the post-crisis policies of
   stabilization and outlines the movements' present situation. Finally,
   the document concludes by drawing on Gramsci's observations on factory
   occupations in post-war Italy and his reflections about the relationship
   between economic crisis, ideological struggle and social transformation.},

Abstract = {The vast majority of existing studies on bureaucratic representation
   focus on bureaucracies' permanent and internal staff. Yet, the rising
   sophistication of modern democracies and the technocratization of
   political life are gradually inducing an increased reliance on external
   experts to assist in the development and implementation of policy
   decisions. This trend, we argue, raises the need to extend studies of
   bureaucratic representation to such external and non-permanent experts
   in governmental affairs. In this article, we take a first step in this
   direction using seconded national experts (SNEs) in the European
   Commission as our empirical laboratory. Our results highlight that
   Commission SNEs do not appear representative of their constituent
   population (i.e., the EU-27 population) along a number of
   socio-demographic dimensions. Moreover, we find that the role perception
   of ``experts{''} is primarily explained by organizational affiliation,
   and only secondarily by demographic characteristics (except, of course,
   education).},

Abstract = {This paper examines, in a comparative way, the quality of democracy in
   60 countries. Six aspects of democratic quality are identified and this
   conclusion is the result of an factorial analysis, an aggregate
   indicator. This shows a big contrast between the countries. There are
   differences between the ``north{''} and ``south{''} democracy. The
   multiple regression analysis shows that social capital is the main
   reason of these differences and the democratic experience also
   influences democracy quality. The analysis disagrees with the structural
   thesis of literature because it doesn't find significant the economic
   development and the inequality. The analysis also shows that majoritary
   electoral systems have got better quality of democracy and the
   multipartidism doesn't affect negatively the quality of democracy.},

Abstract = {After the rift between Moscow and Beijing, the Chinese-Soviet border was
   a closely guarded, hardly penetrable ``Iron Curtain{''} in Asia. Regime
   change in Beijing and Moscow in the 1980s led to a gradual opening of
   the border. Initially, the governments of both countries monitored this
   process. With the collapse of the Soviet Union at the latest, however,
   activity in the border region developed a momentum of its own whereby
   control over local initiatives slipped out of Moscow's hands.},

Abstract = {The bottom line of my book Linguistic Justice for Europe and for the
   World (Oxford University Press, 2011, paperback 2015) can roughly be
   captured in the combination of two recommendations: that the
   democratization of competence English as a lingua franca should be
   fostered in Europe and elsewhere and that language communities should be
   allowed to protect their language against the invasion of English and
   other powerful languages by imposing their own language in public
   communication and public education within some territorial boundaries.
   Most of my critics attack one or the other of these recommendations and
   some question some of the presuppositions of my whole approach. In this
   response, I try to refute some of these critiques by clarifying my
   claims or spelling out my arguments, and I make whatever concessions I
   believe are required.},

Abstract = {This study examines the effects of political knowledge on various types
   of political participation by focusing on five recent presidential and
   legislative elections in Taiwan. The empirical findings indicate that
   political knowledge has positive effects on some types of political
   participation but the effects of political knowledge on different types
   of political participation vary by the types of electoral systems and
   elections. Besides, although the interviewer's assessment of the
   respondent's level of information has been widely used as an effective
   indicator of political knowledge, this study shows that the interviewers
   tend to rate men and partisans as politically knowledgeable, which might
   lead to a biased estimate of political knowledge. Overall, this study
   provides insight into the relationship between political knowledge and

Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},

Volume = {47},
Number = {1},
Pages = {122-143},
Abstract = {Being both emotional and bordering on the irrational, identification
   with a soccer team of Turkish background shows that the experience of
   stigmatization is part of an ``us vs. them{''} mentality cementing
   social relationships. Our qualitative approach highlights the narrative
   of this identification, based on experiences at the margins of the
   social arena. The aim is to demonstrate that interviewees use the ``art
   of faking out{''} as a strategy of identification. This tactical
   dimension of stigma serves as a foundation for a reverse construction of
   identity. However, it illustrates not so much a need for belonging as a
   desire for distinction in a space of mutual acquaintances that is being
   ethnicized and pauperized.},

Abstract = {This study reviews the relationships between merger stress, leadership,
   post-merger integration (PMI), and performance by focusing on the
   mediating effect of PMI using survey data of merged public institutions.
   The study analyzes whether the stress during a merger or the leadership
   in merged organizations have statistically significant impacts on PMI
   and the performance of merged organizations, and whether PMI
   significantly mediates merger stress and leadership with performance.
   The results indicate that merger stress had a statistically significant
   negative impact on PMI and the performance of the merged organizations.
   Conversely, the leadership of merged organizations had a statistically
   significant positive impact on PMI and the performance of the merged
   organizations. Furthermore, PMI showed a significant negative mediating
   effect on the relationship between merger stress and performance, while
   it showed a significant positive mediating effect in the relationship
   between leadership and performance.},

Abstract = {The article begins with a question about the value of revitalising the
   equation between sexual/intimate violence and terrorism in the current
   neoliberal/post-feminist political and epistemological landscape. We
   argue that the intensifying international interest in sexual violence,
   and an accompanying hyper-visual imagery, is implicated in the
   cauterisation of critical thought about sexual violence. We offer the
   more mobile and expansive concept of sexed violence to ``unthink{''}
   dominant narratives that reproduce heteronormativity and white, Western
   hegemony. Through an analysis of the film Unwatchable, we consider why
   non-white raced bodies consistently materialise as less
   ``comprehensible{''} as violatable than white bodies. We further suggest
   that a move to sexed violence can help to think more critically about
   both sexual violence and feminism.},

Volume = {38},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {323-341},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Comparative politics has traditionally not been one of the dominant
   sub-fields of political science in the Nordic countries. Although early
   pioneering efforts were made by Herbert Tingsten and later by Stein
   Rokkan, this field of research led an obscure life in these countries
   until the late 1980s/early 1990s. This article gives a short overview of
   the development and present state of comparative research in the Nordic
   countries. It also gives a brief account of the comparative research
   profiles at the political science departments in Nordic universities. In
   order to give an empirical assessment of the status of comparative
   politics among Nordic political scientists, the article follows up an
   earlier study on publication patterns in five Nordic political science
   journals. In addition, a bibliographical analysis of Nordic
   contributions in international journals with a focus on comparative
   politics is undertaken. The results show, among other things, that there
   has been a marked increase in the share and number of comparative
   articles published by Danish, Swedish and Norwegian scholars. In Finland
   (and Iceland), however, no similar trend can be discerned. The
   conclusion is that the internationalization of political science is
   likely to stimulate cross-country research and accordingly comparative
   politics is likely to consolidate its position as a major political
   science discipline in Scandinavia.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the effect of candidates' expenditure on
   elections' results focusing on run-off elections' data. Our analysis,
   based on all run-off municipal elections in Israel between 1993 and
   2008, shows that candidates' share of the vote is not substantially
   affected by their campaign spending. This outcome contradicts recent
   results showing that in a developing country where voting is compulsory,
   campaign expenditures have a significant effect on vote shares. Yet, it
   is in line with the evidence of earlier studies based on developed
   countries showing that the effect of campaign spending is limited. This
   leads us to suggest that campaign spending may be effective in
   developing countries with consolidating democracies because compulsory
   voting forces the relative poor population to turn out and vote, and
   this population is relatively more impressionable by campaign spending
   on media advertisements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Historical institutionalism challenged older forms of comparative
   historical analysis by moving away from purely structural explanations
   of historical outcomes. Instead it posited that there were critical
   junctures in which actors chose between institutional alternatives,
   which in turn led to path dependence. I examine a phenomenon neglected
   both by historical institutionalism and older forms of historical
   analysischronic instability. Instead of institutional lock-in, some
   junctures lead to periods of instability in which a series of regimes
   replace each other in rapid succession. Three different causal
   mechanisms that routinely contribute to chronic instabilityexternal
   shocks, changing configurations of actors, and disjuncture between the
   logic of change and mechanisms of reproductionare explored in depth. The
   plausibility of the theory is illustrated by an examination of regime
   instability in Germany from the collapse of the Empire in 1918 through
   the founding of the Federal Republic in 1949.},

Abstract = {New Zealand's 2014 general election campaign was seen by many observers
   as out of the ordinary: it was variously described as `weird', `bizarre'
   and `crazy'. However, did media coverage reflect the unusual nature of
   the actual campaign? This study's content analysis of that coverage
   reveals that the news media's concentration on `non-policy' issues meant
   that much of it was dominated by alleged scandals, which were reported
   with a negative tone, and less space was devoted to policy. However,
   this does not indicate an extraordinary shift in New Zealand politics.
   Although seen by many as damaging to democracy and antithetical to a
   robust public sphere, these are now often features of the
   media-dominated `modern' campaign.},

Abstract = {Intimate ethnography presents a number of challenges: How could I write
   about my own family in a way that was true to their experience but also
   an objective report? How could I convey telling details without robbing
   my family of their privacy? How could I rein in my emotions to report
   their story, and did I pick and choose facts to protect them or to make
   them more sympathetic? How could I generalize from their experience to
   that of millions of social assistance recipients? In this Reflections
   essay, I consider these challenges in light of what other social
   scientists have said about the issues of close work with individual,
   sometimes vulnerable, research subjects.},

Abstract = {Studies of popular attitudes toward European integration have paid
   limited attention to the historical roots of voters' security
   preferences. Using an original municipality-level data set, we test
   whether the pattern of voting in Croatia's 2012 referendum on European
   Union accession was affected by the legacy of the country's 1991-1995
   war for independence or rather by economic factors. While finding
   evidence for the impact of the communities' level of prosperity and
   structure of economy, our analysis more notably demonstrates that the
   intensity of the communities' experience of war had a positive effect on
   their level of support for European Union membership. This effect also
   had a strong interactive relationship with the communities' political
   allegiances, highlighting the importance not only of historically rooted
   security issues but also of political actors who make those issues
   electorally salient.},

Abstract = {Campaigns invoke identity appeals to specific groups of voters,
   including women. To understand whether these campaign appeals matter in
   affecting voters' choices, we must better understand how women respond
   to these appeals, the causal mechanism driving responses, and whether
   male and female candidates can use these ads with equal effectiveness.
   Using a nationally representative sample of American voters and an
   experimental design, we test an identity-based appeal aimed at women. We
   find that, although candidates of either gender can use these ads to
   affect women's votes, only female candidates are able to prime female
   voters' gender identity. The use of these appeals by male candidates
   persuades female voters of their positive traits. Male voters are
   generally unaffected by the appeals. Given the integration of women and
   men in the general population, our results demonstrate the utility of
   targeted appeals in encouraging support from a specific group and
   avoiding backlash from others.},

Abstract = {Does electing female political leaders reduce gender stereotypes about
   leadership? Scholars know little about how the increasing presence of
   female executives alters gender stereotypes about political leadership.
   Some studies suggest gender stereotypes change slowly because they are
   embedded in cultural values and structural factors that reinforce
   traditional gender roles. Other research suggests stereotypes change
   more quickly with the increasing presence of female political
   leadership. We address this question by examining the effect of being
   governed by a female mayor in Mexico. We find that the presence of a
   current female mayor reduces gender stereotypes among males. However,
   past female mayors have little effect on current gender stereotypes
   about leadership. Our results suggest women must be present in executive
   offices more frequently to produce long-term change in gender
   stereotypes.},

Abstract = {In the contemporary political environment of polarized claims about
   disputed realities, the online fact-check industry was born. These
   enterprises have received awards and praise but also accusations of bias
   and error, bringing their methods and conclusions into question. This
   paper examines the comparative epistemology of the three major
   fact-check sites: do they examine the same questions and reach the same
   conclusions? A content analysis of the published fact-checks addressing
   three disputed realties - the existence of climate change, the influence
   of racism, and the consequences of the national debt - suggests
   substantial differences in the questions asked and the answers offered,
   limiting the usefulness of fact-checking for citizens trying to decide
   which version of disputed realities to believe.},

Abstract = {Although mainstream models of accountability assume that the election
   date is exogenously fixed, in almost any parliamentary democracy
   governments may choose it. This article proposes a theory of the
   strategic timing of elections that highlights the role of the economy
   and the type of government. First, incumbents will call early elections
   when the economy is growing and inflation rates are low. Nevertheless,
   coalition and majority governments will fall short of the ability and
   the incentives to do so, respectively. As a result, the effect of the
   state of the economy on the opportunistic dissolution of the parliament
   will be stronger when there is only one party in government, and it
   lacks a majority in the lower house. These patterns are examined by
   using data from 21 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
   democracies between 1945 and 2010.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how China's economic cooperation affects
   authoritarian persistence elsewhere. For the period 1998-2008, the
   article assesses quantitatively whether the effects of economic
   cooperation from China vary, conditioned by the regime type of the
   recipient. The analysis finds that China's economic cooperation is
   associated with regime durability in party-based regimes. In non-party
   regimes, in contrast, it is associated with regime collapse.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the relationship between political legitimacy
   arising from a link with the `will of the people', and political
   legitimacy arising from beneficial consequences for them. Questioning
   the common assumption of an inherent trade-off between `input' and
   `output legitimacy', it suggests that the two necessarily go together,
   and that their relationship is continuously reconstructed through
   discursive contestation. These claims are first substantiated
   conceptually, in reference to the legitimacy literature in European
   Union (EU) Studies, which is situated in the broader fields of Political
   Theory and Comparative Politics. In a second step, the argument is
   developed on the grounds of empirical case material: an interpretive,
   non-quantitative reconstruction of the changing discourses on EU
   legitimacy by the European institutions from the 1950s to the early
   2000s.},

Abstract = {Quantitative studies aiming at general explanations for the emergence of
   new political parties stress the importance of new issues and the
   programmatic behaviour of other parties. I connect these two aspects by
   arguing that the programmatic diversity of existing parties is a strong
   influence on the incentives for new party formation, as it determines
   the scope for possible programmatic innovations. I use two measures for
   programmatic diversity in order to capture the programmatic supply by
   existing parties. It can be shown that the explanatory contribution of
   programmatic factors is as high as or even higher than that of the
   factors usually cited in the literature on new political parties, e.g.
   electoral institutions. Moreover, the results underline the necessity of
   differentiating between genuinely new parties and splits from existing
   parties as subtypes of new political parties.},

Abstract = {In many countries with multiparty systems, a decline in class voting has
   increased volatility and the need for comprehensive information about
   the political landscape among voters. Voting Advice Applications (VAAs)
   are online tools that match users to political parties and, as such,
   they hold a promise of reinforcing informational transparency and
   democratic representation. The current research investigated whether
   VAAs live up to this expectation by investigating to what extent VAAs
   affected users' political knowledge and vote choice in the Dutch
   national elections of 2012. Results show that VAA users feel that the
   VAA improved their political knowledge. In addition, those groups of VAA
   users who experienced a large knowledge increase, also relatively often
   indicated that their vote choice had been affected. This suggests that
   VAAs contribute to informational transparency by increasing knowledge
   among a potentially wide audience, and also that VAAs might increase
   democratic representation to the extent that VAAs persuade people to
   vote for the candidate that best represents their opinions. On the other
   hand, we found discrepancies between behavioural and perceptual
   measurements of the effect of VAAs on vote choice. This raises doubts
   about whether VAAs shape actual voting behaviours and knowledge, or
   rather perceptions of that.},

   Throughout this paper it will be possible to see the institutional and
   ideologically collaboration done by Section Female, that certainly made
   the Hispanics thought one of the ideological influences in the project
   established in Chile. The transfer of Hispanic in our country helped
   create a specific ideology on women that was promoted by officialdom.},

Title = {Transgender inclusion in state non-discrimination policies: The
   democratic deficit and political powerlessness},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {Transgender people-people whose gender identity or expression is
   different from their assigned sex at birth-and their allies advocate for
   the inclusion of gender identity or transgender in state
   non-discrimination policies. These policies generally proscribe
   discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations. Courts
   and administrative agencies have determined discrimination against
   transgender people is a violation of existing statutes, but there remain
   efforts by advocates to seek policies that explicitly prohibit
   discrimination on the basis of transgender status, which are often the
   result of legislation going through the political process. A pluralist
   understanding of the political process theorizes that a majority
   coalition of minorities can offer social groups policies they support.
   This rests on the presumption that a majority coalition of minorities
   should rule. Any indication to the contrary may suggest a democratic
   deficit, whereby more than a majority is necessary for policy
   introduction. We find that there is a substantial democratic deficit
   regarding the inclusion of gender identity or transgender in employment
   non-discrimination policies. On average, state support for the policy
   must be 81\% in order for the state to have a policy reflecting such
   sentiment. This leaves substantial implications for the political
   powerlessness of transgender people in the political process.},

Abstract = {In 2001, Richard Niemi and Julia Smith published an article in PS:
   Political Science and Politics on enrollments in high school civics and
   government courses. They framed their study on the premise that
   political scientists were ignoring an important aspect of American civic
   and political life, and they concluded by issuing a call for political
   scientists to become more involved in K-12 civics education. This
   article provides an update on the state of K-12 civics education and
   renews Niemi and Smith's call for political science engagement in K-12

Abstract = {The article examines the immigration policy agendas of two Greek
   mainstream parties, centre right New Democracy (ND) and centre left
   PASOK (Panhellenic Socialist Party) since 2000. Drawing on the analysis
   of parliamentary proceedings and key political texts, it first analyses
   areas of consensus and disagreement on the mainstream parties' positions
   in relation to immigration control and citizenship. Second, it considers
   the impact of far right parties, namely, of the radical right Laikos
   Orthodoxos Synagermos and the extreme right Golden Dawn, on the
   immigration agendas and positions of the two mainstream parties in the
   context of the Greek austerity crisis. The article argues that despite a
   decline of trust, suggested by the recent electoral successes of the far
   right and other `fringe' parties, and despite internal ideological
   strains, PASOK and ND did not ignore or divert attention away from the
   `immigration issue'. In contrast, they co-opted the far right agenda.},

Abstract = {This article deals with welfare culture as an ideational constraint for
   governments' use of normative ideas and justifications in their policy
   communication. The analysis is based on a focused comparison of reforms
   related to the labor market that were passed by the governments under
   David Cameron (the United Kingdom), Mariano Rajoy (Spain), and Enda
   Kenny (Ireland). The cases were chosen because of their similar broader
   context while the welfare regimes and cultures differ between the
   countries. Based on key speeches by the heads of governments and the
   responsible ministers, a qualitative content analysis extracts
   justifications in their communication. As the analysis shows, the three
   cases differ in both the extent and the content of normative
   justifications in a way that is in line with the differences in the
   welfare cultures. Furthermore, the findings from the Irish government
   suggest that party ideology adds to the welfare culture in shaping a
   government's policy communication.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to analyse collaboration in the process
   of post-conflict reconstruction in Kosovo. Based on extensive empirical
   research, we focus on the parliamentarisation in Kosovo in the context
   of a multi-stakeholder partnership (MSP). We investigate the creation,
   operation and effects of co-operation within an MSP called the Kosovo
   Assembly Support Initiative (ASI). This MSP is relevant for the study of
   parliamentary affairs because of its goals to help in the creation of a
   functioning national parliament, but also because several other national
   parliaments contributed to this goal within the broader post-conflict
   peace-building in Kosovo.},

Abstract = {In Germany issues of immigration and integration have gradually moved
   into the centre of competitive party politics over the past 20 years.
   This article highlights two central features of this development: First,
   in recent years there has been a notable gap between highly polarizing
   (populist) public debates on the one hand and a pragmatic shift in
   policymaking among the country's mainstream parties on the other.
   Second, the immigration issue poses a considerable challenge to the core
   political identity of the centre-left and the centre-right. On the basis
   of a frame analysis of electoral politics this article argues that, in
   spite of immigrants' traditional support for the Social Democratic
   Party, Chancellor Merkel's Christian Democratic Party has recently been
   successful in claiming ownership over the immigration issue by linking
   it to policy fields in which it commands public trust, namely economic
   and security policies.},

Abstract = {This article critically examines neo-republican democratic theory, as
   articulated by Philip Pettit, with respect to its capacity to address
   some of the pressing challenges of our times. While the neo-republican
   focus on domination has great promise, it mistakenly commits to the
   position that democracy the primary tool with which we fight domination
   is limited to state activity. Examining this error helps us make sense
   of two additional problems with his theory: an overestimation of the
   capacity of legislative bodies to identify sufficient responses to
   practices of domination, and the potential conflict between avoiding
   state domination of the general citizenry and avoiding state domination
   of a part of it. Minimizing domination is simply too demanding and
   complex a task for us to rely on one institutional structure, no matter
   how well designed, to accomplish.},

Abstract = {In democratic systems, the rich have diverse channels through which they
   can influence policies. In a model of taxation, I study the capacity of
   the rich to constrain the fiscal choice of a government by starting a
   costly political conflict (for example, a press campaign), which imposes
   a cost on the government and influences the fate of the government's
   fiscal plan. I show that the government's tax proposal depends
   critically on the marginal disutility of taxation for the rich. This
   approach provides a new rationale for the empirically documented
   U-shaped relationship between inequality and taxation. It also
   highlights a new role for opposition parties. By agreeing to bear part
   of the cost of a political conflict in exchange for compromise, the
   opposition makes Pareto-improving arrangements possible.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the economic context of June 7th and November
   1st general elections differed to a great extent. First, while the
   economy was central in the June elections, its prominence was shadowed
   in November by rising security concerns. Second, while Turkey's
   macroeconomic indicators were pretty unpromising prior to the June
   elections, increasing growth figures before November, with the help of
   the AK Party's presentation of it, revived the public's optimism about
   the AK Party's economic performance. Third, in the June elections, the
   opposition parties plied the electorate with positive economic messages.
   The AK Party avoided this trend in June but joined the populist camp
   after seeing the voters' positive reactions to economic promises. These
   three differences between the economic contexts of the June and November
   elections made the AK Party more appealing to voters in November.},

Abstract = {Political executives often influence how effectively citizens can
   monitor them, yet the link between executives and government
   transparency is not well developed in the literature. I begin filling
   that void by illuminating the relationship between media freedomone
   dimension of transparencyand executive power. I theorize that
   politicians prefer to avoid monitoring and negative publicity, and that
   both presidents and prime ministers often can do something about it via
   their constitutional powers and influence accrued through partisan
   support. Using new panel data on Central and Eastern European prime
   ministers and presidents, I find that proactive legislative powers for
   both executive types and increased partisan support for prime ministers
   negatively affect media freedom. My model explains most of the variation
   in Central and Eastern European media freedom, predicts high press
   freedom in Western Europe, and has important implications for the
   broader relationships between executive power, transparency, and
   accountability.},

Abstract = {The Justice and Development Party's (AK Party) more than 13 years rule
   has ushered in a debate as to whether the AK Party has become a
   ``dominant party{''} and if so, whether Turkey is experiencing a new
   type of party system, a dominant-party system. In this article, we first
   attempt to denote the terms `dominant party' and `dominant-party
   system,' and to shed light on the distinction between these two terms by
   drawing on the works of Duverger, Sartori, Pempel, and Greene. This
   article will then analyse Turkey's experience under the AK Party to
   determine whether the AK Party can aptly be categorized as a ``dominant
   party,{''} and Turkey as having a ``dominant-party system.{''} Relying
   primarily on Greene's conceptual framework, we contend that it is safe
   to denote the AK Party as a dominant party and to designate Turkey's
   political system as a ``dominant party system.{''}},

   assessment of some of the leading changes in the postwar global politics
   landscape. These issues are explored in greater depth across two cases:
   security and the environment. The article then examines a set of trends
   which can be characterized as a gridlock in leading institutions, and

Abstract = {Recent research claims that local party organizations are essential for
   new parties seeking organizational stability and national-level
   electoral success. Yet new parties which emerged in Japan since the
   1990s have failed in building nation-wide networks of local
   organizations. The article asks how these parties sought to expand
   locally and why their attempts have been largely unsuccessful. It finds
   evidence that under certain conditions (in urban areas and multi-member
   districts, or when controlling local chief executive offices and endowed
   with inherited resources) new parties have been more successful in
   standing and winning seats in regional elections. Regions with these
   favorable conditions are few, however, resulting in the overall weakness
   of the new parties' local organizations. The study also disconfirms
   expectations that a party's control of national government should result
   in their improved representation at the local level. The article
   contributes to elucidating the incentives and dynamics of building party
   organizations in terms of local elected offices for newcomer parties in
   Japan. It hints at similar challenges for entrepreneurial parties with
   few social roots in other established democracies.},

Abstract = {Does electoral competition improve public goods provision in
   dominant-party regimes? In such regimes, localized electoral competition
   does not threaten dominant parties' hold on power. Still, I argue that
   competition can promote improved local public goods provision because of
   the ruling party's desire to generate overwhelming governing majorities.
   Studying Tanzanian districts, I show that greater local electoral
   competition leads to substantially greater access to local public goods.
   Moreover, at least one important mechanism linking electoral competition
   to public goods outcomes is the dominant party's propensity to target
   more competitive districts with greater government resources. The
   findings demonstrate that, even in a country with imperfect elections
   characterized by single-party dominance, greater electoral competition
   can generate better public goods outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {This article applies the concept of state-corporate crime to the
   fisheries sector. It presents a case study from Senegal where Russian,
   European and Asian fishing firms supported by their home governments,
   gained access to overfished stocks that are vital to local food security
   and the artisanal fishing sector. The discussion elaborates on the main
   observations from Senegal about the nature and implications of
   state-corporate crime, drawing on further evidence from other countries.
   It provides a contrasting perspective to mainstream fisheries policy,
   including the global fight against ``fish pirates{''}, and the dictates
   of the wealth-based approach to fisheries reform.},

Abstract = {We are told that an efficient and effective parliament needs functioning
   political parties. They are necessary to ensure stable government
   majorities and to provide a link between voters and legislators. Without
   parties, chaos and instability would ensue as governments would rise and
   fall on the whim of individual legislators. However, this assumption has
   largely gone untested, primarily because parliaments in almost all
   western democracies are entirely dominated by parties.
   The aim of this paper is to expand the study of parliament and to
   examine what happens when parties are not dominant in parliament, to the
   extent that they are entirely absent or in a minority. The cases for
   inclusion are the primary democratic parliaments where this occurs,
   almost all of which are at the regional level. These include: the
   Tasmanian Legislative Council in Australia, the Nebraskan state assembly
   in the United States (US), the Legislative Assemblies of the Northwest
   Territories and Nunavut in Canada, the legislatures in the British
   dependencies of the Isle of Man, Channel Islands and the Falkland
   Islands. Also included are the national parliaments of several Pacific
   island states where there are no functioning political parties.
   Note: Research for this paper was carried out while the author held an
   Irish Research Council Marie Curie Fellowship. Funding was provided for
   this project under the Irish Research Council New Foundations Scheme.},

Abstract = {In many states, agency rules are subject to review and possible veto by
   elected political officials in the legislative and/or executive
   branches. The consequences of this rule review authority are little
   understood. Using time-series cross-section data on state environmental
   compliance costs, this study investigates the impact that several types
   of administrative rule review procedures have on the stringency of state
   environmental regulation. The findings suggest that (1) both
   gubernatorial and legislative rule review powers are systematically
   associated with reduced environmental compliance costs, (2) legislatures
   controlled by the Democratic Party use rule review powers to reduce
   these costs less than Republican ones, and (3) the latter effect is
   observable only when legislatures have the power to amend or veto rules
   without the approval of the governor. These results indicate that rule
   review plays an important, but complex, role in shaping regulatory
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {Despite the growing interest in electoral observation in Latin America,
   the region of greatest development activity in recent years (Cuellar and
   Thompson 2008; Pinilla 2008), we still lack of a consistent conceptual
   discussion about what we mean when we say ``electoral observation{''}.
   Further on, in the same direction, it is well known that the countries
   of the region call that activity in many different ways, so this has a
   great impact on the way we carry research on the subject. This paper
   reviews specific cases of observations and discusses the most used
   conceptualizations on electoral observation in Latin America (Boneo,
   Carrillo and Valverde 2007; Thompson 2008; Munoz-Pogossian 2013).
   Finally, it presents a definition that includes each of its basic
   elements and, at the same time, avoids ``concept stretching{''} to allow
   deeper knowledge on the subject (Sartori 1984).},

Abstract = {Although elections have become the norm not only in democratic regimes
   but also in autocratic ones, the legitimacy of the electoral process in
   different countries is often contested. Facing strong international
   pressures to prove democratic credentials, eventual winners have a
   strong incentive to ensure high levels of voter turnout. Conversely,
   leaders of parties likely to lose the election have an incentive to
   reduce turnoutfor example, through boycottsto delegitimize the election.
   In such situations, turnout is a major dimension of competition. To
   overcome the potential delegitimizing effects of low turnout, incumbents
   will often turn toward clientelistic mobilization, as high turnout can
   be a powerful rejoinder to those who denounce elections as a sham and
   can put observers' concerns about the legitimacy of the electoral
   process to rest. We develop a theory to explain how such campaigns will
   target particularistic benefits. We argue that what we term legitimacy
   buying will be primarily aimed at staunching the bleeding of supporters
   who are usually consistent voters but have doubts about the legitimacy
   of the election. This theoretical prediction departs from theories used
   to explain vote buying in contexts in which the legitimacy of the
   elections is largely uncontested by significant groups in society. The
   theory is supported by data from a list experiment on vote buying
   conducted after the Honduran 2009 elections, which occurred in the wake
   of President Zelaya's ousting and in the midst of a boycott promoted by
   his supporters.},

Abstract = {This article suggests theoretical refinements to the multiple streams
   framework (MSF) that make it applicable to parliamentary systems and the
   decision-making stage of the policy process. Regarding the former, the
   important role of political parties in parliamentary democracies is
   highlighted. Party policy experts are expected to be members of the
   policy communities in the policy stream and to promote viable policy
   alternatives in their respective parties, while the party leadership is
   concerned with adopting policies in the political stream. With regard to
   the latter, the introduction of a second coupling process to analyse
   decision making more rigorously is suggested. Moreover, the article
   provides operational definitions of the framework's key concepts when
   applied to parliamentary systems and derives a systematic set of
   falsifiable hypotheses for agenda-setting and decision making in these
   systems, thus addressing one of the main critiques against the MSF -
   namely that no hypotheses can be derived from it.},

Abstract = {In his recent memoir, William Waldegrave wrote that no country run by
   John Major and Robin Butler was likely to be in much danger of systemic
   corruption. The fact remains that a quarter of a century ago, John
   Major, with the guidance and support of his cabinet secretary, decided
   to establish the Committee on Standards in Public Life under the
   chairmanship of Lord Nolan. The apparent prevalence of sleaze' issues in
   public lifemost notably the cash for questions' scandals involving Tory
   MPsprovoked the decision. Lord Nolan's committee immediately enunciated
   seven principles of public life: honesty, accountability, integrity,
   selflessness, openness, opportunity and leadership. Over the years, many
   of the Committee's recommendations have been accepted. There is today
   vastly greater transparency. The principles have been widely accepted;
   it is clear the public expects that they should be observed by public
   servants, including, perhaps especially, MPs. Yet it is equally clear
   that there is a widespread and still deepening mood of public cynicism
   on standards matters. The Committee is determined to defend the Nolan
   principles, but without more help from the political class it will be
   like Mrs Nupkins in The Pickwick Papers: inculcating moral lessons of
   great importance and generally ignored.},

Abstract = {Drawing on more than 500 elections from around the world, this article
   presents five empirical laws of politics. Four of these laws span
   democracies and dictatorships, and one sets a boundary between the two.
   In both regimes the governing party or coalition represents a minority
   of the electorate. In democracies this minority usually represents a
   plurality that amounts to about one third of the electorate. Judging by
   the outcome of the first free elections in regimes undergoing a
   transition, there is reason to believe that in dictatorships the
   minority is much smaller. Even as they have an advantage over the
   opposition, the incumbents experience an erosion of support over time.
   In democracies this leads to alternation in office, which in turn
   ensures that across many elections about two-thirds of the electorate
   gets to see its favorite party or coalition in government from time to
   time. In dictatorships, during long periods in office, support for the
   ruling party shrinks to insignificance. Also in democracies, it is rare
   for incumbents to receive more than 60 percent of the vote, and it never
   happens twice within the same spell in government. This appears to be a
   reliable indicator that differentiates all democracies from most
   dictatorships. The conclusion is inescapable-the dictatorial ``passion
   for unanimity{''} and illusion of ``organic unity{''} notwithstanding,
   the state is a plurality. The will of the electorate emerges as a result
   of competition among political parties.},

Abstract = {Election debates are considered the main events of election campaigns
   since its introduction and subsequent expansion from the United States.
   However, as important as the discussions themselves may be the media
   coverage. Framing predictions and the assumptions of gatekeeping alike
   affirm that the coverage of political events is often not depicted
   accurately, mainly due to a process of selection and framing of
   information. Moreover, several investigations suggest that the potential
   impact of debates on electoral behavior may be moderated by that media
   coverage, hence increasing the importance of such studies. This article
   shows that, indeed, this phenomenon happened in the news coverage of
   electoral debates by the Spanish media, marginalizing any coverage on
   policy proposals by the candidates and, therefore skewing its contents.
   To achieve this, the researcher makes a functional analysis of recent
   debates in the general election campaigns (two in 2008 and one in 2011
   among the candidates for prime minister - presidente del Gobierno-).
   Subsequently that analysis is compared with the coverage of selected
   media outlets (TVE1, La Cuatro, Telecinco, La Sexta, El Pais, El Mundo,
   ABC and El Periodico). The results show not only the phenomenon of
   selection and framing but that there are other moderators such as the
   type of media outlet (TV or press) or corporation.},

   those who are engaged but use false `knowledge'. Poll data show the

   politicians, who have partisan incentives to help the disengaged become
   active, but also partisan incentives to keep the misinformed politically
   involved. Activity in accord with false `knowledge' can slow needed
   responses to global warming and lead to concrete harm to individuals,

Title = {Political Power in the Modernity and its Limitations: a Reinterpretation
   from the Perspective of The Reason of State by Giovanni Botero},
Journal = {ANALECTA POLITICA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Number = {9},
Pages = {267-288},
Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {This paper aims to analyze the issue of political power and its limits
   in the political thought of the Piedmontese writer Giovanni Botero,
   through his writings published in the late sixteenth and early
   seventeenth century. The author's concept of reason of State and the
   prince's power allows to understand the rise of certain issues of
   relevance in modern political science: the omnipotence of power, its
   possible moral and institutional limitations, the relationship between
   politics and other areas of human knowledge and behavior. Although the
   methodology is based on the premises of some researchers who emphasize
   on the need to study thinkers holistically, taking into account their
   historical, ideological and linguistic context; the paper proposes some
   conclusions accountable in the contemporary discussion about the scope
   and limits of political power. As a result of this, the text presents
   how Botero exposes his idea of reason of State, in which the government
   must conceal, through a delicate balance, the need for an effective and
   successful political action given its obliged subordination to certain
   juridical, moral and religious principles.},

Abstract = {In this paper some considerations about federalism arise and it
   addresses one of its fundamental principles: autonomy. The analysis
   arises from the constitutionalization in 1999 of this principle and its
   attribution to the states and municipalities and the controllers
   entities that operate in these subnational entities. The analytical
   method used is the hermeneutical. We conclude that in the Venezuelan
   federal model, both formal and practical point of view, recognize and
   empower local authorities to organize their public powers guaranteed and
   therefore subnational comptrollers enjoy the same autonomy which is
   vested the Comptroller General of the Republic, therefore, those are not

   autonomy which they are entitled.},

Abstract = {This article examines the loss of the parliamentary mandate in the
   brazilian electoral system. It starts with the discussion fought in the
   prosecution 470 and underway before the Supreme Court and enjoyed a
   buying scheme vote of parliamentarians, in order to ensure the allied
   base for the projects of the federal government and, ultimately,
   condemned several deputies, and they were prevented the exercise of
   parliamentary duties. From this fact, the loss of the parliamentary
   mandate is appreciated comparing to the Machiavelli's ideas about the
   state cycles, the movement of history by fortune and the intervention of
   the virtu men. We conclude that the exercise of power, at the present,
   is not conquered by force or political ability of the man, much less it
   is an end in itself, since it follows from the mandate, the control of
   which is held by the political party and can only be exercised by come
   from the power that emanates from the people and should therefore be
   founded on ethics, morality and well manage public affairs.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with political mobilization among immigrants from the
   Former Soviet Union, who arrived in Israel in the 1990s. The data are
   based on two nationwide surveys, conducted 10 and 20 years after the
   arrival of the first wave of these immigrants. My analysis shows that
   immigrants' voting behavior is dynamic, and is determined mainly by
   their perceived interest in and attitudes toward domestic matters rather
   than regional issues connected with the Israel-Palestine conflict.
   Immigrants have adopted a complex strategy of political mobilization
   over time, which has shifted from the formation of ``ethnic{''} parties
   in the first decade into ``hybrid-ethnic{''} parties in the second
   decade. This strategy allows flexibility in terms of support,
   recruitment, and coalition building; prevents ethnic exclusion,
   maximizes the gains of Russian immigrants; and minimizes the price of
   their ethnic mobilization in a deeply divided society.},

   The Case of Contemporary Mexico},

Number = {1},
Pages = {55-67},

Abstract = {Throughout Latin America, the nature and location of power have shifted
   rapidly, in large part due to the emergence of new ``shadow powers.{''}
   These power groups act beyond institutional and legal frameworks and yet
   also interact with them. They operate clandestinely and yet openly
   control and rule in large swaths of national territory. Our capacity to
   adequately define them and their realms of activity is limited, and yet
   their effects on daily life can be huge. The model of the state fighting
   to eliminate the challenge posed by these powers is inadequate, as we
   see increasing alliances between elements of the state and shadow
   powers. Applying a feminist analysis of power, this article explores
   these contradictions in the case of Mexico, where a volatile mix of
   organized crime, government corruption, and legal and illegal economic
   interests have changed the map of power and led to conflicts. It focuses
   on the new dynamics of power and citizen responses to resist the
   imposition of illegitimate power and eliminate all forms of violence,
   with an emphasis on violence against women, which rises considerably in
   the context of shadow powers.},

Abstract = {Although research demonstrates that favorable ballot position can
   deliver candidates a small windfall of votes in local, nonpartisan, and
   primary elections, it is not clear whether ballot order laws have had
   any impact on the composition of U.S. legislatures. In this article, I
   estimate the substantive significance of ballot order rules by comparing
   the legislators of states that alphabetically order ballots to those
   elected by states that randomize or rotate ballot order. I also compare
   legislators elected by states that started or stopped alphabetically
   ordering ballots in recent decades. I find that states that
   alphabetically order ballots disproportionately elect candidates with
   early alphabet surnames. My research challenges the prevailing belief
   that ballot order affects only minor elections and suggests that
   seemingly innocuous rules have altered our political landscape. I
   conclude that arbitrary ballot ordering rules should be reformed to
   remedy their substantial impact on political representation.},

Abstract = {Illegal state actions are sometimes interpreted as civil disobedience.
   Yet, liberal theorists insist that, to count as such, states must intend
   to reform the systemic imperfections of the international legal order.
   Moreover, states must have the capacity to engineer such reforms
   responsibly. These requirements result in an elitist conception of
   international civil disobedience because weaker states cannot refashion
   the key rules of the international legal order. By introducing a broader
   conception of resistance than found in existing theory, I show how
   weaker states can still engage in civil disobedience. A conceptual
   framework of two types of power supports my argument: constituent power
   and destituent power. If state action were expressed through these two
   types of power, then more states and more types of illegal action would
   count as examples of civil disobedience.},

Journal = {PRESIDENTIAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {45},
Number = {2},
Pages = {221-246},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Existing studies of executive orders tend to focus on two issues: how
   the frequency of executive orders has changed over time and whether the
   nature of presidential power has changed such that we should reconsider
   Neustadt's thesis that bargaining is the essence of presidential power.
   Although institutionalists bemoan the literature's focus on the
   ``personal presidency,{''} no study of unilateral uses of power has
   taken into account the systematic influence of presidents'
   personalities. Instead, studies that consider why some presidents issue
   more executive orders than others focus on contextual factors, not
   attributes of the presidents. In this article we address this gap in the
   literature by examining whether presidents' personality traits
   significantly influence their propensity to issue executive orders. The
   results of our analysis demonstrate that both personality and
   institutional factors play a significant role in presidents' decisions
   to act unilaterally.},

Abstract = {How democratic is contemporary Indonesia? While analysts differ,
   Indonesian citizens, when asked in systematic public opinion surveys
   conducted regularly by the authors since 1999, consistently express
   strong support for democratic principles and also believe that their
   country's democratic performance is high. Support for democratic
   performance is highly correlated with support for government
   performance, as measured by perceptions of the condition of the national
   economy and political system. At the same time, higher levels of
   education and income, in Indonesia as in other countries, have created a
   considerable number of critical citizens, that is, citizens who value
   democracy but are critical of its performance. On our evidence for
   Indonesia, it is members of this group who are the most motivated and
   best prepared to demand a higher level of democratic performance from
   their elected officials.},

Title = {Understanding Urban-Rural Patterns of BJP Campaigning in UP (Lok Sabha
   Elections 2014)},
Journal = {STUDIES IN INDIAN POLITICS},

Volume = {3},

Pages = {111-123},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The electoral patterns in Lok Sabha as well as state assembly elections
   reflect perceptible differences and variations across regions, groups,
   communities and constituencies. One such significant variation is found
   in urban and rural pattern of voting and party campaigning. The rural
   voter turnout in Uttar Pradesh stood at 58.5 per cent as compared to
   54.7 per cent in urban localities. The difference also lies in party
   support in urban and rural areas, issues of campaigning and finally
   strategies to connect with rural and urban masses. Is the recent Lok
   Sabha election also a testimony to such variations? Or has the gap
   reduced due to predominance of other kinds of polarizations, especially
   religion?
   BJP's landslide victory in recent Lok Sabha elections and above all its
   ability to secure 71 out of 80 in Uttar Pradesh, the state with largest
   number of seats in Lok Sabha, marked a decisive shift in the electoral
   verdict of the masses. Its vote share in the state increased by 25 per
   cent.
   The article would engage with a comparative study of urban and rural
   electoral patterns by accounting for variations in vote share,
   strategies used by political parties to attract rural and urban voters,
   issues of relevance for women voters and areas where religious
   polarization made the rural-urban divide immaterial as both urban and
   rural voters responded equally to religious appeals.},

Abstract = {Many scholars have examined the durability of parliamentary versus
   presidential regimes in democracies, but the process by which
   authoritarian leaders are (nominally) elected is generally assumed to be
   irrelevant. However, even if the electoral outcome is not in doubt, the
   executive selection process may affect outcomes such as regime
   durability. I argue that, when opposition parties are allowed to
   participate in the executive selection process, a Parliament-based
   election system increases authoritarian regime durability by creating
   incentives for ruling party elites to work cooperatively for mutual
   gain. In this article, I identify dictatorships by executive selection
   system and find that regimes with a multiparty Parliament-based system
   are more durable than those with a multiparty Presidential system or an
   Unelected (or single party) system if the party, relative to the ruler
   and the military, is an important power center.},

   Capital Index},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {417-440},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {This article argues that the extent to which political office-holders
   can effectively attain and wield authority is a function of the stock of
   `leadership capital'. Drawing on the concept of political capital, the
   article defines leadership capital as aggregate authority composed of
   three dimensions: skills, relations and reputation of a leader.
   Leadership capital ebbs and flows over time within a trajectory of
   acquisition, expenditure and inevitable depreciation. The article
   presents a Leadership Capital Index (LCI) that systematically maps out
   the three broad areas combining concrete measures with interpretive
   aspects. This can be used as a tool for systematically tracking and
   comparing the political fortunes of leaders in a way that is both more
   nuanced and robust than exclusive reliance on the latest approval
   ratings. An illustrative case study of Tony Blair is used to demonstrate
   the LCI. The article concludes by discerning several promising paths for
   future development of the LCI.},

Abstract = {The Russian intervention in Ukraine can be seen not as an isolated
   incident, but as part of a larger strategy aimed at re-establishing
   Russian control and influence over its near abroad - a sphere of
   influence severely diminished with the fall of the Berlin Wall. Building
   on its success in Georgia, the Russian Federation moved aggressively in
   2014 to seize Crimea and destabilise eastern Ukraine. In each case,
   Russia leveraged ethnic Russian populations to encourage separatist
   movements, introducing Russian paramilitaries, intelligence operatives,
   special forces and eventually conventional forces. In this hypothetical
   scenario, written as a historical perspective', Richard D Hooker, Jr
   examines a possible next move against the Baltic States, where similar
   conditions apply. Should Russia move against the Baltics, NATO will face
   its most challenging test in a generation.},

Abstract = {Interest groups work to influence politics. Come election time, groups
   have an interest in affecting the composition of parliament and
   government. On their side, parties value the resources groups can
   contribute to election campaigns. Active electioneering by groups
   entails risks, however, as some voters and group members may be offended
   by close interaction between political parties and interest groups.
   Based on a cost-benefit framework, this article develops a set of
   expectations concerning the electoral engagement of interest groups.
   These are investigated drawing on a survey of all national Danish
   interest groups conducted after the 2011 national election. Most groups
   see the election as important, but the level of active electioneering is
   low. The analysis of variation in election involvement contrasts
   partisan and non-partisan engagement in the election and finds variation
   in the level and nature of engagement between different types of groups.},

Title = {Can experts judge elections? Testing the validity of expert judgments
   for measuring election integrity},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {54},
Number = {2},
Pages = {305-325},

Abstract = {Expert surveys have been used to measure a wide variety of phenomena in
   political science, ranging from party positions, to corruption, to the
   quality of democracy and elections. However, expert judgments raise
   important validity concerns, both about the object being measured as
   well as the experts. It is argued in this article that the context of
   evaluation is also important to consider when assessing the validity of
   expert surveys. This is even more important for expert surveys with a
   comprehensive, worldwide scope, such as democracy or corruption indices.
   This article tests the validity of expert judgments about election
   integrity - a topic of increasing concern to both the international
   community and academics. Evaluating expert judgments of election
   integrity provides an important contribution to the literature
   evaluating the validity of expert surveys as instruments of measurement
   as: (1) the object under study is particularly complex to define and
   multifaceted; and (2) election integrity is measured in widely varying
   institutional contexts, ranging from electoral autocracies to liberal
   democracies. Three potential sources of bias are analysed (the object,
   the experts and the context), using a unique new dataset on election
   integrity entitled the Perceptions of Electoral Integrity' dataset. The
   data include over 800 experts in 66 parliamentary and presidential
   elections worldwide. It is found that validity of expert judgments about
   election integrity is increased if experts are asked to provide factual
   information (rather than evaluative judgments), and if they are asked to
   evaluate election day (rather than pre-election) integrity. It is also
   found that ideologically polarised elections and elections of lower
   integrity increase expert disagreement about election integrity. The
   article concludes with suggestions for researchers using the expert
   survey data on election integrity on how to check the validity of their
   data and adjust their analyses accordingly, and outlines some remaining
   challenges for future data collection using expert surveys.},

Abstract = {Few aspects of Hobbes's thought received as much recent attention as his
   religion; yet there are no comprehensive analyses of Hobbes's biblical
   exegesis. To illustrate a possible method and the value of such studies,
   this article traces Hobbes's strings of references in Leviathan, Part
   III. It shows that despite ascribing the authority to finalise, censor,
   and otherwise control biblical editions to the Sovereign, Hobbes
   preferred the Geneva to the King James Bible. The article also considers
   some implications of Hobbes's Bible interpretations for the
   constitutional design of his Christian Commonwealth, including
   representation, the Christian Sovereign, anticlericalism, and the Second
   Coming.},

Abstract = {Financial regional arrangements vary across countries and change over
   time. Until recently, most economists and political scientists took the
   European model of monetary integration as the yardstick to which all
   other regional financial arrangements had to measure up in this article.
   It is argued that the Euro crisis provides an opportunity for scholars
   to adopt a different perspective that does not interpret the variety of
   financial arrangements merely as economic deficiencies caused by the
   incapacity or unwillingness of regions to follow the European model.
   Instead, the comparative study of monetary and financial regionalism has
   to account for the different factors that shape variations. These go
   from different levels of economic development, over regional political
   and economic preferences to historical processes which shape the
   institutional context and the constellation of interests and social
   forces. Such an approach, which integrates economic and political
   science approaches, de-centres the Euro model and opens up a new
   understanding of the global diversity of regional monetary and financial
   cooperation, and their potential to cope with financial crises.},

Title = {The construction of a `narrative' in Australian federal budget speeches,

Volume = {50},

Abstract = {Given the significance of annual budgetary decisions in both fiscal
   terms and policy reach, the annual federal budget speech has a
   distinctive place in Australia's parliamentary cycle. The speeches
   afford a government a significant opportunity to articulate its economic
   policy agenda and to contrast its agenda with that of its predecessors
   or the Opposition. This article reviews the budget speeches of two
   Treasurers, Peter Costello (Liberal, 1996-2007) and Wayne Swan (Labor,
   2008-13), and compares them with respect to how they used the budget
   speech to position their parties and their governments. Costello's

   research illustrates the complexity of the merger process including the
   manipulation of media to increase pressure, the authority of leadership

Abstract = {The National Authority for Consumer Protection of Romania has recently
   completed the public consultation on the draft law on alternative
   dispute resolution between consumers and professionals. The law is
   intended to transpose the Directive 2013/11/EU of the European
   Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on alternative dispute
   resolution for consumer disputes (Directive on consumer ADR) into the
   national legal system. The Romanian authorities seem to prefer a
   centralized approach, completely excluding from the process the private
   ADR entities that already exist, such as mediators and organizations
   that provide mediation services. The financial and administrative burden
   of the procedure is generally attributed to businesses. The total cost
   of transposition is still unknown and a number of uncertainties arising
   from the wording of the Directive are perpetuated. The purpose of this
   article is to present some important aspects of the future law, with an
   emphasis on the main challenges that mediators and businesses will face
   in the near future if the law is to be adopted as such by the Romanian
   Parliament.},

Abstract = {Democracy asks its citizens to make informed judgments about collective
   matters. Given the scale and complexity of modern polities, however,
   even the most attentive citizens cannot engage knowledgeably with most
   of the collective decisions that affect them. For this reason,
   democratic theorists increasingly conceptualize democratic systems as
   requiring divisions of cognitive labor, in which citizens trust others
   to make decisions on their behalf. Modern democracies have long relied
   on such trustees, yet institutional supports for good trust decisions by
   citizens are often weak or missing. We argue that deliberative
   minipublics can serve as trusted information proxies that help citizens
   make the most of their scarce cognitive resources. These kinds of
   trustees cannot close the gap between the demands of complex societies
   and citizens' capacities for informed judgment, but they may be able to
   narrow it.},

Abstract = {China has become more assertive on its sovereignty claims. Such a change
   has long been campaigned by the People's Liberation Army (PLA),
   illustrating PLA's role in South China Sea (SCS) affairs. Beijing tries
   to strike a subtle balance between confrontation-aversion and being firm
   on China's core national interests embodied in its sovereignty claims.
   Under this civil-military convergence in Beijing's SCS policy, the PLA
   is supportive of pre-emptive measures within well pre-designed ``red
   lines{''}.},

Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},

Volume = {37},
Number = {1},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper explores how multivocal appeals, meaning appeals that have
   distinct meanings to different audiences, work with respect to religious
   language. Religious language is common in politics, but there is great
   variation in its effectiveness. I argue that multivocal appeals can
   resonate as religious with select audiences but have no religious
   content for other listeners. I test the effectiveness of multivocal and
   obvious religious appeals experimentally with two national samples: an
   ingroup that understands the religious connotations in a multivocal
   appeal and a religiously diverse outgroup that does not. Religious
   appeals are persuasive for the ingroup, but an obvious religious appeal
   can be politically costly by triggering negative reactions among
   outgroup members, while the religious meaning in a multivocal appeal
   eludes them. Obvious religious appeals are costly in the diverse
   audience because of different preferences over the appropriate role for
   religion in political speech.},

Abstract = {This paper studies whether or not the government investment expenditures
   affect the growth rate of GDP per capita in the long term with reference
   to production function with constant returns to scale and one sector
   within the context of endogenous growth theory that emerged in 1980s.
   Endogenous growth models, unlike neoclassical growth models, argue that
   productive government expenditures may affect the growth rate of GDP per
   capita in the long term. This argument has been studied through
   conditional ECM approach (ARDL bounds test) for the Turkish economy in
   the period 1980-2013. The results indicate that ratio of total
   government investment do not affect the growth rate of GDP per capita in
   the long term. Increasing of ratio of government equipment investment
   has an effect on long-nm per capita gdp growth, but however, this effect
   is smaller than Solow's prediction.},

Abstract = {The annexation of the Crimea and Russia's war against Ukraine have
   sparked a debate over whether the West bears a share of responsibility
   for the military escalation. One position claims that Russia's elite
   feels threatened by the eastern enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty
   Organisation. The West, it is said, broke a promise made during the ``2
   + 4{''} negotiations that it would not expand NATO to the east. This
   interpretation is void of any basis in fact: there was no such promise.},

Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {26-48},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Is there a relationship between party leader gender and voters'
   assessments? The answer is yes' according to theses on gender identity
   and stereotyping. A voter survey during the 2011 Danish general election
   allows for a comprehensive analysis of a less likely case with four male
   and four female party leaders. Female party leaders are assessed more
   positively by female voters than male voters both in regard to general
   party leader sympathy and assessment of specific characteristics,
   whereas it is not the case that male party leaders are assessed more
   positively by male voters than female voters. The impact of gender does
   not increase with age; in fact, the opposite is the case among men since
   younger male voters have less sympathy for female party leaders.
   Furthermore, there is no support for the expectation that voters with
   more education or with higher levels of political interest and knowledge
   are more positive towards party leaders of their own gender than voters
   with less education. Also, the relationship between gender and voter
   assessment is not stronger prior to an election campaign than
   immediately after an election. Hence, in sum, gender identity does not
   seem to require a higher level of political sophistication, nor does it
   decrease with higher levels of information.},

Abstract = {Despite criticism of ongoing protectionism, this study argues that
   Canada's internal trade regime has evolved significantly since the
   implementation of the original Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT). This
   includes thirteen formal amendments to the AIT and numerous regional
   agreements in Western, Central, and Atlantic Canada. Borrowing from the
   liberal International Political Economy (IPE) literature it argues that
   existing regional agreements complement and offer a potential framework
   for broader internal trade reforms at the national level. Of these the
   New West Partnership Trade Agreement (NWPTA) offers a promising model
   for Canada's internal market, with revised rules and norms related to
   negative lists, labour mobility, procurement, and investment and dispute
   settlement. Ongoing efforts to remove barriers will also be linked to a
   strengthened Internal Trade Secretariat, confidence-building measures,
   increased transparency and further reform of technical language.},

Journal = {JAPANESE JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {114-137},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The prevailing theory states that either Japanese voters have stopped
   ideologically distinguishing parties or that the main political parties
   in Japan have become more centrist in recent years. These arguments are
   based on survey questions asking citizens to locate parties on an
   ideological scale. However, these questions may suffer from noise caused
   by respondents who misinterpret the question wording or answer the
   questions inappropriately to mask their misunderstanding of the terms
   `left' and `right'. To address this problem by extracting only the views
   of those who know the meaning of left-right terms, this article develops
   a mixture model. Applying the model to an opinion poll conducted after
   the 2012 Japanese general election, I confirm that those who comprehend
   the left-right terminology - slightly over half of all voters - largely
   perceived parties' ideologies in the same way as experts. Additionally,
   I find that even these voters face difficulties in placing ambiguous or
   new parties on the political spectrum. This study has implications not
   only for understanding trends in Japanese political ideology, but also
   for survey design and analysis of heterogeneous survey responses.},

Abstract = {The regulation of immigration and how immigrants are treated once they
   settle in a country are fundamental aspects of national policy. Existing
   descriptions of the developments of immigration and integration policy
   have either provided a limited snapshot, or relied on the author's
   subjective assessment of how policies developed over time. In this
   research note, we provide a systematic and truly historical assessment
   of immigration and integration policy in Switzerland: between the
   foundation of modern Switzerland in 1848 and 2014. The most recent MIPEX
   questionnaire was used to provide a systematic and multidimensional
   portrait of how immigration and integration policy has evolved in
   Switzerland. Using these data, we identify three distinctive periods
   (expansive, restricting, expanding), and argue that the changes in
   policies reflect the fact that immigrants are increasingly accepted as a
   permanent feature of Swiss society.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {46-58},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {For a movement that emerged to spotlight the crisis of liberal
   democracy, it did not take long for the Occupy Movement to find itself
   embroiled in its own democratic crisis. Occupy's story has exposed just
   how central or constitutive crises are to democracy. But is crisis such
   a deleterious thing? Though scholars of democracy have customarily given
   it a bad name, should we consider democracies to be in trouble when they
   are met with crisis, when they themselves create a crisis? According to
   the three volumes reviewed in this article, crises can have the
   potential to hamper and destroy democracies, but they can also possess
   the uncanny capacity to reinvigorate them. For scholars of democracy -
   whether they choose to define `democracy' using a liberal,
   participatory, deliberative, or some other paradigm - it is perhaps this
   latter interpretation of crisis that may provide the best way to grapple
   with what comes next for democracy post-Occupy.},

Title = {A Diasporic Critique of Diasporism: The Question of Jewish Political
   Agency},
Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1},
Pages = {80-110},

Abstract = {As the prospects for a negotiated two-state solution to the
   Israeli-Palestinian conflict have dwindled, Jewish scholars in the
   United States have increasingly invoked the concept of diaspora to
   counter a purported Jewish consensus regarding Zionism. In this essay, I
   critique prominent exponents of this approach (Judith Butler, Jonathan
   and Daniel Boyarin) from a diasporic (i.e., non-Zionist) standpoint. My
   concern is not that Butler and the Boyarins attack Israel publicly,
   endorse a binational solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
   and/or support the movement for Boycott, Divestment, and
   Sanctionsrather, it is that they lack a compelling vision for diasporic
   politics. Their visions prove wanting because they contest Zionism on
   the terrain of Jewish identity. To loosen Zionism's hold, Butler and the
   Boyarins recover alternative approaches to the attainment or grounding
   of Jewish identity. Yet when framed as an ethic of particular identity,
   diasporic thinking can neither rebut Zionism's political arguments, nor
   can it develop alternative models of Jewish self-rule. Instead of
   theorizing Jewish identity, I argue, diasporic thinkers should envision
   Jewish political solidarity beyond the confines of the nation-state.},

Abstract = {For Rene Girard, mimetic rivalry is the main cause of violence. Mimetic
   theory addresses a fundamental problem of international relations
   theory: the problem of anarchy as it is outlined in basic texts of
   Realism, also acknowledging the conflicting potential of desire. The
   article argues for deepening the discussion between the mimetic theory
   of the French philosopher, anthropologist, and literary theorist Girard
   and the tradition of twentieth-century Realism as exemplified by Hans
   Morgenthau, who frequently stressed in his concept of ``the
   political{''} the importance of the human desire for power. For Girard,
   the problem of conflicting desire is solved by the scapegoat mechanism,
   the canalization of mimetic violence. Nevertheless, international
   relations theory reveals that identity is formed prior to the
   construction of the Other. I argue that Girard's insights can enrich
   thinking about the terms Self, Other, and identity, particularly in the
   twentieth-century Realist tradition. Ultimately, this leads to the
   proposition that appreciating Girard's thoughts helps make implicit
   claims and assumptions of Realism, particularly regarding violence and
   sub-state issues, more explicit.},

Abstract = {Historical archaeology is defined as the study of capitalism, even
   though it has seldom confronted capitalism head on. A philosophy of
   internal relations provides powerful tools with which to confront
   capitalism. In this paper, I present a range of historical
   archaeological case studies to explore larger themes relevant to a
   philosophy of internal relations, including methodological implications,
   understanding capitalism's `laws of motion', and their relevance for the
   dialectical integration of present, past and future. Historical
   archaeology can help in understanding capitalist dispossession: by
   fleshing out how capitalism has unfolded, humanising these processes,
   and emphasising how contested and contingent the history of capitalism
   was.},

Abstract = {The emergence of `compacts' between government and the `third' or
   `not-for-profit' sector is intimately linked to the comprehensive
   transformation of the welfare state. The first compacts in the United
   Kingdom in 1998 spawned similar policy instruments in other
   jurisdictions, including Australia. In 2006 the Labor opposition led by
   Kevin Rudd undertook to repair a `broken' relationship between the
   federal government and the not-for-profit sector. The National Compact,
   launched in March 2010, was an initial step in a bumpy policy journey.
   Prime Minister Rudd was replaced in June 2010 by Julia Gillard, who
   portrayed the National Compact as the `foundation stone' of a broader
   reform agenda. Although dogged by political instability, Gillard pursued
   ground-breaking reforms in the not-for-profit policy space. These
   reforms are now threatened with repeal by the Coalition government
   elected in 2013. This paper attempts to explain why Labor's reform
   agenda appears set to unravel.},

Abstract = {Research on the impact of parties on public policy, and on immigration
   policy in particular, often finds limited evidence of partisan
   influence. In this paper, we examine immigration policy-making in the UK
   coalition government. Our case provides evidence that parties in
   government can have more of an impact on policy than previous studies
   acknowledge, but this only becomes apparent when we open up the black
   box' between election outcomes and policy outputs. By examining how,
   when and why election pledges are turned into government policies, we
   show that partisan influence depends not only on dynamics between the
   coalition partners, but how these dynamics interact with
   interdepartmental conflicts and lobbying by organised interests.
   In-depth process tracing allows us to see these complex dynamics, which
   easily get lost in large-n comparisons of pledges and outputs, let alone
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {As a condition of receiving foreign aid, developing country governments
   have actively tried to achieve pro-people development through community
   participation in local-level development projects. Based on a case study
   of Bangladesh, this article analyses the impact of community
   participation on the various governance-related issues such as
   accountability, transparency, responsiveness and predictability during
   the implementation of such projects. The empirical findings reveal that
   efforts to achieve such objectives have mostly been futile, leaving
   community participation in the local governance process as an inchoate
   and piecemeal affair. Political manipulation, clientelism and inadequate
   governance structure and processes have been the key stumbling blocks
   contributing to such failures. This study provides important insights
   into governance at the local level, implying that greater awareness and
   participation are needed to formulate and implement effective
   community-based local governance in developing countries such as
   Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {Since the leadership transition in China in November 2012, there have
   been significant changes in Chinese foreign policy. It has been widely
   observed that under the new leadership headed by President Xi Jinping,
   Beijing has become more assertive in international affairs. This paper
   ex- amines the emerging contours of China's foreign policy under Xi and
   the implications for the future regional order in the Asia Pacific. It
   argues that recent international behaviour of China is the manifestation
   of a new phase of Chinese foreign policy that could be defined as
   `peaceful rise 2.0'. In this analysis, while Beijing still adheres to
   its declared `peaceful development' policy aiming to maintain a stable
   external environment conducive to its ascendance, the manner in which it
   seeks to do so are considerably different from past decades. The paper
   further argues that despite China's growing power, President Xi faces
   greater difficulties than his predecessor to achieve his foreign policy
   objectives. Indeed Beijing's capacity to shape the regional environment
   in its favour in the near future is arguably declining rather than
   increasing.},

Volume = {28},

Pages = {153+},
Abstract = {To withstand the challenges they face every day due to the veil they
   wear, the Muslim women whom I interviewed make use of an original view
   of the veil question in France: the religious theme of resilience in the
   face of difficulties.
   Far from being a call for collective mobilization in the name of Islam,
   it rather translates what Weber called ``the `theodicy of
   suffering'-that is, the way in which religion gives meaning to
   suffering, thereby changing it from a source of revolution to a vehicle
   of redemption{''} (Peter Berger).
   After demonstrating how the stigmatization of veiled Muslims is
   transfigured into a resilience test by religious discourse, I identify
   how women use this theme and the reasons why they are aligned with it.},

Title = {SYMBOLIC POLITICS IN POST-SOVIET UKRAINE: CONSTRUCTION OF THE
   LEGITIMIZING NARRATIVE},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2015},
Number = {4},
Pages = {34-45},
Abstract = {The article analyses certain aspects and results of symbolic politics in
   post-Soviet Ukraine, which is unfolding in the conditions resulting from
   the collapse of the state and the erosion of symbolic resources for
   constructing national identity. The authors believe that one of the
   factors that contributed to the failure of the Ukrainian version of
   state construction is the particular format of symbolic politics
   selected by Ukrainian intellectual and political elites as an actual
   scenario for constructing Ukrainian national identity. Symbolic politics
   is viewed in this context as a communicative process of legitimizing
   political dominance and constructing a collective identity regardless of
   any particular type of a political regime. This is based on the fact
   that all political regimes seek to achieve effective political
   communication, which stabilizes relations of domination over the long
   term by developing legitimate reception of the social world and diverse
   rituals whose functional meaning is mass-scale involvement of the
   population in the reproduction of the symbolic order. This process
   ultimately involves not only political and intellectual elites, but also
   various agents of socialization and media-professionals, while social
   audiences become active recipients of political communication, capable
   of alternative decoding of the dominant ideological content developed by
   the elites. The authors stress that the main distinctive aspect of the
   legitimizing narrative at the core of the formation of the Ukrainian
   national state is its syncretic character which involves ideological
   codes of neoliberalism and of the nationalizing state-building with
   different underlying types of identity. The neoliberal ideological code
   is based on the opposition between the market and the state and on the
   model identity of homo economicus, while the ideological narratives
   invoked to invent a nation focus not on the rational actor and on
   minimizing the role of the state viewed as inefficient manager, but on
   the macropolitical identity constructed by a string national state.},

Abstract = {The Mali-Sahel periphery is not an ``ungoverned space{''} captured and
   preyed on by the transnational forces of global ``crime-terrorism{''}
   nexuses but an area of overlapping and competing networks of informal
   governance. Some have an agenda of resistance, others are more aligned
   with coping and criminality. What they share is that they are neither
   entirely state nor nonstate but somewhere in between. Different
   competing ``big men{''} vie for the role of nodal points in different
   networks of informal governance: some mainly profit-driven, others
   combining income-generating strategies with social and political
   objectives, and yet others simply aiming to cope (and hopefully thrive
   in the future).},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of violence on the state and on
   civil-military relations of pro-government militias that failed to use
   violence to influence the outcome of the conflict. It uses the case of
   the Mouvement Patriotique Ganda Koy and the Ganda Iso. It argues that,
   since 2012, militias have succeeded in increasing political influence
   and in framing a national narrative; it further reflects on how state
   sovereignty can be reappropriated by the agency of civilians once a
   state institution, the military, fails to defend it.},

Abstract = {The annexation of the Crimea in March 2014 and Russia's war against
   Ukraine are an attack on Europe. The West must adjust to sustained
   confrontation with Russia. The mantra that security and stability in
   Europe cannot be achieved without Russia is questionable, as is the
   admonishment of Europeans - to themselves! - to maintain dialogue with
   the Kremlin. Putin's revisionist confrontation course demands a clear
   response. These include re-establishing a Western defence capability,
   containment against aggression, sanctions, and comprehensive support for
   Ukraine. What is needed is a Western policy along the lines of
   ``peaceful coexistence{''}: cooperation wherever possible, resistance
   wherever necessary.},

Abstract = {This article reconstructs the main arguments in John Locke's first
   political writings, the highly rhetorical, and often obscure, Two Tracts
   on Government (1660-1662). The Tracts support the government's right to
   impose religious ceremonies on its people, an astonishing fact given
   Locke's famous defense of toleration in his later works. The
   reconstruction of the Tracts developed here allows us to see that rather
   than a pessimistic view of the prospects for peace under religious
   diversity, what mainly animates the young Locke is a desire to defend
   the rule of law against an anarchical conception of religious freedom.
   The article also argues that the evolution of Locke's thinking on
   religious freedom was in large part governed by Locke's attempt to
   interpret religious freedom in a way that avoids its having anarchical
   implications.},

   Idea},
Journal = {OSTEUROPA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {65},
Number = {7-10},
Pages = {515+},
Abstract = {The idea of Europe came to Georgia from Russia. In the first half of the
   19th century, Georgian aristocrats in the Tsar's service began to read
   works of German idealism and Romantic poetry in Russian translation.
   These texts brought the national idea to Georgia. For the national
   movement of the 1870s-1890s, Russia was also the gateway to Europe. In
   the early 20th century, for the first time ever, poets from the
   symbolist group ``Blue Horns{''} spoke not of a move towards a modern
   Europe, but of Georgia's ``return{''} to European civilisation. After
   the establishment of Soviet rule in Georgia, the official doctrine for
   70 years was that the socialist future lies in Asia. Only with
   Perestroika did the idea of a return to the common European home once
   again emerge. However, in the past two decades, Russia has lost its role
   as the mediator of European ideas. Today, it is the opponents of a
   European Georgia who look to Moscow.},

   Frankfurt School},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Pages = {473-485},
Abstract = {Frankfurt School critical theory has always been concerned with
   revealing the various ways in which economic systems and social
   practices can dominate or oppress. It is therefore somewhat surprising
   that the tradition has had relatively little to say about private
   property rights. Indeed, this is all the more surprising because Hegel
   and Marx are crucial sources of inspiration for contemporary critical
   theory, and both gave an in-depth discussion of the structure and
   legitimacy of private property. This paper offers a new analysis of
   Hegel's justification of private property, Marx's critical response, and
   the relevance of such views for contemporary critical theory. This
   analysis builds upon Hegel's discussion of ``Abstract Right{''} in his
   Elements of the Philosophy of Right and Marx's ``Economic and
   Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844.{''}},

Abstract = {This article studies urban gardening as a form of social resilience. It
   analyses its role and impact on society in a context of social and
   financial crisis through the lens of the debate about the commons on the
   basis of three case studies conducted in Brussels in 2013. The study
   connects the specificities of the current social and economic context
   with the new wave of urban gardening from a people -centred perspective.
   Both the motivations and the outcomes of this form of activism are
   analysed and led to the conclusion that being involved in urban
   gardening represents not only a way to cope with economic and social
   threats but also a tool to rebuild and reshape social bonds.
   The paper aims to contribute to the current debate about the commons,
   intended as a form of resilience and a tool of social change rather than
   a simple alternative economic model. It aims to do so through the
   analysis of urban gardening practices, which are more commonly studied
   from the perspective of urban agriculture, food production, access to
   land and urbanism.},

   practice and even setting precedents for ecologically sustainable and
   socially egalitarian ways of living in a city, squatters also furnish
   ways of enabling resilience in the face of socially and environmentally
   devastating policies. Urban squats thereby exemplify an alternative,
   practical eco-social response and counter to the capitalist city.
   Borrowing from ecofeminist and non-market socialist insights, we discuss
   case studies from Barcelona and Rome demonstrating how urban squatters
   engage in subsistence oikonomic practices and balance forms of sometimes
   confrontational resistance with adaptive resilience.},

Abstract = {The article identifies the peculiarity of advertising images in their
   specific normative status: comparing to other forms or types of images
   the advertising image doesn't show particular additional esthetics or
   cognitive features. Its peculiarity consists in the normative task it
   has to fulfill. An advertisement neither is an image that is more or
   less beautiful then other images produced by art, nor has a more
   consistent cognitive content then others. On the contrary it is an
   image, which fulfill a normative function: it has to shape social
   conducts, individual behaviors and common taste more than any other
   image that a given society can produce or consume. The article therefore
   questions the nature and the working principle of a norm, which presents
   an iconic substance rather than a linguistic or verbal one. On the one
   hand the text tries to understand what is a norm, which has to work
   within the visual sphere and with a perceptible and sensitive
   communication form. On the other hand it tries to break the
   identification of law system, normativity and language. Law and norm
   have to be conceived as a peculiar way of existence of the most diverse
   symbolic forms},

Abstract = {Participation in the Andean area and the strong influence of social
   movements have generated the creation of regulatory laws concerning the
   environment as an institutionalized process. It is within this
   regulation that activities of social and ecological interest such as
   recycling, in which work was not done in an orderly manner, start to
   adopt inclusive ways of work with methodologies that include different
   participants as institutions, citizens, and organizations.
   As well as regulations have been generated, articles in the Constitution
   and items in the National Plan for Good Living (Plan del Buen Vivir),
   participatory processes have been developed which has led many cities to
   work on inclusive recycling; that is, where the people who recycle are
   recognized as society leaders.
   This will be the topic of this article: to identify the regulations and
   methodologies that within the recycling processes improved the
   participation of the people.},

Abstract = {Poland's road to the euro proved bumpy and its early status as a euro
   pacesetter developed into one of euro laggard. So why, prior to the
   sovereign debt crisis, did Poland remain among the group of Central and
   East European countries that had not yet adopted the euro? What are the
   political barriers for euro adoption in Poland? This paper argues that
   domestic factors such as the existence of veto points, public opinion,
   central bank institutional features, and the role of political elites
   are key to answering the research questions. With the euro crises, the
   domestic problems were accompanied by declining public support for euro
   adoption along with an unfavorable external environment that is pushing
   euro adoption further away.},

Abstract = {Previous research has proved that a high level of consensus in the
   lawmaking process can be found in the European parliamentary
   democracies. This consensual pattern of behaviour cannot be explained by
   the systemic factors traditionally believed to account for the variation
   in the opposition among countries. The Italian case demonstrates that
   none of the noteworthy changes that occurred in the political system
   over the last 20 years have affected the amount of consensus between
   government and opposition. The aim of the present article is to explore
   which factors might influence the (more or less) consensual conduct of
   the Italian parliamentary opposition in the law-making process and, in
   doing so, to contribute to the progress of research in this field.},

Abstract = {President G. W. Bush faced the worst American attack in the history of
   the USA. The attacks of September 11, 2001 were clearly a watershed
   moment in American history. Similar to the barbaric invasion of Rome,
   led by Hannibal, the USA would never be the same after the infamous day
   of September 11, 2001. In this chapter, I examine President G. W. Bush's
   response to the attacks and determine whether he supported an implied
   theory of executive emergency power. I find through thorough research of
   classified documents that President Bush did invoke a theory of implied
   executive emergency power and used his own prerogative to determine what
   powers to use and when to use such powers in waging America's War on
   Terror.},

Abstract = {The core concern of this article is derived from my personal experience
   of being stopped and questioned at Heathrow Airport on 28 March 2012 for
   possession of ``suspect materials{''}: academic books on terrorism. I
   seek to utilise this experience to reflect on how logics of
   counterterrorism can become manifested in bizarre and prejudicial ways,
   and how autoethnography provides a unique means to articulate human
   experiences of such logics. I further utilise my experience to reflect
   on the dynamics of academic privilege, which often flourish at the
   expense of the voices of ``ordinary citizens{''}, and argue that
   autoethnography can be embraced as an empowering form of self-expression
   through which ``ordinary citizens{''} might de-subjugate themselves from
   the margins of academia towards an emancipatory ideal wherein the lived
   experiences of such citizens occupy a substantial space in academic and
   popular understandings of (counter) terrorism.},

Journal = {PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {68},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In June 2010, the House of Commons agreed standing order changes
   creating the Backbench Business Committee, which was to schedule Commons
   business on 35 days a session. This was both claimed as `a defining
   moment of parliamentary reform' (HC Deb, 15 June 2010, c787) and
   dismissed as comprising only `very modest changes indeed' (HC Deb, 22
   February 2010, c118). Using parliamentary records and interviews with
   MPs and parliamentary officials, this article assesses the Committee's
   effectiveness during the 2010-2012 session and makes recommendations on
   how its effectiveness can be enhanced for the future. It finds the
   Committee to have made a significant impact, enhancing the transparency
   of scheduling non-government business, improving the relevance of
   Commons debates and showing itself to be an excellent method of holding
   government to account. The article warns, however, that changes made at
   the end of the session to the way the Committee is elected risk
   undermining its future effectiveness.},

   Domestic Labor.{''} Both essays illustrate the versatility and precision
   of the analytic approach they share, which can be referred to as
   antiessentialist class theory or New Marxism. Drucilla Barker's article
   discusses the complex strands that compose the social fabric of the
   various households presented in essays by Maliha Safri, Esra Erdem, and
   Graham Cassano. Cecilia Rio applies antiessentialist class theory to
   both economic and emotional labor within the domestic realm. The strands
   of meaning that both authors weave include class, race, gender,
   ethnicity, and psychology.},

Abstract = {The fast development and use of new information and communication
   technologies (especially, the Internet) has changed traditional ways and
   tools of electoral propaganda and information of political parties and
   candidates in electoral campaigns. The use of new technologies in
   electoral campaigns carried out by political parties raises serious
   conflicts with voters personal data safeguards (especially when using
   citizens personal data to send them political messages through emails,
   mobile phone messages, voice messages, automated phone calls, etc.).
   This research is focused on answering key issues as how to make data
   protection right compatible with direct and personalized campaign or how
   to avoid that technological development breaches the main principles of
   the right to data protection in the electoral process.},

Abstract = {There is an unresolved puzzle in research on the economics of democracy.
   While there is consensus that democracy is not generally associated with
   higher rates of economic growth, recent studies have found that
   democratization is followed by growth. But why should becoming a
   democracy bring growth if being one does not? This article shows that a
   substantial and immediate influx of foreign aid into new democracies
   accounts for the positive growth effect of democratization. The domestic
   regime characteristics of neither democracy nor democratization
   therefore seems to bring growth. The importance of aid in explaining the
   democratization-growth nexus underscores that democratizations do not
   occur in vacuum and cannot be fully understood from internal factors
   alone.},

Abstract = {For a long time, ``ideological battles{''} and the joint decision trap
   characterized the coordination of school policy. Nevertheless
   international school benchmarks managed to become established as a new
   mode of coordination in school policy. However, rather than the
   `PISA-shock' of 2001, it was the Konstanz Decision of 1997 by the KMK
   that set the precondition for this change. Only after the loosened
   coupling of the arenas of party competition and joint-decision-making
   could the coordination between Bund and Lander as well as among the
   Lander themselves operate in a different context. Under the condition of
   loosely coupled arenas, well-known instruments of the concept of joint
   decision-making motivated the Konstanz Decision of the KMK.},

Abstract = {In Armenia and Azerbaijan, relations between society and state are
   characterised by distance. Institutions of (self-) governance at the
   local level do not bring about convergence. They serve the ruling elites
   in the implementation of their interests and grant the population no
   possibility of influencing governmental decisions on local matters. The
   population is essentially left to pursue their concerns through self
   -organisation or personal networks.},

Title = {Theory, Method, and the Mechanism of Framing: Reflections on the Syrian
   Civil War and Palestinian Intifada},
Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {266-289},
Abstract = {This article bridges two literatures: research on social movements, in
   which framing is widely recognized as an important causal mechanism; and
   research in civil wars and insurgencies, which tends to deemphasize
   culturalinterpretative factors such as framing. We argue that it is
   important that insights of framing be applied to insurgencies because
   there is a fundamental framing action that often occurs. We have in mind
   civil wars in which oppositional activists, who previously had pursued
   nonviolent tactics, apply a prognostic frame of `what to do' that
   specifies armed conflict. Drawing on methodologies of
   subject-verb-object grammars used to analyze political texts, this
   article elaborates a comprehensive approach to framing that involves not
   only shifts in the < verb >, or specifications of `what to do', but also
   shifts in a < subject >, or definitions of `who we are', and in an <
   object >, or the targets of `who the enemy is'. We use organizational
   texts from the first Palestinian Intifada to demonstrate the approach.
   We also consider frame shifts in the Syrian civil war, inferring the
   grammatical structures of the frame transformations for secularists and
   radical Islamists from events leading up to the outbreak of sustained
   violence. This article proposes that a three-part grammatical approach
   captures the interrelated elements of a full and robust framing
   mechanism that is generalizable. It represents an advance over framing
   perspectives that typically isolate identity and target components from
   action prognoses, therefore missing the synchronization among the three,
   and how limits and/or opportunities for one shape the definition of the
   others.},

Abstract = {This article examines Iraqi political developments in the last few
   years. It argues that unless a constitutional mechanism for proper
   dispersal of political powers across Iraq's regions and branches of its
   government is developed quickly, it may become too late for defeating
   Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, stemming the sectarian and ethnic
   conflicts, overcoming its perpetual crises of governance or for keeping
   Iraq united. We suggest that a confederal structure is a better and
   lasting political solution for Iraq than federal or other structural
   configurations. We also argue that power-sharing and consensus must be
   intertwined directly into the constitutional fabric of the political
   structure.},

Abstract = {To be a successful governor in Iowa, and retain the confidence of
   voters, one has to establish a personal connection with voters. This
   chapter concludes that the stranglehold on power enjoyed by Governors
   Ray and Branstad (and could have been enjoyed by Vilsack had he not
   voluntarily stepped down) had as much to do with perceptions of their
   personal character as it did about the electoral context and economic
   conditions. This chapter gets the reader to think about how the case of
   Iowa applies more generally to not just candidates for governor, but
   also candidates for any office, including the presidency given Iowa's
   unique role in the presidential process. Emphasis here is on the fact
   that while this book is about Iowa governors specifically, the results
   speak to a larger audience on the relationships candidates develop with
   voters and how voters evaluate candidates for elected office.},

Title = {IMMIGRANTS AS SOCIAL AGENTS: ALLOCHTONES AND AUTOCHTONES},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2015},
Number = {1},
Pages = {111-125},
Abstract = {The fact that a significant portion of the populations of industrialized
   countries is of immigrant origin ({''}allochthons{''}) provokes sharp
   public debate and political tensions. Conservative politicians stress
   the issue of social disintegration, which is considered inevitable due
   to the alleged cultural incompatibility of the newcomers with the
   indigenous ({''}autochthonous{''}) population. This paper is focused on
   allochtones as social subjects in terms of their incorporation into the
   receiving countries' social institutions. Allochtones shape a new
   electorate, become members of the existing political parties and create
   new ones; integrate into the existing structures of civil society
   (especially NGOs); and form organizations of their own. Since labor
   migration in Russia is in its initial stage, there is no `second
   generation' of immigrants in this country. Trying to imagine how the
   descendants of migrant laborers may become social agents in the Russian
   context, I refer to the experience of Western European countries -
   mainly the UK, France and the Netherlands. In particular, I explore the
   conditions that brought about the transformation of the newcomers from
   an ``invisible{''} group into a visible and active component of public
   life, taking into consideration the forms of their political
   participation. This study finds that the political behavior of newcomers
   does not exhibit any features that would indicate their inability or
   unwillingness to integrate into the institutions of the host country.
   Allochtones are divided along the same ideological boundaries as the
   local population; in their voting behavior they generally reproduce
   patterns of the autochthonous population's electoral behavior (attitudes
   toward the political system, motivations for voting the way they do,
   etc.). The only difference is their ideological preferences: allochtones
   tend to vote for the left. However, as allochtones enter the middle
   class, the number of these newcomers who vote for center-right parties
   increases. Moreover, a significant part of those coming from Asia (not
   only from Islamic countries), due to their allegiance to `traditional
   values,' could be considered as potential electorate for local
   conservatives. As for the parties which claim to represent allochtones
   (whether on ethnic or religious grounds), they remain tiny organizations
   and do not enjoy any significant support of the people they aim to
   represent.},

Abstract = {Regardless of the difficulties connected with the description or
   characteristics of democracy, it must be noted that - like in the case
   of other political systems - it has the capacity of both auto-regulation
   and auto-destruction. Thus, what is so important for the maintenance and
   quality of democracy is the degree of its consolidation, i.e. how
   strongly both citizens and political elites are attached to democracy
   itself as well as to its values, regulations and constraints it entails.
   It should be pointed out that the level of consolidation largely depends
   on the institutional, international, socio-political and cultural
   determinants. Institutional factors show that a high level of democratic
   consolidation is significantly determined by the existing model of a
   political system: societies in the countries with the parliamentary
   system display a higher degree of consolidation, while the degree is
   lower in the presidential system. The reason for this is the fact that
   the cooperation between different political actors is ``forced{''},
   which ensures that the balance between contrasting political views
   (institutionalized in the form of political parties) will be maintained.
   This results in politically extreme groups being blocked, and, finally,
   reflects socio-economic divisions, thus being conducive to the
   realization of civil rights.},

Abstract = {The expansion of democracy following the collapse of communism in
   1989-1990 led many to believe that democratic institutions would rapidly
   take root. However, over the past decade, electoral malpractice has
   become widespread, casting doubt on democratic consolidation. This paper
   examines the causes and consequences of weak electoral integrity in
   Belarus, Russia, and the Ukraine. Using a series of opinion surveys
   conducted since 2000, we show that public perceptions of electoral
   unfairness have their roots in seeing widespread corruption among public
   officials. By contrast, viewing elections as fair correlates with
   support for the incumbent government, and in watching television, the
   latter showing the importance to the regimes of control of the mass
   media. In turn, views about electoral integrity have a significant
   impact on satisfaction with democracy, especially in Belarus. The
   results suggest that only root and branch reform in the post-communist
   societies will substantially improve public perceptions of electoral
   integrity.},

Abstract = {These comments take issue with two aspects of the treatment of Rawls in
   On The People's Terms. First, I criticize the characterization of Rawls
   as downplaying political liberties and focusing instead on social
   justice. Second, I take issue with the claim that Pettit provides a more
   robust conception of legitimacy than Rawls. The basis for this claim is
   that Rawls, along with others in the Kantian tradition, downplays the
   question of legitimacy by `going hypothetical'. Yet in common with
   Rawls, Pettit's republican conception of legitimacy imposes a stringent
   test of legitimacy that many democratic regimes would not pass. This
   leads him to propose a weaker standard of `legitimizability' that
   appears to involve the same kind of counterfactual judgment for which
   Rawls is criticized.},

Pages = {75-91},
Abstract = {As one of the first empirical works to examine cross-provincial
   differences in vote behaviour, this study uses provincial election data
   drawn from eight provincial elections held between 2011 and 2012 to
   assess provincial vote choice. It applies two models of vote choice
   pioneered at the federal level, the ``bloc-recursive{''} model and the
   valence model, to provincial elections. It is found that, despite that
   bloc recursive model encompassing several more variables, both models
   are similar in their ability to predict voter behaviour. However, the
   bloc recursive model is superior for understanding the unique political
   dynamics of each province. As such, the choice of which model to use
   comes down to a preference for nuance or parsimony.},

   review of how previous survey-based studies were conducted to estimate
   the relative preference of democracy as a political system. We then
   introduce hybridization as a new conceptual tool for ascertaining the
   emerging patterns of political orientations among citizens of
   authoritarian and post-authoritarian societies. Finally, we analyze the
   latest, third wave of the Asian Barometer surveys conducted in 11 East
   Asian countries conducted in 2010 and 2011. On the basis of this
   analysis, we argue that it is premature to claim that democracy is
   emerging as the universally preferred system.},

Abstract = {The article justifies the possibility of applying I. Lakatos' theory of
   the scientificresearch programmeto the array of theories referred to as
   the theory of democracy. Having convincingly demonstrated that, despite
   all the differences between the humanities and the natural sciences, the
   corresponding array of democratic theories can be viewed as analogous to
   what Lakatos refers to as thescientificresearch programme, A. Shvyrkov
   identifies and describes the hard core of this array, its positive and
   negative heuristics, and a belt of auxiliary hypotheses. The author's
   analysis leads him to conclude that the theory of democracy as an
   analogue of the scientificresearch programmehas passed the peak of its
   development and entered a phase of stagnation.},

Journal = {OSTEUROPA},

Volume = {65},
Number = {7-10},
Pages = {549+},
Abstract = {In 19th-century Russian literature, Georgia was romanticised. Poets and
   writers of the Soviet period did not break with this tradition. This is
   seen in the works of Sergei Tretiakov, Konstantin Paustovskii, or Andrei
   Bitov. In poetics and imagery, they drew on the romantic Georgian myth.
   Despite the ideological transformations, their texts fed off the
   traditional arsenal of metaphors, themes, and symbols, which is why
   Russian imperial gestures and interpretations of Georgia remained
   recognisable. On the linguistic level, basic elements of Soviet ideology
   often collide with traditional romantic imagery and allow continuities
   or breaks to emerge.},

   against the background of the current stalemate within the OSCE and
   Russian policies. It argues that, despite the current engagement of the
   OSCE in Ukraine and its renaissance in Russian politics, the task of
   revitalizing the OSCE has not become easier. The German Chairmanship may
   be considered a success if it manages to unblock political dialogue
   within the OSCE and to redefine the agenda for future structured
   dialogue, which could be accepted as a fair deal in conjunction with the
   wider debate over a vision for a Wider Europe.},

   Policy in Alberta},

   POLITIQUE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {48},
Number = {4},
Pages = {933-959},

Abstract = {Recent media accounts suggest certain faith-based interest groups are
   increasingly pressuring provincial governments across Canada to ensure
   their views on education policy are acted upon. This paper offers a
   qualitative assessment of the policy influence possessed by faith-based
   groups active on the education file in Alberta and the factors
   responsible for this level of influence. Overall, such influence is not
   directly attributable to the group's size or resources nor can it be
   explained by the assumption that Alberta is overrun with religious
   citizens demanding socially conservative policies. Rather, the
   explanation is found in a more nuanced appreciation of the
   self-interested electoral calculations made by the long-governing
   Progressive Conservative party, on the one hand, as well as well as the
   party's long-running commitment to ``school choice{''} on the other.
   This sentiment is intimately related to both the province's populist
   political culture as well as a broader ideological convergence around
   the principle of ``free choice{''} in general, and the benefits of
   marketization in particular.},

Title = {When Do Religious Leaders Support Faith-Based Violence? Evidence from a

Abstract = {Religion has increasingly become important in conflicts worldwide.
   Religious leaders may play a key role in mobilizing believers as they
   can call for peace or instigate violence. But what makes religious
   leaders support peace or promote violence? Drawing on a survey poll of
   102 religious leaders in Juba, South Sudan, this paper represents
   virtually the first attempt to study the correlates of pro-violence
   opinions of religious elites in a more quantitative manner in a
   developing country. The paper analyzes when and why some religious
   leaders support faith-based violence while others do not. Employing a
   unique combination of innovative measures, our results have many
   implications for mobilization processes. We find that leaders' support
   for faith-based violence is largely independent of individual
   demographic or personal determinants but is closely related to religious
   attitudes. Tolerance toward other faiths and secularism reduce
   pro-violence attitudes. Muslims seem to be more ready to support
   faith-based violence, probably given their minority status and other
   peculiarities of Islam in (South) Sudan. Surprisingly, interreligious
   activities do not reduce support for violence but increase appreciation
   for peaceful protest. Generally, determinants of peaceful protest
   substantially differ, suggesting that any support for violence follows
   its own distinct logic.},

Title = {Competitive Consensus. What comes after Consociationalism in
   Switzerland?},
Journal = {SWISS POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {654-679},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Large coalition governments, including all relevant parties, are at the
   heart of the consociational model of Swiss democracy. Until the 1990s,
   this model was characterised as ``voluntary proportional{''}. It was
   based on a stable cooperation of two main blocs of political parties,
   and on elite-driven agreements on all-inclusive government formulas.
   Despite growing competition in governmental elections, all-party
   coalitions have survived in most cantons. This article explains that the
   political minority could keep and even improve its representation, as a
   consequence of the divisions in the political majority. While right-wing
   parties hold the majority in almost all Swiss cantons and at the federal
   level, they are no longer sufficiently cohesive to control the
   elections. As a consequence, elections have become more uncertain, and
   political minorities can capitalise on this in order to win seats.
   Empirically, this paper investigates elections for Swiss cantonal
   governments in the period 1971-2011. It combines data on the unity of
   political blocs with data on government formation. To measure the
   political unity of the blocs, the paper introduces a novel measure based
   on the voting recommendations issued by cantonal parties on the occasion
   of national referendums.},

Abstract = {The direct initiative process, often referred to as a gun behind the
   door, provides an incentive for legislators to pass legislation more in
   line with voters' wishes. Concomitantly, legislative procedures such as
   the filibuster and executive veto often impede the ability of the
   legislature to pass policies. We explore the tension between these two
   forces by incorporating legislative procedures and initiative proposal
   into a spatial model of the policymaking process. We find that the
   ability to propose initiatives sometimes breaks legislative gridlock,
   but that other times pivotal players may prefer the initiative outcome
   and therefore prevent the legislature from preempting a ballot measure.
   In particular, we show that initiative use increases with the distance
   between pivotal actors and the median voter. An empirical analysis of
   initiative use in the American states provides support for this
   prediction.},

Abstract = {The resolution of the Kurdish Problem is part and parcel of Turkey's
   democratization and vice versa. Despite claims made by the AKP
   government that the process is close to resolution, there have been
   limited concrete and practical gains. According to the author, the Peace
   Process requires a historical understanding of the key dynamics of the
   conflict, the opportunity for dialogue, and a transparent negotiation
   process. The author presents democratic autonomy as an idea that goes
   beyond the nation-state, and represents a further demand: a progressive
   step for Kurds as well as for the people of the Middle East.},
