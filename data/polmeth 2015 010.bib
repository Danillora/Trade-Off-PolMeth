Abstract = {In May 2014, and for the second time in her political history, regional,
   federal and European elections were organized simultaneously in Belgium.
   In the direct follow-up of the sixth state reform, which increased the
   powers and autonomy of the Belgian Regions and Communities, these
   elections were crucial for the future of the country and for the
   multi-level coalition formation at the regional and federal levels. The
   political campaign was dominated by socioeconomic issues and demands for
   further autonomy, particularly in the Flemish region. Regional electoral
   results confirmed the success of the regionalist parties in Flanders,
   but also in Brussels and in the German-speaking Community. These
   successes allowed regionalist parties to enter all regional and federal
   governments-often as the dominant party-with the exception of the
   Walloon and the French-speaking Community cabinets.},

   that specifically seeks to integrate civic participation and political
   learning in an international context. This includes the development of a
   deep understanding of the political, economic, and social context of the
   Cuban reality where the students work with a Cuban social service
   organization to promote the well-being of, and sustainability in, Cuban
   society through service-learning projects. The outcomes are measured
   through the completion of the projects, as well as the dialogical
   journaling and reflection exercises, lectures, readings, discussions,
   and site visits while in Cuba.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes congressional activism during an international

   executive-congressional relations during a time when immediate policy
   responses are needed. A content analysis of policy statements made
   during committees, on the House floor, and on the Senate floor is used
   to investigate the specific policy ideas proposed by members of
   Congress. The models presented pay particular attention to the actions
   of Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) members, in relation to other more
   common predictors of congressional activism. In addition to the results
   for CBC members, other conclusions indicate that foreign policy leaders
   in Congress are international affairs policy experts without serious
   concerns of being defeated in their next election.},

Title = {Class war-on-terror: counterterrorism, accumulation, crisis},
Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {55-71},
Abstract = {This article discusses US counterterrorism from a class perspective. It
   sees counterterrorism as a state policy with differential effects on
   different social classes. In doing so, the article starts to address a
   lacuna in critical studies of counterterrorism, which tend to be rather
   structural and formal, thus ignoring the pertinence of counterterrorism
   to the field of social dynamics. To partly rectify this blind spot by
   addressing some class implications of counterterrorism, the article
   examines the effects of counterterrorism policy on capital accumulation
   and its social conditions. It notes that counterterrorism has different
   implications along class-lines: for dominant capital, it signifies
   appropriation of public money and direct participation in political
   decisions; for everyone else, it means material dispossession and
   political exclusion. Given that counterterrorism was developed between
   two crises of neoliberalism, the article distinguishes between economic
   crises, which tend to benefit capitalism, and political crises, which
   can be destructive, and suggests that counterterrorism is partly a
   restructuring of the neoliberal state so that it can manage recurring
   economic crises, while preventing their evolution into political ones.},

Title = {Universalism through Common Access: An Alternative Model of Distributive
   Majoritarian Politics},
Booktitle = {INDIVIDUALISM AND POLITICAL DISORDER},
Year = {2015},
Pages = {64-80},
Abstract = {The rational-choice logic of majority rule embodies discriminatory
   distribution of burdens and benefits as between members of majority and
   minority coalitions. Empirical observation, however, suggests
   universality or near-universality even in programs that are potentially
   discriminatory. Attempts have been made to explain the anomaly, but the
   basic issues have not been resolved. Weingast and others have argued
   that working legislatures will implicitly adopt quasi-unanimity rules or
   conventions. We present an alternative model of distributive
   majoritarian politics. The distinctive feature is ``common access.{''}
   If democratic politics is modeled, not in terms of a monolithic decision
   structure, but instead as a setting where differing and separate
   decision authorities are granted access to the general taxable capacity,
   collective action can be analyzed in the logic of common resource usage.
   Our model allows for universality even with pork-barrel spending,
   without resort to institutionalized rules or informal conventions.},

Journal = {FORO INTERNO-ANUARIO DE TEORIA POLITICA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Pages = {129-158},
Abstract = {This article reflects on the idea of equality from a gender perspective.
   Specifically, it states that the current gap between formal and
   effective equality should be addressed using a transformative approach
   to patterns of socioeconomic, cultural and personal relations. To do so,
   it is crucial to deal with two issues: the necessity to conjoin equality
   with freedom and pluralism, understood as interdependent values; and
   secondly, to conceive equality as a universal and ethical referent. In
   this sense, the article proposes the use of a musical formula, the
   enharmonic principle, as perhaps the best metaphor to understand the
   idea and practice of equality in contemporary societies.},

Abstract = {Class Struggle on the Home Front pursues a dialogue between feminism and
   nondeterminist Marxism. I will attempt to situate the book's postmodern
   contribution to this conversation by interrogating the history of these
   mutually constitutive discourses. Since the conversation between Marxism
   and feminism began with Marx and Engels, I first examine their early
   work together. I then compare Engels's later work with that of feminist
   critic of political economy Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Despite their
   differences, Engels and Gilman share a commitment to economic
   determinism. In the essay's second part, I argue that the theoretical
   advances of New Marxian Class Analysis (NMCA), along with empirical
   investigations by feminist sociologists and labor historians,
   demonstrate the insufficiency of Engels's and Gilman's economically
   determinist perspective on relations between gender, class, and power.
   Finally, I respond to comments by Barker and Rio, and particularly their
   shared emphasis upon economic and cultural processes as sites of
   struggle.},

Abstract = {The focus on female MPs and leftist and feminist issues in traditional
   studies of women's substantive representation has supported the overall
   conclusion that women, feminists and left-wing parties promote women's
   interests in parliament. But our analysis of the `critical actors' in
   women's substantive representation in 10 European countries confirms
   this finding only to a certain extent. Our inductive research design
   reveals an important group of less obvious actors: non-left,
   non-feminist and male MPs. That they speak out on behalf of women points
   to the necessity of revisiting our theories on women's substantive
   representation.},

Abstract = {This essay, based on a talk given at the 2013 Rethinking Marxism
   International Conference, defends the idea of the party by setting out
   the conditions that make it necessary. Rather than imagining a national,
   mass-electoral party, it envisions a solidary, militant, international
   organization. Against left realists who claim that the party is an
   outmoded or ``fully saturated{''} political form and that we are
   relegated to momentary acts of resistance or small reforms that leave
   the capitalist system intact, our conditions push us to rethink and
   renew that form of political organization through which communists think
   collectively about political power, act together in order to generate
   it, and inspire one another to use it for the collective determination
   of the world we produce in common. Capitalism pushes us apart. Left
   politics, instead of emphasizing difference, should assert and build
   commonality. The party is a form for this assertion.},

Abstract = {The nonverbal display of confidence is strongly associated with
   leadership and power. However, its importance for the persuasiveness of
   campaign messages has not been explored. How important is showing
   confidence for a political candidate's ratings? How does confidence
   condition the effect of the quality of a candidate's arguments? This
   article addresses these questions using an innovative experimental
   approach that makes it possible to better isolate the impact of the
   candidate's nonverbal confidence and the quality of his message. While
   both of these aspects influence voters' perceptions of the candidate's
   electability and qualifications, the nonverbal dimension matters more
   when it comes to electability. This research contributes to the study of
   nonverbal communication in elections by expanding the focus of inquiry
   beyond the effect of pure emotions (happiness or anger) and facial
   traits.},

Abstract = {The use and the formulation of a business formal and financial planning
   is one of the most relevant and contemporary issues in the management
   theory. This article summarizes the information obtained from a
   questionnaire applied to companies from the city of Morelia in the state
   of Michoacan. The objective of the study was to analyze the knowledge
   and use of formal and financial planning by the administration of these
   companies. The questionnaire contains 24 questions and was applied to
   the management of 46 companies, with more than 10 employees. The study
   discusses subjects like the general knowledge of management about
   business, money, accounting, value and planning and the use of formal
   and financial planning in companies. The questionnaire results show, for
   example, that 54\% of companies perform formal planning and 65\% perform
   financial planning. Also, 36\% of those who use formal planning believe
   that planning improves the quality of decision making. The conclusion of
   the data emerging from the research is shown at the end of the article.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {43-68},
Abstract = {There is some controversy about the dimensionality of the left-right
   (LR) distinction. Some authors argue for unidimensionality (LR
   structured by socio-economic issues). Other authors concede that
   socio-economic issues are of fundamental importance in shaping the LR
   divide, but nevertheless argue for multidimensionality. Considering
   these controversies, we define our two major goals: to test the
   dimensionality of LR voting alignments among the mass public in 21
   countries at the individual level, and to test the differentiation of
   the dimensionality of the LR divide as a `dimension of identification'
   and as a `dimension of competition'. Our main findings are as follows.
   First, as `dimension of identification', LR voting has a
   multidimensional character: it is anchored in multiple sets of values
   orientations, both economic and non-economic. Second, the same cannot be
   said when we discuss it as a `dimension of political competition': LR
   party-system polarization only has a significant and positive impact on
   leftright value voting for socio-economic values.},

Abstract = {Russia seeks rapprochement with China. The project is primarily of a
   political nature and is supposed to demonstrate to the West that Russia
   is not dependent on it. At the heart of the new partnership is
   energy-sector cooperation. Moscow is euphoric about a gas supply
   contract concluded in 2014. But reality looks different. The project is
   expensive, and the deliveries to China can at best supplement those to
   Europe not replace them. Above all, however, Moscow has placed itself in
   a one-sided dependency on China. Today, the Russian Federation needs the
   People's Republic politically and economically much more than China
   needs Russia. The dream of a new Eurasian partnership is not very
   realistic. If it is ever fulfilled, then it will be a nightmare for
   Moscow.},

   Future Economic Reform},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},

Pages = {135-147},
Abstract = {At present, economic reform in China is intensifying and has reached a
   crucial phase. Different segments of society and intellectuals are
   debating the direction of the on-going reforms both based on ideology
   and vested interests. The enormous growth China has experienced in the
   last three decades shows that reforms based on the socialist market
   economy has set China on an inevitable course to build a progressive
   society and help China to realize the Chinese Dream of national
   rejuvenation. The authors explain the essence of the China Model from
   four perspectives: the basic economic system, mode of economic
   regulation, driving force of economic growth and economic cooperation
   with foreign countries. Deepening economic reform requires adhering to
   core policies of the Communist Party of China and establishing a
   democratic politics with Chinese characteristics. Widespread and gradual
   political reform is crucial for the task of further development and
   perfecting the China Model.},

Abstract = {Problems referring to multicultural societies stand at the core of
   today's social and political debate across the world. The immigration
   policy is changing not only in the Americas or Australia, but also in
   European countries which regularly implement changes with respect to
   their immigration and integration policy. Multicultural societies
   undergo a crisis, while the very idea of functioning in a culturally
   diversified world is sometimes perceived as unreal. Contemporary
   multiculturalism seems to be adopting a different, redefined form which
   is more demanding and critical both towards the minority and the
   indigenous majority. Can we therefore state that present-day societies
   are nowadays functioning already in the era of post-multiculturalism, or
   are they experiencing a different form which is only taking its shape
   now? Can we under the current circumstances speak of the end of
   multiculturalism? Will the ever more present term
   `post-multiculturalism' join our debate for good, thus shaping the new
   look of Europe and the world? The author of the article is trying to
   evaluate this still evolving idea.},

Title = {Information and Wasted Votes: A Study of US Primary Elections},
Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {433-459},
Abstract = {We study whether information leads voters and donors to ``waste{''}
   fewer votes and donations on candidates who do not finish in first or
   second place. Examining U.S. primary elections featuring more than two
   candidates, we compare voting and contribution behavior across offices
   with varying levels of information. We find that voters and donors are
   more likely to support the top two candidates, and less likely to waste
   votes or donations on lesser candidates, when information levels are
   higher. In addition, we find that donors consistently act more
   ``strategically{''} - i.e., waste fewer donations on lesser candidates -
   than voters. To supplement these analyses, we isolate the causal effect
   of information by leveraging adjacent U.S. counties that differ in their
   access to politically relevant information from the media. We again find
   that information helps voters avoid wasting votes on candidates who are
   unlikely to win. The results are relevant for understanding the behavior
   of voters and contributors, for understanding the role of information in
   elections, and for the evaluation of policies like runoff primaries
   designed to facilitate strategic voting outcomes.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Robert Dahl's greatness as a political scientist rested on three
   qualities: the analytic clarity of his definitions of democracy, his
   insistence on studying complex ideas such as `power' in a systematic
   empirical manner, and his commitment to a moral or normative
   underpinning for one's scholarship. He was a deep egalitarian
   intellectually and interpersonally. However, many of Dahl's publications
   had a considerable blindspot; until late in life, he did not fully
   recognize how much racial hierarchy and discrimination undermined his
   and others' claims that the United States has a reasonably well
   functioning and robust democracy. This blind spot teaches us to be
   intellectually humble, to recognize the defects of even the strongest
   methodological strategies, and to recognize our own mistakes, as Dahl
   did.},

   limited participation in small discussion groups deserves close
   scrutiny. In School Board meetings and five-person experimental lab
   groups, especially those subject to majority rule, the researchers find
   that women speak less often than men, are interrupted more frequently,
   have less influence on group decisions, and are more likely than men to
   exercise compassionate decision-making. But there are bound to be
   exceptions to this conclusion and I consider the limits to Karpowitz and
   colleagues' findings to better understand the conditions under which
   women's agency comes to the fore. I focus, first, on the role played by
   group identities that can subvert prevailing norms of gendered behavior
   and, second, raise questions about the pervasiveness and magnitude of
   women's different and more compassionate voice. I conclude by noting the
   rich research agenda revealed by Karpowitz and colleagues' pioneering
   study.},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {As multi-level governance structures led by multiple political parties,
   democratic federal systems can experience two types of tensions-those
   between central and state governments, and those between parties in
   power at those different levels. This has made the study of centre-state
   relations in Malaysia challenging, as one coalition has been in power at
   the federal level since independence. Most visible centre-state
   conflicts have occurred in states led by the opposition or minor
   coalition members. However, the majority of state governments are led by
   the United Malays' National Organization (UMNO)-Malaysia's most powerful
   political party and coalition leader. Given this, it is instructive to
   analyse centre-state relations in a state that has also been led by
   UMNO, as this enables the elimination of inter-party strife as a source
   of conflict. Johor lends itself well to this exercise. Like the federal
   government, it has been led since independence by the ruling coalition,
   and is intimately linked to UMNO. Despite this congruence, the Johor
   state government has experienced serious conflict with the central
   government, demonstrating that the same party affiliation does not
   eliminate clashes and highlighting the need to further explore
   centre-state relations in UMNO-led states.},

Abstract = {At conferences, at seminars, and on political science blogs, the
   potential utility of experimental methods for international relations
   (IR) research continues to be a hotly contested topic. Given the recent
   rise in creative applications of experimental methods, now is a useful
   moment to reflect more generally on the potential value of experiments
   to study international affairs, how these inherently micro-level methods
   can shed light on bigger-picture questions, what has been learned
   already, what goals are probably out of reach, and how various research
   agendas in IR might productively incorporate experiments.},

Abstract = {The French Basque Country (FBC) represents an emblematic case of the
   politicization of local development through grassroots economic
   activism. These mobilizations are particularly obvious in the
   agricultural sector. Based on a qualitative research on small farmers'
   organizations and short food circuits, this article shows that Basque
   farmers' mobilizations constitute a case of a dual politicization of
   small-scale farming and territorial identity. This process has gone
   through two phases: the first period (1970-2000) was characterized by
   the politicization of local productive systems. Throughout the decade
   2000-2010, a new mode of grassroots economic activism emerged, signalled
   by new alliances between producers and consumers, and by an increasing
   ideological pluralism. Two case studies illustrate these developments.
   The first relates to a case of explicit politicization with the
   controversy around the foundation in 2005 of an alternative Basque
   Chamber of Agriculture. The second case study is devoted to the
   development of short food circuits in the FBC, considered here as a case
   of implicit politicization of the encounter between productive and
   consumption circuits. Both cases illustrate the politicization of new
   economic social movements, and the constant overlapping of sectoral and
   territorial claims in the Basque territory.},

Abstract = {This essay considers acts and representations of ``passing{''} across
   boundaries of race, sex, gender, and sexuality as productive for queer
   theory and politics. Looking at classic literary texts of racial passing
   and narratives of transgender passing, the essay seeks to bring elements
   of class and materiality in these boundary crossings to the fore. A
   close reading of these texts on ``passing{''} will highlight the
   material and class elements in performances and readings of sex,
   sexuality, gender, and race. And as ``passing{''} has become a primary
   site and source of queer theory, queer politics and theory must
   therefore deepen their engagement with class analysis without being
   fully encircled by it.},

Pages = {67+},
Abstract = {Russia has announced a turn to Asia. China, Japan and both Koreas remain
   secondary for Moscow security policy. In the conflict with the West, a
   ``strategic partnership{''} with China promises the most symbolic
   capital. Simultaneously, the unspoken fear of a dominance of a
   demographically, economically, and militarily superior China is great.
   Therefore, Moscow is expanding its relations to Japan and to South and
   North Korea. Cooperation with the United States over the conflict in
   Europe remains on the backbumer, although Moscow and Washington have
   similar interests in Northeast Asia.},

Abstract = {This article aims to analyze the public activity of the most influential
   political parties of Chernivtsi and Zakarpatska oblast (regions) between
   2013 and 2014. The authors consider the configuration of the leading
   regional political forces and characterize the level of their impact on
   regional politics. The main attention is paid to communications of
   political parties' with their voters. It has been outlined that the
   mobility of organizational structures of opposition to once
   pro-governmental ``Party of Regions{''} has provided growth of their
   electoral support and increasing influence on regional processes. These
   parties emerged like victors of the turbulent situation in Ukraine but
   their popularity and future are highly dependent on the prospect of
   peace and reforms in Ukraine.},

Abstract = {Slectorate theory posits that within each society, there is a political
   selectorate containing a winning coalition. This coalition, comprised of
   societal individuals, groups, and entities, selects the national leader
   whose aim is political survival. The original version of the theory
   suggested that the selectorate expands in step with the ability of the
   leader to provide private or public goods to its supporters in various
   combinations. This study expands selectorate theory to the recent
   revolutions across Middle East and North Africa (MENA). With various
   regimes optimizing economic allocations, we believe that political
   survival in MENA societies is gained and maintained by concurrently
   fulfilling rising religious preferences. Stable MENA regimes also meet
   religious demands. Thus, leaders that ignore religious tides do so at
   their own peril. Addressing religious demands as the selectorate expands
   maximizes stability and reduces autocratic tendencies. We present
   selectorate and stakeholder assessments of six MENA societies during the
   Arab Spring. We find that selectorate expansion, regime stability, and
   regime survival depend as much on religiosity as on private-public
   payoffs optimization. Our results have striking implications for
   democratic preference promulgation and regime stability.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the growing importance that the so-called
   ``commons{''} are gaining in the sphere of cultural creation. To do so,
   it critically analyses two important analogies that have appeared during
   the recent years: the first one, between the ``natural{''} and ``digital
   commons{''}, and the second, between the ``old{''} and the ``new digital
   enclosures{''}. The paper demonstrates that their similitudes are
   prominent, although both comparisons have to be carefully studied. The
   main goal is to present the ``digital commons{''} as those devices
   capable to shape a sort of ``Popular political economy of
   pro-common{''}. Throughout a double approach (the technical-legal and
   the political-economical one), the paper highlights the need to have an
   institutional environment robust enough to prevent the effects of new
   enclosures in contemporary creation and the dissemination of culture.},

Abstract = {This publication presents the results of a research project on forms of
   political subjectivity in social movements. Conducting this research
   required a double disciplinary field, calling on the one hand on
   contemporary political philosophy, particularly the thought of Jacques
   Ranciere, and on the other authors of the corpus of political sociology,
   drawing specifically on an axis of research formed in Argentina on
   popular and territorial mobilizations.
   Between 2009 and 2012, I conducted a field research on the territorial
   organization of Gran Buenos Aires. The objective was to elucidate the
   modes of mobilization of people in precarious situations, starting from
   their entry into the organization to the particularities of their
   mobilization.
   Taking as a starting point the power relations produced by these
   movements, there arose, in the course of the investigation, a reflection
   on the conditions of production of a certain type of subject in the
   struggle. In this article I propose to analyze this reflection in terms
   of political subjectivation. In this sense, I will present one of the
   most significant life stories obtained during the field study. This
   story will be used to explain the dimension of uprooting that
   accompanies the irruption of politics in one's existence. Taking thus
   the experience of disidentification as a fundamental element of
   political subjectivation, I hope to deepen the understanding of its
   existential effects as well as the effects in political philosophy as to
   the analytical complexity that a work on concrete experiences implies.},

Pages = {83-104},
Abstract = {In the last two decades, the Basque Patriotic Left has been a monolithic
   movement with relatively few fissures that has followed the line marked
   by ETA in an orthodox way. But it has not always been that way. During
   Franco's regime and in the first years of democracy, the Basque
   Patriotic Left was formed by a plurality of organizations that had a
   common project but differed in strategies, terms and nuances, and in the
   importance given to the contents of the common project. In this work, we
   will examine the various political and armed organizations that have
   formed the Basque Patriotic Left from its foundation to the present day.},

   political imagery, in particular on those images which have meanwhile

Abstract = {A critical framework for the analysis of political violence, terrorism
   and social movements must be based around a data-driven, empirical
   examination of primary source data. In an era of data overabundance,
   possible sources for analysis are all around us, from anonymous
   communiques issued by social movements to slick propaganda videos issued
   by military-styled insurgent and guerrilla movements. The problem is no
   longer ``Where do I find data?{''} but has now become ``Through what
   metric can I measure reliability?{''} A critically situated analysis of
   violence must take into account the intentional manipulation of facts
   which is standard practice by both state and non-state actors. If one
   can acknowledge that both governments and Foreign Terrorist
   Organizations attempt to shape public opinion through selective
   reporting and misrepresentation, the study of political violence through
   the venue of discourse is appropriate. Therefore, discourse is a fitting
   site for critical engagement, as it is based around subjective reality
   and its construction, and not the establishment of authorship and
   ``truth.{''}},

Abstract = {Eight years after the launch of the Stern Review of the economics of
   climate change, a new major report on economic growth and climate change
   (Better Growth, Better Climate) has been published by a Global
   Commission on the Economy and Climate, chaired by Nicholas Stern. While
   this comprehensive review of recent evidence has some overlap with the
   original Stern Review, it focuses more on the short-term costs and
   benefits of action needed to reduce carbon emissions in specific parts
   of the economy such as cities, energy and agriculture. Perhaps the most
   noted conclusion of the report is that policies which governments should
   be pursuing anyway, because they will reduce pollution, improve health,
   raise productivity and reduce congestion, will cut carbon emission by
   between 50 and 90 per cent of what is needed to get to a 2 degrees C
   pathway. This is an important report that will have considerable
   influence, although it has had lower public visibility than the original
   Stern Review. However, it also points to the need for a better
   understanding of the politics of climate policy, and why the
   opportunities to adopt policies that have multiple long-term public
   benefits do not get taken. While Better Growth, Better Climate does have
   a chapter on the political economy of change, the analysis is limited,
   and could be deepened by bringing in the growing literature on the
   politics of climate policy.},

Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {63-81},
Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {Non violence, non-violence or nonviolence? Nonviolence can be defined as
   a methodology, an ethical-political doctrine, a way to build peace that
   is oriented towards a coherent philosophy, seeking a love of knowledge,
   experimentation and life. In the Latin American and Spanish academia
   there is ignorance about how to describe this concept. This article
   tries to find a consensus on this controversy. The controversy lies in
   its morpho-syntactic confusion, attributing definitions or inappropriate
   actions. We believe that the building of a consensus definition needs to
   be from what it is not (on the various forms of violence), the
   presentation of some principles-values (Refusal to Kill/Dignified life;
   To search the truth/Tolerance and not having the truth; Active dialogue
   and listening/Empathy and humanism; Alternative and creative modes of
   thought/Anthropological optimism and opening) on which it may be based
   and the arguments concerning the relationship means-purposes and
   consequences of the use of violence (especially with some historical
   experiences). All of this should allow us to better define such a
   complex concept as nonviolence.},

   Ideals and values of a democratic society should be based on dialogue
   and compromise of both the state and the citizens. Mission of the state
   consists in determination of ``game rules{''} which allow it to act as a

   used in conjunction with a wide range of qualitative methodologies,
   including process tracing, concept formation, counterfactual analysis,
   sequence elaboration, and qualitative comparative analysis. We
   illustrate the utility of set diagrams by drawing on substantive
   examples of qualitative research in the fields of international
   relations and comparative politics.},

Abstract = {The International Criminal Court (ICC) commenced investigation of the
   armed conflict in Uganda in 2004. In 2005 it issued arrest warrants for
   five leaders of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). This article examines
   how the court's involvement in the situation has impacted on conflict
   transformation in Uganda after ten years of judicial work. It also
   addresses the problem of assessing the impact of law on conflict through
   the use of an analytical framework that is based on four variables:
   deterrence, victims' rights, reconciliation, and accountability to the
   law. Relying on this framework, and on a report of a field research
   project in Uganda, it argues that the ICC's intervention has had
   multiple impacts on the situation in Uganda, and that despite some
   arguments to the contrary, the ICC does promote conflict transformation
   through deterrence, promotion of accountability to the law and promotion
   of victims' rights.},

   politics that eschews critique and antagonism in favor of emergent
   postcapitalist alternatives. Such a dichotomy eclipses myriad
   possibilities for autonomous, organized forms of opposition and
   creation. This commentary appreciatively challenges postcapitalist
   scholar-activists to engage more robustly with a critique of capital and
   with forms of decentralized militant organization in order to constitute
   a politics in which anticapitalism and postcapitalism can become
   mutually reinforcing dynamics in struggles to build new modes of

Abstract = {The paper analyzes the behavior of the United States, particularly its
   status as an international power in charge of maintaining order and
   international security, during the transition between the governments of
   George Bush and Barack Obama. The political tradition states that the
   country should maintain a strong position in order to safeguard
   equilibrium in the international system. However, two confronting
   theories emerge when it comes to resolving a dilemma of international
   character. On one hand, Mearsheimer, offensive realism theorist,
   proposes a context in which states are always in competition due to the
   existence of an unbalanced international system; the liberal trend
   leaded by Ikemberry. On the other hand, notes that the liberal
   international order, proposed by the United States, should not be
   defined as a scheme of radical competition but quite the opposite,
   namely, a space for international cooperation aiming to reduce
   international tension. Is in this latter frame that the United States
   could set a course of action regarding Latin America.},

Abstract = {Based on more than 30 macro-indicators this article gauges the profile
   and performance of the Austrian welfare state in international
   comparison. In addition to social spending levels and patterns of
   financing, this paper sheds light on the generosity of welfare benefits
   and the coverage of selected welfare programs and examines Austria's
   performance in terms of income distribution and employment. The
   comparison demonstrates that the Austrian welfare state, despite its
   pronounced Bismarckian make-up, shows a very favourable performance.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {While mistaken as zealot ideologues of Marxist ideals fused with Khmer
   rhetoric, the Khmer Rouge (KR) cadres' collective profile better fits
   that of the convert subjected to intense thought reform. This research
   combines insights from the process and the context of thought reform
   informed by local cultural norms with the social type of the convert in
   a way that captures the KR phenomenon in both its general and particular
   dimensions. Relying on textual analysis of KR party cadres' notebooks
   and their own self-confessions during state-sanctioned `lifestyle'
   meetings, this article provides new insight into how conversion and
   radicalization happened at a mass level. This process of conversion
   allowed the KR to establish its social influence over the mass and to
   carry out its social engineering plans. These KR notebooks provide a
   window to peer into the everyday practices of KR thought reform and
   assess its social-psychological impact on lower level cadres at that
   time. Towards the end of the KR regime, thought reform degenerated into
   terror.},

Pages = {55-70},
Abstract = {In accordance with methodological principles of sociology of knowledge,
   construction of political reality may be considered as a process of
   general political knowledge formation. The politics gains reality
   properties for an individual soon as he learns concepts and symbols,
   used in the society's culture to identify specific sphere of political
   relations. This provides grounds to interpret political reality as
   symbolic and intersubjective, that is existing only due to human ability
   to create jointly shared systems of knowledge about authoritative
   relations in the society by means of signs and symbolic constructions.
   The paper analyzes cognitive mechanisms creating commonly shared
   beliefs, values and ideas of political institutional orders. The paper
   explores the impact of these cognitive mechanisms in shaping and
   constructing political reality.},

Title = {Two Contemporary Approaches to Political Theory},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {226-240},
Abstract = {Broadly speaking, the form that contemporary Anglo-American political
   theory has taken since the 1970s, with its reinvigoration in the seminal
   work of John Rawls, can largely be described as Platonic and Kantian,
   focusing on the formulation, comparison, and evaluation of abstract
   principles of justice, and only subsequently looking to their
   application in the real world. Concerned about this, a number of critics
   of the contemporary paradigm in political theory have emerged to offer
   their own alternatives. This article will discuss two of them: Raymond
   Geuss and Amartya Sen. This article does three things. Its first section
   lays out the realist approach to political theory advocated by Raymond
   Geuss and the comparative approach advocated by Amartya Sen,
   respectively. Here I argue that Sen's comparative approach can best be
   understood as a kind of realism. In the second section of this article,
   I explore what I take to be an underlying concern behind the work of
   both Sen and Geuss, and which, although it is rarely explicitly
   mentioned (and certainly never fully developed), I think we should bear
   in mind: namely, a strand of anti-Platonism in political theory. Third
   and finally, I present three arguments for why a realist approach to
   political theory is likely to be superior to those of their contemporary
   adversaries: the argument from efficacy claims that realist approaches
   are more likely to impact real politics; the argument from cognitive
   distortions claims that realist approaches are better equipped to notice
   and critically evaluate and revise undue assumptions and distortions of
   various kinds; and the argument from abstractness claims that since such
   distortions are likely to increase with a theory's degree of
   abstractness, and since realist theories tend to be less abstract than
   their competitors, a realist approach will likely be less susceptible to
   such distortions to begin with.},

   life history of a Brazilian woman demonstrates that as individuals
   travel through state institutions and civil society organizations
   (CSOs), they carry conflicting worldviews with them which bear on the
   practices of CSOs. With Gramsci we recognize civil society as a space
   where movements and the state struggle for hegemony; beyond him we
   conceptualize CSOs as contradictory, being simultaneously of and against
   the state, while the state is simultaneously outside and within them.},

   TRANSNATIONALISATION OF COLLECTIVE MEMORY},
Journal = {TOCQUEVILLE REVIEW},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {65-93},
Abstract = {This article seeks to advance the theoretical understanding and
   empirical operationalization of transnational collective memory. While
   the theoretical nature of collective memory has been thoroughly analyzed
   on the national and sub- national level, there has been less conceptual
   work on the potential of transnational collective memory. Against
   widespread assumptions that because of the diversity of nationally
   rooted memories, transnational memory discourses lead to ``memory
   wars{''}, the text argues that memory discourses are fundamentally
   different from war discourses. Combing theoretical arguments by scholars
   of collective identity and transnational communications, memory
   discourses are conceptualized as claims about the entanglement in a
   common story. To the extent that such claims and their normative
   implications are recognized, a transnational collective memory can
   emerge and even result in the emergence of a transnational collective
   identity. Building on the conceptualization of the transnationalisation
   of national public spheres, transnational collective memory can be
   operationalized through the emergence of transnationally similar memory
   claims involving similar normative ``lessons{''} in national media
   discourses. Using this framework, IR scholars can develop systematic and
   powerful methodological tools enabling the systematic examination of the
   dynamics of transnational memory discourses.},

Abstract = {This article examines self-reported purposively spoiled votes using
   individuallevel survey data from European Parliament election studies,
   1989-2009. Three rival explanations, one centering on low political
   interest and compulsory voting, another on anti-party protest behavior
   and a further on anti-EU attitudes are evaluated to explain the puzzling
   behavior of turning out for elections while purposefully casting a
   spoiled vote. The results presented in this article give support to the
   second proposition. A perceived lack of party choices among the voting
   options and non-partisanship among voters otherwise satisfied with the
   democratic process seems responsible for, at first sight, the irrational
   choice of ballot spoiling. This behavior is best described as a mild
   form of anti-party protest voting.},

Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {This article examines comparatively the stances of Serbian and Croatian
   political parties on European integration in relation to their
   international affiliations. It specifically seeks to explore how and to
   what extent the European People's Party (EPP) exerted influence on
   parties from these two countries. The article analyses the nature of
   these linkages in a systematic manner by employing the concept of direct
   and indirect transnational impact. The study argues that, in general,
   the EPP was not a crucial driving force behind party stances on the
   European Union (EU) and its direct impact was rather low. However, the
   EPP appears to have had a considerable indirect impact on parties that
   were at an early stage of ideological transformation towards becoming
   credible mainstream and pro-European parties, after a long legacy of
   Eurosceptic and nationalist politics. These parties strove to obtain
   European legitimacy by becoming members of the EPP and were,
   consequently, more willing to harmonise their positions with (potential)
   European partner. Moreover, `EU commitment' of Serbian and Croatian
   applicants, closely scrutinised by the EPP, was primarily related to
   their affirmative positions on EU membership, rather than their stances
   on any particular model of European integration.},

Abstract = {This article looks at the strategies religious non-governmental
   organizations (RNGOs) with strong transnational linkages use to maintain
   a continued presence in mainland China. It does so by utilizing
   neo-institutional theory as an instrument for analysis, with an emphasis
   on outlining the coercive, mimetic, and normative pressures RNGOs face.
   One of the key findings of the study is that there is creative
   circumvention of isomorphic pressures by working with local agents,
   fostering trust with the local government, and keeping a low profile.
   Moreover, RNGOs dealt with the uncertain institutional environment in
   China through staff exchanges, denominational supervision, tapping into
   global platforms, and undergoing a professionalization process.},

Abstract = {For more than three centuries, China and Russia have been neighbouring
   states. Territorial conflicts along their common border have until
   recently overshadowed their bilateral relationship. After 1991, the
   People's Republic was able to assert some of their territorial demands
   vis-a-vis Russia. Meanwhile, the border is regulated by international
   law. But the historical territorial dispute remains to this day a burden
   on interstate relations.},

Abstract = {This essay aim at reading the spatial paradigm, dominant today, based on
   the flows, the net, the networking, as element of a complex discourse
   designed to offer epistemological legitimation to the economic-spatial
   restructuring effects generated by globalization. A paradigm whose
   functioning produces exclusions, selections, cuts and it maybe
   constitutes the instrument of new governamental policies. The term
   ``plasma{''}, introduced by Latour to indicate what is exceeding that
   model, is here used to refine the more classical concept of plebs. In
   Hegel as in Foucault, the plebs is a social spread that depends on the
   forms of material and ideal organizations which liberal society assumes
   time by time, and that problematizes the political centre of the
   discourse on the city exactly because is not reducible to it.},

   representation in African democracies},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {40},
Pages = {335-346},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Although electoral malapportionment is a recurrent theme in monitoring
   reports on African elections, few researchers have tackled this issue.
   Here we theorize the meaning and broader implications of
   malapportionment in eight African countries with Single Member District
   (SMD) electoral systems. Using a new dataset on registered voters and
   constituency level election results, we study malapportionment's
   magnitude, persistence over time, and electoral consequences. The
   analysis reveals that patterns of apportionment institutionalized in the
   pre-1990 era established a long-lasting bias in favor of rural voters.
   This ``rural bias{''} has been strikingly stable in the post-1990 era,
   even where the ancien regime has been voted out of power. These findings
   underscore the importance of the urban-rural distinction in explaining
   electoral outcomes in Africa. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The emergence of a moral power of the state-legitimacy through
   accountability and prosecution of perpetrators of human rights
   abuses-provides a new dimension of power in Latin American countries.
   Following a normative international approach, this article presents the
   relevance of truth commissions for the consolidation of a decisive
   democratic turn in Latin American countries, highlighting the relevance
   of having a trustworthy morality of the state through just policies
   toward its citizens. Truth commissions are important tools to restore
   citizens' trust in their authorities and set the basis for
   reconciliation. By engaging in active restorative and transitional
   justice, states can be reconciled, and the conditions for an effective
   peacebuilding within borders can be established as pillars of an
   improved, stronger democratic state, as the cases of truth commissions
   in Argentina and Chile represent. By examining the outcomes of these
   commissions, I argue that a truth commission in Mexico could promote a
   much-needed reconciliation.},

Abstract = {Nearly 13 percent of Turkey's population is disabled, and yet there are
   still leaps and bounds to be made with regard to equality,

   From the perspective of his involvement in providing disability services
   in Turkey as well as around the globe, the author argues that Turkish
   businesses and the government need to see the value added in employing
   members of the disabled community, many of which have untapped skill
   sets. The author also emphasizes the vital importance of ending
   discrimination against disabled people in Turkey and providing the

Abstract = {Turkey needs to accelerate its integration into the Internet economy.
   The state of new media in Turkey is caricaturized as a battle of
   politics and culture/ideology, waged between the leadership and
   supporters of the AK Party and a nebulous mass of politically aligned or
   non-aligned groups. While this portrayal represents a very real and
   persistent problem with the freedoms of expression and information in
   Turkey, online censorship is only the beginning of Turkey's challenges
   in adjusting to the values of, and the commercial and political
   relationships in, the Digital Era. Businesses across the country expect
   the development of a more advanced technological infrastructure, a more
   liberal new media sector, and a more skilled and flexible workforce.
   Turkey needs to build a more inclusive policy dialogue to help shape the
   future of its new media sector and community.},

Abstract = {Paradoxical status of case studies in social sciences is particularly
   evident in comparative politics, where theoretical relevance of a case
   study method is repeatedly undermined despite the overwhelming amount of
   empirical research that employs it. For this reason, the paper explores
   under which conditions a single case study can be defined as a method of
   comparative politics, as well as its specific strengths and weaknesses
   for theory development in comparative politics. The first part of the
   paper tries to clarify definitional disputes which contribute to
   unjustifiable dismissals of case study as a comparative method. The
   second part examines in more detail the potential contribution of case
   studies in accomplishing the goals of comparative research. Arguments
   put forward in both parts of the paper point to positive evaluation of
   case study as a legitimate method of comparative politics.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the use of social media platforms by select
   political parties (BJP, BSP, CPI(M), INC, NCP and AAP) during the
   campaign in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The methodology of data
   collection for the study includes the content analysis of Twitter and
   Facebook postings on social media platforms by these political parties
   for a period of 67 days. The study attempts to understand and analyze
   the strategies adopted by the political parties to interact and
   communicate with the voters online. It finds that social media has
   emerged as a virtual site where major political issues have been raised
   and contested; social media campaign is not simply interactive, but is
   aggressive as well. While underlying the growing importance and impact
   of social media in political campaign, this study however observes that
   it has not been a game changer in the 16th Lok Sabha elections.},

Abstract = {This article examines the adoption of income taxes in Western economies
   since the 19th century. We identify two empirical regularities that
   challenge predictions of existing models of taxation and redistribution:
   While countries with low levels of electoral enfranchisement and high
   levels of landholding inequality adopt the income tax first, countries
   with more extensive electoral rules lag behind in adopting these new
   forms of taxation. We propose an explanation of income tax adoption that
   accounts for these empirical regularities. We discuss the most important
   economic consideration of politicians linked to owners of different
   factors, namely, the shift of the tax burden between sectors, and
   examine how preexisting electoral rules affect these political
   calculations. The article provides both a cross-national test of this
   argument and a microhistorical test that examines the economic and
   political determinants of support for the adoption of the income tax in
   1842 in Britain.},

Abstract = {The paper focuses on the changing pattern of warfare in Africa arising
   from the proliferation of armed non-state groups ranging from ethnic
   militias, Islamist fundamentalist, rebel groups and insurgent movements.
   It argues that the insurgency is rooted in the complex identity crisis
   as a result of pluralism of states in Africa. The paper seeks to advance
   our understanding of African conflicts, or warfare, by going beyond the
   conventional and fashionable analysis among Euro-centric and some
   Afro-centric scholars. Combining some theoretical insights and rich
   empirical details, the paper illuminates the forces and factors that are
   responsible for the insurgency in Nigeria and the effects on the
   socio-economic and political stability. Nigeria offers the most fertile
   environment for terrorist recruitment and radicalization. In such
   environment, one aggrieved would unleash terror as a way to drive their
   demand. The data collected through secondary sources will be
   qualitatively analyzed. It concludes that a rich and culture-sensitive
   approach of neutralizing terrorist radicalization, promotion of
   religious moderation, non-violent approach to conflict resolution,
   mutual co-existence will be the basis for peace and stability in
   Nigeria.},

Volume = {15},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Poverty reduction and health became central in the agendas of Southern
   regional organisations in the last two decades. Yet, little is known
   about how these organisations address poverty, inclusion and social
   inequality, and how Southern regional formations are engaging in power
   constellations, institutions, processes, interests and ideological
   positions within different spheres of governance. This article reviews
   academic literatures spanning global social policy, regional studies and
   diplomacy studies, and the state of knowledge and understanding of the
   place' of regional actors in health governance as a global political
   practice therein. It identifies theoretical and thematic points of
   connection between disparate literatures and how these can be bridged
   through research focusing on the social policies of regional
   organisations and regional integration processes. This framework hence
   locates the contributions of each of the research articles of this
   Special Issue of Global Social Policy on the regional dimension of
   health policy and diplomacy in relation to Southern Africa and South
   America. It also highlights the ways in which the articles bring new
   evidence about how social relations of welfare are being (re)made over
   larger scales and how regional actors may initiate new norms to improve
   health rights in international arenas engaging in new forms of regional'
   diplomacy.},

Abstract = {Using data from statistical sources and official reports, we propose a

   instead, contributes to reinforce a collective imagination of a
   dependent and impoverished old age, with ``fatal{''} consequences that

Abstract = {On 16 August 2012, striking miners in Marikana, South Africa were fired
   upon by the South African Police Service, resulting in the death of 44
   mineworkers. For many the incident has signalled a turning point for the
   country. This paper suggests that rather than a turning point, the
   tragedy at Marikana is perhaps only the newest instalment in a
   century-long cycle of industrial action and government violence in South
   Africa's labour history. Marikana is thus not a turning point, but
   rather a restatement of the ineffectiveness of law. The article then
   attempts a theoretical analysis of these events, as well as the matter
   of whether Marikana is a true event that brings about political and
   social change. Although many consider Marikana a ``founding myth{''} for
   a popular uprising in South Africa, the article cautiously suggests that
   it is in fact just ``business as usual{''}.},

Abstract = {While the 2015 General Election produced mixed electoral fortunes for
   the major parties, the results for women have been historic - 191 women
   were elected to the House of Commons on 7 May, including a record number
   of Scottish women MPs. This article reports on the 2015 GE from the
   perspective of women's representation, providing a gendered analysis of
   the election campaign and assessing the parties' efforts to increase the
   number of women elected in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.
   It argues that while the 2015 elections may have made some cracks in the
   political `glass ceiling', further increases in women's representation
   are unlikely without greater commitment by all of the parties and
   without the use of strong equality measures, including legislative
   gender quotas.},

Abstract = {This article joins the current debate over the many perspectives
   applicable to contemporary political thought, with the aim of
   incorporating a broader view that would have its origin in border areas
   such as Legal Sociology, Political Anthropology, Sociobiology,
   Evolutionary Biology or Neuroscience. Such prospects are requiring
   nowadays a cultural and political evolution of societies, in order to
   cope with the crisis of the existing model. After a brief summary of the
   paradigmatic shifts that are affecting the political thought, the
   article reflects on the need to expand the foundations of political
   analysis and political study sources. The author defends the need of
   maintaining the specific methodologies of each perspective, although
   integrated into a common epistemology. The paper concludes affirming
   that, contrary to any methodological reductionism, a complex
   epistemology is probably the more convenient way to respond to the
   current uncertainty of the political science. All this, provided that
   this approach is supported in a paradigmatic renewal which should be
   commited to social construction as the original vocation of the
   political thought that was born in Greece. Finally, the article cites
   some of the most recent studies that advance in this direction. The
   article continues by taking a position within the controversy created
   last decade around the visions of Cansino-Sartori-Colomer authors.},

Abstract = {Much recent political thought has been devoted to the proposition that
   neither political endeavor properly understood nor theorizing about such
   endeavor is or could ever be a kind of rational activity. I examine
   three broad approaches that celebrate, respectively, rhetorical
   practices of political persuasion, agonistic conceptions of democracy,
   and, more generally, a kind of hard-headed critical realism rooted in
   the plain facts of political life. I argue that criticisms of
   rationalism in politics associated with these approaches systematically
   ignore central tenets of what might be called a post-Kantian convergence
   of recent and important philosophical perspectives and that such
   perspectives can be enormously useful in addressing and critically
   evaluating the underlying intellectual structures of political life.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {54},
Number = {4},
Pages = {691-706},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In recent years, observers have raised concerns about threats to
   democracy posed by external support for authoritarianism coming from
   regional powers such as Russia, China and Venezuela. This article
   assesses the efficacy of autocracy promotion through a close examination
   of Russian efforts to shape regime outcomes in the former Soviet Union.
   It finds that while Russian actions have periodically promoted
   instability and secessionist conflict, there is little evidence that
   such intervention has made post-Soviet countries less democratic than
   they would have been otherwise. First, the Russian government has been
   inconsistent in its support for autocracy - supporting opposition and
   greater pluralism in countries where anti-Russian governments are in
   power, and incumbent autocrats in cases where pro-Russian politicians
   dominate. At the same time, the Russian government's narrow
   concentration on its own economic and geopolitical interests has
   significantly limited the country's influence, fostering a strong
   counter-reaction in countries with strong anti-Russian national
   identities. Finally, Russia's impact on democracy in the region has been
   restricted by the fact that post-Soviet countries already have weak
   democratic prerequisites. This analysis suggests that, despite
   increasingly aggressive foreign policies by autocratic regional powers,
   autocracy promotion does not present a particularly serious threat to
   democracy in the world today.},

Abstract = {Over the past two decades, International Relations scholars have
   highlighted the importance of efforts by hegemonic states and norm
   entrepreneurs to foster norm clarity when promoting the establishment,
   institutionalisation, and internalisation of norms. Yet, such analyses
   obscure the benefits of norm ambiguity in facilitating consensus,
   flexibility, and compliance. The authors offer a framework positing that
   hegemonic and institutional ambiguity can help create consensus and
   facilitate incremental reform necessary to sustain that consensus.
   Empirically, the authors then show how such ambiguity has facilitated
   the development of the responsibility to protect norm, tracing
   Rwanda-era debates over humanitarian intervention, Iraq-era backlash
   over interventionist abuses, and Libya-era norm implementation.},

Abstract = {This article presents an account of the conditions under which
   politicians engage in the production of electoral intimidation, by
   enlisting support from state employees and private actors. We
   characterize the political and economic factors that influence the
   cost-benefit calculations of these actors and their decisions to engage
   in the systematic harassment of voters. Empirically, our article
   examines the political and economic determinants of electoral
   irregularities in German elections during the period between 1870 and
   1912. The most salient economic variable that affects the decision of
   private actors to engage in the electoral intimidation of voters is the
   occupational heterogeneity of a district. Other economic conditions in a
   district have no systematic effect on the incidence of electoral
   intimidation. We also find that political factors such as the level of
   electoral competition, strength of the political opposition, and the
   fragmentation among right parties affect the incidence of electoral
   irregularities.},

Abstract = {What factors make it more likely that non-state organizations will
   target civilians as a political strategy? This study examines targeting
   civilians as a tactical and normative choice, and hypothesizes that the
   targeting of civilians (compared to the general use of violence) is a
   function of the ideological make-up of organizations, organization
   weakness and state repression. Other factors related to organizational
   capability will not have a differential impact on the likelihood that an
   organization will target civilians for violence. This article uses data
   from the Minorities at Risk Organizational Behavior database to examine
   these issues with respect to ethno-political organizations. It argues
   that the typical analytic focus on general violence obscures
   understanding of the factors that lead to targeting civilians. It finds
   that targeting civilians-while similar in some respects to the use of
   general violence-is different, particularly with respect to
   organizational ideology.},

Abstract = {This study provides micro-level evidence for the new theories of
   accountability under globalization. We analyze the micro-level logic
   that underpins political accountability in democratic countries with
   highly globalized economies. We contend that voters discount current
   economic conditions in evaluating incumbent leaders if they perceive the
   incumbent leader moving the country in the right direction. We test this
   argument with survey data from eight European countries in 2012, while
   controlling for potential alternative explanations associated with
   pocketbook, sociotropic, and clarity-of-responsibility factors. We find
   that valence considerations related to future directions in the country
   sustain positive evaluations of leaders' performance even in the face of
   negative evaluations of the economy.},

Abstract = {The method in which a government policy is deliveredfor example, as a
   tax break rather than a direct paymentcould potentially have significant
   implications for how the public views that policy. This is an especially
   important consideration given the importance of indirect policy
   approaches like tax breaks to modern American governance. We employ a
   series of survey experiments to test whether citizens react more
   favorably to tax breaks than to equivalent spending programs. We find
   that citizens prefer tax breaks, particularly when they are the
   established means of intervention. When direct intervention is the
   status quo, or when any government involvement on the issue is
   unfamiliar, the preference is reduced. We also find an interactive
   effect for ideology, with conservatives strongly preferring tax breaks
   to direct intervention, though the effect is still present among
   liberals. This study establishes the importance of delivery mechanism to
   citizens' policy preferences and suggests that the policy status quo
   structures citizens' perceptions of policy proposals.},

Abstract = {Two apparently contradictory features have characterized the group of
   left-wing populists who have come to power in Latin America in recent
   years. First, these leaders share a tendency to centralize power in
   their own hands. Yet at the same time populist regimes have created new
   opportunities for ordinary citizens to participate directly in politics
   through the sponsorship of participatory governance programs. These
   apparently contradictory tactics have led to an intense debate whether
   the participatory programs sponsored by the populist regimes represent
   true attempts to deepen democracy or simply another mechanism for
   reinforcing the hegemony of populist leaders. This paper aims to
   transcend this contradiction by analyzing participatory fora created in
   Venezuela under Hugo Chavez. Neither a personalistic conception of
   populism nor pure participatory democracy conform to the actual design
   and practices of Venezuelan participatory organizations. I propose a new
   framework, which I call participatory populism, for analyzing the role
   of participatory fora in the broader political strategy of Chavez's
   movement. Using qualitative analysis and public opinion data, I show
   that local-level participatory self-governance is used to meet the
   regime's promises of popular inclusion and empowerment, thus justifying
   hegemonic politics at the national level.},

Abstract = {Turkey's rapidly growing natural gas demand, favorable geostrategic
   position, and desire to become a regional energy hub have put gas at the
   forefront of Turkey's energy strategy. But because the country is highly
   dependent on a few providers for its supply, energy security has become
   a hot topic in Turkey over the past decade. Due to the nature of most
   natural gas projects, these conversations tend to be strongly
   interconnected with foreign policy issues and geopolitical
   considerations, particularly in Turkey's region. Faced with a host of
   challenges - regulatory, financial, political, and logistical - it is
   important for Turkey to adopt a carefully balanced approach to its gas
   strategy that takes into account both geopolitical considerations and
   market realities.},

Abstract = {In a replication of Miller and Wattenberg's (1985) coding of American
   National Election Studies open-ended likes/dislikes questions,
   respondents' evaluations of candidates and parties are found to be
   especially policy oriented in 2008 and 2012. Compared to earlier
   elections without an incumbent, prospective policy evaluations were far
   more prevalent in 2008. Furthermore, voters' comments about the
   candidates in 2012 were more policy oriented than the elections of 1964
   and 1972 in which challengers offered a stark policy choice to an
   incumbent president. We also find the public's likes and dislikes of the
   political parties focused heavily on policy considerations in the two
   Obama elections.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {19},

Abstract = {In the last two decades we have witnessed a growing global
   acknowledgement of indigenous rights - manifested in the 2007 UN
   Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples - challenging the
   traditional nation-state-centred understanding of political rights and
   democracy. In this paper, the author argues that indigenous
   self-determination is to be understood as a way to level the balance of
   power between indigenous peoples and the nation-states in which they
   live. Without a solid legal foundation for indigenous peoples to define
   self-determination in their own languages and to negotiate the
   conditions of their relation with the nation-states on their own terms,
   the colonial past (and present) of violent conquest and domination might
   continue. Indigenous peoples' right to self-determination ought in this
   perspective to imply recognition of indigenous peoples as having a
   standing equal to nation-states, i.e. as if they were sovereigns. What
   self-determination means in political practice would thus be the outcome
   of negotiations between two (or more) equal political entities. In this
   way, the right to self-determination has to be interpreted procedurally
   rather than substantially.},

Volume = {24},

Abstract = {Drawing on research carried out for the Scottish Government in 2014,
   this article explores how people experience sectarianism in Scotland
   today. For some, sectarianism is manifestly part of their everyday
   experience, but for others it is almost invisible in their social world.
   The article sets out a metaphor of sectarianism experienced like a
   cobweb in Scotland; running strongly down the generations and across
   masculine culture particularly, but experienced quite differently by
   different people depending on their social relationships. Using the
   examples of song and marching, the article suggests that sectarian
   prejudice should be conceived of as much as a cultural phenomenon as in
   social and legal terms. A multidisciplinary and intergenerational
   approach to tackling sectarian prejudice would help emphasise its
   cultural and relational construction. Much can also be learned from
   examining the broader research on prejudice worldwide, rather than
   treating Scottish sectarianism as if it is a unique and inexplicable
   quality of the national character.},

Abstract = {Do knowledge and information about foreign countries affect people's
   evaluation of domestic situations? Using unique survey and experimental
   data, this research finds that Chinese citizens with more positive
   perceptions and especially overestimation of foreign socioeconomic
   conditions have more negative evaluations of China and the Chinese
   government. Moreover, correcting socioeconomic misinformation about
   foreign countries improves one's evaluations of China, indicating that
   the causal direction is at least partly from rosier estimation of
   foreign conditions to lower domestic evaluations. The relationship
   between domestic evaluations and international political knowledge, as
   measured by familiarity with political affairs and figures in foreign
   countries, is typically not significant, although awareness of political
   instability in other countries can increase satisfaction with one's own
   country. These results contribute both substantively and conceptually to
   the study of politically relevant knowledge and information, and shed
   new light on the nuances of information flow and opinion formation in
   changing societies.},

Abstract = {In this essay, I propose an interpretation of John Rawls's The Law of
   Peoples that puts the stability of liberal societies as the central
   organizing idea of its principles. I start by critically examining other
   interpretations currently found in the literature. I observe two
   characteristics of Rawls's conception of stability from his political
   turn: stability for the right reasons and in the right way. In the main
   body of the essay, I argue that the absence of a global egalitarian
   principle is compatible with the stability of liberal peoples, that the
   toleration of decent peoples is conducive to the stability of liberal
   peoples, and that the universal enforcement of human rights and
   assistance to burdened societies are rationally required for the
   stability of liberal peoples. I clarify the meaning of the centrality of
   peace and stability, and explain why it is not conspicuous but still
   unsurprising given Rawls's personal history and the development of his
   theory of international justice. I conclude by suggesting how the
   stability interpretation paves the way for further extensions of Rawls's
   theory of justice and assessing the practical value of The Law of
   Peoples.},

Abstract = {Legislative politics scholars rely heavily on roll call vote (RCV) data.
   However, it has been claimed that strategic motives behind RCV requests
   lead to overestimating party group cohesion and, thus, biased findings
   on legislative behaviour. To explore this claim, we distinguish between
   two types of bias, a behavioural bias' and a selection bias'. A recent
   rule change in the European Parliament, making RCVs mandatory on all
   final legislative votes, presents the unique opportunity to evaluate the
   latter. We compare party group cohesion in requested and mandatory RCVs
   by examining final legislative votes before and after the rule adoption
   using amendment RCVs (which still need to be requested) as a benchmark.
   The analysis shows that group cohesion is higher whenever RCVs are not
   just requested on some but mandatory on all votes. Hence, there is
   indeed a selection bias' in RCV data. Yet, somewhat contrary to former
   claims, relying on requested RCVs leads to underestimation of the
   cohesion party groups would have had were all votes automatically roll
   called. We argue that this is mainly because requests occur on more
   contentious votes.},

Abstract = {What explains the timing of the liberalization of citizenship laws?
   Although scholars have offered a number of competing explanations for
   differences among citizenship regimes, few have examined the timing of
   liberalization and retraction of rights for non-citizens. To investigate
   the timing of both liberalization and reversal, this study examines the
   historical expansion of voting rights for non-citizen residents (VRA).
   Given both the symbolic and substantive consequences of VRA, democracies
   may proceed slowly when liberalizing political rights and may retract
   them quickly. Two bodies of scholarship offer competing explanations.
   The national resilience thesis suggests that differences in cultural
   definitions of citizenry, political institutions, and social policies
   produce national citizenship regimes that evolve slowly. By contrast,
   the policy constraints thesis asserts that domestic institutions enact
   human rights norms that expedite convergence around a common set of
   political rights. This study tests these explanations by examining the
   timing of liberalization of VRA in 25 democracies between 1975 and 2010.
   It finds factors that drive the timing of liberalization differ from
   those that cause the reversal of rights. While policy constraints best
   explain the timing of liberalization, policy constraints interact with
   national resilience factors to explain the retraction of rights.},

Abstract = {Many historians of Australian political thought have attributed its
   pragmatic and anti-speculative tendencies to a Benthamite influence.
   Without denying the influence of Bentham and Benthamism on Australian
   thought and institutional development, this article challenges the
   assumption that the abovementioned tendencies necessarily betray a
   Benthamite heritage. By analysing the theoretical justifications for
   pragmatic, anti-speculative approaches to institutional design in the
   Federation debates (1890-1898), this article shows that there was a very
   strong Burkean impulse behind the sort of pragmatism that is usually
   attributed to Bentham. If the argument of this article is correct, then
   it is an invitation for historians and political scientists to
   reconsider significantly the nature of Australian political
   thought.??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????,?

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {The literature on the `new age' of political clientelism discusses how
   political parties established their clientilist networks. This article
   explains the inner dynamics of clientelism, specifically the role played
   by the state, its institutions, the government, and social policies. I
   compare the social policies, presidential roles, and constructed
   networks of the governments of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and Alvaro Uribe
   in Colombia. In addition, the article provides evidence of the ``new
   age{''} of political clientelism, which is based on the utilization of
   public policies or state institutions to form a clientelistic network in
   order to elect its favored candidate. The article demonstrates that such
   practices are highly structured in Venezuela due to the strong
   centralization of power in the government. By contrast, in Colombia,
   clientelism is less structured. However, political clientelism still
   focuses on obtaining the highest possible number of votes. Finally, I
   examine how these processes shed light on new state-citizen
   interactions, a re-centralization of power, and the dependency of the
   citizens on the state.},

   Cameroon, perpetuated by Southern Cameroon National Council (SCNC). A
   close understanding on how border crisis in Africa are being approached
   is critical especially when we consider that continuous ethnic violence
   in Southern Sudan which recently separated from Sudan highlights the
   weakness of separatism as tool in redressing identity issues in Africa.
   It also raises the question of whether separatism as advocated for by
   Southern Cameroon elites, empowers some of these African movements with
   the ability to sustain independent states.},

   debates},

Abstract = {France's prohibition on public face-veiling was rationalised partly with
   reference to `fraternity' - the third prong of the republican motto - as
   well as liberty and equality. Correspondingly, the voile integral ('full
   veil') was widely described as transgressing republican standards of
   civility. Yet counterintuitively, republican civility was not
   understood, at least primarily, in terms of sociability or expressivity
   - but rather as requiring discretion, modesty and self-restraint.
   Therefore, the `full veil' was not portrayed as an austere
   interpretation of religious modesty, but as precisely the opposite - as
   an `ostentatious' defiance of republican civility. It was deemed
   anti-republican not because it was too modest - but rather because it
   was too flamboyant. In this light, I argue that the law should be
   understood neither as a coherent republican response to problems of
   domination in religious life nor, however, should it be seen purely as
   an expression of ethno-nationalist defensiveness. Rather, it can be
   understood as an attempt to legislate a republican habitus, that is a
   set of social mores - and bodily techniques - deemed appropriate in
   republican society. I use the French example to consider the political
   function of civility understood not in relation to speech constraints
   but rather in terms of bodily and linguistic technique.},

Abstract = {The paper questions the view that the alleged lack of autonomy displayed
   by certain practices and cultural behavior may constitute a sound
   justification for limiting toleration of those practices. Not only is
   the concept of autonomy open to endless controversy, but it also entails
   a conflict with liberal public morality and often nurtures double
   standards. To this end, the paper first examines the assumptions and
   basis of the lack-of-autonomy approach; this analysis perforce leads the
   author to unravel the notion of autonomy and its rival conceptions.
   Second, it will be argued that liberal and democratic politics, though
   indebted to the value of personal autonomy in a fashion, requires only a
   purely political principle of autonomy. It is also contended that if
   comprehensive notions of autonomy are used instead of a purely political
   conception, unacceptable consequences for the public morality of liberal
   democracy may follow. Finally, the point will be illustrated with some
   examples drawn from multicultural politics.},

Abstract = {How do elections affect the costliness of financial crises to taxpayers?
   Previous research contends that more electorally competitive countries
   choose policies that are less costly to taxpayers. In this paper, we
   update Keefer's seminal 2007 article published in International
   Organization with revised data. The original article found that more
   electorally competitive countries had lower fiscal costs from responding
   to crises. The commonly used IMF/World Bank data set Keefer employed has
   since been extensively corrected and expanded. We update the original
   analysis with the newest version of this data set. After doing so, we
   find no evidence for an association between electoral competitiveness
   and the fiscal costs of responding to financial crises both within the
   original sample and outside of it. Our update highlights a broader
   methodological lesson: that the costs of responding to financial crises
   can take many years to be settled. Future research should explicitly
   address and model this delayed cost resolution.},

Abstract = {The participation of Flora Tristan in the political field is necessarily
   connected to her life story. Women and proletarian life, the two main
   subjects treated in her work, are directly related to several concerns
   about her own reality, and therefore, the outcome of a personal story,
   dealing in a struggle for affirmation of liberated identities opposed to
   restrictive roles from within the alterity. The misfortune of being a
   woman without liberties in an (ex)-bourgeois worker position allows her
   to establish a political theory of liberation. In that sense, the
   objective of this article is to present the thoughts and ideas of Flora
   Tristan under three perspectives. On the first place, the formation of a
   work methodology derived from praxis and travel. In second place, the
   configuration of her two main political subjects: the male and the
   female workers, and the woman. Finally, to establish the relation of
   this political construction, anchored to an ethical program of the
   universal love.},

Abstract = {Do senators respond to the preferences of their state's median voter or
   only to the preferences of their copartisans? We develop a method for
   estimating state-level public opinion broken down by partisanship so
   that scholars can distinguish between general and partisan
   responsiveness. We use this to study responsiveness in the context of
   Senate confirmation votes on Supreme Court nominees. We find that
   senators weight their partisan base far more heavily when casting such
   roll call votes. Indeed, when their state median voter and party median
   voter disagree, senators strongly favor the latter. This has significant
   implications for the study of legislative responsiveness and the role of
   public opinion in shaping the members of the nation's highest court. The
   methodological approach we develop enables more nuanced analyses of
   public opinion and its effects, as well as more finely grained studies
   of legislative behavior and policy making.},

Abstract = {This article explores competing interpretations of American federalism
   and immigration authority during the 11th century. I argue that the 1787
   Constitution did not clearly place the authority to manage migration
   with the national government. In fact, the Constitution did not discuss
   enhy and exit policy, including the power of deportation. The debates
   over the Alien and Sedition Acts illustrate the diversity of opinions
   about the proper balance of authority between the national and
   subnational governments with regard to migration policy. Debates over
   the potential expansion of national power were particularly heated in
   the antebellum period because migration policy and slave policy were
   inextricably linked. In the end, whatever guidance the Constitution
   provided on migration policy was tainted by the document's endorsement
   of slavery.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to develop the idea of Gutierrez Girardot that the
   Aristotelian-Thomist stream modelled the Latin-American social
   structure; which ended up in farms as forms of socialization or the
   ``big house{''} model. Furthermore, the paper goes beyond Gutirrez
   Girardot's theory, and follows Fernando Guillen Martinez and Orlando
   Fals Borda. These authors explain the evolution of the encomienda model
   to the farms and political parties, which partly determines the social
   and political behavior of the region. The text also arguments, based on
   Gutirrez, that Spanish racism formed aristocracies that eventually
   created the social aristocratic constitution. This implied the
   undermining of democracy and the reproduction of violence. In the
   Colombian case, violence is intrinsic to the social structure formed
   under the Aristotelian-Thomist model.},

Title = {Assessing the Policy Impact of Australia's Parliamentary Electoral
   Matters Committees: A Case Study of the Victorian Electoral Matters
   Committee and the Introduction of Direct Electoral Enrolment},
Journal = {PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS},

Abstract = {In recent years there has been surge of critical interest in the study
   of committees in Westminster-derived parliaments. However, one type of
   committee has escaped review: Australia's dedicated electoral matters
   committees (EMC). This article investigates the policy impact of one of
   Australia's EMCs, the Victorian EMC. Using a mixed-methods case study of
   the Victorian EMC's 2008/2009 inquiry into voter participation and
   informal voting, this article argues the Victorian EMC influenced the
   introduction of direct electoral enrolment in June 2010 through the
   Electoral Amendment (Electoral Participation) Bill. Consistent with the
   mixed-methods case study literature in committee studies, the analysis
   occurs in two parts. To assess the Victorian EMC's impact on the
   Victorian government, this article conducts quantitative analysis of the
   number of references made in second reading speeches for the Bill, and
   then content analysis. Further to this, building on the work of Hawes
   (1993) and Russell and Benton (2011) on `non-quantifiable' aspects of
   committee impact, this article examines the Victorian EMC's impact on
   the Victorian Electoral Commission (VEC), another inquiry stakeholder.
   It contends that the Victorian EMC's impact on the VEC was a defining
   factor contributing to the introduction of direct enrolment in Victoria
   in August 2010. This article contributes to the scarce literature on
   Australia's EMCs, proposing a framework for their analysis at a time
   when the Victorian EMC and the New South Wales Joint Standing Committee
   on Electoral Matters are approaching their tenth anniversaries. To a
   lesser extent, this article also contributes to the effectiveness branch
   of the committee studies literature.},

   allow the understanding of the way in which people live and perceive
   their everyday environment and to be able to relate these imaginary
   perceptions to the site's spatial planning process, which will generate
   a public policy with a higher dose of efficiency, efficacy and
   effectiveness, which for the purpose of this paper are called: public
   policies of otherness. These include, among other, a common denominator
   that enables the association of techniques and a variety of
   methodologies to the planning process, allowing the progress in the
   theoretical knowledge discipline.},

Abstract = {There is no shortage of historical and sociological works tackling the
   long-term development of U.S. policies on unauthorized immigration. This
   essay highlights several key conceptual and empirical gaps for
   understanding the politics of immigration policy history, and spotlights
   the meaning and implications of conflicts over problem definition,
   reform impasses, ``strange bedfellow{''} compromises, and immigrant
   agency. The study underscores the increasing intensity and texture of
   struggles over ``illegal{''} immigration over time. This essay also
   highlights how rare shifts from gridlock to major policy change have
   been driven by unexpected alliances, the necessity of painful
   compromises to appease disparate actors, and the contradictions produced
   by immigration reform packages. Finally, this essay highlights the role
   of immigrants as transformative agents in immigration politics, who
   employ strategies of litigation, civil disobedience, protest, and
   electoral mobilization.},

Abstract = {In power since 2009, Moldova's pro-democracy and pro-European ruling
   coalition has been unable to implement effectively much-needed reforms.
   Presenting the details of recent key events and using quantitative
   assessments, this article argues that the main cause of Moldova's
   present problems is state capture. Cynical elites have engaged in a
   fierce competition for the capture of state institutions and for the
   control of policymaking in order to promote their own private economic
   interests. The ensuing delegitimation of state institutions and of the
   Moldovan state itself is highly detrimental to the country's democracy
   and sovereignty.},

Abstract = {Visa policy is an inherent component of migration management systems and
   visas are tools for controlling and facilitating entry and admission.
   However, within the context of modern migration management systems, the
   blatant emphasis on ``control or prevention{''} sometimes shades over
   other functions of visa policies such as promoting human mobility
   especially for the countries where the visa is solely used for short
   term mobility. In this article, the author argues that traditionally
   Turkey's visa policies have been determined mainly by positive
   incentives rather than concerns related to undesired migration. While
   Turkey's visa policy is considered liberal in favor of increasing
   mobility and may serve ongoing discussions of the (adverse) effects of
   strict border regimes, it needs to further build upon the universal
   principles of non-discrimination, consistency, and transparency.},

Abstract = {Abraham Lincoln is usually described as a purely American, almost
   provincial, figure. But his ideas and wartime policies should also be
   understood in a transatlantic context, since Lincoln's ideas and
   policies conform so remarkably to the patterns of classical liberal
   ideas in Europe in the nineteenth century, and especially to the
   Manchester School of Richard Cobden and John Bright. In contrast to the
   failures and disappointments of Continental liberalism, Lincoln's
   triumph in the American Civil War represents a world historical victory
   for bourgeois liberal democracy.},

Abstract = {There is no shortage of political science literature on field research
   regarding issues of research design, methodology, and data evaluation.
   Yet, the practical and organisational intricacies that precede
   successful fieldwork are frequently overlooked. This lack of methodical
   advice may be due to the impression that field research is highly
   contextual, and so case-specific that general guidelines, which apply to
   all field research endeavours alike, are inconceivable. While we
   acknowledge the organisational complexity of field research, we disagree
   with the notion that the preparatory dimension of fieldwork is by
   necessity unique for every undertaking. Rather, recommendations for
   common challenges that occur during the preparation and organisation
   phase of a field trip can be identified and formulated. Consequently, we
   present and discuss ten organisational `do's' preceding successful field
   research. Current graduate students and future field researchers will
   regard these ten pointers as useful hints in the organisation of their
   own endeavour. While the list is by no means exhaustive, the ten
   recommendations will lower the organisational entry costs of aspiring
   field researchers, and enable them to hit the ground running upon
   arrival in the field.},

Abstract = {This study of the uses of Europe by the leaders of the Front National
   shows how the opening of a new European political space can have
   indirect effects, supporting political parties at the domestic level and
   strengthening specific actors within political organizations. The theme
   of Europe, together with European elections and the European Parliament,
   are transformed by Front National leaders into material as well as
   symbolic resources which they mobilize in the national political space
   at both inter and intra-party level. These uses of Europe reinforce the
   capacities and resources of the party as well as its legitimacy and
   visibility. It helps Front National actors to widen their electoral
   support and allows party presidents to strengthen their position. The
   article reveals the specificity of the Front National relationship to
   the European arena and underlines the strong continuity of the practices
   developed by the new leadership. Finally the study provides a detailed
   account of the process of Front National Europeanization and advances
   understanding of the impact of European integration on domestic
   political competition.},

Abstract = {Evidence regarding the influence of campaign donations and lobbying
   efforts on legislative behavior is mixed. Much researchnot to mention
   conventional wisdomsuggests that well-funded interest groups exploit
   their resource advantage by making campaign contributions and deploying
   lobbyists to gain informational advantages and influence legislation.
   Using contribution data, information about interest group support for
   legislation, and a rare data setconstituent contacts to six state
   legislative officesthis paper examines how interest group donations and
   constituent activism influence outcomes. Although the amount of money
   contributed by groups supporting or opposing a bill did not affect its
   prospects, constituent contacts had a substantial impact. Political
   expenditures by business firms appear primarily to sustain an entrenched
   class of lobbyists and consultants.},

Abstract = {How is euroscepticism related to left-right ideology in Western European
   public opinion? We argue that inconsistent findings on this relationship
   result from the changing nature of European integration over time.
   Initially, EU market integration mainly sparked left-wing opposition;
   after Maastricht the intensification of political integration
   additionally produced nationalist euroscepticism among the political
   right. Hence, we hypothesize that the relationship between citizens'
   left-right ideology and euroscepticism evolved from linear to U-shaped.
   We test this hypothesis by means of multilevel logistic regression on 74
   waves of the Eurobarometer (1973-2010) in 12 EU member states. The
   results demonstrate an increase of right-wing euroscepticism across
   countries, whereas the developments on the left are mixed. In the
   concluding section, we discuss the theoretical and political
   implications of these findings.},

Abstract = {In 2007, a private corporation specializing in deep-sea salvage
   retrieved a treasure-laden shipwreck in international waters southwest
   of the Iberian Peninsula. The wreck was that of a Spanish warship that
   sunk during the Napoleonic wars. Following the discovery, a legal
   dispute arose in U.S. federal courts, between the corporate salvors, the
   Kingdom of Spain, and other litigants. At issue in the legal proceedings
   was the status of the shipwreck and whether it was protected by
   sovereign immunity. At the heart of this case are differing political
   imaginations concerning the authority of states and the role of
   corporations in the contemporary global order. Through a close reading
   of court documents and the narratives in which the courts' rulings are
   embedded, we demonstrate that the case is symptomatic of the tension in
   neoliberal sovereignty between two overlapping and at times competing
   political rationalities: the neoliberal logic of capital and commerce
   and the logic of sovereign prerogative.},

Abstract = {The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) was founded in 1974 in response to the
   Indian nuclear test in order to prevent nuclear proliferation by
   controlling nuclear exports. In 2008, the NSG exempted India from its
   full-scope safeguards (FSS) condition, making it the first country to be
   allowed to have nuclear trade with NSG members while retaining its
   nuclear weapons program. India won this waiver after tough negotiations
   and having resisted tough nonproliferation conditions. India is now
   bidding for NSG membership. This paper analyses the prospects for the
   membership in light of the waiver negotiations and how the waiver
   negotiations can guide us in assessing the likely path of the membership
   negotiations. This study concludes that India will resist any conditions
   and the US and India have to invest massive diplomatic efforts to reach
   a formula that addresses the nonproliferation concerns of member states.},

Abstract = {A common assumption in the West is that distance and space are no longer
   key considerations in strategy and politics. Over there', the argument
   goes, can quickly and dangerously become over here'. Yet, as Patrick
   Porter contends, this is a dangerous fallacy that distorts Western
   strategy. A proper consideration of the role of distance should not lead
   to disengagement or isolation, but rather to a more selective and
   considered - and thus more flexible - foreign and security policy.},

Abstract = {Somewhat paradoxically, numerous scholars in various disciplines have
   found that religion induces negative attitudes towards immigrants, while
   others find that it fuels feelings of compassion. We offer a framework
   that accounts for this discrepancy. Using two priming experiments
   conducted among American Catholics, Turkish Muslims, and Israeli Jews,
   we disentangle the role of religious social identity and religious
   belief, and differentiate among types of immigrants based on their
   ethnic and religious similarity to, or difference from, members of the
   host society. We find that religious social identity increases
   opposition to immigrants who are dissimilar to in-group members in
   religion or ethnicity, while religious belief engenders welcoming
   attitudes toward immigrants of the same religion and ethnicity,
   particularly among the less conservative devout. These results suggest
   that different elements of the religious experience exert distinct and
   even contrasting effects on immigration attitudes, manifested in both
   the citizenry's considerations of beliefs and identity and its
   sensitivity to cues regarding the religion of the target group.},

Abstract = {Why are some nascent groups able to organize sustained violent
   resistance to state repression, whereas others quickly fail? This
   article links the sustainability of armed resistance to a largely
   understudied variablethe skills to mount such a resistance. It also
   argues that the nature of repression experienced by a community creates
   and shapes these crucial skills. More specifically, the article focuses
   on a distinction between selective and indiscriminate state repression.
   Selective repression is more likely to create skilled resisters;
   indiscriminate repression substantially less so. Thus, large-scale
   repression that begins at time t has a higher chance of being met with
   sustained organized resistance at t +1 if among the targeted population

Abstract = {Most formal models of valence competition add a single, separable and
   unweighted component to the standard one-dimensional utility function of
   voters. This article presents the results of a conjoint analysis
   experiment in which respondents were asked to choose between two
   candidates whose profiles vary along five attributes. Four of these
   traits behave like valence or policy issues as expected, but one, which
   has been employed in recent formal and empirical works, does not.
   Moreover, policy and valence are not separable. They interact at least
   in some cases, taking a competency form whereby the marginal impact of
   valence on voters' choice is conditional on candidates' policies. This
   result lends support to recent studies that have found more extensive
   valence voting under ideological convergence. Finally, policy trumps
   valence in awkward choices. Respondents even prefer corrupt candidates
   with similar policy views to honest ones with different opinions,
   despite integrity being declared the most important attribute.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship has identified problems in the measurement of party
   system instability. To limit the conflation of different sources of
   instability in party systems (e.g., electoral shifts between stable
   parties and instability in parties, such as mergers, splinters or new
   parties), this article introduces a new indicator of electoral
   instability in parties, tests its robustness and construct validity and
   demonstrates its usefulness empirically. The indicators of party
   instability and the accompanying data of 27 European democracies,

Abstract = {The research addresses youth voter turnout in the United States and,
   specifically, tests the relationship between candidate age and a
   commitment to vote by young people in a controlled experiment. We learn
   that potential young voters are more willing to commit to vote when they
   view pictures of younger candidates running. This is the case after
   controlling for the age and partisanship of respondents. In a real-world
   test of our experimental results, we examine state-level variation in
   youth voter turnout in midterm governor and Senate races (1994-2010). In
   the state-level analysis, we find a larger candidate age gap in governor
   and Senate races associates with higher levels of youth mobilization. In
   all, the research affirms the value of candidate characteristics as a
   predictor of voting behavior.},

Abstract = {Margaret Thatcher was literally a legend in her own lifetime. Her death
   in April 2013, however, affords us with a fantastic opportunity to map
   and perhaps qualify the common wisdom about her and her governments.
   This article analyses the leading articles and obituaries published on
   her death in Britain's national newspapers. How does the picture painted
   in them of Thatcher and her governments match what most academics would
   see as the reality? What do they over- and under-emphasize, or even miss
   out altogether? And what chance is there that more rounded and realistic
   accounts will eventually triumph?},

Abstract = {This article traces the changing funding relationships between Scotland
   and the UK government. Beginning from the Barnett Formula, it examines
   how the changing support within Scotland for greater political autonomy
   from Westminster has influenced the mechanisms that have determined
   Scotland's fiscal structure. Increasing support for the SNP, and then
   for the Yes campaign in the September 2014 independence referendum, has
   led to a mixture of new powers being granted to the Scottish Parliament.
   The Scotland Act 2012 extends the Scottish government's control over
   income tax and some other small taxes. Although independence was
   rejected by the Scottish people in September 2014, the Vow' made by the
   Westminster parties immediately before the vote is leading to
   far-reaching changes in the UK's fiscal structure. This will cause a
   very substantial change in intergovernmental relations within the UK,
   which the Barnett Formula may not survive.},

Abstract = {The 1/1977 Law of January 4, for Political Reform (LPR), was a key
   political piece at the beginning of the Spanish Transition to democracy,
   as well as a legal instrument that allowed the institutional dismantling
   of the Francoist regime and the transition to a democratic system. This
   paper analyzes the different phases of the legislative iter and its
   difficulties, the risky bet on the LPR of Adolfo Suarez and his
   Government, including the study of the campaign to its ratification by
   referendum, and giving special attention to the debate between legality
   and legitimacy and the role played by the memory of the Civil War in the
   process of elaboration and passing of this Law.},

Abstract = {Rapid changes in power relativities inevitably aggravate security fears
   among smaller, weaker states and those in relative decline. The closer
   these states are to the major power and the deeper their historical
   relationships with it, the more this is true. It is preponderant on
   rising or remerging major powers to assuage these worries in word and
   action. If not, the rising or reemerging power will face resistance.
   Under Xi Jinping, Chinese foreign policy has embraced China's status as
   the leading power in East Asia and one of two major powers globally.
   Acceptance and support for China's new major power status and
   corresponding regional initiatives like the Asian Infrastructure
   Investment Bank and a ``new Asian security order{''} face three
   particular challenges in East Asia. The first challenge is increasingly
   public concerns about possible future Chinese hegemony with the East and
   South China Sea disputes, in particular aggravating these worries among
   the non-Chinese disputants. The second challenge is the disruption of
   the liberal virtuous cycle between growing economic interdependence and
   more aligned strategic interests and greater strategic trust. The third
   is the strengthening of alliance and security partnerships between the
   United States and a growing number of East Asian states from Vietnam and
   Singapore to the Philippines and Japan. Chinese foreign policy under and
   after Xi Jinping will have to respond to these concerns and reassure its
   East Asian neighbours in order to succeed.},

Volume = {45},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Despite its importance in contemporary American politics, presidential
   scandal is poorly understood within political science. Scholars
   typically interpret scandals as resulting from the disclosure of
   official misbehavior, but the likelihood and intensity of media scandals
   is also influenced by the political and news context. This article
   provides a theoretical argument for two independent factors that should
   increase the president's vulnerability to scandal: low approval among
   opposition party identifiers and a lack of congestion in the news
   agenda. Using new data and statistical approaches, I find strong support
   for both claims. These results suggest that contextual factors shape the
   occurrence of political events and how such events are interpreted.},

Title = {Clientelism and the personal vote in Indonesia},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {37},
Pages = {73-85},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The personal vote literature proceeds from the assumption,that
   personalism has an independent effect on policy outcomes. Institutions
   appear as exogenous variables that structure incentives for personalism,
   and the personalism of electoral competition effects legislator behavior
   once in office. This paper finds that existing state spending and
   prevailing patterns of policy implementation can have an independent
   effect on the personalism of political competition. When political
   fortunes depend on the personal vote, and candidates can promise to
   deliver clientelistic benefits to voters, both voters and candidates
   have an incentive to enter an enduring patron-client relationship. The
   clientelistic appeal, however, is only credible if voters expect the
   winning candidate will have goods to deliver once in office. The
   empirical section leverages cross-district variance in electoral
   personalism in Indonesia. It connects preference voting rates to
   pre-existing patterns of sub-national state spending. In electoral
   districts where the state played a dominant role in the economy, voters
   and candidates tended to form the type of patron-client bonds that
   resulted in high levels of preference voting. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Why do some presidents emerge from a scandal unscathed while for others
   it may lead to a crisis of legitimacy? This question is crucial to
   understanding the conditions under which elected leaders are held
   accountable. This study proposes a theory of conditional accountability
   by which the public most consistently punishes presidents for scandals
   when the economy is weak. Under strong economic conditions, scandals do
   not tarnish presidents' public standing. To test the theory, we use a
   new dataset that includes measures of scandals, presidential approval,
   and the economy for 84 presidential administrations in 18 Latin American

Title = {Dealing with Religious Differences in Italian Prisons: Relationships
   Between Institutions and Communities from Misrecognition to Mutual
   Transformation},

Abstract = {Against the backdrop of the `formatting of religions' thesis, this paper
   presents the outcomes of empirical research on religious assistance in
   ten prisons in the Italian region of Lazio. We construct a typology of
   the forms of relationships that exist between prisons and religious
   organisations in an increasingly pluralist context. These relationships
   can have their bases in (1) misrecognition, which is strictly speaking a
   form of non-relation; (2) adaptation, with a distinction drawn between
   instrumental adaptation, on the one hand, and formatting, on the other;
   (3) conflict; or (4) cooperation and mutual transformation. Each form of
   relationship is explained and discussed through the experiences of
   relevant individuals, with stories drawn from interviews conducted
   during our research. This typology shows that, in the Italian case at
   least, a context of religious pluralism and the coexistence of religious
   and secular worldviews and practices in public institutions do not
   necessarily have a `formatting' effect on religious organisations, nor
   lead to any form of mutual transformation or `complementary learning'
   process taking place. This `complementary learning' process has been
   taken in our research as a working hypothesis. We take the term from the
   broader theoretical debate about the postsecular, but we want to make
   the point that the postsecular also has an empirical dimension which can
   be described and assessed through the kind of sociological research we
   conduct in this paper. This paper explores why no such complementary
   learning process has developed between institutions and religious groups
   in the Italian context, and briefly highlights how, conversely, this
   kind of postsecular relationship is promoted in the UK. At the same
   time, it argues that forms of resistance from religious groups to
   institutional formatting pressures can be observed in both the British
   context and in the results of our own research.},

Title = {More Equal than We Thought? Using Vote Validation to Better Understand
   Participation Inequality in the States},
Journal = {STATE POLITICS \& POLICY QUARTERLY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {91-114},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Inequality in political participation is a well-known and often studied
   feature of American politics. An important study examining misreporting
   of voter turnout in opinion surveys, however, calls into question the
   true extent of participation inequality. Ansolabehere and Hersh's
   first-ever 50-state vote validation project shows that those with more
   political resources are more likely to misreport turnout. That is, those
   with higher incomes are more likely than others to report that they had
   voted when in fact they did not. These findings suggest that income
   disparities in participation are not as large as opinion surveys have
   led us to believe. Moreover, studies using differences between voters
   and nonvoters as a key political indicator may also be biased. This
   article presents the first assessment of whether vote misreporting
   creates systematic bias in measures of state participation inequality.
   An index of economic inequality in participation for the 50 states is
   developed using the Ansolabehere and Hersh validated vote data and
   compares the measure of political inequality with a similar measure
   using traditional (i.e., nonvalidated) survey data. These state indices
   are used to determine the extent of bias produced by misreporting and
   whether this bias has implications for studies using these measures of
   participation inequality. The latter is assessed by examining the
   influence of the self-reported and validated inequality measures on
   state welfare programs and minimum wage policy.},

   Evidence from Japan's single non-transferable vote and single-member

Volume = {21},

Abstract = {This study aims to offer empirical evidence of how electoral systems
   influence the way legislators represent their constituencies. In
   particular, it analyses the influence of electoral systems on
   legislators' representations in terms of a pattern of policy areas
   represented by them. By comparing legislators' behaviour under Japan's
   multi-member district, single non-transferable vote and single-member
   district systems, I demonstrate that electoral systems with higher
   district magnitude (i.e. higher number of seats per district) are more
   likely to offer electoral incentives for legislators to represent
   specific benefits, including particularistic interests in targeted

   representing diverse benefits, including general interests in various

Abstract = {Emerging regional powers, such as Brazil and India, are reshaping world
   politics. We conduct a game-theoretic analysis to examine how growing
   regional powers compete for influence against a global power, such as
   the United States, in different circumstances. If the global power
   regards dominant positions in different regions as strategic substitutes
   (complements), a stronger regional power in region A increases
   (decreases) the global power's efforts to dominate in region B. For
   example, if Iran grows stronger, the United States should increase its
   efforts to secure energy resources in Central Asia as substitutes for
   Middle Eastern oil. Conversely, suppose the United States fails to
   create support for stringent intellectual property rights protection in
   Latin America because Brazil opposes new rules. In this case, we expect
   the United States to have fewer incentives to create support in other
   regions because intellectual property rights rules are most valuable
   when they constitute a complementary global standard.},

Abstract = {It has previously been proposed that agency theory (principal-agent
   approach) might be applied to media organizations to understand how
   media owners make sure that their companies are managed according to
   their wishes. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to investigate:
   a) whether agency theory is applicable to three Icelandic media
   companies, and b) how the theory manifests itself in the management
   practices of these companies. The media companies that were examined
   were: the Icelandic National Broadcasting Service (RUV ohf.), 365 midlar
   ehf. and Arvakur hf. Qualitative interviews were conducted with three
   editors-in-chief, two CEOs/publishers, the director general of RUV and
   the news director of RUV in May of 2012. Two of the interviewees were
   also part-owners of the media companies.
   The results indicated that it is, indeed, possible to analyze management
   practices of media organizations from the perspective of agency theory.
   However, it varies how much the companies are driven by profit
   maximization, for instance -on which agency theory places an optimum
   emphasis. The media house 365 midlar ehf. turned out to be the best
   example of how the underlying constructs of agency theory are
   incorporated into the management practices of a media organization.},

Abstract = {Some historians who write about and document the Armenian Genocide may
   still differ on the significance of the massacres of 1894-1896 and on
   the process that initiated the mass murder during and following the
   First World War. One group of historians argues that the genocide was,
   in effect, a continuation of the 1894-1896 massacres and that its
   origins were rooted in Islam and Ottoman culture. A second group of
   historians contends that the genocide was qualitatively different from
   the massacres and that it was driven by a policy of radicalization
   during the First World War. This historiographical disagreement has some
   parallels to that between historians of the Holocaust who stress the
   role of German culture and the ideology of the leadership as against
   those who emphasize the cumulative radicalization of Nazi policy that
   was spurred by the Second World War. The second view of the Armenian
   Genocide is, in effect, a critique of the first. After examining these
   two approaches, this article concludes with an evaluation of some of the
   assumptions of the second view.},

Abstract = {Poland's radical economic and political reforms after 1989 were an
   enormous success. In Ukraine, Warsaw's liberal path is considered a role
   model. However, circumstances differ considerably. Ukraine's economic
   decline may indeed be so glaring that the population is ready for
   far-reaching reforms. However, it is incomparably more difficult to
   reform Ukraine's deformed oligarchic capitalism, and Russia's war
   against Ukraine diverts resources. In addition, the international
   situation is much worse than it was for Poland in 1989: The EU will not
   support Ukraine to the same extent as it did the Central European
   countries, and the years of global neoliberal consensus are over.},

Abstract = {The division of cultural policy between different levels of
   administration and the coordination between them in federal countries is
   a relatively neglected area of research, even though the cultural sphere
   always requires a balanced combination of autonomy and governance. A
   particularly interesting case of this equilibrium arises in Spain; often
   described as a quasi-federal system, both regarding its model of state
   and within the sphere of cultural policy. However, we demonstrate that,
   despite the broadly decentralized development of cultural administration
   in Spain-a plurinational and multicultural state-different recent
   judicial and political processes are distorting the quasi-federalism
   constructed over the past three decades. We also show that there is a
   growing tendency to recentralize and to promote a single cultural
   conception of the country.},

Abstract = {This article intervenes into an ongoing debate on authoritarian regimes
   in the Arab world following the uprisings of 2011, in particular
   addressing the perceived failure of those uprisings to bring about
   ``transition{''} to liberal democratic models. Drawing upon the method
   of comparative historical sociology used in seminal analyses of
   democratization and dictatorship in Europe, Asia and the Americas, the
   article seeks to explain the varying trajectories of the Arab Uprising
   states in terms of several structural factors, namely the balance of
   class forces, the relative autonomy of the state and the geo-political
   context. The article provides an empirical comparison of the cases of
   Egypt, Tunisia and Syria as points on a continuum of outcomes following
   the Arab uprising. The article mounts a critique of the absence of class
   analysis in mainstream transition theory and hypothesises instead an
   important role for workers' movements in bringing about even basic
   elements of liberal democracy. The empirical comparison is shown to
   support this hypothesis, demonstrating that in Tunisia, the state where
   the worker's movement was strongest a constitutional settlement has been
   reached while Syria, the state with the weakest and least independent
   workers' movement has descended into counter-revolution and civil war:
   the case of Egypt lying between these two poles.},

Abstract = {It is common wisdom in radical right research that men are
   over-represented among the radical right electorate. We explore whether
   a radical right gender gap exists across 12 Western European countries
   and examine how this gap may be explained. Using the European Values
   Study (2010), we find a radical right gender gap that remains
   substantial after controlling for socioeconomic and political
   characteristics. However, our results indicate strong cross-national
   variation in the size of the gap. Explanations for these differences are
   explored by looking at the outsider image and the populist discourse
   style of the radical right parties, which are hypothesised to keep women
   from voting for the radical right. Our results do not confirm this
   expectation: differences in party characteristics do not account for
   cross-national differences in the gender gap. Implications of these
   findings and suggestions for further research are discussed.},

Abstract = {The problems most people have in understanding Marx come not only from
   the complexity of his theories, but also from the frequent changes in
   the meanings of his concepts. The present article attributes this
   unusual practice to Marx's `philosophy of internal relations', which
   serves as the foundation for his dialectical method, and his use of the
   process of abstraction (breaking up our internally related world into
   the `parts' best suited to study it). The `flexibility' found in Marx's
   use of language is the linguistic counterpart of the different
   abstractions he believes necessary in order to capture the complex
   workings of capitalism. Marx's dialectical categories, especially
   `contradiction', are good examples of this process at work.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},

Volume = {19},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {This article examines some recent Canadian projects of historical
   narrative revision in light of Canada's broader redress culture: the
   recurring norms and assumptions that govern its apportionment of causal
   and reparative responsibility for historic wrongs. To this end, it
   studies several grassroots commemorative projects funded under the
   Community Historical Recognition Program. It asks whether these projects
   contribute to forging a broader culture of redress capable of
   contributing to a goal that this article identifies as a central
   underlying justification for enterprises of historical justice in
   general: democratizing citizenship. Thus, the article aims to fulfil two
   main objectives. First, it offers an empirical analysis of some
   important Canadian historical justice initiatives, thus contributing to
   our understanding of a case often seen as a leader in redress politics.
   Second, by developing and then applying its own account of how
   historical justice projects can contribute to goals of democratic
   citizenship, the article offers what I hope is a suggestive model for
   analysing and evaluating particular acts or policies of historical
   redress more generally. A key conclusion from this analysis is that the
   Canadian example is much less inspiring than often assumed.},

Abstract = {The normative ideals and feasibility of deliberative democracy have come
   under attack from several directions, as exemplified by a recent book
   version of a special issue of this journal. Critics have pointed out
   that the complexity of the modern world, voter ignorance, partisanship,
   apathy, and the esoteric nature of political communications make it
   unlikely that deliberation will be successful at creating good outcomes,
   and that it may in fact be counterproductive since it can polarize
   opinions. However, these criticisms were aimed at ``micro{''} theories
   of deliberative democracy. The new ``systemic{''} turn in deliberative
   democracy avoids these problems by positing a system-wide division of
   labor in a nation-state: experts and ordinary citizens ``check{''} each
   other's opinions; partisanship and even ignorance can spur deliberation
   among citizens; and citizens may remain apathetic about some issues but
   deliberate about others. So long as the overall level of systemic
   deliberation increases, instead of decreases, the ideal of deliberation
   is still relevant in a society as complex as ours.},

Abstract = {Whether or not a legislature is uni- or bi-cameral has been found to
   have important consequences. Ireland's 1937 constitution provided for a
   directly elected lower chamber (Dail eireann) and an indirectly elected
   upper chamber (Seanad eireann). With the appointment to government in
   2011 of two political parties with a common electoral commitment to
   abolish bicameralism, the subsequent coalition agreement included a
   promise to hold a referendum offering voters the option to move to a
   unicameral parliamentary system. On 4 October 2013, the electorate voted
   to retain the upper chamber, albeit by a narrow majority of 51.7 per
   cent, on a turnout of 39.17 per cent. The outcome was arguably
   surprising, given that opinion polls signalled a plurality of voters
   favoured abolition, and there was a general public antipathy towards
   political institutions in the midst of a major economic crisis. Public
   opinion research suggests that a combination of factors explained voting
   behaviour, including a lack of interest amongst those who did not vote.
   A cost savings argument was a significant factor for those favouring
   abolition, while concerns over government control of the legislative
   process appear to have been most prominent in the minds of those who
   voted to retain the upper chamber.},

Abstract = {After the global financial crisis, the European Union has adopted a new
   regulatory approach towards foreign countries by making use of
   equivalence rules in finance. Why? This paper argues that it is the EU's
   attempt to restore financial stability in its territory and maintain the
   competitiveness of its financial industry. However, this old' dilemma
   between stability and competition in financial regulation is further
   complicated in a regional jurisdiction, such as the EU, because
   different regulatory paradigms play off in the dilemma.},

Abstract = {Ireland's tobacco control policy today is recognised as one of the
   strongest in Europe and the world, largely on the basis of its
   first-in-the-world general workplace smoking ban in 2004. However, it is
   insufficiently recognised that Ireland has persistently and deliberately
   developed tobacco control policies since the 1970s, a longer period than
   most countries. Using a five-fold analysis of factors influencing
   tobacco policy: agendas, socio-economic setting (including public
   opinion), networks, institutions, and ideas (including scientific
   information and diffusion), this paper explains policy development in
   Ireland over the long term. It demonstrates how a small country, not
   dependent on tobacco growing or a domestic tobacco industry but also
   having only a small research and bureaucratic capacity, has managed to
   create a strong tobacco control policy. Even though it is a European
   Union member, Ireland has utilised diffusion of research and policy in
   the English-speaking world, especially paying close attention to the
   USA, to develop its position as a world policy leader in tobacco
   control.},

Pages = {531+},
Abstract = {The conflict-ridden relationship between Georgia and Russia has been
   emotionally charged for centuries. This was manifested not only in
   Russian, but also in Georgian literature. The loss of Georgian
   independence starting in 1801 and the conquest by Bolshevik troops in
   1921 are major turning points. The spectrum of Georgian images of Russia
   range from Christian protector to colonial oppressor. Within this
   spectrum resonates the promise of individual liberty, but also hatred
   for the great collective prison. Georgia's ever evolving perception of
   itself is also always reflected in the literary depictions of its large
   neighbour.},

Abstract = {This article serves to introduce a new technology for student feedback
   on written assignments to political scientists. Developed in the field
   of composition studies, screencapture commentary is a novel technique
   designed to provide audiovisual responses to student writing. To receive
   feedback, students watch a recorded video of the instructor's computer
   terminal, listening to the instructor's commentary while watching the
   cursor move and highlight selections of the text for illustration. The
   final section of this article demonstrates preliminary evidence of
   improved educational outcomes in courses taught at two large 4-year
   universities where screencapture technology was employed. On the basis
   of these findings, I also argue that screencapture comments may be
   especially beneficial in online course environments.},

Title = {The Market Metaphor As an Issue of Political Language and Practice},
Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Number = {3},
Pages = {238-254},
Abstract = {This paper focuses on the problem of analogies and metaphors in
   politics, concretely the metaphor of the market and the various
   analogies it encompasses applied to the political sphere, as a
   phenomenon of political language and practice. The inspiration behind
   this article is a sociological critique of the economic theory of
   politics by Lars Udehn. After forming a basic theoretical framework for
   the terms analogy and metaphor, the author discusses the problem of
   methodological inconsistency in the social sciences. The discussion of
   metaphor is presented in three parts: the inherence of homo economicus
   in politics, politics as exchange and politics as competition. The
   crucial thesis of this paper is that there are limitations on the extent
   to which political processes and phenomena may be understood in market
   terms, and individual analogies that have emerged from this metaphor are
   by definition only partially applicable. The conclusion is that the
   market metaphor presents specific difficulties and is an
   oversimplification which will lead sooner or later to significant
   misunderstandings and misinterpretations of politics.},

Abstract = {This article examines the history of political science in relation to
   the history of the prison. It considers how theories of the state in
   political science have assumed that proper states should punish with
   prisons, and traces these ideas to the work of Francis Lieber, the first
   academic political scientist in the USA. Because his ideas about prison
   reform were central to his conceptualization of the discipline as a
   science of punishment, his theory of the state is an understudied part
   of the history of mass incarceration. Lieber argued that the state had a
   moral duty to punish its citizens with the prison, and an obligation to
   manage the risks of democracy through the prison's principles of
   scientific certainty, less eligibility, and disciplinary solitude. By
   examining the life and work of Francis Lieber, this article offers new
   ways of thinking about political science's past, and its status as part
   of the history of the American prison.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the partisan messages of US Senate campaign
   advertisements. Using data from 2000 to 2004, we measure the levels of
   partisan cues and ``owned{''} issue mentions in US Senate campaigns. We
   hypothesize that campaigns are likely to use campaign communications
   involving partisan cues and owned issues when national and local
   conditions favor one of the parties. Our results recognize some
   variation in campaign strategies, providing strong evidence that
   candidates, political parties, and outside groups respond differently to
   local and national conditions when cueing party labels and party-owned
   issues.},

Journal = {CANADIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1-20},
Abstract = {Canadian provincial governments continue to own and operate a host of
   public enterprises. While many Crowns have been privatized or
   eliminated, governments continue to rely on remaining Crowns to meet
   specific policy and political objectives. This article analyzes three
   contemporary provincially-owned and operated Crowns - BC Ferries, the
   Liquor Control Board of Ontario and ATB Financial - and sets out to
   examine both why they continue to be publicly owned as well as their
   institutional evolutions as all three firms have reorganized their
   internal operations and the ways in which they are governed. These firms
   are relatively secure in their current condition since they all confer
   material advantages onto particular groups while providing politically
   important services to their governing superiors; any changes to their
   ownership structures would require a significant amount of energy, yet
   would yield marginal gains. The centralized decision-making structures
   within provincial governments, strong path dependencies, iterative
   incremental changes to these firms' operations and governance regimes,
   are all key factors shaping their respective lifecycle evolutions. These
   three public institutions help governments to meet key obligations and
   avoid potential political problems that are specific to their provincial
   contexts.},

Abstract = {The 2011 Newfoundland and Labrador election would mark a turning point
   in provincial politics. The exit of the extraordinarily popular former
   premier, Danny Williams, in the year prior to the contest guaranteed
   that the election would, at a minimum, diverge from the pattern set in
   recent years. Equally significant, Williams' successor, Kathy
   Dunderdale, is a historic figure: she was the first woman to lead the
   province and one of only eight women ever to hold the top office in a
   Canadian province. We give an account of the determinants of the vote
   decision in the 2011 election. We conclude that a fairly standard set of
   demographic and long-term dispositional influences were highly
   influential in voters' choices. At the same time, our analysis suggests
   that strategic considerations - especially concerning the Liberals and
   NDP are critical to understanding the final outcome.},

Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {49},
Number = {3},
Pages = {31+},
Abstract = {This paper focuses on the European REACH regulation on chemicals. We
   analyze the operations crafting regulatory categories in order to define
   technical objects and organizing the distribution of powers between
   public and private, national and European actors. This article suggests
   that the concept of ``regulatory precaution{''} helps characterize a
   European mode of governing chemicals. The examples of the registration
   of nanomaterials and that of the autorisation of phtalates highlight the
   choice made by the European Commission in favour of a ``case by case
   approach{''} that ends up multiplying regulatory categories, while
   postponing the introduction of legal constraints. These initiatives are
   not consensual: member states and the European Parliament produce more
   rigid regulatory categories, and thereby suggest an alternative mode of
   governing chemicals. Thus, regulatory precaution offers a lens through
   which one can identify the constitutional effects of the regulatory
   categories for European technical objects.},

Title = {SPECIFICS OF MIGRATION FROM RUSSIA TO EUROPE IN THE COURSE OF CRISIS:
   THE FLIGHT OF THE CREATIVE CLASS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2015},
Number = {2},
Pages = {52-67},
Abstract = {Russian emigration has its own specifics related to the fact that for
   the general population a ``crisis{''} is a part of a purely European
   phenomenon. The poorest part of the society is sure that Europe
   (European values related to human rights, market economy and liberal
   democracy) is failing, and this is manifested by the ``crisis{''}. So
   for traditionally the most vulnerable and marginalized populations,
   migration seems pointless. However, the statistical analysis suggests
   that migration to Europe from Russia is well gathered after the
   presidential election. It is specifically predominant amongst the middle
   class. Russian migrants in Europe tend to already have higher education,
   higher-paying jobs, own their own homes and are used to quite a high
   level of material and cultural consumption. All of this the migrant is
   ready to leave for the sake of (sometimes illusory) prospects in Europe.
   Thus, the desire to leave Russia is expressed, and, increasingly, is
   undertaken by those who are the backbone of the Russian society. These
   are people who are sufficiently secure at home and their desire to
   emigrate is not related to any kind of financial distress. As it is
   shown in the quantitative analysis carried out by the author, current
   migration is related to political reasons - the lack of the freedom of
   speech and the overall inability to influence the political destiny of
   the country. This general conclusion was made based on extensive
   research which sought to determine the nature of the Russian migration
   to Europe. It is defined as representing a kind of ``new wave of
   dissent{''}, caused primarily not due to economic distress, but rather,
   because of the political futility of the regime in the eyes of the
   middle class.},

Abstract = {Danny Boyle's opening ceremony for the London 2012 Olympics presented an
   extraordinary spectacle to the watching world. This article is about
   what it said to people in Britain, how it said it and why. By comparing
   (1) Boyle's version of a new Jerusalem with William Blake's `Jerusalem',
   and (2) the content of the ceremony with the realisation of Britain in
   works of art around Blake's time as analysed in Anthony D. Smith's The
   Nation Made Real, it is possible to see how Boyle reworks old themes and
   where he breaks new ground. There follow discussions of the ceremony's
   reception according to polling evidence, its broad-left political
   message, and the singular character of an event that sparked something
   akin to a moment of `collective effervescence'.},

Title = {Is Scotland a Westminster-style Majoritarian Democracy or a
   Scandinavian-style Consensus Democracy? A Comparison of Scotland, the UK
   and Sweden},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-18},
Abstract = {The idea of `new politics' in Scotland, in the 1990s, was based on a
   rejection of the `majoritarian' politics of `old Westminster' in favour
   of a `consensus democracy' associated with Scandinavian countries. Yet,
   the nascent literature suggests that Scottish and UK policy-making
   practices are similar. UK policy making does not live up to its
   majoritarian reputation and Scotland was designed with key `old
   Westminster' features. We extend the comparison to Sweden, as one of
   several, distinctive, Nordic reference points in Scotland. We examine
   critically its consensual image and identify the ways in which Scotland
   has similar features. The study helps clarify the practical meaning of
   majoritarian and consensus and encourages scholars to focus on actual
   behaviour rather than policy-making reputations. It also informs current
   debates on Scotland's future, using long-term evidence to inform recent
   attempts to revive this focus on the Nordic ideal.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes whether participation in civil society
   organizations (CSOs) in Turkey enables the learning of active
   citizenship. I conceptualize active citizenship along two axes. The
   first axis includes its defining dimensions (civic action, cohesion,
   self-actualization) while the second axis includes the types of learning
   (cognitive, pragmatic, affective) active citizenship requires. The study
   presents in-depth analysis of participant experiences in four CSOs in
   Turkey. Data are derived from semi-structured interviews with CSO
   members and volunteers. Findings reveal the mechanisms that link changes
   which occur to CSO participants to the various dimensions of active
   citizenship. The analysis points toward the potential for change in how
   citizenship is both learned and practiced in Turkey.},

Abstract = {Who do parties target for clientelistic vote buying? Existing research
   looks almost exclusively at individuals' socioeconomic and, especially,
   electoral profiles-which parties and candidates they support, professed
   ideological leanings, past voting turnout, and choice. We argue party
   brokers also consider democratic attitudinal profiles. Specifically,
   they are more likely to avoid full-fledged democrats and target citizens
   who are ambivalent to or reject core democratic principles. We test this
   proposition with the 2010 Argentina AmericasBarometer. To address
   selection bias on observables and unobservables, respectively, we
   preprocess the data with entropy balancing and employ instrumental
   variables regression. Results from both strategies are consistent with
   the notion that democrats are less likely vote-buying targets than their
   less democratic counterparts. Effect sizes are on par with or exceed
   other theoretical variables, and the results are robust to a variety of
   checks and specifications.},

Abstract = {Despite consensus regarding the civic shortcomings of American citizens,
   no such scholarly consensus exists regarding the effectiveness of civic
   education addressing political apathy and ignorance. Accordingly, we
   report the results of a detailed study of students enrolled in
   introductory American politics courses on the campuses of two large
   research universities. The study provides pre-and postmeasures for a
   broad range of political attitudes and behaviors and includes additional
   long-term observations in survey waves fielded 6, 12, and 18 months
   after the conclusion of the class. Long-term observation provides
   leverage absent in many prior studies and enables us to compare the
   changes we observe during the semester to those that take place beyond
   the confines of the classroom and during important political events,
   such as the 2012 presidential election. Also embedded in the study is an
   experiment designed to assess whether students' enthusiasm for ``new
   media{''} (e.g., blogs) can be harnessed in American politics courses to
   stimulate long-lasting political engagement. We find evidence that civic
   education matters for some, but not all, measures of political
   engagement. Moreover, we find evidence that what one does in the
   classroom also matters. For some dimensions of political engagement,
   this study finds evidence of lasting civic education effects and the
   experimental manipulation compellingly locates the source of some
   engagement variation in the classroom.},

Abstract = {The first decade of the twenty-first century has been marked by the
   decisive entry into our media landscape of the so-called global war on
   terror, with countless films and TV series from all over the world
   addressing the issue of international terrorism. Even Indian popular
   cinema, which has been addressing the issue of domestic terrorism since
   the late 1980s with films such as Roja (Ratnam, 1992), Drohkaal
   (Nihalani, 1994), Maachis (Gulzar, 1996), has, since the new millennium,
   begun to tackle the topic of international terrorism. In this article, I
   will analyse the shift in the construction of the terrorist discourse in
   Indian popular cinema from a domestic to an international perspective in
   order to highlight the close proximity between the two, as in fact, the
   ``global war on terror{''} narrative seems to offer Indian filmmakers
   the possibility to simultaneously address international and domestic
   terrorism. In particular, I will refer to Karan Johar's film My Name Is
   Khan as a text which, while discussing the consequences of the American
   war on terror on its minorities, problematises the official discourse on
   terrorism and its neo-Orientalist character. It also draws a parallel
   between the situation of minorities in the United States and India. In
   so doing, the film triggers a reflection on the state of the Indian
   nation and questions the state of the secularist values of newly
   independent India after decades of communal violence.},

Abstract = {While much scholarly attention has focused on the determinants of
   women's presence in state and national political offices, relatively
   little is known about women's descriptive representation at the local
   level. This study seeks to address the continuing gap in inquiry by
   examining where women run for and win seats on local legislative bodies
   throughout Louisiana. We develop hypotheses about the effects of the
   local strategic context on women's representation and expand on existing
   research by examining both place and county offices over a period of
   nearly three decades. Modeling candidate emergence and success
   endogenously, we find that more women run in localities where the
   strategic context is favorable to them and confirm that more women win
   when they have the resources necessary to propel their campaigns. The
   results suggest that the gender gap in local political representation
   can be lessened by building more robust networks of female leaders,
   enhancing partisan competition, and stimulating women in the electorate
   to support women's candidacies.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the challenges of social protest in case of a
   possible post-conflict in Colombia. In a post-conflict scenario, which
   aims for the consolidation of democracy and the exclusion of violence as
   a legitimate way to make politics, it is necessary to put an end to the
   counterinsurgency legacy of the Cold War, promote a political culture
   that assumes the protest as a legitimate exercise of a right and not as
   an internal threat, de-privatize policing and end paramilitarism in all
   its forms, demilitarize the police and connect the legal framework to
   the reasonable needs of the right to protest.},

Title = {Welfare Effort and Poverty from the Monetary and Capabilities Approach:
   A Cross-Country Analysis in Latin American and the Caribbean (1990-2010)},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},

Volume = {52},

Abstract = {There is abundant empirical evidence on the negative relationship
   between welfare effort and poverty. However, poverty indicators
   traditionally used have been representative of the monetary approach,
   excluding its multidimensional reality from the analysis. Using three
   regression techniques for the period 1990-2010 and controlling for
   demographic and cyclical factors, this paper examines the relationship
   between social spending per capita-as the indicator of welfare
   effort-and poverty in up to 21 countries of the region. The proportion
   of the population with an income below its national basic basket of
   goods and services (PM1) and the proportion of population with an income
   below 50\% of the median income per capita (PM2) were the two poverty
   indicators considered from the monetarist approach to measure poverty.
   From the capability approach the proportion of the population with food
   inadequacy (PC1) and the proportion of the population without access to
   improved water sources or sanitation facilities (PC2) were used. The
   findings confirm that social spending is actually useful to explain
   changes in poverty (PM1, PC1 and PC2), as there is a high negative and
   significant correlation between the variables before and after
   controlling for demographic and cyclical factors. In two regression
   techniques, social spending per capita did not show a negative
   relationship with the PM2. Countries with greater welfare effort for the
   period 1990-2010 were not necessarily those with the lowest level of
   poverty. Ultimately social spending per capita was more useful to
   explain changes in poverty from the capability approach.},

Title = {Labouring in the Shadow of the British Political Tradition: The Dilemma

Volume = {86},

Abstract = {The British state is in flux and the Labour party is struggling to shape
   an effective response to the politics of disunification. This article
   reflects on the nature of Labour's governing project and its conception
   of modern statecraft which has evolved since the party became a serious
   contender for power in the aftermath of the First World War. We argue
   that Labour's initially pluralising instincts cultivated in opposition
   have been checked by the ongoing reality of a state-centric mode of
   governing, in which the party continued to robustly defend the
   Westminster model operating within the parameters established by the
   British Political Tradition (BPT). Ed Miliband's conception of One
   Nation' Labour threatens to reinforce this historical pattern of
   reversion to the Westminster model, at precisely the moment when
   devolutionary forces are destabilising the existing political
   settlement. To break out of this impasse, Labour must look elsewhere in
   its ideological lexicon for inspiration, chiefly to the tradition of
   socialist pluralism and associationalism.},

   highlights that relations between the United States and the region of
   Latin America are related to the USA's investments and trade as well as
   to a whole range of problems such as terrorists, crime and refugees.
   According to the author there are four fundamental challenges in Latin
   America and the Caribbean: organized crime, Islamic radicalism, Russia
   and China. The author examines in detail these challenges and analyses
   their influence in the region on the United States. Furthermore, the
   author stresses that the USA should take necessary measures and develop
   further strategy to improve the relations with Latin-American countries.},

Abstract = {This article critically analyses the securitisation of Islam post-9/11
   in the US and argues that this securitisation is a remote securitisation
   whereby the securitisers - the security practitioners - are placed at a
   distance from the securitisees - the Muslim community. This is achieved
   through two processes of security practice: linguistically by
   euphemising language and using metaphors, and analytically by
   understanding radicalisation through a rationalist perspective, which
   follows the ``logic of expected consequences{''}. This article further
   problematises the rationalist view of radicalisation in the
   counterterrorism sector in the US and concludes by introducing a
   Bourdieusan concept of relationality to critical counter-radicalisation
   studies.},

Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {298-317},
Abstract = {The articles interrogates the relationship between democratization and
   people power in Nigeria. It argues that the broadening of the Nigerian
   public sphere has not led to reciprocal development of democratic
   principles and practice. As civilian rule reigns and economic growth is
   reported, Nigeria's democratization is fraught with many challenges.
   Democratization remains questionable in Nigeria; it is rudimentary and
   distorted by irregularities. These have had implications for national
   development and human securities as the poverty level worsens and
   acclaimed economic growth and ``democratic dividends{''} fail to enhance
   Nigerians' quality of life. The trivialization of democratization raises
   critical questions about its state and relevance to Nigerians and the
   Nigerian state. Is Nigeria democratizing or de-democratizing? How does
   the democratization process bring the Nigerian people closer to state (
   power)? How has it helped their developmental quests? The article
   contends that Nigeria's democratization process is indeed on trial. As
   Ake argues, Nigerian state democratization does not only trivialize the
   essence of democracy-it also continues to reverse the democratization
   process. Against this background, the article concludes that the
   democratization process in Nigeria requires elite political will and
   people's consciousness to advance to the next stage for better
   democratic consolidated and economic development relevant to Nigerians.},

Abstract = {In this paper I advocate a left-libertarian approach to egalitarian
   world ownership that combines common ownership of land, following Henry
   George (where private appropriation is subject to the payment of rent),
   with joint ownership of finite and exhaustible resources such as oil
   (where use is subject to a collective decision-making process and tax
   paid at the point of extraction). This rent and tax together create a
   common fund available for global distribution. I argue that this
   approach offers improvements on Hillel Steiner's proposal for a global
   fund, and Thomas Pogge's proposal for a Global Resources Dividend (GRD)
   since it does not penalize states for the inclusion of valuable
   resources within their territory that are not being used, while it also
   does not allow states to benefit from the use of resources elsewhere
   while simultaneously refusing to exploit the resources within their own
   borders. Moreover, joint ownership need not conflict with the
   libertarian commitment to self-ownership, as is often thought to be the
   case, and when supplementing common ownership of land it can provide an
   egalitarian outcome as well as greater protection for future generations
   and the environment.},

Abstract = {The article attempts to construct an operational model of regional
   political regimes based on the synthesis of a number of new approaches
   in comparative politics and political regionalism. On the basis of the
   multidimensional models of subnational regimes elaborated by R.Turovsky
   and S.Mazzuca, Yu.Gaivoronsky suggests that the transformation of
   regional polities should be measured along three vectors:
   ``dependence{''}, ``authoritarianism{''}, and ``patrimonialism{''}. The
   multidimensionality of the model allows us to analyze regional regimes
   in greater detail. Moreover, in contrast to most of the existing
   indexes, the model makes use of verifiable data rather than expert
   evaluations. The empirical testing of the model on the data from the
   Russian regions reveals its validity and the possibility of its
   application for political studies.},

Title = {Foreign-Born Voting Behavior in Local Elections: Evidence From New
   Immigrant Destinations},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1},
Pages = {27-58},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Approximately half of immigrants to the United States are now settling
   directly in cities and towns with little prior history of immigration.
   Because this dispersed settlement pattern is so recent, we know little
   about the political behavior of naturalized citizens in these new
   immigrant destinations. This article begins to fill this gap by
   exploring the determinants of foreign-born voting in municipal elections
   using a new dataset that combines official voting information from the
   state of Utah with demographic information about Utah residents from the
   Utah Population Database (UPDB). We hypothesize that in addition to
   individual-level predictors of prior experience with democratic politics
   and community attachment, the size of cities and their form of
   government will also affect the likelihood that foreign-born citizens
   will turn out to vote in local elections. We use multilevel modeling
   techniques to test these hypotheses and find that prior experience with
   democratic politics, whether in the United States or in their home
   country, along with the city-level characteristics of city size and form
   of government, are powerful predictors of foreign-born voting in local
   elections. Moreover, we find that while large cities experience lower
   levels of turnout for all citizens, the negative effect on participation
   is strongest for foreign-born citizens.},

Title = {The contingencies of power: reformulating Foucault},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {411-429},
Abstract = {In a critique of Michel Foucault's understanding of power relations,
   Andrew Sayer outlined an alternative that was both more conceptually
   rigorous and offered a clearer analytical framework with which to
   approach the analysis of power. Part of Sayer's development was to
   distinguish not only between the holding and the operating of power(s),
   but also the three contingencies that always exist alongside power( s).
   The paper argues that Sayer's critique of Foucault, while a welcome
   theoretical clarification, partially mistakes Foucault's project (which
   was to analyse power `as is', not power `in the abstract') and also
   misses some of Foucault's own clarifications to his understanding of
   power. The paper develops Sayer's position by integrating important
   elements of Foucault's approach - namely his concept of `dispositif' -
   that illustrate Foucault's more nuanced understanding of power. This is
   developed by arguing that there is, in fact, a fourth level of
   contingency that Sayer does not articulate. The paper uses De-facing
   Power, an early work of Clarissa Hayward, to illustrate how a combined
   `Foucaultian/Sayerian' model of power and contingency can give extra
   explanatory and analytical strength. The outcome of the article's
   argument is that contingency ceases to be a `problem' in social
   scientific research; instead it becomes the raison d'etre for social
   scientific explanation.},

Abstract = {The text examines the electoral rise of the Sweden Democrats party
   between 2010-2014. Based on the theoretical assumptions of the concept
   of political opportunity structures, the authors analyse exit polls data
   to explain the factors that contributed to the unprecedented rise of
   populist radical right in Sweden. The authors conclude that the 2014
   elections took place in the context favorable for the rise of Sweden
   Democrats, mainly due to higher salience of immigration, law and order
   and relatively weak ties between voters and political parties. Moreover,
   the level of trust towards politicians remained quite low during the
   period under investigation. Furthermore, the profile of voters of Sweden
   Democrats underwent significant changes, especially when age and
   political orientation of voters is taken into consideratio. In contrast
   to the 2010 elections, the voters of Sweden Democrats were older and
   more centrist in 2014.},

Abstract = {In April 2011, a large consortium of European rail and security
   suppliers, transport operators and research organisations launched the
   Secured Urban Transportation European Demonstration (SECUR-ED) project
   with the objective of providing public transport operators with the
   means to enhance urban transport security. Drawing on a detailed study
   of the SECUR-ED project, this article examines the way in which the
   problem of urban transport security has been addressed in Europe. It
   analyses the SECUR-ED project as a performative space, in which risks
   and capabilities are identified, enacted and contested, and relations
   across public and private actors are forged. Combining the literature on
   the performativity of security with John Law's work on ``the
   project{''}, the article proceeds by assessing how, in the context of
   SECURED, connections and continuities are performed across European
   differences and across public-private space. Hence, it argues that the
   main function of the project was precisely this: to enact a common
   security culture, outlook or network in the realm of mass transportation
   in Europe. This is not a stable culture, but one that is subject to
   multiple possibilities for re-articulation and mis-performing. The
   article aims to engage with these moments of re-articulation by focusing
   on the situated practices of mass transport security. It concludes with
   a critical analysis of the broader European Union project for security
   research under the Seventh Framework Programme.},

Journal = {SECURITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {33-47},
Abstract = {Ever since negotiations on the Helsinki Final Act opened in Helsinki in
   1973, the United States has regarded the Conference (later Organization)
   on Security and Co-operation in Europe with some ambivalence. The role
   of the Helsinki Final Act in establishing a normative regime that
   contributed significantly to undermining the authoritarian regimes in
   the former Warsaw Pact countries, eventually bringing an end to the Cold
   War, is widely recognized and appreciated in the United States. However,
   the expanded post-Cold War role of the OSCE has received less attention
   in us foreign policy and, with respect to issues of European security,
   has clearly been assigned a secondary role in that policy behind the
   NATO Alliance. Those knowledgeable about the OSCE in the United States
   widely regard its role in positive terms on issues such as human rights,
   rights of persons belonging to minorities, rule of law, election
   monitoring and other ``soft{''} security issues. However, the OSCE role
   in ``hard{''} security issues has been given little attention and
   receives only limited support, due largely to its inability to achieve
   consensus on most serious security problems and its lack of resources to
   effectively implement those decisions that it takes. Nevertheless, the
   recent crisis in Ukraine has awakened us interest in the OSCE as the
   institutional framework best able to manage that crisis. The challenge
   for the German Chairmanship in 2016 will be to build upon this renewed
   us attention to the OSCE's role in ``hard{''} security issues, in
   promoting negotiated resolutions to this and other stalemated
   -conflicts, in rebuilding the badly damaged regime of
   confidence-building measures and conventional arms control, as well as
   responding, within the multilateral OSCE framework, to new security
   threats, such as cyber warfare and countering violent extremism.},

Abstract = {This chapter lays out a perspective on the research project that
   produced the 12 chapters presented in this book. How to perform
   political theory after the postcolonial critique, and in doing so
   contribute to the decentring of Euro-American political theory, is a
   question that troubles many scholars today. This chapter argues that a
   performative political theory must not only attend to the origins but
   also the workings of institutions by studying how both political
   theorists and political theories are embedded in them. The book is a
   response to the question of how to perform political theory by taking
   one essential institution - citizenship - and focusing on its workings.},

Abstract = {The issue of humanitarian intervention has been for a long time a very
   hot topic not only in the area of international law, but also in state
   practise as well. These two fields do not always pursue the same
   direction when dealing with gross violations of human rights and the
   problem of pursuing national interest enters the game as well. This
   paper deals with the concept of humanitarian intervention based on the
   just war theory and liberal approach underlining the significant role
   played by international and regional organisation in the area of human
   rights protection. The paper examines the role of the UN, especially the
   UN SC and its resolutions in deciding on humanitarian intervention,
   which many times indicate the dangerous situation, however, were not
   followed by the one under Chapter VII that would justify the use of all
   necessary means. This was the case also during Kosovar war. Following
   the international failure in Bosnia and death of 8000 Muslim men in
   Srebrenica, Kosovo became next area where identity and religious
   differences contributed to civil war between nationalistic Serbs and
   Kosovar Albanians fighting for independence. The war in Kosovo
   represents a milestone in the area of peace-making, peacekeeping or
   peacebuilding when the multinational force established under NATO's flag
   bombed the area without the UN SC approval, thus violating international
   law. However, in this case the role of mass human rights abuses enters
   the game and provides ethical justification for such action.},

Abstract = {Guillermo O'Donnell and Philippe Schmitter's Tentative Conclusions about
   Uncertain Democracies is one of the most influential texts on the study
   of democratic transitions in contemporary political science.
   Nevertheless, while O'Donnell and Schmitter emphasized the provisional,
   contingent, and uncertain character of their reflections on regime
   change, later scholars constructed a discourse of ``transitology,{''}
   which theorized about regime change more broadly and which, thereby,
   overlooked a key component of the two authors' original work-its
   tentative character as an intervention in a complex and rapidly changing
   situation. This article highlights the tensions between O'Donnell and
   Schmitter's normative and political intervention into a historically
   uncertain period, and the subsequent research on transitions. Through a
   review of the volume, the article illuminates the relation of normative
   political practice to social scientific inquiry in the field of
   democratization.},

Journal = {NEW PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {127-157},
Abstract = {This intervention argues that NATOneeds a new strategy towards Russia.
   The current strategy is imbalanced because it over-emphasizes power and
   risks negatively affecting the European security order. A new strategy
   should recall the 1967 Harmel Report, which successfully combined the
   security elements of power, order, and liberal values. Today, such a
   balanced strategy is again needed. A new Harmel strategy (Harmel 2.0)
   should, like its predecessor, rely on a combination of deterrence and
   engagement. This intervention thus argues that in the realm of power,
   NATO needs to respond to Russia's hybrid warfare threats with
   conventional reassurance and societal soft power measures and that
   securing the Allies' economic vulnerabilities while leaving NATO's
   current nuclear posture untouched will also be crucial. In the realm of
   order, NATO needs to re-engage on cooperative security and the
   instruments of arms control, and it is argued that a pause to further
   NATOenlargement would be helpful. Finally, in the realmof liberal
   values, the Allies should lower their expectations as a gesture of
   recognition that they cannot change the domestic situation in Russia in
   the short term, but they should address the attitudes of certain member
   states in that realm. In order to succeed with such a multi-pronged
   strategy, the Allies need to better coordinate their policies in the
   OSCE and amongst EU countries.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on three mechanisms to explain the rise of populist
   movements across Europe. They are politicization of resentment,
   exploitation of social cleavages, and polarization of resentment and
   feelings of non-representation. We conceptualize populism as a strategic
   power game aiming to transform potential majorities into real ones by
   creating or reframing social cleavages. Our theoretical model is used to
   explain the rise of the Five Star Movement (M5S). Beppe Grillo's M5S
   gained notoriety on the national political scene in Italy just before
   the 2013 elections and succeeded in getting nearly 25 percent of the
   overall vote. Moreover, it was the only political force that was able to
   attract votes across the different regions in Italy, making it the
   country's only truly national party.},

Title = {Constraining Political Transformation: The Two Faces of Activist
   Religious Organizations in the Search for a New Constitution in Kenya},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},

Pages = {348-365},
Abstract = {Religious organizations are key structural components of Kenyan civil
   society that have played or continue to play a critical role in
   socio-political developments. In the last two and half decades
   especially, religious institutions have been among the principal actors
   shaping the mechanics and trajectories of Kenya's political order. But
   religious organizations' political behaviour, especially in the
   country's search for a new constitution, was contentious and remarkably
   inconsistent. There were moments of progressive actions but also
   behaviour that imperilled progress. This article probes this ambivalence
   of Kenyan faith groups in the struggles for a new constitution. It is
   argued that their political behavioural inconsistencies largely reflect
   an ethnic, class and, to a lesser extent, instrumentalized doctrinal or
   denominational schism that is ever present in the wider Kenyan society.
   By analysing how religious leaders and their organizations challenged
   political elite domination while remaining amenable to its influence,
   this article illustrates the contradictions of elite pacts in these
   struggles and how they constrained progressive transformation.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},

Number = {3},
Pages = {719-739},
Abstract = {This article first summarizes the structural reforms of pensions (total
   or partial privatization) in Latin America and Central and Eastern
   Europe, identifying their advantages and disadvantages, and does the
   same with the international process of re-reforms of pensions with a
   greater role of the state. Second, chooses Chile as a case study, as a
   world pioneer in both types of reforms; describes their characteristics
   and effects on social welfare of the structural reform of 1981 and the
   re-reform of 2008. Such effects are evaluated based on ten basic
   principles of social security from the International Labour Office
   (ILO): 1) social dialogue to approve the reforms, 2) universal coverage
   of the population, 3) equal treatment of insured persons, 4) social
   solidarity, 5) gender equity, 6) sufficiency of benefits, 7) efficiency
   and reasonable administrative cost, 8) social participation in the
   management of the system, 9) role of the state and supervision, and 10)
   financial sustainability. Third, it summarizes the advantages and
   disadvantages-challenges of the re-reform and informs on the current
   debate for further reforms.},

Abstract = {The Coalition took office in 2010 in what seemed to be a relatively
   benign foreign policy environment. Since then, the international
   environment has become far more treacherous and the government has
   considered war on humanitarian grounds on three occasions. In light of
   the silence of early Coalition documents on humanitarian intervention,
   together with the two parties' different positions on the issue, this
   article assesses the extent to which the Coalition has adopted a
   distinctive approach to humanitarian intervention. In so doing, it
   evaluates the relative importance of Conservative and Liberal Democrat
   traditions in determining the direction of Coalition foreign policy. The
   article also considers whether there are other, more pertinent factors
   driving foreign policy, and offers an explanation for its relative
   isolation from coalition tensions. It concludes by reflecting on the
   likely future of humanitarian intervention after the May 2015 general
   election.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {391-404},
Abstract = {Scholars argue that mass media appeals and other examples of
   communications that provide ``noticeable reminders'' to vote should
   elevate voter turnout (Dale and Strauss 2009), but a wide range of field
   experimental studies show that messages delivered via untargeted and
   impersonal means (such as mass media) are ineffective (Green and Gerber
   2008). We test these competing hypotheses in a randomized, mass media
   field experiment using billboard advertisements to mobilize
   participation in local elections taking place in November 2007. Despite
   that outdoor advertising is commonly used in political campaigns to
   widely reach citizens, no study of which we are aware has experimentally
   tested the causal effects of billboard advertising on voter turnout. Our
   findings suggest that billboards are ineffective in generating higher
   levels of voter turnout. We discuss these results in comparison with
   other mass media advertisements and other get-out-the-vote methods.
   Experimental replication and extension is necessary to probe further the
   impact of outdoor advertising on voting behavior.},

Abstract = {This text is a revised version of the Kapuscinki Development Lecture
   that the author delivered in May 2015 in Bucharest and later updated
   after the COP21 December 2015 summit in Paris. It presents a critical
   assessment of the new global agenda on development - the Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs). The most important criticism is that, like in
   the case of the Millennium Development Goals, there is insufficient
   specificity about who is supposed to do what in order to realize these
   goals. The other criticisms address the definitions and the measurement
   procedures, the sustainability of the SDGs, the SDGs' treatment of
   inequality, and the SDGs' lack of attention to structural or
   institutional reforms. Tying everything together, it finally argues why
   the SDGs may be understood as brilliant propaganda.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},

Abstract = {The author of the review analyzes a new book by a political sociologist
   Chimiza Lamazhaa ``Archaization society. Tuvan phenomenon{''} (St.
   Petersburg, 2013), which reveals the place and role of archaisms in the
   process of social transformations. Specific effects of archaization are
   described in detail with the Republic of Tuva as an example; its past
   and present history are also discussed. This book convincingly shows
   that connection between the past, present, and future is a significant
   and even universal philosophical and general political problem actively
   discussed throughout the history of philosophy. Applied to Tuvan
   society, this actualization turns out to be exceptionally actual and is
   especially enhanced during periods of transformational changes. Ch.
   Lamazaa credibly demonstrates that the increased interest in historical
   memory is one of the essential characteristics of a modern society. Not
   long ago, the modernization process was assumed by many researchers as a
   rejection of the heritage of the past. Now a belief is growing that it
   is impossible to understand our present and future without our past.},

Title = {Neuropolitics: Applicability of advanced imaging techniques for
   the study of political attitudes and voting behavior},
Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2015},
Number = {50},
Pages = {191+},
Abstract = {During the past years neurosciences had great impact on our
   understanding of decision-making and underlined the pivotal role of
   emotions in this process. Advanced imaging techniques are also of
   interest for political science in order to improve our knowledge about
   special themes like voting behavior or political attitudes. This review
   gives an introduction to several studies using neuroimaging techniques
   for scientific political questions. After a short overview about the
   basics of the human brain, the imaging methods will be explained with
   special focus on their applicability and their limitations in political
   science. The presented studies focus on two main aspects: political
   attitudes and voting-behavior.},

Abstract = {By studying discursive productions in certain popular movements, I would
   like to examine in this text the way in which these movements vindicate,
   in their transformative practices, a right that cannot be reduced to the
   instituted rights in a legal sense, nor interpreted in accordance with a
   merely reformist comprehension of political action. I thus seek to
   define a ``right that is not a right{''}. This right is essential in
   showing how these actions can be the site of processes of political
   subjectivation from which there can emerge both polemical instances of
   disidentification and other forms of being-together that could be
   considered simultaneously dissensual and ``experimental{''}.},

Abstract = {The deficit of democracy in the European Union (EU) explains the
   widening gap between EU citizens and the EU ideas and structures. This
   fact leads to a situation in which citizens' opinions are not taken into
   consideration by the supranational bodies. This pattern will continue
   until the average EU citizen will be able to intervene directly in the
   policy-making processes of the EU in a more significant way. Citizens'
   confidence in the EU has eroded largely since the Maastricht Treaty.
   Furthermore, it is an ongoing process that will not be countered until
   the deficit of democracy in the EU will be effectively confronted. The
   EU will never be considered as a real union and a fully democratic
   structure without the active participation of citizens in the
   configuration of the political agenda and over the control of the
   governmental implementation.},

Title = {Does Spoiling Work? Assessing the Impact of Spoilers on Civil War Peace
   Agreements},
Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {89-111},
Abstract = {Scholars and policymakers argue that violent actors - termed `spoilers'
   pose a significant threat to civil war peace agreements. Yet existing
   research, which is overly reliant on single-case studies, has not
   effectively determined how prevalent spoiling is, or thoroughly examined
   what its ultimate effects are on peace agreements. This article draws on
   a newly constructed cross-national dataset of spoiling following 241
   civil war peace agreements in the post-Cold War era to analyze spoiling.
   It finds that spoiling intended to terminate an agreement is not as
   common as typically assumed, but still plagues a sizeable number of
   peace agreements. Moreover, most actors who resort to this strategy
   typically fail in their goals and the agreement is not at risk, despite
   the high publicity and attention given to these threats. Yet particular
   types of actors, most notably paramilitaries and state security forces
   excluded from the agreement, can pose a significant threat to peace.},

Abstract = {Research on the relationship between territorial disputes, militarized
   conflict, and economic integration occurs at the intersection of two
   large research programs in international relations: one linking
   territorial disputes to violence, and another exploring the effects of
   conflict on trade and vice versa. Although we know that territorial
   disputes fuel conflict and that conflict dampens trade, we know less
   about whether the prospects of economic gains contribute to the
   settlement of disputes and subsequent compliance with those settlements.
   I argue that research in this area could profitably adopt an emerging
   view of borders as institutions that not only distribute territory but
   also allow cooperation and the production of joint gains. This review
   identifies gaps in the existing literature on the resolution of
   territorial disputes and helps to reframe a persistent methodological
   challenge in this area: missing and noisy data on trade flows.},

Abstract = {Whether urbanisation promotes or inhibits the risk of civil war is
   disputed: while case studies usually support the former, quantitative
   investigations have found either the latter or no significant
   correlation at all. I argue that this contradiction is due to a
   conceptual and operational over-aggregation of urbanisation, ignoring
   its intrastate variation. I claim that a high relative concentration of
   the urban population and political, economic and social institutions in
   the largest city - so-called metropolisation - can increase both the
   motivation for and the feasibility of rebellion in a country.
   Triangulating case study evidence with a quantitative cross-national
   time series design, I show that metropolisation significantly and
   robustly increases the risk of governmental conflict in particular and
   hence civil war in general.},

Pages = {175-193},

Abstract = {Restrictions to media freedom, in the form of repressive defamation
   legislation, are thought to affect the amount of information about
   corruption that the media report. Exploiting variation in regulation of
   speech across states in a federal country, Mexico, and using a novel
   data set based on content analysis of the local press, I estimate the
   effect of lack of freedom on the coverage devoted to acts of malfeasance
   by public officials. Corruption receives significantly less attention in
   states with a more repressive defamation law. Instrumental variable
   models corroborate the interpretation of the negative association
   between regulation and coverage as a causal chilling effect.},

Journal = {POLITIX},

Volume = {28},
Number = {112},
Pages = {83+},
Abstract = {The application of Burstin's concept of protagonism to the events of
   1848 is complicated by the much shorter time frame and equivocal outcome
   of the February revolution. Not a single one of the principal actors
   fully corresponds to the model that Burstin has so skillfully described
   for 1789, in part because the Great Revolution and the decades of social
   turmoil that followed so dramatically transformed the consciousness of
   subsequent generations of political activists. The parallel between
   protagonism and the notion of the ``repertoire of contention{''} is
   briefly explored, along with reflections on how profoundly and
   permanently the context for revolutionary action was changed by the
   experience of 1789.},

   of learning to live with differences. Harmonization practices such as
   concerted adjustment and reasonable accommodation are some of the
   mechanisms proposed by cultural diversity management policies to deal
   with this contemporary situation. In the case of reasonable
   accommodation, this practice can be justified not only because it is
   based on a recognition of equality in difference, but also on a belief

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2015},
Number = {5},
Pages = {145-159},
Abstract = {The author substantiates the necessity of development of the `science of
   the critical states' of a society and its cities as an integrated branch
   of interdisciplinary knowledge and know-how. Recently, the situation of
   a critical, that is, urgent state has become a normal modus vivendi of
   various communities and societies across the world. The economic and/or
   political crises come up and down but the critical areas are still
   mushroomed elsewhere. The theoretical and methodological basement of
   this new branch of science is the concept of `society of all-embracing
   risk' proposed and developed by the author in 1980-90s. The subject
   matter of the proposed complex discipline is the forces which generate
   the critical situations; their disposition, resources and strength;
   their values, strategies, tactics and action repertoire; an
   environmental dimension of the emergence and evolution of such
   situations; a changing quality of social capital of affected people,
   local and abroad; and characteristics of post-critical states and
   politics of their rehabilitation. The indispensable prerequisites for
   the establishing of such discipline are as follows: full-time

Abstract = {Reflections on political systems are necessarily based on some sort of
   model of political man - an individual who thinks, decides, discusses,
   and participates in politics. This paper offers a review of modern
   conceptions of political man structured in five models. The personality
   model highlights the importance of childhood experiences for political
   behavior and belief in adulthood; the sociological model highlights the
   importance of primary and interest groups; the sociopsychological model
   highlights the importance of party identification; the rational-economic
   model highlights the efficiency of thought and self-interest; while the
   cognitive model highlights the citizens' mental capabilities. The main
   assumptions, methodology, and findings for each model are presented in
   the paper. Also, implications for democratic processes for each model
   are explained. The conclusion offers a critical survey of the current
   state of research on political man, as well as recommendations for
   further research.},

Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between the State and religion in
   Great Britain. After summarizing the key features of the constitution of
   the UK and discussing the evolving relations between Church and State,
   the article describes the religious landscape both in general and in
   terms of minority religious groups, focusing on Muslims (the second
   largest religious group in Britain after Christians). The main features
   of British law pertaining to religion are then discussed, followed by an
   assessment of the impact of religion on education in terms of the
   ownership and management of schools, religious education and religious
   worship. The concluding section reflects on the main debates and

Abstract = {This article examines the factors that shape parties' motivation to
   invest time and other resources in scrutinizing European Union policy
   proposals. We distinguish between two different motivations to engage in
   scrutiny activities. First, parties use such mechanisms to influence the
   national position directly. Second, parties play a two-level game and
   use scrutiny to manipulate their negotiator's domestic constraints. Both
   arguments depend on a set of conditions, namely the government's
   relative strength in Brussels, the transparency of the European Union
   decision-making process as well as the government's relative strength
   and cohesion in the domestic arena. On the empirical side, we study
   scrutiny at the level of committees in the national parliaments of
   Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Slovakia, and the
   United Kingdom over a 13-year period, during which 32 governments are
   covered. Our findings suggest that parties deploy scrutiny to shift the
   domestic constraint strategically, but only if such a shift can be
   communicated convincingly to the international bargaining partners.
   Moreover, our findings suggest that opposition parties employ such
   measures to influence the position of a weak government.},

Abstract = {In this conclusion, I attempt to provide a synthesis of the findings of
   this superb set of papers and put them into a broader perspective. For
   this purpose, I also rely on some other more recent assessments of Swiss
   politics - in particular on Sciarini, Fischer and Traber's (2015)
   replication of my own study of Swiss politics in the 1970s, which covers
   the most important political decision-making processes of 2000-2006, and
   on a recent special issue of the Swiss Political Science Review (SPSR
   2014) that is dedicated to the 2011 Swiss Elections. I proceed in four
   steps: first, I discuss the guiding theme of this collection of papers -
   the increasing party competition and the related polarization of Swiss
   politics, as well as the drivers of this development. Then, I turn to
   the consequences of this development for Swiss politics and Swiss
   policies. I conclude with a summary discussion, where I draw attention
   to the forgotten elephant in the room - the Great Recession and the
   Euro-crisis.},

Abstract = {Water security has become one of the most important topics in China's
   relations with neighboring countries. Currently, there is an asymmetric
   interdependence and a structure of ``low conflict and low
   cooperation{''} between China and neighboring countries, which leads to
   a sense of insecurity over the water resource utilization. Consequently,
   some of these countries are trying to form a potentially strategic
   alliance with other countries outside the region to contain China's
   ``water power,{''} which will exert negative impact on China's
   relationship with these neighboring countries and change the overall
   security environment on China's peripheries. In the future, however,
   China's strategic advantage on water resources could serve as the basis
   of diplomatic breakthroughs to promote regional water governance in
   alignment with China's national interest. China should take advantage of
   its strategic position as the ``Water Tower in Asia{''} to formulate a
   water resource security strategy, establish feasible sharing and
   compensation mechanisms, and create new arenas for its neighboring
   diplomacy.},

Abstract = {Before the welfare state, people were protected from disabilities
   resulting from illness, old age, and other infirmities by care work
   provided within the family. When the state assumes responsibility for
   care-work tasks, in effect it assumes parental roles, thereby becoming a
   form of familial government in which the public provision of goods and
   services is analogous to care work provided in the family. My research
   pushes back the origins of the state's obligation to care for people to
   a preindustrial form of government, hereditary monarchieswhat Max Weber
   termed patrimonialism. It explicates how monarchs were cast as the
   parents of the people, thereby constituting kingship as a care work
   regime that assigned to political rulers parental responsibility for the
   welfare of the people. Using historical and quantitative analysis, I
   establish that retaining the legitimacy of monarchies as the first form
   of familial government in the course of Western European democratizing
   makes it more credible to the public and to political elites to accept
   the welfare state as the second form of familial government. That, in
   turn, promotes a more robust public sector supportive of social
   provision. The results reformulate conceptions of the contemporary
   welfare state and its developmental legacies.},

Abstract = {China's rapid rise has characterized the decades since the end of the
   Cold War. China's growing comprehensive power has obviously given it
   more leverage and resources to pursue its goals and national interests.
   However, more power does not naturally translate into more security. To
   a great extent, China is facing a paradox between its security
   governance and increasingly broadened and complicated security agenda.
   Against this background, there are some changes in China's security
   governance approach which are seen by some observers as China's attempt
   to seek global hegemony and expansion. The author argues in this article
   that China's security practice still remarkably maintains its continuity
   and stability with Chinese characteristics and is mainly driven by the
   needs of its own development rather than an ambition for global
   hegemony.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},

Volume = {43},

Pages = {975-998},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Recent studies in political psychology report a significant association
   between personality traits and ordinary citizens' attitudes and
   behaviors in the political arena. A growing body of literature examines
   the influence of personality on individuals' attachment to a political
   party and vote choice in electoral settings. In line with these studies,
   we analyze the relationship between personality traits and correct
   voting, i.e., the extent to which citizens vote in accordance with their
   own preferences and values. Using a large-scale national survey fielded
   in the context of the 2008 presidential election, we find that, after
   controlling for well-known predictors of correct voting, some of
   personality traits not only exert a direct influence on correct voting,
   but also moderate the effect of strength of party identification, a
   well-established determinant of correct voting. These findings provide
   new evidence for the idea that individual differences such as
   dispositional personality traits are deeply intertwined with both vote
   choice and democratic representation.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the European Neighborhood Policy is
   characterized by normative imperialism. The EU's institutional set-up
   implies a specific logic of external behavior which differs
   significantly from conventional state foreign policy, as empires need to
   provide their large polity' with a sense of community. The argument
   offers an explanation to the question why the EU needs to adopt a
   normative agenda in external relations. The article continues to briefly
   assess three EU neighborhoods. In Eastern Europe, the EU's approach had
   to fail, being based on deficient assumptions about political realities
   in the EaP states and underestimating the antagonistic relations with
   Russia.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine whether there is a difference
   between female abstinents in Bosnia and Herzegovina in terms of certain
   demographics (age, education, rural-urban, party and ethnicity) and
   socio-psychological characteristics (interest in politics, the ways of
   getting their information about politics, trust in institutions,
   dogmatism, nationalism, cosmopolitanism, the end justifies the means,
   the attitude towards the leader, conservatism, liberalism and
   authoritarianism). The study was conducted in the first half of March
   2013, on a sample of 483 adult women who did not plan to vote in the
   upcoming elections, who in the past six years (three election cycles)
   either voted occasionally, or they voted, but have no intention of
   voting again, or they have never voted. We started from the assumption
   that the different modes of political abstinence differ with respect to
   the measured variables. The results show that the three categories of
   women abstinents differ in terms of certain socio-demographic variables:
   age, education, ethnicity, party affiliation and religious beliefs.
   There are differences among respondents concerning political interests.
   The greatest interest was found among the respondents who manipulate
   their turning out to the polls, followed by those who were disappointed
   in the elections, while the slightest interest in politics was among the
   respondents who have never voted. Television is still the dominant
   medium for getting information about political events, the second and
   third ones are newspapers and radio, but they are much less influential.
   Yet among the three categories of women abstinents significant
   differences were found only regarding television and radio. Three
   categories of women abstinents differ only in cosmopolitanism and
   liberalism variables. There is a difference between women abstinents in
   their confidence in institutions. The most trust in institutions is
   found in women who occasionally took part in the elections, followed by
   those who voted, but no longer do so. The least trust in institutions is
   found among women who have never voted.},

Abstract = {This study develops a political competition model in which campaign
   platforms are partially binding. A candidate who implements a policy
   that differs from his/her platform must pay a cost of betrayal, which
   increases with the size of the discrepancy. I also assume that voters
   are uncertain about candidates' policy preferences. If voters believe
   that a candidate is likely to be extreme, there exists a semi-separating
   equilibrium: an extreme candidate imitates a moderate candidate, with
   some probability, and approaches the median policy with the remaining
   probability. Although an extreme candidate will implement a more extreme
   policy than a moderate candidate, regardless of imitation or approach,
   partial pooling ensures that voters prefer an extreme candidate who does
   not pretend to be moderate over an uncertain candidate who announces an
   extreme platform. As a result, a moderate candidate never has a higher
   probability of winning than an extreme candidate.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the debate in this journal about the state
   of British democracy. I criticise the tendency to use a demand-supply'
   dichotomy in interpreting the strong distrust experienced by
   institutions and politicians, and especially the idea that all the blame
   for current problems is to be attributed to the inadequateness of the
   British political tradition (BPT). By referring to international data on
   democracy and to recent British trends in both public attitudes and
   institutional innovations, a more nuanced picture on the state of
   democracy emerges. I argue that the BPT is not incompatible with
   incremental changes that have already introduced innovations in the way
   politics works in Britain today, and that the task of empowering
   citizens is one of the most delicate aspects in this process of
   innovation.},

Abstract = {Forced outside of the system of modern nation-states into a regime of
   detention and deportation, immigrant detainees suffer an injustice that
   is not easily or adequately captured by the familiar vocabulary offered
   by contemporary liberalism. In this article, I propose an alternative
   strategy for articulating the kinds of injustice that these individuals
   suffer. I argue that the idea of metaphysical homelessness-a notion that
   I recover through a reading of the work of Martin Heidegger-offers a
   useful theoretical lens with which to identify the kinds of harms
   perpetrated against immigrant detainees. Purged from the polis and
   shuttled instead into the realm of police, they are deprived of a home
   in the world. This strategy is deployed as part of what I call a
   politics of crisis containment, a kind of politics that ensues when
   states find themselves confronted by troublesome individuals whose
   presence is deemed a threat to the existence of the community.},

Journal = {POLITICAL QUARTERLY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {86},
Number = {4},
Pages = {563-572},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {This article examines the potential to tackle the roots of inequality by
   the introduction of one or more social wealth funds. Such funds would
   aim to capture some of the financial gains from the private ownership of
   capitala principal driver of inequalityand use the proceeds for wider
   community benefit, such as investment in social infrastructure. In
   recent decades a number of countries have introduced a variant on such
   funds, mostly taking the form of state-owned sovereign wealth funds
   resourced through the exploitation of oil, and used for a diversity of
   economic purposes. In contrast, the UK has failed to take the
   opportunity to create such funds by, for example, reinvesting the
   revenue from the sales of public assets. So would it be possible to
   build one or more such collectively owned funds in the UK, and if so,
   how should they be financed? As well as funding social investment and
   anti-inequality programmes, could such a scheme also help finance a
   regular Citizen's Dividend payment or a Citizen's Income scheme?},

Volume = {47},

Abstract = {This article attempts to understand Athenian anti-tyranny laws as
   offering a democratic response to emergency. These laws sought to
   promote the killing of ``tyrants{''} who overthrew the democracy and to
   punish those who collaborated with any non-democratic regime. I argue
   that the anti-tyranny laws reflect a broader series of measures enacted
   in the aftermath of the oligarchic coup of 411 BCE that sought to
   facilitate the collective action of the demos (people) as a means of
   maintaining and preserving Athenian democracy. Such legislation, I
   suggest, is best understood when situated within the context of a
   distinctly Athenian conception of the rule of law that viewed the
   relationship between the rule of law and popular sovereignty in
   recursive terms. The article places this Athenian response to emergency
   in dialogue with recent work on emergency politics in contemporary
   political theory.},

Abstract = {This study bases on the field research implemented in the summer of 2013
   in Italy/Milan on Turkish Migrants from Turkey, and it aims to analyse
   their experiences as international migrants from a multi-dimensional
   perspective. Eventhough migrants from Turkey in Milan do not form a
   large group, it still is possible to observe that their migration
   carries general characteristics of migrations in the global round of
   capitalism, and beyond that it is also possible to detect new trends in
   parallel to deepening world economic crisis. Italian economy went into
   deep recession in 2009 when worldwide economic crisis overlapped its
   own. This situation led migrant workers losing their jobs. Currently,
   not only comparatively new Turkish migrants but also migrants who spent
   some years in Milan cannot see a secure future there anymore and getting
   ready to migrate yet again. Protracted feature of migration is becoming
   increasingly salient in the recent years in parallel to the deepening
   world economic crisis and accelerating capital movements in addition to
   other features such as informal character of migration, the role of
   migrant trafficers, socio-spatial exclusion of migrants, citizenship and
   belonging and forming the most precarious part of working class.},

Abstract = {This article addresses competition over immigration in the Dutch and
   Flemish party systems. By looking at when, whether and how mainstream
   parties engage with immigration in each place, this article seeks to
   understand how parties compete on an issue under non-ownership
   conditions. Drawing on an analysis of party manifestos, it supports the
   concept of combined competence and positional competition, and of
   parties emphasizing immigration when they have a distinct position, and
   shows how the presence of intra-party tensions is relevant for
   understanding how parties choose to emphasize (or avoid) immigration as
   part of their electoral strategy. On the other hand, there is less
   support for the premise that party size predicts emphasis on
   immigration. These results are discussed with respect to the wider
   implications for understanding party strategies in Western Europe, and
   for the (party) politics of immigration specifically.},

Abstract = {While some believe that economic development prompts democratization,
   others contend that both result from distant historical causes. Using
   the most comprehensive estimates of national income available, I show
   that development is associated with more democratic governmentbut mostly
   in the medium run (10 to 20 years). This is because higher income tends
   to induce breakthroughs to more democratic politics only after an
   incumbent dictator leaves office. And in the short run, faster economic
   growth increases the ruler's survival odds. Leader turnover appears to
   matter because of selection: In authoritarian states, reformist leaders
   tend to either democratize or lose power relatively quickly, so
   long-serving leaders are rarely reformers. Autocrats also become less
   activist after their first year in office. This logic helps explain why
   dictators, concerned only to prolong their rule, often inadvertently
   prepare their countries for jumps to democracy after they leave the
   scene.},

Abstract = {Since 1989, NATO has expanded its strategic concept and geopolitical
   scope to the detriment of an efficient and well-defined military
   capability in Europe. However, the Ukrainian crisis has brought the
   attention back to Europe and to NATO's deterrent value. Linda Risso
   argues that, as one of the Alliance's leading members, the UK must act
   as a catalyst to ensure that NATO has the necessary military strength
   and political will to respond to the new security challenges.},

   Reconciliation},
Journal = {JAPANESE JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {315-331},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Previous studies on international reconciliation have focused on the
   security and economic interests of the countries involved, treating
   reconciliation as an end-goal rather than an ongoing process. This study
   divides the process of reconciliation into three stages. Procedural
   reconciliation', which refers to the mending of international relations
   through institutional change, is the most basic. In the material
   reconciliation' phase, the perpetrator(s) provides the victim(s) -
   either at the individual or state level - with economic compensation for
   inflicting harm. The third stage, ideational reconciliation', is reached
   when the perpetrator acknowledges past wrongdoings and when civil and
   cultural exchanges are carried out smoothly. This study delves into the
   relations between South Korea and Japan. Even though reconciliation
   between South Korea and Japan is vital to achieve stable peace in
   Northeast Asia, the topic has not received sufficient scholarly
   attention. Former studies have focused on bilateral relations, but few
   have discussed the two countries' path towards reconciliation. In this
   study, readers will find an in-depth analysis of the ties between South
   Korea and Japan from an international reconciliation perspective, one
   which will help them understand how the two nations have worked towards
   understanding and how much they have achieved to date. The study also
   suggests a roadmap to reach the final stage of reconciliation and
   identifies the policy changes needed to get there.},

Abstract = {Competing interests among big powers played a role in the making of
   World War II. But, and not separated from this, another element had a
   serious impact: the sense of psychological insecurity experienced, each
   in its own way, by Germany and Japan in the context of their quest for
   recognition by other major powers - Great Britain, France, Russia, and
   the United States - and the implications this had internationally. In
   connection with their material conditions (internal and international)
   compared to other great powers, this pushed Germany and Japan to embrace
   policies that were ultimately self-defeating. It led them to see and
   assess themselves, others, and the international environment in
   conflicting terms and, faced with the unwillingness of other big powers
   to accommodate them to the extent they wanted, to overplay their hand,
   with lethal outcomes as a result. This article follows two previous
   articles published in this journal. (1) It is a case study that focuses
   on Germany and Japan, and the making of World War II. In the first
   section, it begins with highlighting the overall relevance of this case
   study in the context of the analysis of emotions and passions in
   international politics. In the second section, it shows that both for
   Germany and Japan a sense of psychological insecurity regarding their
   international status and their urge to catch up and compensate, put them
   on a collision course with the great powers of the period. In the third
   part, the article explains how, in time, this contributed to the fact
   that Germany and Japan embraced negative and exclusionary political
   emotions and passions that translated into belligerent policies. In the
   fourth section, as a way to conclude, the article touches upon how a
   better understanding of the nature and role of emotions and passions in
   international affairs can encourage a psychology of peace, and
   international peace altogether.},

Abstract = {The dramatic rise of democratic regimes around the world has coincided
   with an equally significant increase in migration, characterized by an
   unprecedented movement of people from emerging to established
   democracies. Through analysis of survey data from six Latin American
   countries, we offer an empirical evaluation of theoretical mechanisms
   through which migration can shape the political behaviors of
   non-migrants in sending nations. We find that individuals who have
   strong cross-border ties that connect them with relatives living in the
   United States are more likely to participate in local politics,
   sympathize with a political party, and persuade others to vote for a
   party. Those effects are influenced by the positive impact of
   cross-border ties on civic community involvement, political interest,
   and political efficacy. Moreover, the evidence suggests that frequent
   usage of the Internet among non-migrants with strong cross-border ties
   results in increased political knowledge, which contributes to their
   greater political interest and efficacy.},

Abstract = {The Frankfurt ``critical theory{''} presents in its long history a
   complex sequence of critical paradigms: the critique of ideology and
   traditional theory that characterizes the first approach of M.
   Horkheimer, the ``negative{''} dialectic of the late Adorno, the
   reconstruction of counterfactual assumptions of communication by J.
   Habermas and, finally, the normative and critical character of the
   spheres of recognition in the recent work of A. Honneth. This history
   seems to swing between an immanent (and context-dependent) account and a
   transcendent (or transcendental) account, in which standards are
   represented by an ideal and normative point of view. But all these
   different accounts are only variations around a fundamental paradigm:
   the model of the Hegelian determinate negation.},

Abstract = {Globally, 2015 is an important year for democracy as it marks a number
   of historical anniversaries that serve as key prompts for all
   parliaments to contemplate the significance of their relationships with
   the people.
   2015 also marks a number of additional milestones with regard to the
   relative importance of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT)
   Legislative Assembly's relationship with the people-the year preceding
   (2014) saw the celebration of 25 years of self-government in the ACT and
   the year following (2016) will mark the first time the people of
   Canberra will go to the polls to elect 25 members (previously 17) to its
   Legislative Assembly. It is timely, therefore, to assess and reflect on
   the Assembly's relationship with the people of Canberra.
   This paper uses methodological inquiry to examine civil society
   participation in the work of Assembly committees over the first 25 years
   of self-government. The assessment also serves to establish an important
   benchmark for the next 25 years, as it provides an indicator by which
   the maturity of the Assembly with regard to inclusiveness can be
   assessed. While it is not possible to predict the degree of
   inclusiveness over this time period a new stage of political
   imperatives, priorities, and awareness will shape participation
   priorities for an enlarged Assembly, its committees and from 2016
   onwards its 25 members.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article analyses constituency campaigning and personalization when
   electoral system and party organizational incentives conflict. Providing
   the first study of candidate campaign behaviour in Austria we show that
   a sizeable number of candidates in national elections engage in
   personalized rather than party-centred campaigns. Focussing on
   behavioural indicators of `personalized' campaigning, we find that
   individual motivation and resources play an important role in how
   candidates conduct their campaigns. Factors such as experience in
   political office, the probability of winning a seat, candidate goal
   choice (self- or party-promotion), the district characteristic (urban or
   rural) and party affiliation influence the numbers of hours spent on
   campaigning and the kind of campaign resources candidates use and value
   most. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {What factors prompt citizens to switch from a partisan judgment
   strategy, one in which they reflexively side with the in-group in policy
   and electoral contests, to a more thoughtful one, in which they pause to
   consider additional information? Previous work suggests that variation
   in political reasoning is triggered by the experience of anxiety. In
   this research, we examine a broader consideration: whether the overall
   pattern of experienced emotions confirms or violates one's partisan
   expectations. Using both cross-sectional and panel data from the
   American National Election Studies, we examine how the emotions of
   anxiety, anger, and enthusiasm influence the manner in which voters
   appraise presidential candidates and update their opinions on salient
   policy issues. In line with an expectancy violation framework, the
   results consistently indicate that expectancy-violating emotions (e.g.,
   experiencing enthusiasm toward the other party's candidate) heighten
   deliberative reasoning and suppress partisan cue-taking, and that
   expectancy-confirming emotions (e.g., experiencing anxiety toward the
   other party's candidate) have the reverse set of effects. We discuss the
   implications of our findings for American politics and for theories of
   political information processing and judgment.},

Abstract = {I examine the political consequences of prison development in the United
   States. I theorize that the prison apparatus not only upholds a system
   of racial hierarchy and class stratification, but also links the
   economic stability of lower-class, rural whites to the continued penal
   confinement of poor, urban minorities. Analysis of an original dataset
   suggests that local reliance on existing prison infrastructure
   throughout many economically-depressed rural communities strengthens
   political support for harsh criminal punishments and militates against
   reform efforts. Political representatives have powerful interests in
   protecting rural prison investments, regardless of their actual economic
   impact in host communities. The evidence indicates that rural prison
   development contributes to the perceived economic viability and
   political power of rural areas, while reinforcing forms of punishment
   that destabilize poor urban neighborhoods and harm politically
   marginalized populations.},

Abstract = {As the term `soft power' in international relations (IR) has been coined
   by Joseph Nye a quarter of a century ago it has gained a great response
   and initiated numerous debates. A high quality education sector is one
   of the important factors that contributes to a country's soft power.
   Despite that, as shown in the article, education has not been adequately
   covered in the existing IR literature. The article addresses this lacuna
   by offering an attempt to conceptualise and operationalise the
   educational aspect of soft power. First, with cases from the People's
   Republic of China and Finland, it provides various examples of growing
   internationalisation of education, and analyses possible soft power
   gains from education. Second, the article provides a theoretical
   conceptualization of educational soft power, and presents three
   mechanisms that it can work through: as a carrier of genuine values, as
   a resource that countries possess, and as a tool in achieving certain
   goals. All three mechanisms also show how increasing
   internationalisation brings more direct connections between education,
   international relations, and foreign policy.},

Number = {6-7},
Pages = {802-819},

Abstract = {This article argues in favor of a Levantine approach to citizenship and
   citizenship education. A Levantine approach calls for some sort of
   Mediterranean regionalism, which accommodates and promotes overlapping
   and shared sovereignties and jurisdiction, multiple loyalties, and
   regional integration. It transcends the paradigmatic statist model of
   citizenship by recasting the relationship between territoriality,
   national identity, sovereignty, and citizenship in complex, multilayered
   and disaggregated constellations. As the case of Israel/Palestine
   demonstrates, this new approach goes beyond multicultural accommodation
   and territorial partition. It proposes, among other things, extending
   the political and territorial boundaries of citizenship to take all the
   territory between the Mediterranean Sea and Jordan River as one unit of
   analysis belonging to a larger region.},

Abstract = {Many culturally heterogeneous societies with functioning democratic
   regimes nonetheless fail to grant equal status to different ethnic and
   cultural groups within their borders. To a great extent, scholars
   discuss such inequalities within the analytical boundaries of the
   discourse on democracy and democratization. We argue that such
   discussions overstretch the concept of democracy. In this research, we
   offer a novel axis of inquiry, namely distributiveness. We define
   distributiveness as the egalitarian distribution of resources -
   political, material, cultural-symbolic, institutional, and territorial -
   among different ethnic, religious, or cultural groups which
   self-identify as collectives within society. The aim of this new
   conceptualization is to (1) restore conceptual clarity to the literature
   on democracy, (2) enhance our capacity to assess the allocation of
   resources within a given polity, and (3) elucidate the processes that
   lead to change in patterns of allocation.},

Title = {The profile of gender equality issue attention in Western Europe},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {54},
Number = {3},
Pages = {525-542},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This article investigates the factors that drive governments to pay
   attention to gender equality issues and place them upon executive
   agendas. In line with studies of the dynamics of issue attention, which
   demonstrate the importance of investigating variability in the attention
   policy makers give to issue demands across policy domains, this article
   argues that policy issues related to gender equality are
   multidimensional and patterns in executive attention vary across the
   different types of gender issues. Multidimensionality of gender equality
   issues reflects different dynamics in agenda-setting as different issues
   invoke contrasting constellations of political representation,
   institutional friction and veto points. To investigate this variation,
   this article proposes a twofold distinction between class-based and
   status-based gender equality issues and assesses the validity of three
   sets of explanations for when gender issues succeed in reaching
   executive agendas: women in politics, party ideology and economic
   performance. Drawing on governmental attention datasets from the
   Comparative Agendas Project, a systematic comparative quantitative
   analysis of the determinants of gender equality issue attention in five
   Western European countries is conducted. The main findings confirm that
   the mechanisms through which different types of gender equality issues
   gain executive attention differ according to the kind of the gender
   equality demand. Costly class-based gender equality issues are more
   likely to receive executive attention when the economy is performing
   well, when there is a strong presence of Social Democrats and when there
   is a high proportion of female MPs. In contrast, economic performance,
   party politics and women's parliamentary presence do not seem to exert
   any impact on status-based issues. Instead, critical actors in the
   government seem to be the strongest driver for attention over this
   second type of gender equality issue. This study contributes a gendered
   dimension to the policy agendas scholarship, adding theoretical and
   empirical depth to the understanding of how non-core issues secure their
   place on full governmental agendas. By focusing on how to secure
   governmental attention for gender equality issues, the article makes a
   major contribution to understanding the initial genesis of gender
   equality policies.},

Abstract = {The existing literature on bias in interest group access faces the
   challenge that there is often no clear benchmark for judging whether a
   given distribution of interest groups involved in policy making is
   biased. To tackle this challenge, we link two new data sets on
   registered European Union (EU) interest groups and membership of the
   advisory committees of the European Commission and examine the factors
   affecting selection to these committees. Our approach allows us to
   qualify the conclusions of the existing literature. We see that, even if
   business interests dominate advisory committees, they are not generally
   privileged over other group types in the selection processes and their
   degree of access varies considerably between policy areas. Instead,
   supranational interest groups enjoy selection privileges, which are
   particularly pronounced on permanent committees. Finally, we find some
   evidence that, even though lobbying budgets are important for getting
   access, their value varies across group types. In this way, our study
   has implications for future theory building on resource exchanges
   between interest group types and decision makers.},

Abstract = {This article deals with newly emerging international collaborative
   initiatives around two issues connected to climate change: removal of
   fossil fuel subsidies and improving climate information disclosure
   practices in the business sector. While networked initiatives on the
   gradual removal of fossil fuel subsidies and a multi-actor network on
   disclosure of climate change information do not explicitly mobilize
   collective actions around climate change, they supplement and reinforce
   a wide array of other transnational initiatives and partnerships around
   climate change mitigation efforts. Analysed networks equip transnational
   policy processes around the climate change issue, initially formed by
   the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC)
   member states, with new policy tools to mitigate human-induced climate
   change and hugely expand the membership of policy-making at the
   international level. Newly emerging transnational networks in the area
   of fossil fuel subsidies removal and improving climate change
   information disclosure practices in the corporate world also strive for
   harmonization of policy methods and instruments across international
   boundaries. The experience of the European Union (EU) in promoting
   climate change actions among its member states and in sustaining
   collaboration with private actors can serve as an exemplary and learning
   tool for transnational policy networks across continents. And the size
   of the EU's market together with its governance structure provides it
   with a common legitimate voice at the international arena for climate
   change decision-making.},

Abstract = {The political theory of Charles W. Mills seeks simultaneously to expose
   liberalism's complicity with white supremacy and to transform liberalism
   into a source of antiracist political critique. This article analyzes
   both Mills' critique of liberalism and his attempt to reconstruct it
   into a political philosophy capable of adequately addressing racial
   injustice. I focus on his (a) problematization of moral personhood, (b)
   theorization of white ignorance, and (c) conceptualization of white
   supremacy. Together these establish the need to integrate a new
   empirical axiom into liberal political theory: the axiom of the power of
   white supremacy in modernity, or the axiom of white power, for short.
   This axiom is analogous to James Madison's axiom of ``the encroaching
   spirit of power.{''} Any liberal theorist who fails to take the
   encroaching spirit of power seriously meets the scorn of his peers. The
   same should be true for white power, Mills suggests. I conclude that
   Mills' reconstruction of liberalism is incomplete and urge him to
   develop a fully-fledged liberal theory of racial justice to complete it.},

Abstract = {This manuscript examines the political behavior of White union members,
   with a focus on the differences between private sector and public sector
   union members. In the last several decades, private sector union
   membership has drastically declined, but public sector union membership
   has greatly increased. This has transformed the White unionized
   workforce from a group composed primarily of non-professional men with
   no college education to one that is much more female, college educated,
   and professional. We test the proposition that White public sector union
   members have greater incentives to support the Democratic Party than
   their private sector counterparts. The method employed is an examination
   of the presidential vote among both unionized and non-unionized Whites
   during the 1950s and the 2000s, using data from the American National
   Election Studies. Support among unionized Whites for Democratic
   presidential candidates in the 2000s came primarily from college
   educated and professional White union members, which represents a
   reversal of the pattern found during the 1950s. These results provide
   evidence that the White union members currently voting for Democratic
   candidates belong mainly to public sector unions.},

Abstract = {In December 20th, 2013, President Enrique Pena Nieto signed the energy
   reform bill that allowed to open the energy sector to both national and
   international companies. On that day, the President said that with the
   promulgation of the reform ``begins a new history for our country. We
   have opened the gates to a better future for all of us{''}. Along these
   process of political negotiation the government embarked on a propaganda
   of the reform that consisted in a barrage of persuasive messages about
   the positive effects and the need of the implementation of the
   initiative. Given the growing significance of the government
   communication in the last few years and the impact of the implications
   for Mexico, the purpose of this paper is to make a first analytical
   approach on the construction of the governmental narrative to
   communicate the reform and its effects on the public opinion.},

Abstract = {The electoral success of many West European Christian Democratic parties
   as prototypical people's parties has been threatened in recent years by
   growing secularization and economic trends. In the light of these
   challenges, this article analyses the importance of social and
   attitudinal variables in predicting support for seven Christian
   Democratic parties at the individual level using data from the European
   Social Survey. The results highlight the continuing centrality of
   religion in Christian Democratic voting. Regular attendance at church,
   particularly among Catholics, raises the probability of supporting
   Christian Democracy at the ballot box substantially. Class, by contrast,
   offers a weak guide as to the likelihood of a Christian Democratic vote.
   The importance of religion is such that expectations about other
   potentially important independent variables (character of domicile, age)
   are generally not met. Yet the reliable support of religious voters is
   increasingly an ambiguous electoral asset with clear signs that this
   partisan constituency is in decline throughout Western Europe.},

Abstract = {For over a half century, various fields in the behavioral and social
   sciences have debated the appropriateness of null hypothesis
   significance testing (NHST) in the presentation and assessment of
   research results. A long list of criticisms has fueled the so-called
   significance testing controversy. The conventional NHST framework
   encourages researchers to devote excessive attention to statistical
   significance while underemphasizing practical (e.g., scientific,
   substantive, social, political) significance. I introduce a simple,
   intuitive approach that grounds testing in subject-area expertise,
   balancing the dual concerns of detectability and importance. The
   proposed practical and statistical significance test allows the social
   scientist to test for real-world significance, taking into account both
   sampling error and an assessment of what parameter values should be
   deemed interesting, given theory. The matter of what constitutes
   practical significance is left in the hands of the researchers
   themselves, to be debated as a natural component of inference and
   interpretation.},

Abstract = {The Leveson Inquiry recommended that a new press regulator be created,
   with a statutory backingwhich the government and opposition agreed
   should be a Royal Charter. Presently, a Press Recognition Panel, backed
   by the Charter, has been created, but has attracted no requests for
   recognition. Only one regulator has been set upIPSO: it has a membership
   of most of the newspaper and magazine groups in the UK, but will not ask
   for recognition, since it does not wish to have any formal link with the
   state. Though the campaign against the Royal Charter has been grossly
   overblown, the press is right to refuse to join an institution which is
   guaranteed by the state.State-backed regulation, in any form, will not
   in the UK lead to tyranny, censorship or any more than occasional
   meddling. But a link to the state is a bad idea for an independent
   press. Not only does this set a bad precedent, opening up a temptation
   for behind-the-scenes pressure, but more importantly it misses the
   point. Bad and abusive journalism is not improved by regulation. It is
   improved by journalists understanding the main task of journalism is to
   report and analyse accurately and neutrally.This complements robust
   debate and opinion and contributes greatly to a well-informed citizenry.},

Title = {Politics is local: State legislator voting on restrictive voter
   identification legislation},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {The marked increase in restrictive voter identification (ID) laws since
   the 2010 elections reveals the extreme partisan polarization in those
   state legislatures advancing this reform. Unlike previous studies that
   examine state-level factors expected to influence passage of restrictive
   voter ID bills, this study is the first to investigate the question
   using the state legislator as the unit of analysis. Multivariate
   analysis of the voting behavior of state legislators shows which kinds
   of district-level factors increase or decrease their likelihood of
   supporting stricter voter ID laws. Given the differentiable coalitions
   favoring Democratic and Republican candidates, certain partisan-aligned
   district demographics influence state lawmaker support for restrictive
   voter ID legislation. Race in particular is a major cleavage
   conditioning support for restrictive voter ID laws. Unlike the mixed
   findings generated by macro-level studies, this article provides
   convincing evidence that the size of the black district population
   negatively influences the likelihood that a Democratic legislator votes
   in favor of a restrictive voter ID bill, but positively affects the
   probability that a Republican lawmaker votes yes. The findings in this
   study illuminate the contextual factors that influence legislator voting
   on this salient election reform.},

   private sector in health-care service delivery and health insurance is

Abstract = {An important thesis of political science argues that the decision-making
   capacity of a government is related to the degree of fragmentation of
   the party system. Paradoxically, in the early `90s the fragmentation of
   the Argentinean party system increased while fundamental changes in
   public policy were taking place. The research is aimed to explore the
   link between these two dimensions. The investigation results show that
   through a proper characterization of party systems it is possible to
   overcome the initial paradox and restore the validity of the prevailing
   thesis, with an amendment: the degree of fragmentation of governmental
   levels of the party system affects the decision-making capacity of the
   governments.},

Abstract = {Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has articulated and
   implemented explicit strategies of democracy promotion by providing
   assistance to governments, political parties, and other non-governmental
   groups and organizations all over the world. One particularly
   challenging region has been the Middle East and North Africa, where
   democratic development and democracy aid opportunities have been limited
   and constrained by a variety of factors related to social, economic, and
   political characteristics of the region and policy priorities of the
   United States. This article examines the impact of two major paradigm
   shifts - the end of the Cold War (1989) and the 9/11 episode (2001) - on
   the nature, purposes, and consequences of US democracy assistance to the
   Middle East. Examining democracy aid allocations, social, democratic and
   political factors in the region, and other variables, the analysis
   traces the shifts in aid strategies, purposes, and recipients generated
   by these paradigm shifts and assesses the impact of such assistance on
   the politics of the region. The article concludes with a discussion of
   the implications of these findings for US democracy promotion policies
   and the impact of the Arab Spring events as a potential third break
   point.},

Abstract = {The Arab Uprisings and their transformational impact across MENA have
   generated immense debate about the future of the region's countries

Abstract = {Under what conditions do minorities in the Middle East participate in
   authoritarian coalitions? Research on authoritarian resilience in the
   Middle East has been largely silent on linguistic and religious
   minorities' preferences over regime types. Here, we examine whether
   minorities differ in their support for authoritarianism from the
   majority groups in four Middle Eastern states. We argue that minorities
   whose status is threatened by a transition to majoritarian
   decision-making institutions are less likely to be supportive of
   democratization. We examine how different cleavages affect the
   preferences of minorities over regime type and identify three historical
   legacies in the Middle East that have shaped these cleavages: the
   Ottoman-Islamic legacy of minority accommodation, the ethnic class
   structure that emerged as a result of the region's integration to world
   markets in the nineteenth century, and a post-independence pattern of
   authoritarian secularism. Based on survey research and a comparison of
   minorities in Turkey, Egypt, Morocco, and Jordan, we find that
   linguistic minorities tend to be less supportive of authoritarianism
   while religious minorities tend to be more supportive of
   authoritarianism.},

Abstract = {We contrast the central theoretical claims of the realist and liberal
   traditions of international relations concerning the importance of
   public opinion in foreign affairs, providing sufficient empirical
   evidence to uphold the liberal view and refute the realist hypothesis.
   Using data collected over the last decade by The Americas and The World
   Project in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru, we show that,
   even if Latin Americans have important limitations in terms of knowledge
   of international affairs, a strong system of political beliefs endows
   them with the conceptual tools to face the complexity of global issues,
   permitting them to hold coherent and consistent preferences on
   international issues.},

Abstract = {This paper assesses the hypothesis that election quality is worse under
   plurality voting systems than under proportional representation (PR). We
   use a two-pronged research design that permits us to harness the
   advantages of most similar and most different approaches to limit
   problems of endogeneity that afflict hypothesis testing in comparative
   politics. We use a subnational database of more than 1,300 accusations
   of electoral fraud from Costa Rica (1901-1948) that uniquely varies
   formulae among (provincial) electoral districts. Our statistical models
   reveal that plurality leads to more ballot rigging than proportional
   systems. We also demonstrate that plurality voting systems are
   associated with inferior election quality in the Quality of Elections
   Database (QED), which covers 170 countries between 1975 and 2004. Our
   findings suggest that electoral formulae, a basic feature of
   institutional design, have as much impact as social structure on whether
   elections are free and fair.},

   experience with EU referendums},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {38},
Pages = {170-182},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article is about comparative voting behaviour in referendums on the
   EU and explores variation within one country rather than variations
   across countries. This enables us to control for broad national context
   while allowing variations in the immediate referendum context, in terms
   of campaign intensity and incumbency. It analyses voting behaviour in
   the many referendums that have taken place in Ireland. The major part of
   the analysis deals with the five referendums since 2001, as this allows
   the use of the same measurement of EU support and the use of post
   referendum surveys. Most attention is paid to attitude to the EU, party
   support and satisfaction with the incumbent government, reflecting the
   main debates in the literature on the issues and party cues. The
   relative importance of each is said to depend on contextual factors such
   as campaign intensity and economic strength. We find both party cues and
   issues matter consistently, and suggestive evidence that incumbency
   matters to the effectiveness of cues given by the two main pro-EU
   parties but the major finding is that variations in the factors driving
   voting behaviour in different Irish polls on Europe are slight and
   barely significant. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Court-based constitutional review as a way of controlling executive and
   legislative action is generally considered as one of the most
   significant developments in post Second World War liberal
   constitutionalism in the world. 1 Constitutional courts can make a
   significant contribution to the preservation of the rule of law, the
   protection of the individual's fundamental rights and the strengthening
   of democracy as long as they remain independent. Constitutional courts
   are perceived as important factors of stabilization in many countries
   characterized by new or fragile democratic systems. 2 Due to their
   potential role in the establishment and maintenance of constitutional
   democracies, constitutional courts have been comprehensively studied in
   the area of constitutional law and politics. 3 In this study, the
   Turkish Constitutional Court, as one of the oldest and most active in
   Europe, will be examined in a comparative perspective by considering the
   interpretation of the historical origins and functions of the
   Constitutional Courts.},

Abstract = {Chantal Mouffe's conceptualization of a deliberatively forged consensus
   as a hegemony and her assertion that adversarial politics best nurtures
   the conditions of freedom have had a profound influence on contemporary
   democratic thought. This article takes a critical view of this trend,
   arguing that a norm of consensus is a very precondition, rather than
   impediment, for the kind of pluralistic democracy Mouffe and other
   agonists wish to promote. It is asserted that Mouffe's dehistoricized
   refutation of consensus lacks causal or explanatory relevance to how
   concrete actors embedded in empirical situations relate to one another
   and that the very preparedness to find something acceptable about
   another is at the heart of what it means to treat others justly.},

Abstract = {The research note comments on W. Veenendaal's article A Big Prince in a
   Tiny Realm: Smallness, Monarchy, and Political Legitimacy in the
   Principality of Liechtenstein. It is argued, inter alia, that the
   phenomenon of princely self-restraint should not be underestimated in
   Liechtenstein's constitutional reality. The character of the
   microstate's actual political system strongly depends on the individual
   personality of the Reigning Prince. A strong monarch who acts as a
   political actor with his own agenda should not be conceptualized as a
   neutral traditional leader. From the perspective of many citizens of
   Liechtenstein, the principality's political system is legitimate since
   it combines traditional authority and legal-rational authority in a
   unique way. Largely due to the powerful role of the government, the
   microstate is characterized by consensus-oriented hierarchical
   governance. Elite surveys can be seen as a useful instrument to overcome
   some of the methodological pitfalls of the elite interview approach.},

Abstract = {The liberation struggle impacts on the current political landscape of
   Southern Africa. In this regard, some scholars speak of enduring
   `post-liberation states', whereas others foresee the slow but inevitable
   decline of the active role of freedom fighters in politics. We aim to
   enrich the debate over the legacies of the liberation struggle by
   providing empirical evidence in a three-step analysis. Firstly, we
   provide figures on the composition of cabinets since independence,
   demonstrating not only that more than half of today's cabinet members
   are former freedom fighters, but also that their numbers are
   continuously decreasing. Secondly, we compare recent election manifestos
   of liberation-movements-turned parties to older documents of the same
   movements, showing that in Namibia and South Africa, freedom fighter
   rhetoric is more subtle than overt, which differs from the case in
   Zimbabwe. In a third step, we contrast these findings with evidence from
   practical politics. Through this multilayered comparative analysis, we
   also reveal the opportunistic use of the liberation struggle as a
   political tool across all three country case studies.},

   This study tests whether and how the direction, stability and strength
   of party identification are associated with big five personality traits,
   using panel data from a representative sample of German citizens. First,
   the study confirms that personality traits are related to identification
   with different political parties. Second, it moves beyond previous
   research by showing that personality traits are related to the strength
   and variation in party identification over time. The implications of the
   study for the classical perspectives on party identification, as well as
   the personality and politics literature, are discussed.},

Abstract = {In the following pages, I will conduct an examination of the Fichtean
   concept of idealism in Der geschlossene Handelsstaat. Then I will
   outline some considerations (albeit impressionistic) about our present.
   In Fiche's Der geschlossene Handelsstaat the contrast between idealism
   and dogmatism is presented in a specific way, in relation to the
   political project delineated in that work: idealism is the specific
   philosophical and political position meant to change the world, in order
   to accord it to the reason (that is the central concept of
   Vernunftstaat, the rational State). On the other side, dogmatism is the
   specific conservative point of view that aims to conserve everything.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {184-195},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Democratic contractarianism aspires to unite two previously unconnected
   strands in political philosophy: a democratic commitment to a social
   world in which citizens wield equal power; and a contractarian
   commitment to a strictly prudential justification of political morality.
   It is argued in this article that the commitment to democratic equality
   is theoretically unmotivated and risks limiting the applicability of the
   view to societies in which equal bargaining power already obtains. It is
   also argued that the view cannot account for why a political order
   governed by democratic contractarianism will be stable over time.
   Ultimately, it is suggested that these problems are traceable to a
   fundamental incompatibility between the two dimensions of democratic
   contractarianism. The view can be democratic, and it can be
   contractarian, but it cannot be both.},

Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {409-418},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Africa's arbitrary country borders have been seized upon as sources of
   ``natural experiments{''}: having randomly assigned people to different
   country treatments, differences in outcomes on either side of the border
   can then be attributed to the institutions, demographics, or policies
   put in place in each country. While methodologically attractive, the use
   of African borders as sources of natural experiments presents several
   potential pitfalls. We describe these pitfalls-some common to all
   studies that employ jurisdictional boundaries, some unique to African
   borders-and offer guidelines for overcoming them. We conclude that
   African cross-border studies can provide research advantages similar to
   well-executed comparative case studies, but that they frequently offer
   weaker inferential leverage than is claimed.},

Abstract = {The work of Daniel Kahneman and his colleagues has established that
   people do not always think and act rationally. However, this amounts to
   saying that Kahneman and his collaborators interpret people's behavior
   in experimental settings to be inconsistent with the narrow
   understanding of rationality deployed by orthodox neoclassical
   economists. Whether this means that people make poor decisions in the
   real world, however, has not been demonstrated, a fact that calls into
   doubt the significance of the list of heuristics and biases generated by
   behavioral economists. Dual-process (System 1/System 2) theory was meant
   to give theoretical coherence to this list, but its empirical
   foundation, too, retains the premises of rational choice as an ideal.},

Title = {`In it together'? The political consequences of perceived discommunions
   of interest in British politics},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {The presence of shared interests between politicians and citizens is
   central to many accounts of political representation, yet there has been
   little empirical research into how citizens perceive these interests and
   whether they think a `communion of interests' exists between them and
   their elected representatives. Using new survey data, this paper
   explores the extent to which Britons think their Members of Parliament
   share the same everyday experiences as they do. It further explores the
   relationship between these perceptions and indicators of specific and
   diffuse political support. We show that British citizens generally say
   that politicians are less affected by social and economic conditions and
   less reliant on public services than they are. The size of this
   perceived `discommunion' affects voting behaviour and satisfaction with
   democracy.},

Title = {Third-Party Actors and the Success of Democracy: How Electoral
   Commissions, Courts, and Observers Shape Incentives for Electoral
   Manipulation and Post-Election Protests},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {77},
Number = {2},
Pages = {407-420},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {When and how do third-party actors-most prominently electoral
   commissions, courts, and observers-contribute to the integrity of the
   electoral process? We approach these questions by studying how
   third-party actors shape politicians' incentives to comply with the
   outcomes of elections. Third parties are most beneficial in close
   elections, when the threat of a post-election confrontation alone fails
   to ensure self-enforcing compliance with election outcomes. Our analysis
   highlights that third parties do not need to be impartial to be
   politically consequential, that it is third parties with a moderate
   pro-incumbent bias that will be acceptable to not only the opposition
   but also the incumbent, and that incumbents adopt politically
   consequential third-party institutions when they fear that their narrow
   victory might result in a costly post-election confrontation. Extensions
   of our model address the role of repression and urban bias, examine the
   differences between commissions, courts, and observers, and clarify not
   only the potential but also the limits to institutional solutions to the
   problem of electoral compliance in new and transitioning democracies.
   As long as I count the ballots, what are you going to do about it?

Abstract = {Political theorists have recently emphasized the popular dimension of
   Aristotle's political thought, and many have called attention to
   Aristotle's assertion that certain multitudes should share in the city's
   deliberations. In this article, I explore the part of virtue and
   prudence Aristotle believes necessary for a multitude to participate in
   political life. I argue, first, that military service helps citizens
   develop the part of virtue necessary for political participation and,
   second, that the part of prudence Aristotle has in mind is sunesis. I
   argue, moreover, that military virtue helps citizens acquire sunesis and
   guides its exercise. Aristotle recognizes the limitations and potential
   dangers of military virtue and attempts to avoid these, in part by
   offering a new understanding of military virtue to offset the Spartan.
   Understanding the part of virtue and prudence citizens have helps
   understand their role in a polity but also points to how those citizens,
   and their regime, can be improved.},

Abstract = {Many have pointed to Blade Runner's humanization of its `replicants' as
   a compelling statement against exploitation and domination. I argue,
   however, that the film has another kind of agenda: a Rousseauvian
   concern about the dangers of representation, about confusing the
   imitation with the real and confusing the consumption of images with
   political action. Rather than humanizing the other, Blade Runner's
   central concern is to humanize our own social and political
   relationships, which are in danger of falling into the same trap
   Rousseau outlined in his Letter to D'Alembert. To do so, we must learn
   to appreciate the difference between mutual surveillance and mutual
   regard. To live freely in any regime, we must understand the dangers of
   representation, even if, in a large state, we must continue to make use
   of it.},

   Attitudes, 1980-2004},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {77},
Number = {2},
Pages = {368-380},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Among the terms central to the literature on political attitudes have
   been complexity and constraint, with some scholars asserting that
   increased complexity-political sophistication-constrains political
   attitudes to a single ideological dimension while others argue that
   complexity instead leads to a multidimensional attitude structure. We
   investigate the role of sophistication in structuring issue attitudes
   using a unique survey of Democratic and Republican party elites in
   conjunction with the American National Election Studies (ANES). The two
   surveys allow us to compare directly the structure of elites' and mass
   issue attitudes. We hypothesize that elites' attitudes are
   unidimensional and mass attitudes are multidimensional. The difference,
   we argue, is that political sophistication constrains elites' attitudes
   to a single ideological dimension, whereas much of the mass public is
   not fully capable of making the necessary connections between ideology
   and issue attitudes. The results of comparisons between elite and mass
   attitude structures from 1980 to 2004 support our hypotheses.},

   role of regulatory law and the role played by regulators, generally
   independent agencies. This article offers a critical reflection on the
   operability of policy tools in relation to the economy, departing from
   the original State model of economic constitution and following an
   evolutionary pattern centered on the evaluation of regulatory law and
   its future prospects. It hypothesizes that the scenario of revision of
   the regulatory law must connect with parallel changes in the design and
   functions of regulatory agencies.},

Abstract = {In Dnipropetrovsk Russian, Ukrainian, Soviet, and Jewish layers of
   history overlap. The metropolis in South-Eastern Ukraine has so far
   managed to resist the war that Russia, with the help of armed groups in
   the Donbas, has unleashed. That has a lot to do with the work of
   billionaire Ihor Kolomoiskyi and the Private Group. Together with the
   regional authorities, they have seized on the traditional
   self-confidence of Dnipropetrovskers and offered a new form of local
   patriotism that is closely linked with political loyalty to Ukraine.
   Dnipropetrovsk is the first city to manifest a decidedly Ukrainian
   political nationalism. This nationalism is compatible with the Russian
   language and Russian or Jewish identity.},

Abstract = {Over recent decades, scholars have debated the connection between
   resource scarcity and conflict. Does resource scarcity produce conflict,
   or does scarcity demand development and international cooperation? Can
   environmental stress be an occasion for peace, or does international
   cooperation during an environmental crisis indicate local or intrastate
   conflicts? Toward responding to these questions, this analysis examines
   the effects the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) and shows that
   while the LHWP helped to put a stop to international conflicts between
   Lesotho and South Africa, the Project's consequences (ecocide,
   displacement, and unequal distribution of basic resources) have
   intensified tensions within these states.},

Abstract = {In our days, sport is a big business, with huge sums of money involved.
   With various types of emotions and the huge budgets involved, conflict
   is a daily reality of sports organizations. The present article started
   from the idea that arbitration-the most commonly used procedure in
   dealing with sports disputes - doesnot represent a viable solution any
   more, and that mediation could succeed where arbitration has failed. The
   article will present the reasons behind this statement by describing the
   procedure and the high number of national and international institutions
   with arbitrational responsibilities. Based on 40 interviews with
   athletes and staff, and from my own professional and academic experience
   as mediator, the article presents the main benefits of mediation that
   can be used in sports disputes.},

Volume = {86},
Number = {2},
Pages = {226-233},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Referendums are often criticised for being elite-controlled and
   undeliberative. This article argues that the detailed, multiactor
   regulation of the Scottish referendum resulted in an elaborate legal
   regime which helped to overcome these potential pathologies, diluting
   executive control and facilitating an exercise in national public
   engagement. It addresses the troubled history of referendum use in the
   UK and contends that the Scottish process may well transform how
   referendums are now viewed. Indeed, one outcome of the Scottish process
   is likely to be a greater demand at UK level for the use of direct
   democracy in processes of significant constitutional change. It is by no
   means certain, however, that these demands for greaterpopular engagement
   in the process of constitutional change will be met, particularly when
   we consider the Smith Commission process, which marks a return to elite
   interparty bargaining.},

Abstract = {This article uncovers a new mechanism linking oil wealth to autocratic
   regime survival: the investigation tests whether increases in oil wealth
   improve the survival of autocracies by lowering the chances of
   democratization, reducing the risk of transition to subsequent
   dictatorship, or both. Using a new measure of autocratic durability
   shows that, once models allow for unit effects, oil wealth promotes
   autocratic survival by lowering the risk of ouster by rival autocratic
   groups. Evidence also indicates that oil income increases military
   spending in dictatorships, which suggests that increasing oil wealth may
   deter coups that could have caused a regime collapse.},

Abstract = {The legislation on recall of MPs, introduced as a response to the
   parliamentary expenses scandal, was presented as filling an
   accountability gap. The nature of this alleged gap is examined, and it
   is argued that the accountability of Members of Parliament is more
   complicated than the recall proposal suggests. This includes issues
   about the regulation of parliamentary standards. Finally, the recall
   proposal is located within the context of discussion about the condition
   of representative democracy.},

Abstract = {Public attitudes are greatly shaped by the cohesiveness of the strategic
   narratives crafted by policy-makers in framing the national involvement
   in war. The literature has recently devoted growing attention toward the
   features that define successful strategic narratives, such as a
   consistent set of objectives, convincing cause-effect chains, as well as
   credible promises of success. This paper provides an original framework
   for `effective strategic narratives' for the case of Italy. The military
   operations undertaken by Italian armed forces in Iraq, Lebanon, and
   Libya represent the cases through which the framework is assessed.
   Drawing on content and discourse analysis of political debates and data
   provided by public opinion surveys, this paper explores the nature of
   the strategic narratives and their effectiveness.},

Title = {Integration of the Swedish Local Elite: The Role of Professional and

Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {49-74},

Abstract = {This article uses social network data to study the integration of local
   elites in four Swedish municipalities. Four research questions are
   asked. First: How integrated are the elites? While the results modify
   the picture that there are two rather distinct elites in Sweden - that
   is, a political elite dominated by the labour movement and an economic
   elite dominated by business and the large business organizations - it is
   interesting to note that integration between elite spheres is lowest for
   the relation between politicians and business representatives. To a
   considerable degree, integration between political and economic elites
   is indirect, mediated through the administrative elite. The second
   question is: Are the inner elite circles dominated by the political,
   economic or administrative elite? The study indicates that local elites
   in Sweden are strongly dominated by political elites, and also by
   administrative elites. This is reassuring, since it would indicate a
   democratic deficit if the structural power of decision making in
   municipalities resided predominantly in economic actors and
   administrators. The third question is: What is the role of friendship
   relations in creating elite integration? The study indicates that
   private relations among elites both reinforce professional networks and
   extend them in important ways. The final question is: Is elite
   integration contingent on political stability and/or the structure of
   local business? The results are surprisingly stable across the four
   municipalities, even though the largest distinction was found between
   elite core and periphery in the politically most stable municipality,
   which was also the one with the lowest economic diversity.},

Abstract = {The intensification of Russia's diplomacy in the Middle East is combined
   with a clearly defined objective: positioning itself as the new
   protector of persecuted Christians in the region. The author highlights
   both the ambitions of the Kremlin in the Mediterranean and the
   ever-growing influence of the Russian Orthodox Church, which has become
   a major political actor. Moscow sees Shiite Islam as its ally in the
   Middle East and is increasingly aligning itself with a Shiite axis
   composed of Iran, Syria, and the Lebanese Hezbollah. The author examines
   this burgeoning Russian-Shiite alliance in light of Russia's strategic
   interests in the region.},

Abstract = {Sub-Saharan Africa is the part of the world that is most severely
   affected by HIV/AIDS. Yet, surveys of attitudes to AIDS across African
   countries show that voters do not attach great importance to the issue.
   This paper argues that the low salience of AIDS is in large part a
   result of the widespread poverty that exists on the continent, which
   means that AIDS is crowded out by other issues. Using multilevel
   regressions, results from four waves of survey data support the
   hypothesis that poverty significantly affects the salience of AIDS as a
   political issue at the individual level.},

Abstract = {Hezbollah today is Lebanon's strongest political party. However, its
   military intervention in the Syrian conflict has put it at a crossroads.
   While the party's domestic strength continues, largely due to the
   weakness of its Lebanese political opponents and to its reliance on the
   possession of weapons to intimidate them, Hezbollah is facing increasing
   challenges in Syria. The author argues that as a deal on Iran's nuclear
   ambitions looms, and with it the possibility of imposed limitations on
   Iran's behavior by the international community, Hezbollah - being Iran's
   key client - will find its autonomy and ability to act in the domestic
   Lebanese sphere as well as externally reduced in the future.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is thus to further explore the relationship
   between involvement in voluntary associations at the community level and
   specific forms of political participation. We pose the following
   questions. Do voluntary associations contribute to specific forms of
   individual political participation in a consociational context? Do
   voluntary associations encourage forms of political participation aimed
   at directly interacting with the policy process, or do they promote
   extraparliamentary forms of protest? The study contributes with testing
   three different measurements of community level involvement in voluntary
   associations and their correlations with individual level political
   participation. The empirical data is based upon a mulitilevel sample of
   4232 individuals located in 33 different Swedish municipalities. Results
   show that only direct contacts with local elites are significantly
   correlated with community level participation in civil society
   organizations. This result may be interpreted as indicating that local
   voluntary associations contribute to the local political culture.},

Abstract = {In a hasty response to the 9/11 attacks, Congress authorized the
   ``war{''} against al-Qaeda in a statute known as the 2001 Authorization
   for the Use of Military Force (AUMF). It was meant to be a temporary
   grant of powers to allow the president to fight the perpetrators of the
   attack. This article analyzes how two very different presidents have
   used the 2001 AUMF to justify controversial policies in ways unforeseen
   by its congressional makers, resulting in an accruement of power to the
   executive branch that could become long term, if not permanent.},

Abstract = {Motivated by research showing that policy preferences are driven by
   social-interests rather than strict self-interest, this article examines
   if stereotypes of the rich shape Americans' tax policy preferences. For
   this project, an original free-response survey was designed asking
   respondents to describe the rich. Respondents offered 1,570 unique
   descriptions, ranging from hard working and job producer to selfish and
   inheritance. In the analysis, these stereotypes were modeled in three
   ways: (a) as affective stereotypes, (b) as discrete categories, and (c)
   as deservingness stereotypes. There are three main findings. First,
   political ideology and affective stereotypes have large and
   statistically indistinguishable effects on tax policy preferences.
   Second, deservingness stereotypesin particular, whether the rich exhibit
   dispositional and prosocial characteristicshave particularly large
   effects on preferences for taxing the wealthy. And third, both affective
   and deservingness stereotypes have an interactive effect with personal
   ideology. For self-described liberals, preferences for taxing the
   wealthy are largely a function of ideological considerations. For
   conservatives, however, tax policy preferences are determined by a mix
   of ideology and stereotypes. In sum, the findings suggest that
   stereotypes affect policy preferences even when the target belongs to an
   advantaged group and the policy domain is nonracial.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the nature and role of authority contests-the
   claims and counterclaims about whose ideas matter on policy debates and
   via what procedures they should be heard - in policy paradigm
   contestation, reform and abandonment. Examining the authority contests
   around prairie Canada's grain marketing policy illustrates an additional
   pathway-a value-driven model-to Hall's model of endogenous policy
   anomalies. It further documents differences across governments in how
   they resolve contentious policy debates, showing that governments make
   fewer efforts to supplement their own representational authority with
   expert and/or popular authority when they enjoy majoritarian support
   from the affected region than when they do not and when their support
   for paradigm change is value-driven rather than a response to policy
   anomalies.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes Rawlsian property-owning democracy in the American
   historical context. The purpose of the article is to reveal an
   ``overlapping consensus{''} between Rawlsian property-owning democracy
   and the American political tradition that in turn could be of great
   value to Rawlsians wishing to make a persuasive argument for liberal
   reforms. I examine three historical periods-Jeffersonian democracy, the
   age of Populism and Progressivism, and the New Deal-showing how New
   Dealers, with their Keynesian fiscal approach, diverged from the
   American political tradition advocated by previous reformers and how
   Rawlsian property-owning democracy, as a substitute for the capitalist
   welfare state, could reconnect with that important tradition.},

Abstract = {Previous research finds that House majority members and members in the
   president's party garner additional federal spending in their districts.
   Using federal spending data in individual districts, we implement two
   research designs to distinguish elected officials enacting policies that
   benefit like-minded voters-the party in the electorate-from those that
   benefit same-party elected officials-the party in government. We find
   robust evidence that presidential partisanship is associated with large
   differences in spending correlated with voter preferences, but little
   evidence that presidents favor areas represented by their party in the
   House. By contrast, control of the House is associated with differences
   in spending by voter preferences and with modest increases in spending
   in districts held by members of the majority. These findings have
   important implications for understanding presidential influence, as well
   as the role of parties in the House and in coordinating between elected
   branches.},

Abstract = {We respond to the critique of our article (Ackermann and Traunmuller
   2014) and argue that theories of the declining importance of
   social-structural characteristics for voting behavior are misguided.
   Instead we are interested in the more substantial question of how and
   under what conditions they become politically salient. This theoretical
   perspective opens up the view for regional and temporal variation in
   social influence processes that is at odds with traditional views of
   cleavage-voting. We support our argument by demonstrating that social
   contexts are more important for individual voting behavior today than
   decades ago. We conclude by discussing several implications for the
   study of social context effects on political behavior.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {244-262},
Abstract = {This essay critically examines one of the dominant tendencies in recent
   theoretical discussions of anarchism, postanarchism, and argues that
   this tradition fails to engage sufficiently with anarchism's history.
   Through an examination of late 19th-century anarchist political
   thought-as represented by one of its foremost exponents, Peter
   Kropotkin-we demonstrate the extent to which postanarchism has tended to
   oversimplify and misrepresent the historical tradition of anarchism. The
   article concludes by arguing that all political-theoretical discussions
   of anarchism going forward should begin with a fresh appraisal of the
   actual content of anarchist political thought, based on a rigorous
   analysis of its political, social, and cultural history.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {129-144},
Abstract = {Subsidiarity has become one of the key principles of European Union law
   since its introduction in the Treaty of Maastricht, but in recent years
   other federal or decentralized systems have cemented this principle into
   their constitutions: one example is Italy, where subsidiarity was
   encapsulated in art. 118 of the constitution as amended in 2001. This
   article surveys some of the contributions coming from Italian
   constitutionalism and adds to the debate on subsidiarity, especially
   with regards to the stimulating, yet controversial, interpretation of
   the principle offered by the Italian constitutional court, which
   permeated it with a ``centralist{''} essence. The article explores how
   subsidiarity is construed beyond EU law and argues that, while revealing
   all the elasticity of this principle, the interpretation offered by the
   Italian constitutional judges presents some risky consequences.},

Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {340-356},
Abstract = {How do civilians respond to and shape civil war? Dominant approaches
   emphasise territorial control, while rival sociological explanations
   understand civilian behaviour as rooted in justice, pleasure, and social
   norms. This paper assesses these divergent sensibilities by examining
   rebel-controlled areas from Aceh, Indonesia. Many civilians provided the
   rebels with symbolic support, information and provisions, support that
   deepened over time as the rebels established control. By disaggregating
   `civilians' into social groups, a more complex story appears. Only some
   civilian groups supported the dominant armed group, suggesting that
   control and sociological approaches can be complementary in explaining
   civilian behaviour.},

Abstract = {The article describes the role of Dushanbe as an imperial city in the
   social space of Tajikistan. Having carefully analyzed the functions
   performed by Dushanbe and its Russian-speaking residents in the internal
   structure of the Tajik community in the Soviet era, L. Blyakher shows
   that these functions are still relevant after the collapse of the Soviet
   Union. According to his conclusion, today the identification within the
   ``Russian{''} town of Dushanbe, originally isolated from the local
   territorial communities, appeared to be one of the few options of the
   Tajik political identification that can serve as a basis for the
   formation of the political nation. And since the Russians as such left,
   a layer of the ``Tajik Russians{''} (ethnic Tajiks who accepted Russian
   language and culture) is emerging to form the main population of
   Dushanbe. Thanks to their ``Russianness{''} they can rise above the
   local identity and thereby preserve the overall balance of power in the
   republic.},

   electoral knowledge of young voters in Bucaramanga (Santander-Colombia).
   This qualitative enquire into is exploratory and descriptive, and aims
   to identify the political values that are present in the subject when
   voting. The quantitative results from a survey applied randomly to 423
   voters aged between 21 and 26 years indicate that 42\% of people voted
   in the 2011 elections motivated by the candidate's proposal, 26\%
   influence by family and 8\% by media. In addition to this, 39\% of
   respondents say that they do not identify themselves with any
   ideological leaning, whereas 61\% categorize themselves in one of the
   seven options presented in the survey. This decision coincided with the
   question of the ideological leaning of the family's respondent: 26\%
   answered not to have any, 84\% answered positively. Data show the
   socio-psychological and psycho-political perspectives; the latter from
   the family's socialization of political values given that 74\% of
   respondents affirm that they talked to their families about political
   activity at some point during the week, 46\% talk occasionally and 9\%
   once a month. The study suggests to validate and analyze some data
   obtained in the second stage of the research, which centers its
   collecting information methods in focal groups and interviews.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the provisions of agreements on cooperation in
   combating various forms of crime that were signed between Poland and the
   Eastern Partnership countries. The growing international crime,
   including its organized forms, and terrorist attacks in the US and in
   Europe as well as Poland's accession to the EU have influenced the
   development of bilateral cooperation in that sphere. The scope and forms
   of cooperation regulated in the agreements between Poland and the
   Eastern Partnership countries are very similar with regard to combating
   organized crime, preventing criminal activities and detecting offenses.
   Relatively widest legal regulations of cooperation are provided for in
   the agreements between Poland, Moldova and Georgia. Common fight against
   organized crime and other forms of cooperation help achieve the
   objectives of the Eastern Partnership. The recognition of convergent and
   divergent aspects of bilateral cooperation can contribute to the
   creation of a multilateral platform for coordinated cooperation in this
   field between the European Union and these countries, and within the
   Eastern Partnership.},

   emerging states seek to affirm their status as civilized Christian
   states, the political, social and cultural equals of the older states

Abstract = {Most political economy models start from the assumption that economic
   self-interest is a key predictor of support for income redistribution. A
   growing literature, in contrast, emphasizes the role of
   ``other-oriented{''} concerns, such as social solidarity or affinity for
   the poor. These frameworks generate distinct, often conflicting
   predictions about variation in mass attitudes toward redistribution. We
   argue that this tension is in part an artifact of conceptualizing demand
   for redistribution as unidimensional and propose distinguishing between
   redistribution conceived as taking from the ``rich{''} and
   redistribution conceived as giving to the ``poor.{''} These two facets
   of redistribution prime different individual motives: self-oriented
   income maximization on the one hand and other-oriented social affinity
   with welfare beneficiaries on the other. We find strong evidence for
   this framework using British longitudinal survey data and
   cross-sectional data from four advanced industrial countries. We discuss
   the implications for studying changes in mass support for
   re-distributive social policies.},

Pages = {35-44},
Abstract = {The article deals with ideological and political processes in China
   under the leadership of Xi Jinping. The author formulates several
   methodological approaches for policy evaluation of the ``5th
   generation{''} of leaders, thoroughly analyzes the starting points of Xi
   Jinping's modernization project, and concludes that the course for the
   rejuvenation of the Chinese nation embodies an attempt to continue the
   tasks of domestic modernization while maintaining the national
   identification codes and the stability of traditional political
   mechanisms. Proclaiming the consolidating concept of ``Chinese dream{''}
   largely dictated by the necessity to find a reliable basis for the
   public consensus. In the author's opinion, the recent ideological
   campaigns (from the criticism of constitutionalism to propaganda of the
   ``core socialist values{''}), are intended to form a value basis of the
   unique Chinese way. The West, in turn, is used as the ``external
   Other{''} both by the representatives of the liberal wing of the party
   and by the advocates of conservatism. Overcoming the binary opposition
   ``China - the West{''} will mark the new era in the history of China's
   development and will mean creation of a new Chinese identity.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {571-589},
Abstract = {This response essay begins by outlining Geopolitical Economy's
   historical interpretation of Marxism. It then engages with Rick Wolff's
   suggestions for further discussion of relations between capitalist and
   noncapitalist parts of the world, addresses the definitions of key
   terms, and responds to his alternative thesis about the fate of Western
   working classes. It then argues that Kristjanson-Gural's concern about
   the book's critique of Marxist economics assumes that the critique is
   considerably milder than it is. It finds that McIntyre's arguments about
   U.S. capitalist success do not translate into arguments for U.S hegemony
   and that his arguments about U.S. capitalism's ``Schumpeterian{''}
   victories are ill evidenced. Finally, this response provides more
   support for Kellogg's arguments about the limitations of the latest
   attempt to demonstrate U.S. hegemony while taking up the issue of the
   origin of uneven and combined development (UCD) and also that of the
   ``imperial{''} nature of the USSR, both questions of considerable import
   for any left politics.},

Title = {On the Validity of the Regression Discontinuity Design for Estimating
   Electoral Effects: New Evidence from Over 40,000 Close Races},

Abstract = {The regression discontinuity (RD) design is a valuable tool for
   identifying electoral effects, but this design is only effective when
   relevant actors do not have precise control over election results.
   Several recent papers contend that such precise control is possible in
   large elections, pointing out that the incumbent party is more likely to
   win very close elections in the United States House of Representatives
   in recent periods. In this article, we examine whether similar patterns
   occur in other electoral settings, including the U.S. House in other
   time periods, statewide, state legislative, and mayoral races in the
   U.S. and national or local elections in nine other countries. No other
   case exhibits this pattern. We also cast doubt on suggested explanations
   for incumbent success in close House races. We conclude that the
   assumptions behind the RD design are likely to be met in a wide variety
   of electoral settings and offer a set of best practices for RD
   researchers going forward.},

Abstract = {Recent elections have resulted in women holding over one quarter of
   provincial legislative seats, with women in urban and Western Canada
   seeing greater success. A much smaller proportion of seats are held by
   lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) politicians, although they are found in
   similar regions. This article identifies factors such as stronger
   parties of the left, less traditional social and economic structures,
   and a greater attention to diversity in more populous urban centers as
   attributing to these results for both female and LGB candidates.},

Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {516-531},
Abstract = {Since August 2014, there has been a marked increase in the violence
   perpetrated by the Islamic State against Western hostages. Videos
   released by the Islamic State depicting the brutal executions of
   hostages have been circulated widely on social media. This has prompted
   a dialogue about governments' policies regarding negotiation with
   terrorist organisations to secure the release of their citizens held
   overseas. The United States and Britain, two non-negotiating countries,
   have faced significant criticism for this policy, which has led to the
   beheadings of several American and British citizens. This article
   analyses the discourse of two spokesmen - White House Press Secretary
   Josh Earnest, and British hostage John Cantlie - in framing the issue of
   hostage negotiations on behalf of their organisations. A grounded theory
   approach informed by framing analysis is utilised in order to identify
   dominant discourses employed in White House press briefings and John
   Cantlie's videos and articles. This article concludes that, through the
   deliberate use of discourse, the US government and the Islamic State
   shape public perception of hostage negotiations in pursuit of distinct
   policy goals.},

Abstract = {In the present work we analyze the new law of Democratization of
   Political Representation, Transparency and Electoral Equity, enacted at
   the end of 2009 in our country. We will focus particularly on the
   compulsory, simultaneous open primary election law (PASO), an initiative
   inspired by the Uruguayan model. In Uruguay the rule as applied demands
   that all officially registered parties hold simultaneous open primary
   elections, regulated by the electoral organism of the country.
   Here we examine that the main drawback of the latest reform lies in the
   fact that it attempts to force the system to use party support as an
   organizing criterion, but starting from contradictory principles based
   on antagonistic points of view about political parties, which only
   hinders a rightful appraisal of them, both in terms of their internal
   stnicture as well as their position and behaviour within the general
   overview of democratic institutions. Thus we shall see that whenever a
   kind of competition exists that is not party -ruled, personalized or
   divided into sectors, and the entire citizenry is allowed to
   participate, the results only promote fragmentation, internal
   inconsistencies, and loss of relevance of the political parties within
   the electoral scene.},

Abstract = {One of the toughest tasks for self-determination campaigns has been
   overcoming the realist characterisation of empty time as something that
   holds us together, is to be desired, is the `people's'. In the UK this
   has been understood as consensus, a mass promise which permanently
   delays action, and which makes the defence against popular sovereignty
   `communal' and moral. However strongly and dynamically it promotes
   financial sovereignty, a `Golden' image of welfare consensus still has
   an extraordinary hold over the British-left media, as we see in the
   run-up to September 2014. In the terms of state-creation, the creation
   of citizens through access to the universalist time of credit is
   franchise. The imagescape of the Golden Country is what
   self-determination is trying to unlearn.},

Abstract = {After the fall of the Soviet Union the South Caucasian states' social
   systems slipped into a severe crisis. It took more than a decade to
   overcome the negative effects of secession wars and economic collapse.
   Over the last years, many development indicators have shown progress.
   Life expectancy is on a constant rise, and all health systems provide
   free basic health care. Every child has access to schooling, and the
   quality of secondary education is improving. Georgia clearly shows the
   most promising developments, although it is economically in the weakest
   position. Azerbaijan, on the other hand, has not used the economic
   benefits from its oil industry to finance broader access to health care
   and education.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {227-241},
Abstract = {The article explores how media representations influence ideas about
   legitimate behaviour within a civil society organization (CSO). We
   develop understanding of the mediatization of CSOs, and in particular of
   how media coverage influences internal practices and decision-making.
   The analysis is based on a case study of the Swedish Red Cross and
   illustrates how (negative) media exposure influences the conditions for,
   and behaviour of, a CSO. The findings demonstrate that media constructed
   a legitimacy crisis and that the organization over time adjusted to the
   media story to maintain its legitimacy. The findings also suggest that
   professional communicators play significant roles in carrying and
   reinforcing ideas within CSOs about the importance of controlling media
   attention.},

Abstract = {This article examines whether the crisis caused a quantum leap in the
   scope and intensity of politicization compared with previous integration
   debates. We compare the public debate on the Eurozone crisis with
   previous debates on European integration in six West European countries
   (Austria, Britain, France, Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland) spanning
   the past forty years. The article concludes that the Eurozone crisis was
   politicized in the countries under scrutiny, but that it did not cause a
   quantum leap in the level and scope of political conflict. Rather, it
   reinforced the dominance of executive elites in public debate.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},

Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {80-99},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article offers a spatial theory to explain how a centrist third
   party gains votes via the ideological depolarization of its two main
   competitors towards the centre ground. Using the cases of British
   elections in 2001, 2005 and 2010, during which the two main parties,
   Labour and the Conservatives, were ideologically similar, the article
   reveals how perceived similarities between these parties led voters to
   turn to alternative issues and criteria - which benefited the third
   party, the Liberal Democrats - to decide their vote. Major parties
   therefore trade a proximity benefit of chasing the median voter against
   a separation benefit whereby votes can be lost due to voter
   indifference. The expectations are supported by analyses of vote choices
   using two measures of indifference, although the incentives do not apply
   equally in all three elections. The article reveals that indifference is
   not just relevant to voter abstention, as applied in existing spatial
   theories, but is also relevant to the basis of the vote choice and to
   votes for third parties. The implications are important for spatial
   models of party competition.},

Abstract = {Modern citizenship, with its exclusions and disaggregated freedoms, has
   a distinct genealogy in the state-formation of settler societies. Ethnic
   tensions and indigenous rights-claiming in many Anglophone states are
   frequently traced to their beginnings as settler societies. This is not
   only a legacy of the rights-claiming discourses of settlers, traced in
   individual national histories. It owes much to the formal body of
   literature that justified settler states not primarily as the embodiment
   of a nation but for the government of transnational populations. Using
   the writings of Edward Gibbon Wakefield and his contemporaries, this
   article examines the settler as a problem in British liberal thought.
   Wakefield's unease about the settler as a political subject drew
   together three contemporary discourses, the critique of American
   society, post-Malthus thinking on poverty and the systematic
   colonization movement. For Wakefield, settler societies could only
   prosper through central planning, surveillance and land price fixing,
   leading to class formation.},

Abstract = {In this article, I focus on Chapters 4 and 5 of On the People's Terms,
   chapters that deal with democratic influence and control. I take an
   applied political science approach to how Pettit's republic might be
   practically achieved by exploring the under-appreciated capacity of
   elections to mobilise the resistance-prone, contestatory public upon
   which his republicanism depends. Whereas Pettit tends to focus on public
   contestation between elections and only demands that the public has the
   opportunity to vote when elections are held, I argue that they should be
   given a more prominent role within his republic and further, that access
   to voting is not enough: rather, citizens should actually vote. In order
   to ensure that participation is socially inclusive and that the public's
   attempts at influence are `individualised', `unconditioned' and
   `efficacious' in the manner Pettit desires, I suggest that compulsory
   voting should be a major pillar of his republicanism.},

Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {461-487},
Abstract = {Many hypothesize that the divergence between Democratic and Republican
   members of Congress is partly attributable to partisan primary
   elections. Yet most empirical evidence on the influence of primary
   elections finds small to no effect on member behavior. I argue that
   existing designs that compare members elected out of nomination systems
   with more open rules of access to members elected out of more closed
   systems rest on the crucial and untested assumption that more closed
   institutions lead to more polarized primary electorates. With survey
   opinions, turnout validated to voter files, and an IRT model of
   ideology, I characterize the preferences of Democratic and Republican
   primary electorates and general electorates in each House district in
   2010 and 2012. To the extent that there is a relationship between
   primary ideology and closed primary institution, it is in the direction
   opposite that hypothesized. I then show that the primary electorate
   diverges from the general electorate in every House district and even
   from supporters of the party in the general election in almost every
   district, which is consistent with a centrifugal influence of primary
   voters. These results suggest that institution of nomination may not
   have a large influence on the type of voters who turn out, and that some
   other feature of nominating contests must be implicated in polarized
   primary voters.},

Title = {Variables and Challenges in Assessing EU Experts' Performance},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},

Volume = {3},

Pages = {166-178},
Abstract = {Expert advice in political processes is supposed to improve decisions.
   If expertise fails in this function, a legitimacy problem occurs:
   granting political power to experts may be defensible, but only on the
   grounds that it contributes to enlightening political processes and
   facilitate problem-solving. The paper provides a theoretical exploration
   of four variables that are key when assessing the epistemic quality of
   expert deliberations: the degree to which these deliberations are 1)
   informed by technical expertise, 2) regulated by epistemically optimal
   respect and inclusion norms, 3) focused on politically relevant and
   applicable knowledge, and 4) approaching questions involving moral
   judgment and standard setting competently. Previous research on the
   European Commission's use of expert advice has more or less overlooked
   the question of experts' epistemic performance, and this paper discusses
   the possible reasons for this in light of well-known methodological
   challenges in studies of elite behaviour; access and bias problems. A
   discussion of the merits and limitations of different available data on
   the Commission experts shows that the biggest obstacle in the study of
   experts' epistemic performance is rather the problem of epistemic
   asymmetry, i.e. of how researchers as non-experts can assess the
   epistemic quality of experts' contributions and behaviour. The paper
   offers, finally, a set of strategies to get research going despite this
   problem.},

Abstract = {The current political developments in Libya and northern Mali represent
   nothing less than the renegotiation of the postcolonial political order.
   The toppling of Libya's authoritarian regime and the country's
   subsequent disintegration into post-revolutionary camps, plus the
   continuing Tuareg rebellion in northern Mali accompanied by the rise of
   transnational jihadist forces, have fostered the fragmentation of state
   structures, greater heterogeneity in politics, and gains by nonstate
   power groups on the complex political stage. To assess these processes
   the article proposes three theoretical concepts and fields of research:
   heterarchy (historical and present), connectivities in northwest Africa,
   and the importance of local actors/locality.},

Title = {Althusser and Italy: A Two-Fold Challenge to Gramsci and Della Volpe},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {200-210},
Abstract = {During the 1960s, the ``exchange{''} between Louis Althusser and Italian
   Marxist philosophers developed around the theme of the autonomy of
   Marxism. Harmony between the theories of Althusser and Galvano Della
   Volpe (and his students) was short-lived, and there was a definitive
   break around the relationship between science and ideology. The chief
   intermediary for introducing Althusser's thought to Italy was Cesare
   Luporini, a philosopher and an active member of the Italian Communist
   Party who brought For Marx and Reading Capital to Italy. Althusser's
   grappling with Gramsci was constant, and after the critiques of
   historicist Marxism, the author of Prison Notebooks came to hold
   influence over the French philosopher with regard to political matters.
   As Althusser's thought developed, considerable weight was also held by
   the reading, mediated by Gramsci, of the works of Niccolo Machiavelli,
   which consolidated his relationship with Italian political and
   philosophical culture. Althusser managed to catch a glimpse of the
   philosophical significance of the Gramscian conception of reality as
   relations of forces (the philosophy of praxis) beyond the historicist
   and humanist schema within which he had enclosed Gramsci in Reading
   Capital. But his reading of Machiavelli would develop in the direction
   of so-called aleatory materialism, also because to Althusser (for
   deeply-held political reasons: his attachment to classism and to the
   division of the world into two adversarial camps), the Gramscian
   category of hegemony would always remain extraneous.},

Abstract = {Commentators suggest that the UK is entering a period in which general
   election results are unlikely to produce a clear winner. In such a
   situation, how and where the constituency boundaries are drawn is
   crucial, as different configurations of seats in particular places could
   have a significant impact on an election outcome. Although those
   configurations are recommended to Parliament by non-partisan Boundary
   Commissions, research has shown that Labour has been significantly
   advantaged by their recent proposals because they incorporated the
   equivalents of two well-known American electoral abuses -
   malapportionment and gerrymandering. This article illustrates how and
   why they have operated and discusses how the Conservatives' failed
   attempt to remove one of them (malapportionment) and influence the other
   (gerrymandering) might have impacted on its position prior to the 2015
   general election.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},

Volume = {18},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {One test of the practical relevance of any theory of international
   justice will be to apply it to the case of global climate change.
   Several thinkers have already dismissed John Rawls's Law of Peoples as a
   possible candidate for helping to manage this problem, arguing, among
   other things, that it demands too little, too late. This paper revisits
   and defends the Rawlsian framework as a viable approach to managing
   climate change. In particular, it argues that the duty to assist (the
   eighth principle of the Law of Peoples) may actually be an invaluable
   resource for dealing with the now inevitable consequences of global
   climate change.},

Title = {Reform or cataclysm? The agreement of 8 February 1914 regarding the
   Ottoman eastern provinces},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {285-304},
Abstract = {On 8 February 1914, Ottoman Grand Vizier Said Halim and the Russian
   charge d'affaires Konstantin Gulkevich signed a reform project for seven
   Ottoman eastern provinces that covered roughly half of Asia Minor. This
   international Reform Agreement differed considerably from a first
   Russian draft the year before. Though little known by most World War I
   historians in the West, this agreement was a central but fragile piece
   for the future of Ottoman coexistence in egalitarian terms in Asia Minor
   on the eve of World War I. Often called `Armenian Reforms', it was also
   a last seminal, more or less consensual project of European diplomacy
   before the latter's breakdown in the July crisis of 1914. Important
   Ottoman and non-Ottoman protagonists then chose the road towards
   cataclysm instead of efforts for Ottoman coexistence, reform and
   international consensus building. The cataclysm of greater Europe in
   World War I produced various seminal outcomes. One main result in the
   Levant was a Turkish nation-state in Asia Minor that excluded Asia
   Minor's Christians and tried to assimilate non-Turkish Muslims, above
   all Kurds, into `Turkdom'. This article argues that the agreement of
   1914 had opened for a short time a completely different perspective and
   that it played a crucial role on the road that led to genocide in spring
   1915. Its postulates are still topical.},

   development have made it impossible for North Korea to make any
   significant progress in finding the breakthrough. In this gloomy
   atmosphere, the North's relations with Russia seem the most promising in
   2015.},

Title = {The Judicial Role in Defining National Security and Access to
   Information in South Africa},
Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {275-297},
Abstract = {This article argues that judicial and other institutions concerned with
   legal interpretation are playing an increasing role in regulating and
   defining the concept of national security for South Africa, particularly
   in the realm of national security information. Part I surveys the
   post-apartheid evolution of accountability of South Africa's national
   security agencies with particular attention to the treatment of national
   security information. Starting from a low base, intelligence agencies in
   South Africa have become more accountable, in part through the greater
   degree of access to national security information. Part II portrays the
   placement of access to national security information within South
   Africa's legislative framework, taking into account the keys laws
   underpinning both secrecy and disclosure regulation. Here, with no
   definition of national security on the secrecy side, it is on the
   disclosure side of South Africa's legislative framework that the
   judiciary and other legal actors are crafting an operative definition of
   national security. Part III covers three recent developments, arguing
   that they demonstrate the increasingly important regulatory role played
   by the judiciary and other legal institutions. These include two key
   Constitutional Court decisions and an ongoing legislative reform effort.},

Year = {2015},

Pages = {117-136},
Abstract = {Between 26 and 28 May 2014 p.esidential elections were held in Egypt.
   The majority of voters (96.91\%) voted in favor of ex-Defense Minister
   Abd al-Fattah al-Sisi, whereas only 3.09\% of the votes were cast for
   the leader of the Egyptian legal leftist opposition, Chairman of the
   Egyptian Popular Current Hamdeen Sabahi. It is known that the main
   opponent to the election of a new president was the banned Muslim
   Brothers movement, whose de facto leader Mohamed Morsi was ousted as a
   result of the ``June 30 Revolution,{''} and the action of the
   constitution (adopted in December 2012, during his reign) was suspended.
   The Muslim Brothers urged their supporters to boycott the presidential
   elections in 2014. Our mathematical analysis of the results of the May
   2014 Egyptian presidential elections shows that the level of support by
   the Egyptians of the Muslim Brotherhood in the first five months of 2014
   grew very noticeable (especially in Middle Egypt), and a more or less
   high level of support of the al-Sisi regime was only observed in May
   2014 in most provinces of the Delta as well as in Port Said.},

Title = {A framework for social investment strategies: Integrating generational,

Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {131-149},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {From 2013 the European Union has promoted social investments as a
   national reform strategy to increase individuals' capacities and
   national economic growth. However, to take full advantage of social
   investments, the strategy needs a more coherent framework that takes
   into account the dynamic and multidimensional nature of social issues
   and social investments. Theoretically, this article establishes such a
   framework consisting of generational, life course and gender
   perspectives on social investments. The generational perspective brings
   out that social investments involve horizontal redistribution, underpin
   the productive and reproductive social contract between generations, and
   the increased diversity within generations. The life course perspective
   demonstrates how social issues and social investments in one life stage
   depend on the situation in prior life stages and affect the situation in
   later life stages and, possibly, in multiple dimensions. The gender
   perspective shows how social investments can improve economic and social
   returns when gender and ageing over the life course are taken into
   consideration. Empirically, cross-national patterns indicate a positive
   relation between social investment policies and returns.},

   Moscow has shown itself keen to reinvigorate its relationship with

Abstract = {Political competition should protect judicial autonomy. A host of
   studies produce evidence that is consistent with this expectation. The
   influence of political competition operates through two distinct
   mechanisms: fragmentation and turnover. Most empirical studies treat
   them as mutually reinforcing. We explain why each of these effects
   should be most clear when the other one is inactive: when power is
   concentrated only the expectation of turnover may protect judicial
   autonomy; when turnover seems unlikely only fragmentation should prevent
   interferences on the judiciary. We test these hypotheses using an
   original data set comprising all justices that served in the 24
   provincial supreme courts in Argentina between 1984 and 2008. Results of
   a survival model with competing risks support our argument. The effect
   of fragmentation is discernible when turnover seems unlikely. The
   expectation of turnover restrains incumbents particularly when power is
   concentrated.},

Abstract = {The paper deals with the concept of ``Europe{''} in the Revista de
   Occidente (1923-1936) and it's recpeption by Jose Ortega y Gasset
   (1883-1955). Through discourse analysis the paper deepenth into the key
   factors of influence that were transfered to Spain during the interwar
   period by the Revista de Occidente and the numerous translations made by
   its publishing house between 1923 and 1936. The analisis reveals three
   decisive factors that determined the concept of ``Europe{''} of Ortega
   and the so called ``circle of the Revista de Occidente{''} : (a) the

   metaphysics of Herman von Keyserling (1880-1946) and (c) the

   of these keyfactors generated several residua in the concept of

Abstract = {This article tackles the issue of social citizenship in Europe, beyond
   its legal and political definition, as the result of social mechanisms
   and practices, and it assumes the cosmopolitan perspective as a
   conceptual tool for the interpretation of changes in its principles and
   structure as related to Europeanization and globalisation. It starts
   from the heuristic value of the concept, grounded in modern industrial
   societies and built on its institutions and forms of social solidarity.
   Then it draws on the debate about the challenges of the welfare state
   and capitalism's transformations, as well as on the impact on social
   citizenship of the European integration process. It proposes
   cosmopolitanism as a lens for catching cosmopolitan ideas, narratives
   and values that contribute to creating new practices of solidarity and
   mutual recognition, which are the basis for the construction of new
   kinds of sustainable social citizenship in Europe. The European social
   forum of 2012 has been considered a significant case study for an
   empirical exploration of the cosmopolitan imagination as a factual
   process. A cosmopolitan epistemology takes shape, based on the values of
   commons and global public goods. Meanings, actions and practices
   enhanced by social actors, building solidarity in diversity and
   following global-local logics, show forms of recognition of otherness
   and of sharing global responsibilities representing a tendency towards a
   new conception of European social citizenship. Social rights and
   recognition beyond territorial boundaries are at the core of the
   construction of a cosmopolitan citizenship in Europe.},

Abstract = {At the root of the West's conventional military dominance lie investment
   in and the operationalisation of advances in science and technology
   (S\&T). However, with the funding behind this long-held military edge
   now being scaled back as part of a wider austerity drive, it is
   ever-more important that governments invest their money wisely and that
   new technology is operationalised as effectively as possible. John Louth
   and Justin Bronk draw on interviews with policy-makers, industry figures
   and military personnel as well as novel-technology case studies to argue
   for the `operationalisation' of uncertainty in the early design stages
   of capability planning, thereby allowing for the inclusion of mature
   technology at a much later date.},

Title = {THE POLITICAL DIMENSION OF SOCIAL INEQUALITY AND POVERTY (Comparative
   Experience)},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2015},
Number = {5},
Pages = {94-106},
Abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of trends and political aspects
   of social inequality. The author argues that the issues of inequality
   move to the center of sociopolitical relations. The future of modern
   civilization largely depends on the transition to positive patterns of
   inequality and social justice that promotes formation of growth
   potential and social cohesion. But the process is highly controversial:
   the type of inequality based on material wealth is still a dominant
   feature. Since the end of the 20th century social policy in Western
   countries has undergone inadequate changes. The growing impact of global
   competition enhances the growth of poverty and social inequality which
   is associated with significant increase in unemployment,
   disproportionate trends in income growth of social and professional
   groups, and cuts in social programs. There are signs of restructuring of
   inequality patterns. Despite some improvements, social inequality and
   poverty are significant and remain a serious problem throughout the
   world, including developed countries. This leads to the rise of the
   proportion of citizens who experience a direct decline in living
   standard. The threat is that high levels of inequality define
   considerable distinctions in social opportunities that create a
   permanent and deep conflict of social interests which can be transferred
   to the political level. As a result, the European social model which has
   contributed to significant poverty reduction, promoted social growth and
   social cohesion is under increasing pressure. As for Russia, it needs a
   strategic consolidation with high degree of social cohesion on major
   issues, especially of internal development. The perspective depends on
   the amplification of factors of cohesion, and therefore, measures
   designed to tackle extreme inequality and narrow the space of social
   injustice. This involves transformation of sociopolitical strategy aimed
   at the alignment of social opportunities, the growth of progressive
   taxation of super-high revenues, capital and wealth. Russia needs a
   socially balanced political strategy with the emphasis on the adequate
   contribution to the process of modernization from social groups which
   control the most part of national wealth. Achieving social and political
   consensus in Russia on these issues is essential and can open the door
   to stable and long-term social cohesion, effectively address the
   strategic issues of sustainable development and growth of social
   welfare.},

Title = {The missing spirals of violence: four waves of movement-countermovement

Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {7},

Pages = {53-68},
Abstract = {Since the Second World War, Great Britain has witnessed a recurring
   escalation and de-escalation of confrontations between extreme
   right-wing or anti-minority protest groups on the one hand and, on the
   other, militant anti-fascist or anti-racist groups, and latterly also a
   number of extreme Islamist groups. In this article, we trace the outline
   of four waves of these movement-countermovement contests in order to
   engage critically with ideas of what some academics have called{''}
   cumulative extremism (CE){''}. Contrary to the tenor of much of the
   public, policy and academic debate around such contests, we draw
   attention to what we describe as the missing spirals of violence. In
   order to better explain and accommodate these empirical findings, we
   argue that it is important to resist the temptation to reduce ``CE{''}
   to a process of ``tit-for-tat{''} violence. We outline four factors that
   have been particularly important in shaping patterns of interactive
   escalation, de-escalation and non-escalation in the case studies
   described: the broader strategic aims of activist groups; dynamics of
   intra-movement control and leadership; the actions of and activist's
   interactions with state actors; and emergent movement cultures and
   identities.},

Title = {THE COLOMBIAN LEFT, A PARTICULAR CASE IN THE LATIN-AMERICAN Scenario},
Journal = {PENSAMIENTO AL MARGEN},
Year = {2015},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {For the last 25 years two clear phenomena can be appreciated in the
   Latin American political context. Firstly, the crisis of the neoliberal
   approach, installed in the continent since the Washington Consensus, and
   secondly the popular response which lead to the rising of some movements
   belonging to a wide left-wing spectrum. Colombia, despite the fact of
   keeping an active social mobilisation, has not managed to join this
   regional tendency. The permanent USA intervention, the violence used as
   a political instrument by the Colombian elites, and the left-wing
   dispersion seem to be among the main explanations for this situation. As
   a response to the state violence and the closing of the democratic
   spaces, a part of the left-wing took up arms refuting the regime
   legitimacy. Meanwhile, other part kept within the institutional
   framework, in spite of the risks. The State, which was determined to end
   the armed uprising by force, adopted a militaristic tendency aiming to
   the guerrilla persecution, but which was extended to the whole
   democratic left-wing and social movement. However, the Peace Talks have
   opened the possibility of getting over the confrontation. Before the
   possible signature of a peace agreement, the debate on the left-wing
   unity is back in force, but this time with an additional element: the
   possibility for the political movements resulting from the agreement to
   be able to join the dreamed alignment.},

Abstract = {Drawing on an empirical study on French second-wave feminist activists,
   this article examines the spread of feminism in their families, a
   dimension that has received little attention in the literature. More
   precisely, I examine how a feminist legacy is diversely received and
   appropriated by the feminists' offspring. The first part provides a
   general overview of these legacies and their mechanisms of transmission.
   The second part explores four cases of feminists' children in order to
   illuminate different forms of appropriation, ranging from the
   interiorization of some feminist contents to political and militant
   appropriations. Drawing also on the data coming from other cases
   encountered in the investigation, the analysis points out some general
   elements that account for the observed variations between the children
   in the appropriation of the feminist legacy.},

Abstract = {The international development agenda is in flux, and this poses a
   challenge to all development actors, including the European Union. In
   this paper, I argue (1) that development progress has been substantial,
   with fewer countries now classified as ``low income,{''} and most of
   those characterised as fragile states which need new kinds of
   intervention; (2) that the adoption of the new Sustainable Development
   Goals creates a new set of challenges, especially around the linking of
   poverty and environmental goals; (3) that the combination of a new
   poverty context and the increased profile of environmental goals shapes
   a new frontier in international development thinking and action; and (4)
   that the EU, especially the European institutions, rather than just the
   Member States, is well placed to lead at the new frontier, provided it
   follows through on current policy initiatives. An action agenda follows
   from these arguments, especially in relation to the formulation and
   implementation of the new EU global strategy. Policy coherence becomes
   ever more important in development cooperation.},

Abstract = {The ideal of the ``democratic classroom{''} has been discussed in
   educational circles for several years. This article answers the question
   of whether there are specific advantages to be derived from a
   democratization of the political science classroom, especially one in
   which democracy itself is a focus of study. Can giving students more
   power over course content enhance their understanding of democratic
   authority and process? The author approached these questions by adding
   several ``democratizing{''} elements to a seminar course, most notably a
   ``democratic syllabus{''} in which students determined discussion
   topics, led class sessions, and submitted work of their own choosing.
   Student surveys and the author's reflection suggest that the democratic
   syllabus was a success in terms of the classroom dynamics that it
   engendered and the thinking about democratic politics and citizenship
   that it encouraged. Both students and professor agreed that the
   democratic syllabus presented challenges that should be considered by
   anyone thinking about creating or modifying a course on this model. Yet
   this article argues that many political science courses would benefit
   from similar endeavors in classroom democratization.},
