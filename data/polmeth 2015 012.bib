Abstract = {Ilya Somin argues that in light of the public's rational political
   ignorance we should make government smaller. But his account of the
   phenomenon of rational ignorance does not justify his policy
   prescription of smaller government; on the contrary, it implies that we
   should revamp the current framework of democratic institutions. This is
   because, since Somin fails to set out a principled basis on which to
   value democracy even in the face of rational ignorance, he cannot
   explain why we should want any democratic government, however small it
   may be. If rational ignorance is as grave a challenge to democracy as he
   takes it to be, it would seem to demand either radical institutional
   innovation or, alternatively, an abandonment of certain democratic
   principles. By not explaining why we should value citizens' involvement
   in politics at all, and why we might therefore draw different policy
   conclusions than he does himself, Somin's book ultimately fails to do
   full justice to the important questions that it raises.},

Abstract = {Nigeria's bid for the United Nations Security Council permanent seat
   received a boost from the African Union (AU) at its Golden Jubilee
   Summit in Addis Ababa the other day. Africa sent an appropriate signal
   to the world that it could work in unity to pursue its collective
   interest. The country was endorsed by the AU Executive Council in a
   pleasant display of solidarity and consensus. Coming against the
   background of an earlier endorsement by the Economic Community of West
   Africa (ECOWAS), this new wave of solidarity is commendable. It should
   be harnessed to win the support of more member states of the global body
   at the crucial vote of the United Nations General Assembly. Hence, the
   argument that the Security Council membership be expanded to include
   major financial contributors and the equitable representation of the
   regional spread. There is every indication that Nigeria has all it takes
   to represent Africa in an enlarged Security Council. But considering the
   vagaries associated with international politics, a lot still needs to be
   done by Nigeria to garner the overwhelming support from Africa that will
   enable her to emerge as a consensus candidate for Africa.},

Title = {Judicial Influence on Policy Outputs? The Political Constraints of Legal
   Integration in the European Union},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {48},

Abstract = {The ability of courts to generate political change has long been debated
   in national, comparative, and international politics. In the examination
   of the interaction between judicial and legislative politics, scholars
   have disagreed on the degree of judicial power and the ability of
   politics to override unwanted jurisprudence. In this debate, the Court
   of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has become famous for its
   central and occasionally controversial role in European integration.
   This article examines to what extent and under which conditions judicial
   decisions influence European Union (EU) social policy outputs. A
   taxonomy of judicial influence is constructed, and expectations of
   institutional and political conditions on judicial influence are
   presented. The analysis draws on an extensive novel data set and
   examines judicial influence on EU social policies over time, that is,
   between 1958 and 2014, as well as for case studies of working-time
   regulations and patients' rights. The findings demonstrate that both the
   codification and overriding of judicial decisions are unlikely in the
   contemporary EU-28 of fragmented politics. However, modification and
   nonadoption constitute other political responses to attenuate unwelcome
   jurisprudence and constrain the legislative effect of judicial
   decisions.},

Abstract = {Can the U.S. Congress address major challenges? Can Congress govern?
   Questions like these keep getting asked. This article addresses them by
   consulting the record since 1789. Given the separation-of-powers
   structure of the American system, such questions cannot be addressed
   directly. They need to be deconstructed. The presidency needs to enter
   the discussion, too. Also, what is a major challenge? To identify such
   challenges, and to supply a way of seeing how and in what respects
   Congress, as well as in a background frame the U.S. system more broadly,
   has performed, I draw on comparative analysis. How has the United States
   participated in thirteen major impulses that have invested a comparable
   set of nations at various times since the late eighteenth century? These
   challenges range from launching a new nation through building a welfare
   state through dealing with climate change and debt/deficit problems

Abstract = {This article analyzes the ideological culture conditions and previous
   electoral reforms to the political change (1997) as explanatory
   variables of the successive defeats of the party left in Nuevo Leon. It
   is considered that in a context of organizational weakness and low
   ideological penetration of the leftist parties, federal and local
   electoral reforms (1977) (1987), designed from strategy to encourage
   plurality in the party system, were more while the effect of generating
   the characterization of a model where the PRI maintained although the
   prevalence, space opened tends toward bipartisanship with the PAN. The
   evidence we found is that the election results of 1979-1994-a period
   before the political change in the State-,gradually led to a legislative
   creation of this court, where the party left was reduced and
   marginalized as electoral choice.},

Abstract = {This article explores the developmental consequences of forced
   settlement colonization, based on the large-scale import of African
   slaves and/or Asian indentured laborers into newly settled territories.
   Paradoxically, forced settlement resulted in superior levels of
   educational attainment and postcolonial democracy than European
   domination over indigenous populations (i.e., colonial occupation) among
   countries and territories decolonized after 1945. This relationship is
   robust to statistical controls for British rule, European settlement,
   socio-economic development, ethnicity, religious composition, and
   geography. Investigating the role of Protestant missionaries and
   colonial legal institutions as possible causal mechanisms linking forced
   settlement to surprisingly favorable developmental outcomes, I find that
   directly ruled colonies that universalized metropolitan legal rights
   prior to World War II have performed better than colonies that
   maintained distinct ``native codes{''} for indigenous populations.},

Abstract = {This article examines whether voters' use of the internet as a source of
   political news affects the extent to which they are certain of their
   vote choice in national-level elections. It employs data pertaining to
   the 2011 general election in Ireland, linking geographical information
   on broadband coverage with individual-level public opinion data from the
   2011 Irish National Election Study. The resultant dataset allows the
   adoption of a quasi-experimental approach in our examination of the
   effects of online political newsgathering on voters' electoral
   uncertainty. Implementing instrumental variables, the study finds
   consistent evidence of a causal relationship between the use of the
   internet as a source of political information and increased levels of
   political uncertainty among voters, ceteris paribus. These findings are
   robust to a range of model specifications and alternative
   operationalizations of dependent and independent variables.},

Abstract = {This paper tests the Varieties of Capitalism (VoC) framework to explain
   variation in fiscal stimulus measures across OECD countries in response
   to the 2008-2010 economic crisis. Following Soskice (2007), I argue that
   coordinated market economies are less flexible with fiscal policy than
   liberal market economies. Multivariate analysis across 23 OECD countries
   demonstrates that VoC is more powerful than three competing theories:
   fiscal institutions, which hypothesizes more stimulus in countries with
   less restrictive budgetary rules; debt credibility, which hypothesizes
   more stimulus in less indebted countries; and political partisanship,
   which hypothesizes more stimulus in countries governed by the left.},

   Huntington emphasized the existence of two major approaches to TJ - for
   and against - this article argues there is a third way that has been
   relatively understudied - strategic silence. It will be argued that,
   under certain conditions, political calculations can lead to the
   adoption of silence as a deliberate strategy by certain political actors
   in TJ processes. Focusing on the Portuguese case (1974-1976), the
   article explores why, and under what conditions, silence is perceived as
   the best strategy in dealing with the past following the defeat or
   breakdown of an authoritarian regime.},

Abstract = {A decision to replace Trident with a like-for-like system will see the
   UK remain in the nuclear-weapons business well into the second half of
   this century, but it is far from clear that reliance on a small,
   retaliatory nuclear capability for deterrence would be the best approach
   to an increasingly complex future nuclear-threat landscape. Andrew
   Futter argues that the requirements of deterrence are perhaps more
   blurred today than at any point in the nuclear age-a situation only
   likely to get worse. A more holistic and long-term view of UK nuclear
   policy is needed, with greater consideration given to how
   techno-military, strategic and, to a lesser extent, political-normative
   developments are likely to alter, if not transform, the nature of the
   future deterrence environment.},

Title = {The hidden cost of phosphate fertilizers: mapping multi-stakeholder
   supply chain risks and impacts from mine to fork},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE PEACE \& SECURITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {323-343},
Month = {SEP 2},
Abstract = {Without phosphorus, we could not produce food. Farmers need access to
   phosphate fertilizers to achieve the high crop yields needed to feed the
   world. Yet growing global demand for phosphorus could surpass supply in
   the coming decades, and the world currently largely relies on
   non-renewable phosphate rock that is mined in only a few countries.
   Morocco alone controls 75\% of the remaining reserves, including those
   in the conflict territory of Western Sahara. While some argue that the
   market will take care of any scarcity, the market price of phosphate
   fertilizers fails to account for far-ranging negative impacts. Drawing
   on multi-stakeholder supply chain risk frameworks, the article
   identifies a range of negative impacts, including the exploitation and
   displacement of the Saharawi people, the destruction of aquatic
   ecosystems by nutrient pollution, and jeopardizing future generations'
   ability to produce food. This paper fills a crucial gap in understanding
   phosphorus impacts by mapping and discussing the nature of phosphorus
   supply chain risks, and the transmission of such risks to different
   stakeholder groups. It also identifies a range of potential
   interventions to mitigate and manage those risks. In addition, the paper
   highlights that while risks are diverse, from geopolitical to
   ecological, those groups adversely affected are also diverse - including
   the Saharawi people, farmers, businesses, food consumers and the
   environment. Potential risk mitigation strategies range from resource
   sparing (using phosphorus more sparingly to extend the life of high
   quality rock for ourselves and future generations), to resource
   diversification (sourcing phosphorus from a range of ethical sources to
   reduce dependence on imported phosphate, as a buffer against supply
   disruptions, and preferencing those sources with lower societal costs),
   and sharing the responsibility for these costs and consequences.},

Abstract = {What explains individual support for inter-regional redistribution? Few
   studies examine support for regional redistribution, even though such
   issues are politically salient in many democracies. We test models that
   hypothesize that such preferences are affected by regional and
   individual income, as well as other arguments beyond the traditional
   political economy framework. We focus on informational assumptions and
   implications of these models with an experiment embedded in a nationally
   representative survey in Spain. We randomly inform some citizens of the
   true relative income of their region to assess the impact of this
   information on regional redistribution preferences. We find that
   citizens' learning about their region's relative position affects these
   preferences in a manner consistent with some of the political economy
   models. We also find some support for out-group concerns as an important
   factor. The findings have implications for the applicability of economic
   models to explaining support for regional arrangements.},

Abstract = {As a supplement to the classic works of electoral studies, this article
   investigates the relationships to politics and vote of working-class
   youth from the Parisian banlieues on the basis of a qualitative field
   study conducted during the 2012 presidential campaign. In doing so it
   addresses the general question of why and how a population that is
   usually seen as disconnected from politics votes anyway. We show that
   disinterest in politics does not equate to dispossession. Internal
   divides within the working class, elliptic appropriations, personal
   references and everyday life all contribute to the construction of
   opinions that translate into electoral positions. Finally, this article
   constitutes a methodological contribution to electoral sociology in
   addition to quantitative works.},

Abstract = {In this article we provide a theoretical and empirical evaluation of the
   evolution of partisan alignments in Latin America since the beginning of
   the Third Wave of democratization. We first point to a series of
   limitations of the conventional framework of partisan alignments, namely
   their disregard of party systems that are only partially or
   non-institutionalized. Second, we propose a refined framework that is
   more universally applicable. We then operationalize our indicators and
   apply our new framework to every democratic country in Latin America to
   generate a map of the evolution of partisan loyalties in Latin America
   in the period 1980-2012. Our analysis reveals that the conventional view
   of widespread partisan dealignment in Latin America is largely
   inaccurate.},

Abstract = {This state of the art essay examines past and current research on the
   topic of politics and the web. First of all, we define the three main
   stages in the evolution of relations between politics and the web, in
   order to contextualize the present situation. Secondly, we analyze the
   main fields of research in political communication in the age of social
   networks, with particular attention to the central role assumed by
   Twitter. The essay ends focusing the switch from the ``web politics{''}
   to the ``networked politics{''}, with an overview of most important
   studies about the new digital environments impact on organizational
   forms of politics and of political communication.},

Abstract = {Following Russia's actions in Ukraine, the discourse of ``hybrid
   warfare{''} became a hotly debated topic among political experts. While
   not new for practitioners, the scale and scope of this hybrid war, as
   well as the unpreparedness of EU member states and their partners,
   resulted in the need to face new challenges and to address unknown
   threats that cannot be addressed by single actors. In this article, the
   author analyzes the ways hybrid warfare targets the Eastern Partnership
   states, which in addition to Ukraine are second-level targets, and
   underscores the necessity to correlate European policy towards Eastern
   neighbors in consideration of the reality and threats of hybrid warfare.},

   transport/telecommunications technology, the revival of the European
   colonialism and the ``awakening of Asia{''}) on the other hand brought
   about a renewal of the interest in the complex relation between space
   and power, politics and geography. The article contends that the
   American geopolitical discourse both reflected that spatial
   transformation and undertook the task of assessing its likely
   consequences for the national security of the United States and the
   survival of its peculiar way of life. In so doing Geopolitics drew a new
   global map of the opportunities and the threats to the United States'
   fundamental interests and furnished a criterion for identifying
   America's friends and foes in the international arena, which in turn
   influenced the American foreign policy and contributed to the rise and
   evolution of the American internationalism.},

Abstract = {Most lobbying is invisible, meaning that interest groups routinely
   contact government officials off the public record. While such lobbying
   is ubiquitous, whether and how it may affect public policy
   decision-making remains largely unknown. I theorize that lobbying that
   employs both invisible and visible tactics is the most influential. I
   study the development of 38 health-related regulatory policies in
   Wisconsin to assess this argument. I employ government records, survey
   data from more than 350 individuals, and interviews with 15 state
   policymakers. I find that invisible and visible lobbyingwhen performed
   in combinationare associated with greater regulatory policy change. From
   a normative perspective, these results are both reassuring and
   troubling. On one hand, the results suggest that invisible lobbying, on
   its own, rarely drives state regulatory policy shifts. Yet, on the other
   hand, those interested parties with the resources necessary to lobby
   across multiple modes are more likely to see policy change.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the possibilities for the emergence of more
   participatory forms of citizenship in the context of austerity Europe.
   Especially significant in this regard is the history of the post-war New
   Left who were critical of both social democracy and authoritarian
   Marxism. In this context I reconsider the radical humanistic' writing of
   E.P. Thompson and Raymond Williams. Not only does their work offer a
   critical understanding of the commons, but equally connects to the
   revival of humanism evident within the alter globalisation movement.
   Further I look at the development of different ideas for a revived Left
   including nostalgia for the social democratic period and the idea of
   cosmopolitanism. While all of this work has something to offer I seek to
   argue that it fails to adequately address the need to develop more
   ecologically sensitive and more participatory forms of citizenship. In
   the final section, I outline the importance of the struggle for a more
   democratic and autonomous society and the increasing importance of
   issues related to traditions of self-management and the idea of the
   commoner. The idea of the commoner could yet become one of the major
   ideological struggles of the twenty-first century, but this will depend
   upon its ability to excite the imaginations of Europe's increasingly
   frustrated citizens in the age of neoliberalism.},

Abstract = {Islamist rhetoric about the humiliation of Islam and American rhetoric
   about national humiliation have been energized by disparate events in
   recent years, from the photographs of American soldiers in Mogadishu,
   Somalia to the invasion of Iraq, the Innocence of Muslims video to the
   attacks on 9/11. At the same time, there's been an explosion of
   scholarship on humiliation as a driver of international conflict and
   political violence in general, and in relation to the bodies and minds
   of Muslims in particular. The link between humiliation and Muslims is
   thus a co-production between Islamists who continually invoke it and
   scholars from various disciplines and regions who regularly posit it.
   Yet there's been very little analysis of humiliation in Islamist
   discourse; minimal effort to anatomize the ways in which this experience
   of humiliation is constructed to necessitate particular kinds of
   retaliatory action; and no attempt to theorize more broadly about
   patterns and discontinuities in how different rhetorics construct
   humiliation. This article takes up the following questions: What is the
   substantive content of humiliation in such rhetoric and analysis? Do
   these different rhetorics of humiliation articulate the same
   understanding of it, as an act and an experience? What does close
   analysis of Islamist discourse on humiliation in comparative perspective
   reveal about the political stakes and affective resonances articulated
   and energized by it in this particular moment in history? Finally, what
   do the answers to these questions say about the reach and limits of the
   dominant account of humiliation as the violated dignity or injured
   self-respect of a generic individual?},

Abstract = {In recent studies, scholars have highlighted factors that influence
   citizen satisfaction with democracy, with particular emphasis on the
   role played by the institutional features of political systems, and
   ideology. This article presents the first empirical study of whether
   changes in important party characteristics can affect individuals'
   satisfaction with democracy. Using a measure of parties'
   character-valence derived from content analysis of news reports,
   evidence is presented that when governing parties' images decline with
   respect to important valence-related attributes such as competence,
   unity and integrity, then citizen satisfaction with democracy similarly
   declines. However, this relationship is conditional on the performance
   of opposition parties. These findings are relevant to studies of regime
   support, political representation, democratic accountability and voter
   behaviour.},

Abstract = {Discussion of sectarianism often focuses on evidence purporting to show
   discriminatory behaviour directed at Catholics or Protestants in
   Scotland. But attitudes also matter - in sustaining (or preventing) such
   discriminatory behaviours, and in understanding the nature of the
   `problem of sectarianism' from the perspective of the Scottish public.
   This paper uses data from the Scottish Social Attitudes survey 2014. The
   survey fills a gap in the evidence base by providing robust evidence on
   what the public actually thinks about sectarianism in modern Scotland.
   It assesses public beliefs about the extent and nature of sectarianism
   and its perceived causes. Tensions in public opinion and differences in
   the attitudes of different sections of Scottish society are explored.},

Abstract = {This work is result of a line of research on internationalization of
   higher education. The objective is to analyze the changes posed by
   emerging countries in the knowledge society. For this purpose, they are
   systematized and analyzed various indicators relating to the evolution
   of the emerging countries in support of research and innovation
   policies. Presents the various results including scientific publications
   and participation in networks. It also discusses the increase in the
   number of enrolled in higher education and graduates in the BRICS
   countries and consequences that can generate. The basic idea is that
   emerging and, in particular, the BRICS countries not only quantitatively
   changed the map of the knowledge society, but they have also begun to
   fulfill specific functions different from those that emerged from the
   existing dynamics between developed countries and developing existing
   until recently.},

Abstract = {Paraguayan women have transcended history as the mothers of the
   ``Guarani breed{''}, as The Resident Woman Residentas, the social role
   of these has been undeniable, but in other scopes, such as the political
   area, its social and historical role is still invisible, because the
   policy has historically been considered a male activity. However, many
   women have contributed to the construction of the history of this
   nation, and although the asymmetries in the real access to power between
   men and women are notorious today, Paraguayan want power and will seek,
   as it was found in the last two presidential elections of 2008 and 2013.
   On this basis, this paper aims to describe what has been the impact of
   feminism in Paraguayan politics and, in turn, explain the factors that
   have influenced raid Kuna Pyrenda feminist movement in the elections of
   2013.},

Abstract = {While it is widely acknowledged that politics and politicians have
   fallen from grace among large parts of the public in western
   democracies, it is less clear what the latter's political discontents
   are about. To find out, we performed an interpretative content analysis
   of the letters to the editor of the largest popular Dutch newspaper in
   the 2000s (2000-2009). It yielded three empirically grounded discourses
   of political discontents about `the state'-shorthand for the government,
   its agencies, officials, judges, politicians and political parties-'the
   incompetent state', `the alienated state' and `the corrupted state'. The
   relevance of these findings is subsequently discussed in the light of
   research on political distrust and contemporary populism.},

Abstract = {The rapid development and diffusion of information and communication
   technologies (ICT) provides various political and administrative
   institutions with new opportunities for civil political action. There
   are new tools, channels and methods, which can be utilised both in order
   to transform closed representative democracy systems into more open and
   communicative ones and to facilitate new forms of authentic civil
   political action - participatory democracy. The theoretical concepts of
   paper are participatory democracy and eParticipation, which are placed
   in the eGovernance framework. Based on empirical data, author wants to
   answer the research questions whether there are adequate tools for
   eParticipation available to Slovenian citizens at local level of
   government and if the concept of ``eCitizens{''} can also be applied in
   Slovenian case. In context of Slovenians' familiarity and qualification
   of ICT on one hand and with further information, dissemination and
   especially establishment of e-tools for active participation on the
   other hand, author concludes that the concept of eCitizens has good
   future opportunities to develop in Slovenia.},

Abstract = {Geographic sorting of the electorate along partisan lines has received
   increased attention by scholars following the publication of Bill
   Bishop's and Robert Cushing's The Big Sort (2008). The evidence
   presented in this paper stems from an original public opinion survey in
   two Wisconsin landslide counties. We find that the majority among
   migrants to these partisan strongholds have shared the partisanship of
   the respective political majority. Using logistic regression analysis,
   we show that partisanship as well as specific lifestyle preferences
   mattered in people's decisions to migrate into these partisan
   strongholds. We also find that partisanship is a factor in potential
   out-migration: residential satisfaction is lower among the respective
   political minorities, and relevant shares of the political minority say
   they consider moving away for political reasons. Among the members of
   the minority who consider leaving the county about one third say they do
   so because they dislike the politics of the people there. Our findings
   on the two counties, each a prototypical Democratic and Republican
   stronghold, lend further support to the Big Sort hypothesis.},

Title = {Mining texts to efficiently generate global data on political regime
   types},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {We describe the design and results of an experiment in using text-mining
   and machine-learning techniques to generate annual measures of national
   political regime types. Valid and reliable measures of countries' forms
   of national government are essential to cross-national and dynamic
   analysis of many phenomena of great interest to political scientists,
   including civil war, interstate war, democratization, and coups d'etat.
   Unfortunately, traditional measures of regime type are very expensive to
   produce, and observations for ambiguous cases are often sharply
   contested. In this project, we train a series of support vector machine
   (SVM) classifiers to infer regime type from textual data sources. To
   train the classifiers, we used vectorized textual reports from Freedom
   House and the State Department as features for a training set of
   prelabeled regime type data. To validate our SVM classifiers, we compare
   their predictions in an out-of-sample context, and the performance
   results across a variety of metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) are
   very high. The results of this project highlight the ability of these
   techniques to contribute to producing real-time data sources for use in
   political science that can also be routinely updated at much lower cost
   than human-coded data. To this end, we set up a text-processing pipeline
   that pulls updated textual data from selected sources, conducts feature
   extraction, and applies supervised machine learning methods to produce
   measures of regime type. This pipeline, written in Python, can be pulled
   from the Github repository associated with this project and easily
   extended as more data becomes available.},

Abstract = {Building on recent studies of social pressure and group conformity in
   peer groups, I apply a social identity framework from social psychology
   to the study of political networks. Using the American National Election
   Studies (ANES) 2008-2009 Panel Study, I test several hypotheses
   regarding the relationship between peer networks, the salience of
   partisan identity, and the consequences for intergroup attitudinal and
   affective polarization. The findings suggest that peer network
   homogeneity produces the strongest association with more salient
   partisan identities across several network characteristics, including
   cohesiveness, sophistication, and density. Both the salience of partisan
   identities and network homogeneity are also linked to significant
   intergroup polarization, that is, differences in in-group and out-group
   partisan affect. The current research contributes to the existing
   literature on political networks by highlighting the role of social
   identities and providing a theoretical framework worth considering for
   future research.},

Abstract = {In National Water Act's reform in 2004, explicitly it's stablished that
   the Mexican water policy would be guided by the principles of Integral
   Water Resources Management (IWRM), which, among other things, impulse
   the management by watersheds, social participation and gender equality
   in the management of water. But, what is and what is the origin of IWRM?
   and mainly, what factors or mechanisms explain its adoption in Mexico?
   It is the objective of this paper to outline answers to the above
   questions. In that sense, the central argument is that the origin of
   IWRM was given by an epistemic community in which, apparently Mexico
   have participated actively. Additionally its subsequent international
   promotion by international institutions has leaded to a transnational
   convergence towards this model, in which, Mexico is part.},

Abstract = {This paper draws on the `moral' dimensions of Turkey's `new' foreign
   policy as it became manifest after the Justice and Development Party
   rose to power in 2002. This article first discusses `ethics' and
   `justice' in the context of international politics and states' foreign
   policy. It then delves into Turkey's behavioral posture vis-a-vis a
   number of key issues and policy areas, such as global economic and
   social inequality, disarmament, military aggression, the degree of
   respect for international law and human rights, protection of the
   environment, self-determination, and attitude towards and within
   international institutions, first and foremost being the United Nations,
   to demonstrate how this new outlook has played itself out},

Number = {1},
Pages = {56-72},

Abstract = {The French Pacific island collectivity' of New Caledonia has faced
   serious challenges in decolonising since the Second World War because,
   unlike Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US, it is a settler
   country manque. Instead of becoming a small minority, the indigenous
   Melanesian inhabitants (today called Kanak (invariable spelling))
   comprise nearly half the population and hold 46\% of the seats in the
   Congress. Most of them seek independence, whereas most settlers want to
   remain part of France, albeit with autonomy. For a century after French
   annexation in 1853, colonial segregation onto small, marginal native
   reserves and a lack of civil rights created a unified consciousness
   among the 30 indigenous language groups. Apart from forced or low-wage
   labour situations or conversion by missionaries, they intermingled very
   little with settlers, who included French convicts and small farmers,
   ranchers and nickel miners, as well as indentured Asian labourers and
   Polynesian workers from Wallis and Futuna or French Polynesia. The Kanak
   finally received civil rights in 1946 and were a demographic majority,
   so they supported a multiracial political party for a generation while
   the territory gained autonomy. However, in the 1960s, Paris revoked such
   self-governing powers during a nickel boom, and new immigration made the
   Kanak a minority, which hardened ethno-political polarisation and
   sparked an independence movement that culminated in a Kanak revolt in
   the 1980s. Two peace accords ensued, which restored autonomy and
   proposed a common destiny' for local citizens. The May 2014 elections
   chose a Congress that can hold a referendum on independence, but
   factionalism within each ethno-political bloc delayed forming a cabinet
   until April 2015, when some pro-independence leaders chose to cooperate
   with some loyalists.},

Abstract = {Does candidate religion influence vote choice? And if so, under what
   conditions does religion matter? In this contribution we provide the
   first systematic analysis of the impact of candidate religion on voting
   behaviour in an ethnically divided democracy: Uttar Pradesh, North
   India. The results from a series of conditional logit models shows that
   Muslims are more likely to vote for Muslim candidates, but only when
   those candidates have a realistic chance of winning - there is thus a
   strong strategic element to their vote calculus. Moreover, there is no
   evidence that Hindus discriminate against Muslim candidates, or that
   parties face an elcectoral penalty for fielding a Muslim candidate.

Abstract = {The debate on what effect networks have on the existing institutions of
   representative democracy is highly polarized. On one hand, networks are
   regarded as means to fill in' where traditional institutions fail, and
   on the other, networks are viewed as arrangements draining or hollowing
   out' traditional institutions of power and legitimacy. In this article,
   filling in and hollowing out are treated as two distinct dimensions,
   opening up for the possibility that networks may both fill in and hollow
   out member organizations. The argument is that networks, to be able to
   fill in, must be strong' (autonomy, resources), but the stronger they
   become, the higher the probability that they also hollow out their
   individual members. This thesis is empirically illuminated by studying
   political governance networks in Norway (i.e., voluntary cooperation
   between municipalities creating a regional council). Main findings
   conclude that these networks only to a very moderate degree fill in and
   hollow out, indicating that the networks play a largely symbolic role.
   However, there are variations between networks, and the data indicate
   that the degree of hollowing out depends on both the strength of the
   network (size and asymmetry) and its individual members (i.e., their
   population size).},

Abstract = {This essay interprets Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address as an
   effort by the reelected president (and victorious commander in chief) to
   produce a common memory of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery as
   a means of reuniting the country. It argues that Lincoln did not believe
   the opposing sides could think and act as Americans after the war unless
   they moved from war to peace with a shared understanding of why the war
   and emancipation happened. He supposed that God used ``this mighty
   scourge of war{''} to punish both North and South for the sin of
   slavery-a punishment that, in light of how long slavery had existed in
   America, would actually constitute a divine mercy. Only a common
   acceptance of mutual responsibility for what he called ``American
   slavery{''} would enable former combatants to extend ``charity for
   all{''} and ``malice toward none{''} and thereby pave the way to
   successful Reconstruction.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Presidential administrations have devised numerous legal rationales,
   such as executive privilege, for concealing information. A relatively
   new and related rationale is ``White House equities.{''} Although not
   statutorily defined, White House counsels and other executive officials
   have interpreted White House equities to encompass all agency
   communications either to the White House or prepared for communication
   with the White House. Records classified as containing White House
   equities provide a basis for the president to assert executive privilege
   to justify the withholding or redaction of records. This article
   describes and analyzes the rise and evolution of White House equities,
   and it critically assesses the impact of the use of this vehicle of
   information control on the balance of powers of the national government

Abstract = {This paper examines the prospects of ethnic politics and
   consociationalism in Malaysia, in terms of their structures and
   capabilities. Towards this end, the Barisan Nasional's (BN) policies
   from 2008 to 2013, the BN's and the Pakatan Rakyat's (PR) 2013 electoral
   strategies, and the results of the 2013 election will be analysed. As
   political parties in both the BN and the PR have generally represented
   ethnic interests and identities, an ethnic-based political structure has
   been maintained. A consociational political system, which is based on an
   ethnic-based political structure, has been adopted by both political
   coalitions. An examination of the 2013 election results indicates that
   the BN's ethnic politicking as a vote-gathering device has become
   ineffective. The BN's consociationalism has suffered from a legitimacy
   deficit, particularly within ethnic minority communities. However, it
   may be premature to claim that the Malaysian political culture is on the
   cusp of transcending the BN's paradigm of ethnic politics and
   consociationalism. The shift from ethnic politics will generate stronger
   momentum when the PR parties are incorporated into one political party.},

Abstract = {The Principality of Liechtenstein challenges the prevailing view in
   political science that small is democratic.' Located in the heart of
   Western Europe, the Principality is ruled by a monarch with extensive
   political powers. The present article examines how the smallness of the
   Principality contributes to the maintenance of powerful traditional
   leadership, and which strategies are used to legitimize the
   Liechtensteiner system vis-a-vis its population. On the basis of
   interviews with Liechtensteiner respondents, it is found that the
   smallness of Liechtenstein contributes to the position of the monarchy
   due to (1) the lack of alternative sources of identification, (2) the
   perception of the Prince as a neutral arbiter standing above the
   quarreling political factions, and (3) the dominant cultural code that
   limits citizens' opportunities to criticize the monarchy. The article
   highlights several ways in which the Prince has sought to legitimize his
   own position, and to undercut the criticism against him.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {45},
Number = {2},
Pages = {335-360},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {To understand how jokes have functioned as part of U.S. presidents'
   strategic communication, this project examined every available White
   House Correspondents' Dinner (WHCD) speech over the last century,
   documenting various presidents' approaches to humor. I argue that the
   ability to talk about difficult or taboo subjects through jokes' deeply
   enthymematic ways of communicating has offered presidents expanded
   rhetorical spaces during crises, providing insights into why they
   started using humor with such routine frequency. Working with multiple
   factors shaping the modern presidency, presidents have used the elastic
   and inventive nature of enthymematic joking in attempts to move pressing
   issues outside immediate lines of criticism. The use of jokes in
   presidential communication is charted through three periods of WHCD.
   Several implications are drawn from this analysis, including the risks
   of humor as a rhetorical strategy.},

Abstract = {The article analyses publication patterns according to gender in three
   Political Science and International Relations journals based in Britain
   (Political Studies, British Journal of Political Science, and Review of
   International Studies). Examining publications from 1991 to 2011 in
   terms of authorship, seniority of author, and number of citations and
   responses, our findings suggest that women are less likely to be
   published as sole or lead author than their male counterparts are but
   that they are just as likely to be cited. Furthermore, since 2000, women
   are now over-represented in comparison with their presence within the
   discipline in publications that have at least one female author.},

Title = {Do political parties matter for turnout? Number of parties, electoral
   rules and local elections in Brazil and Bolivia},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {404-416},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Does the number of political parties influence voter turnout in
   developing democracies? Some scholars argue that large party systems
   facilitate matching voter preferences with a specific party, increasing
   turnout. Others argue multiparty systems produce too many alternatives,
   decreasing turnout. In developing democracies, there is debate over
   whether these institutions matter at all. We argue that party systems do
   matter for turnout in developing countries, but the relationship between
   turnout and the number of political parties is conditional on the
   electoral formula. Under proportional representation systems, large
   numbers of parties increase turnout. Under winner take all systems,
   large numbers of parties depress turnout. Since electoral rules also
   influence the number of parties, we use an innovative sub-national
   research design, taking advantage of local variation in the number of
   parties that is largely unrelated to the electoral system. Specifically,
   we test these relationships by analysing turnout data at the municipal
   level in Brazil and Bolivia, countries with very different electoral
   rules. Overall, we find evidence that party systems influence turnout,
   but in different ways depending on the election rules.},

Abstract = {I argue that the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan employed a
   strategy to prevent unpopular prime ministers from tainting the party's
   image. Time-series analyses of public opinion data from 1960 to 2006
   show that national economic performance had modest effects on prime
   minister support ratings and no effects on LDP ratings. When prime
   minister ratings fall below party ratings, cabinets are more likely to
   be reshuffled and prime ministers to be replaced to avoid having the
   cabinet's negative image rub off' on the LDP. Although electoral rules,
   culture, and other factors surely play a role in sustaining the LDP, I
   show for the first time that the party manages its cabinet personnel
   strategically to maintain support.},

Abstract = {This article deals with Carl Schmitt's analysis of Shakespeare's Hamlet
   This analysis involves an inquiry into the relation between tragedy as a
   dramatic genre and the political. The central topics of Hamlet or Hecuba
   (1956) are henceforth considered. Schmitt's idea of ``the intrusion of
   the time into the play{''} will be tracked and related with his
   contemporary texts as well as with those texts of the Weimar period. In
   the work will come to light the continuity (in Schmitt's analysis) of
   the fundamental alternatives concerning the ways of conceiving the
   relation between the particular and the general. Ways that are secular
   declinations of Protestantism and Catholicism. In this context Hamlet's
   myth become relevant, as an option between Don Quixote and Faust,
   namely, between Catholicism and Protestantism. In this being-in-between,
   the decision becomes necessary.},

Abstract = {There is very limited Western scholarship on the Donbas region, despite
   its being the center of Europe's worst conflict since World War II. The
   Donbas region did not wish to join Soviet Ukraine in 1918, was not a
   source for Soviet Ukrainian leaders, and has high levels of Soviet
   nostalgia, low support for Ukrainian independence, and relatively high
   levels of support for separatism. The Donbas-based Party of Regions
   political machine won a plurality in three Ukrainian elections (2006,
   2007, and 2012); its leader, Viktor Yanukovych, was the country's prime
   minister in 2002-4 and 2006-7 and president in 2010-14. Yanukovych
   provoked two revolutions: one that prevented him from becoming president
   (2004) and another that ousted him from power (2014). The November
   2013-February 2014 Euromaidan crisis, which led to the flight of
   Yanukovych, Russian annexation of the Crimea, and the Donbas separatist
   conflict, also led to the disintegration of the Party of Regions in Kyiv
   and in its two regional strongholds. This article analyzes the factors
   behind the rise and fall of the Party of Regions and its Donbas-based
   political machine, and its implications for Ukrainian domestic politics
   and foreign policy.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Support for independence from Spain has sharply increased in recent
   years in Catalonia. According to all available evidence, public opinion
   has shifted from an overwhelmingly pro-autonomy position to an
   increasingly pro-independence stance. How can we explain such widespread
   support for secession in a democratic context? Traditionally, national
   identity has been regarded as the main explanatory factor, but recent
   accounts tend to underline the effect of political elite's agency as
   well as instrumental calculations regarding the economic consequences of
   secession. However, the identification of this last causal effect is
   subject to a fundamental challenge: the possibility that economic
   expectations are mere rationalizations of prior preferences. In order to
   overcome this identification problem, we combine the analysis of
   observational survey data with an original survey-embedded experiment
   that provides a robust test of the causal nature of economic
   expectations. Our results show how identity, as well as partisanship,
   are the main drivers of support for secession, but also that economic
   considerations play an independent role. Results show that economic
   motivations are more relevant for citizens with ambivalent identity
   positions and for those that have no party identification, or are
   partisans of parties with less clear-cut stances on the issue.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the conceptual and theoretical implications of
   the logic of habit for the path-dependence approach. In the existing
   literature, we see two different logics of action associated with two
   distinct models of path dependence: the logic of consequences
   (instrumental rationality) is linked with utilitarian paths (i.e.
   increasing returns) and the logic of appropriateness (normative
   rationality) constitutes normative paths (normative lock-in). However,
   this study suggests that despite its popularity, the path-dependence
   approach remains underspecified owing to its exclusion or neglect of the
   logic of habit, which constitutes a distinct mechanism of reproduction
   or self-reinforcement in the institutional world. This article,
   therefore, introduces the notion of the `habitual path' as a different
   model of path dependence. Although the idea of the habitual path is
   complementary with the existing models, owing to its distinctive notions
   of agency and mechanisms of path reproduction, it offers a different
   interpretation of continuity or regularity. Thus, by enriching the
   path-dependence approach, the notion of the habitual path would
   contribute to our comprehension of continuities and discontinuities in
   the political world.},

Abstract = {This article offers the first disaggregated, quantitative comparison of
   Islamist and nationalist violence, using new data from Russia's North
   Caucasus. We find that violence by Islamist groups is less sensitive to
   government coercion than violence by nationalist groups. Selective
   counterinsurgency tactics outperform indiscriminate force in suppressing
   attacks by nationalists, but not Islamists. We attribute this finding to
   rebels' support structure. Because Islamist insurgents rely less on
   local support than nationalists, they are able to maintain operations
   even where it is relatively costly for the local population to support
   them. These findings have potentially significant implications for other
   contemporary conflicts in which governments face both types of
   challenges to their authority and existing political order.},

Abstract = {Adding a gender dimension to the story of the Irish crisis deepens our
   understanding of crisis and necessary responses. Using gender both as
   category and process we see clear gendered patterns throughout the Irish
   crisis including patterns of gender inequality in gendered institutions
   and changes in the process of gendered agency. Reviewing the extent to
   which Irish political and public spheres, banking and budgetary
   processes are gendered raises questions about how this impacts on post
   crisis outcomes. The gendered lens draws attention to the risks inherent
   in hyper-masculine institutions and culture and questions whether
   greater gender balance might alter the risk oriented culture of Irish
   financial services. It also draws attention to the gendered nature of
   Irish austerity budgets which disproportionately impacted women, and low
   income women in particular. The crisis also impacted on feminist agency.
   Examining women's political agency in the context of the crisis we find
   examples of defensive agency that sought to protect women's interests
   from fiscal retrenchment. These exist alongside examples of offensive
   feminist agency that use the crisis as an opportunity to strengthen
   gender equality in the political and policy processes. We find the
   gender infrastructure negatively impacted but despite such damage, we
   find feminist agency remains crucial to realising gender equality in
   public and private decision-making and despite the crisis, hopeful signs
   of renewed feminist agency are present.},

Abstract = {Long-term immigrants often have the option but not the obligation to
   acquire citizenship in their state of residence. Contrary to the
   received wisdom, this article defends the idea of mandatory citizenship
   for immigrants. It suggests that the current asymmetry in the
   distribution of political obligations between native-born citizens and
   immigrants is unfair. It also argues that mandatory citizenship is
   required by the principle that those who persistently affect others
   should share a democratic setting. Finally, it claims that mandatory
   citizenship is more compatible with the ideal of democratic equality and
   more conducive to a stable society.},

Abstract = {We argue that individuals use responsibility attribution heuristics that
   apply to collective decisions made, for example, by families, teams
   within firms, boards in international organizations, or coalition
   governments. We conduct laboratory and online experiments to tease out
   the heuristics subjects use in their responsibility attribution for
   collective decision makers. The lab experiments comprise a collective
   dictator game in which decision makers have weighted votes and
   recipients can punish individual decision makers. Our results show that
   recipients punish unfair allocations and mainly target the decision
   maker with proposal power and with the largest vote share. We find weak
   evidence that decision makers with veto power are targeted or that
   recipients punish proportional to vote share. The online experiment
   demonstrates that subjects indeed believe that the decision maker with
   proposal power has the most influence on the collective decision
   outcome. We discuss the implications of our findings for theories of
   vote choice.},

Abstract = {This paper offers a new electoral geography perspective on two stylized
   facts that do not fit easily with our current understanding of the
   implications of electoral rules for electoral politics and social
   policy: (1) proportional representation (PR) electoral rules are not
   always associated with more generous social spending. In some cases, we
   observe comparatively high levels of social spending in majoritarian
   single-member district (SMD) systems. (2) Contrary to our theoretical
   expectations, national two-party competition occurs rarely, even under
   SMD rules. Here, I demonstrate the importance of electoral geography
   through a series of analytic examples that are based on a simple model
   of electoral politics, and in which all possible combinations of
   electoral boundaries, rules, and voter locations are manipulated.},

Abstract = {This article advocates a lesson plan for introductory comparative
   politics and elections courses. The authors argue that Wikipedia (yes,
   Wikipedia) provides a unique platform for improving learning outcomes
   and a useful social good from traditional student papers on elections.
   The proposed lesson plan can achieve this in at least three ways: (1) by
   providing social incentives for learning and a method for students to
   contribute to social science knowledge from their earliest courses, the
   incorporation of Wikipedia editing can improve student learning and
   retention; (2) incorporating an online information component can help
   both future students and researchers by improving the quality and
   quantity of easily accessible and well-referenced information about
   historical and upcoming elections; and (3) the use of the Wiki format is
   becoming increasingly common in both business and government. Teaching
   the basics of editing is an increasingly useful skill for students to
   learn for future employment.},

Abstract = {The research program of behavioral economics is gaining increasing
   influence in academic economics and in interest from policymakers. This
   article analyzes behavioral economics from the dual perspective of
   Foucault's genealogical investigation of neoliberal governmentality and
   contemporary critical theorizations of neoliberalism. I argue that
   behavioral economics should be understood as a political economic
   apparatus of neoliberal govemmentality with the objective of using the
   state to manage and subjectivize individuals - by attempting to correct
   their deviations from rational, self-interested, utility-maximizing
   cognition and behavior - such that they more effectively and efficiently
   conform to market logics and processes. In this analysis, I contend that
   behavioral economics enacts three components of neoliberal
   governmentality: positioning the market as a site of truth and
   veridiction for the individual and the state; regulating what
   constitutes the objects of political economy and governmental
   intervention; and producing homo economicus (economic human) and
   diffusing this mode of economic subjectivity across the social terrain.
   In doing so, behavioral economics and its rationalities transform and
   introduce new technologies of power into neoliberal govemmentality. I
   illustrate this argument with an analysis of recent changes to
   retirement savings policy in the United States, heavily influenced by
   behavioral economics thinking, that entrench neoliberal formations.},

Abstract = {The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed through
   Congress on partisan lines and with only lukewarm public support. The
   Obama administration and Congressional Democrats, though, had reason to
   expect that the ACA's political fortunes would substantially improve as
   the acrimonious debate over its enactment faded and millions of
   Americans came to receive significant benefits from health care reform.
   But 5 years after its passage, the ACA's political foundations remain
   shaky. We suggest that one reason for the ACA's unsettled fate is the
   role of policy feedbacks that undermine public support for and
   opponents' acceptance of the program. The ACA experience highlights how
   policy feedbacks can vary widely in their political impact, and suggests
   that some policies are in fact self-undermining. We also emphasize the
   crucial role of partisan polarization as a mediating factor in shaping
   policy feedbacks.},

Abstract = {Despite the proliferation of instruments of public consultation in
   liberal democracies, little is known of how the design and use of these
   instruments affect stake-holder participation in practice. The article
   examines participation in written government consultations in an
   analysis of approximately 5,000 responses to consultations in Denmark
   and the UK in the first half of 2008. It shows that participation is
   highly conditional upon system-and actor-level characteristics in
   practice. Our findings indicate that, even if liberal democracies have
   adopted similar procedures for actor consultation in the last decades,
   the design and application of crucial rules vary considerably between
   systems. They emphasize how the conduct of consultation is heavily
   conditioned by the design of these processes, which is in turn
   constrained by the historical legacy of state-society structures of the
   system in question.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of foundational violence immanent in
   history, understood as the space of production of
   inputs-memory/origin-that awake senses of belonging in a
   community-identity, culture, etc-.In this direction, we believe that the
   emergence of a certain way of understanding the socialevidenced in the
   founding gesture of Law Decree No. 1 of 1973, would suppose a basic
   discursive strategy for the naturalization of a triumphant, democratic
   and legal actuality; and the production of a vicarious identity proper
   of the neoliberal model.},

Title = {Rethinking the Dartmouth College Case in American Political
   Development: Constituting Public and Private Educational Institutions},
Journal = {STUDIES IN AMERICAN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-39},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Dartmouth College v. Woodward is taken to be the seminal case in the
   rise of the corporation. In recognizing a charter as a contract that
   vested private rights against many forms of state regulation, the case
   paved the way for the private business corporation and helped usher in
   large-scale commercial development against Jeffersonian agrarianism. In
   this classical liberal story, Dartmouth College is understood to have
   preserved a private corporation against public interference. Yet this
   understanding of Dartmouth College neglects what the actual case was
   about and erases an important moment of constitutional development.
   American colleges in the colonial period were church-state schools
   forged when the church and state were not separated. The Dartmouth
   College case was part of a wider constitutional debate over what many
   saw as a public institution that, in the wake of the American
   Revolution, needed to be disestablished from the church. Doing so was
   part of a revolutionary constitutionalism that would help frame how we
   understood the relationship between public and private, church and
   state. This was a conflict about recasting institutions and embedding
   them in constitutional ideas. While advocates failed to solidify
   Dartmouth as a public institution, they succeeded in forging
   distinctions between public and private that shape how we think today.},

Abstract = {The prevailing wisdom among political philosophers claims that political
   ideals provide normative guidance for unjust and otherwise nonideal
   circumstances. This article has two objectives. The first is to develop
   a model of the logical relationship of moral evaluative considerations
   to feasibility considerations in the justification of normative
   political principles. The second is to use this model to demonstrate
   that political ideals are uninformative for the task of specifying the
   normative principles we should aim to satisfy amidst unjust or otherwise
   nonideal circumstances. The argument implies that social scientists have
   an essential contribution to make to the normative theoretical
   enterprise.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {21},

Pages = {36-47},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {On 9 February 2014, the Swiss people accepted the popular initiative
   against mass immigration launched by the national-conservative Swiss
   People's Party (SVP). This voting outcome has triggered wide-ranging
   debates about both the policy on immigrants as well as the future of
   Switzerland within the European context. Against this background, we
   evaluate attitudes toward immigration in Switzerland. Using hitherto
   unexplored survey data of MOSAiCH, our empirical analyses show that
   already in the year 2013, before the debate about the initiative on mass
   immigration was in full swing, roughly 53 percent of the 1011
   interviewed Swiss citizens stated that immigration should be reduced.
   Moreover, our estimations indicate that the threats and fears induced by
   immigration and the will to maintain sovereignty and autonomy are
   particularly relevant for attitudes toward immigration. By contrast,
   education and national or personal economic conditions are only weakly
   related to the immigration issue.},

Abstract = {Asian values discourse has focused on the Confucian cultural
   peculiarities of East Asia as the motorforce behind the East Asian
   ``miracle{''}, which is characterised as significant economic boom,
   increased welfare, and more fair distribution of income in
   East/Southeast Asia. These peculiarities have both pragmatic and
   psychological/intellectual dimensions, which, seemingly, operate
   independently but actually complement each other. Psychologically, Asian
   values claim an East Asian intellectual and cultural exclusiveness from
   the ``West{''} but, pragmatically, they actually encourage commercial
   relations with non-Asians. Australia's contemporary relations with East
   Asia are a clear example of this. A trade-oriented and pragmatic
   engagement with the region has relegated politico-strategic relations to
   the background. This research argues that to move beyond trade and
   increase the influence of a non-Asian power, such as Australia in East
   Asia, the psychological dimension cannot be ignored.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes Turkey's official energy strategy to indicate how
   it responds to actual challenges by striking a compromise between market
   characteristics, and geopolitics and foreign policy. It points to
   Turkey's growing energy demand as one of the most significant factors
   that affect the country's policies and elaborates how Turkey's supply
   security perspective intersects with geopolitical features and foreign
   policy issues on behalf of international cooperation. The first section,
   with conceptual highlights, gives a brief picture of the actual energy
   security challenges that Turkey faces. The second part focuses on
   Turkey's official energy strategy (Turkey's Energy Strategic Plan, as
   introduced by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources) to
   understand how these policies respond to the challenges Turkey faces.
   The final section gives an idea of how Turkey's energy security strategy
   supports international cooperation with diverse actors.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The literature on the transnational dimension of civil wars points to
   transnational ethnic kin as an important catalyst that initiates and
   sustains civil wars. Ethnic ties that transcend national boundaries,
   these studies argue, intensify the conflict by providing sanctuaries as
   well as human and material resources to the rebels. In this study, I
   argue that the same transborder ethnic ties make it more difficult for
   the government to achieve a decisive victory and contribute to outcomes
   more favorable to rebels. These networks can help create a more balanced
   relationship between an ethnic group and a previously antagonistic state
   by increasing the political, economic, and military costs of repression
   for the government. An analysis of ethnic civil wars starting and ending
   between 1950 and 2006 demonstrates that civil wars fought by ethnically
   mobilized rebel groups are more likely to be negotiated and settled in
   favor of rebels who have ethnic kin in a neighboring country.},

Abstract = {The article explores the Croatian and Montenegrin EU accession path as a
   two-sided disciplining process established through the negotiations. The
   ``success{''} of the EU's civilising mission in the two countries is
   determined through the feedback/dialogue relationship formed between the
   EU and the candidate country. I analyse two aspects of the accession
   negotiations: cooperation with the ICTY and the rule of law
   institutions. In Croatia, the domestic elites' determination to ensure
   the membership paired up with the EU's civilising mission in the
   Balkans. In Montenegro, the EU membership has not outright represented
   the mythical return to Europe, hence initially self-civilising was not
   high on the list of the priorities. Moreover, Montenegro was the success
   story of the Balkans and the EU initially did not insist on the
   institutional development. The paper contributes to the wider EU
   enlargement literature by specifically emphasizing the cultural studies
   framework and by emphasizing the importance of the overlooked
   feedback/dialogue characteristics of the accession process.},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {This contribution documents and analyses the genocide of 1.5 million
   Armenians in the Ottoman Empire during 1915 and 1916 and is based mainly
   on the German diplomatic correspondence of the time, which is preserved
   at the Political Archives of the German Foreign Office, in Berlin. In
   the introduction, I refer to the Turkish nation state building process
   during 1912-1921 and its effects on the Christian populaces of the
   Ottoman Empire. In the second part, I focus on the various, apparently
   coordinated, measures directed against the Ottoman Armenians. A special
   subsection is dedicated to the clandestine intelligence organization
   Teskilat-i Mahsusa (Special Organization), which planned, implemented,
   and largely conducted the destruction of the Armenians in such a
   conspiratorial way that its activities escaped even the attention of
   Turkey's most important military ally, Germany. The final part discusses
   Germany's involvement in the destruction of Ottoman Armenians,
   Aramaic-speaking Christians, and Greek-Orthodox Christians against the
   background of 50 years of scholarship in history and genocide studies.},

Abstract = {This article is focused on two basic concepts: Law and Society. Older
   sources do not clearly indicate that a sharp distinction was commonly
   drawn between the society on one hand and the law on the other.
   Regardless of the evolution and progress which has been made in both
   areas the ties between these two subjects have not been disconnected. In
   fact, one does not have to reflect long on the matter to understand the
   obvious and necessary coherence. The influence is interactive. This
   reciprocity means, inter alia, that rights cannot be claimed without the
   shouldering of corresponding duties. Comprehension of this basic strand
   in the concept of law demarcates the basis for our everyday existence.},

   Ukrainian question{''}: the drive of a patronized people for
   emancipation and self-assertion. The question whether a democratic
   Ukraine governed by rule of law is more important than raw materials
   from Siberia, is a test case for the West. The much-maligned European
   Union has withstood the test and proven more capable of acting than
   expected. Those who believe in a revival of the Tsarist-Stalinist empire
   have the short end of the stick.},

Abstract = {This paper explores how local government structure affects policy
   co-ordination. It compares the delivery of economic development services
   in two Ontario cities. In London, a specialized agency is the lead, but
   lacks full functional control, while in Hamilton policy control is
   consolidated in a single municipal department. The findings support the
   hypothesis of those who argue in favour of general-purpose governments,
   as the municipal hierarchy in Hamilton was instrumental in achieving
   policy co-ordination. Proponents of specialization argue that it limits
   the need for coordination between governments but, as the London case
   demonstrates, this logic breaks down when there are too many players
   with too few responsibilities.},

Abstract = {The Scottish referendum of autumn 2014 has been debated as if it was a
   unique moment in the country's history, and in several senses it was
   indeed unprecedented - in the level of engagement by citizens which it
   stimulated, in the acceptance by all sides to the debate that the
   decision on independence was Scotland's alone (which was an implicit
   recognition of popular sovereignty), and in its being the first ever
   democratic and explicit endorsement of the Union by Scotland.
   Nevertheless, there is also a sense in which the pattern of protest and
   compromise that led to the referendum and that pervades its aftermath is
   very familiar - the latest in a series of such processes that have
   characterised Scotland's always evolving place in the Union since 1707.
   Radical challenge is followed by pragmatic adjustment as the state cedes
   just enough power to keep the Union intact for the time being, a
   compromise which sows the seeds of the next phase of radical rebellion.
   That is why Scotland's position never fully satisfies anyone, and why,
   on this occasion, the basis for a new challenge to the Union (and for a
   new compromise to that new challenge) has probably already been laid
   before even the outcome of this referendum has been fully settled.},

Abstract = {One of the central claims of democratic theory is that the institutional
   features of democracy systematically cause government to respond to the
   people's needs. In fact, however, democracy might logically be expected
   to be especially responsive only to the people's desires, not their
   needs. Responses to people's objective needs can be substantially
   different from responses to their subjective desires. Democratic
   institutions therefore cannot guarantee (and may even hamper)
   responsiveness to basic human needs. Democracy, should, at least in
   principle, thus be confined to the sphere of wants rather than needs.},

Abstract = {This article examines whether decentralization in the Republic of
   Macedonia has contributed to widening effective political participation
   and strengthening democracy at the local level between 2005 and 2012. It
   begins by demonstrating the debate regarding political decentralization
   and its ability to mitigate ethnic conflict by facilitating the
   effective participation of national minorities in local institutions. An
   assessment of the largely consociational power-sharing mechanisms
   envisaged locally then determines whether decentralization has
   contributed to: improving the political representation of diverse groups
   in local decision-making processes; deepening local democracy by
   providing opportunities for residents to participate in local
   governance; and enhancing the transparency, accountability, and
   responsiveness of municipal governments. The opportunities Macedonian
   citizens have for participating directly in local decision-making
   processes are also evaluated. This article argues that whilst political
   decentralization has expanded the potential space available for citizens
   to participate in local governance, it has not guaranteed the
   participation of local communities, or that their participation is both
   equitable and effective. Advocates of decentralization have failed to
   sufficiently appreciate the extent to which the over-dominance of some
   political parties, which lack internal democracy, along with the
   pervasiveness of patronage-based politics, may undermine the reform's
   potential benefits.},

Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},

Abstract = {This Special Issue, `Voters and Voting in Multilevel Systems', is a
   contribution to a better understanding of the functioning and logics of
   the present-day German electoral system, but its findings and
   consequences stretch beyond the German case. After all, Germany is
   ideally suited for studying multilevel voting and the interdependences
   and mutual repercussions of multilayer electoral systems. The Special
   Issue takes the challenges and changes in voting behaviour as a starting
   point and searches for links and causal relationships between levels.
   Overall, it has two major goals: first, to examine how (increasing)
   volatility in voting behaviour and declining participation rates
   manifest themselves at all layers of the multilevel system, possibly
   amplifying each other; second, to turn the usual perspective on its head
   by examining the impact of second-order elections and vote choices on
   parties' fortunes and electoral outcomes at the national level.},

Abstract = {By focusing on the ultranationalism of the recently defunct Welsh
   Defence League (WDL), which in turn had a direct influence on the
   formation of its more infamous relation the English Defence League, this
   paper re-examines the long-entrenched discourses of competing
   nationalisms in Wales. By doing so, it highlights a tendency to
   emphasise only left-leaning cultural and linguistic nationalist types in
   that country's historiography, as opposed to the more violent, albeit
   minority, racist/new racist varieties to be found amongst recent extreme
   right groupings. Such extreme right antipathy in Wales is not
   Anglophobic but is directed rather at the `substantial numbers of
   immigrants and minorities. {[}who] have arrived as a result of empire
   and its postcolonial aftermath', particularly those who are Islamic. By
   taking this new perspective on a heretofore generally ignored, but by no
   means insignificant Welsh subaltern group, this work further underlines
   the theoretical difficulties in understanding nationalism(s) generally.
   More importantly, the paper concludes by tracking the newer and smaller
   far right groups to have emerged in Wales in the wake of the WDL's
   collapse. It argues that these derivative groups and the far right
   ideology which they represent are likely to remain marginalised but
   still need to be monitored closely.},

Abstract = {Violence is not the other of politics. By relating this affirmation to
   the fundamental ambivalence of politics, this article proposes to
   reexamine the tensions and the strategies between politics and violence,
   discussing in particular the degrees and the modalities of the latter.
   It seeks to trace the instable and mobile lines that separate and
   relate, on the one hand, forms of cruelty and forms of civility (where
   civility is understood as a politics of antiviolence) and, on the other
   hand, violence and extreme violence. The article confronts the question
   of extreme violence in relation to capitalist globalization,
   communitarian violence and the State, and examines the political
   possibilities and strategies of civility, as a capacity to act in
   conflict and on conflict.},

Abstract = {This chapter outlines the acts of resistance of the relatives of 11
   Pakistani and Indian detainees accused of terrorism in Barcelona, Spain,
   in 2008. These actions were in opposition to the brutal criminalization
   to which the Muslim community had been subjected. Rather than
   considering `orientalization' as an exoticizing strategy or prejudice,
   this chapter demonstrates that it can be understood as an agonistic
   strategy of government. Acts of resistance as acts of citizenship play a
   crucial role in exposing this strategy. Since 2008, not only Muslim
   migrants but also non-Muslim citizens and non-citizens have mobilized to
   call for the release of the detainees and the restoration of the
   presumption of innocence. These acts turned streets, courts, and prisons
   into sites for contesting the anti-terrorist legislation of exception.
   These acts also produced new subjects of power: women, youth, and
   children, who seemingly lacked political subjectivity, had burst onto
   the scene as political subjects claiming not only freedom and the
   presumption of innocence of their imprisoned family members but also the
   dignity of an entire community criminalized by the dominant political
   and media discourses. This episode in Spain enables us to draw some
   broader conclusions about Muslims in Europe, neo-orientalization as a
   strategy of government, and acts of resistance capable of exposing this
   strategy. Even as they are legally constructed as savage non-citizens
   incapable of integration, (Muslim) migrants, through their acts of
   resistance, became activist-citizens against orientalization.},

Title = {Majoritarian exploitation of the fiscal commons: general
   taxes-differential transfers},
Booktitle = {INDIVIDUALISM AND POLITICAL DISORDER},
Year = {2015},
Pages = {81-98},
Abstract = {Do majoritarian democracies overexploit the general tax base, akin to
   the tragedy of the commons? Or, apart horn any consideration of
   efficiency norms, are there ``natural{''} forces in majoritarian
   politics that keep tax rates below revenue-maximizing limits? This paper
   formulates the fiscal process through the metaphor of the commons and
   analyzes the equilibrium that emerges in settings where differing
   majority coalitions may operate simultaneously to place charges on the
   general taxable capacity of the economy. The presence of a ``membership
   externality,{''} emergent horn the necessary intersections of members
   among separate majority coalitions, acts to limit fiscal exploitation,
   even in the pure transfer settings. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Can You Repeat That Please?: Using Monte Carlo Simulation in Graduate
   Quantitative Research Methods Classes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {94-107},
Abstract = {Graduate students in political science come to the discipline interested
   in exploring important political questions, such as ``What causes
   war?{''} or ``What policies promote economic growth?{''} However, they
   typically do not arrive prepared to address those questions using
   quantitative methods. Graduate methods instructors must provide the
   quantitative tools and statistical knowledge for answering these
   questions through data analysis. Often this is done with a heavy
   emphasis on lecture and textbook training, which comes with an array of
   Greek letters, formulae, and formal proofs, or by walking students
   through point-and-click statistical software without ever seriously
   engaging the underlying mathematical concepts. Neither approach is ideal
   because they both leave students lacking real understanding of core
   concepts. In this article, we discuss a useful alternative: Monte Carlo
   simulation. Simulations allow students to experience and visualize the
   meaning of core statistical concepts and to make comparisons between
   various statistical methods. We describe how simulation can illustrate
   these difficult concepts and improve comprehension of foundational
   material, even for students with minimal quantitative backgrounds.},

   Conscription Risk on the Voting Behavior of His Parents},

Abstract = {When do government policies induce responsive political participation?
   This study tests two hypotheses in the context of military draft
   policies. First, policy-induced risk motivates political participation.
   Second, contextual-level moderators, such as local events that make risk
   particularly salient, may intensify the effect of risk on participation.
   I use the random assignment of induction priority in the Vietnam draft
   lotteries to measure the effect of a son's draft risk on the voter
   turnout of his parents in the 1972 presidential election. I find higher
   rates of turnout among parents of men with losing draft lottery numbers.
   Among parents from towns with at least one prior war casualty, I find a
   7 to 9 percentage point effect of a son's draft risk on his parents'
   turnout. The local casualty contextual-level moderator is theorized to
   operate through the mechanism of an availability heuristic, whereby
   parents from towns with casualties could more readily imagine the
   adverse consequences of draft risk.},

Abstract = {This article presents the branding case of EU president Herman Van
   Rompuy. The branding of the political image is at the heart of being
   ``in control.{''} Political candidates, even those with a damaged
   reputation, are therefore challenged to produce an image that projects
   nothing but the positive side of their characters or the traits that fit
   the position they desire. Which are the personality traits required, in
   the given context, from a chief executive of the European Union? And
   which are the traits projected by Van Rompuy? This article introduces
   the psychological profiling technique by Immelman (2004) as a political
   marketing technique. Thanks to this personality assessment that refers
   to the public image, it becomes possible to brand the profile of the
   current EU president and to compare the personal profile with the
   desired one.},

Abstract = {The phenomenon of civil society as a part of political system presents
   distinguished interest in the study of modern democracy. Current
   increased concern about analysis of civil society is based on these
   pillars: social and political development, increasing requirement to
   strengthen public awareness, enforcement of civil participation and
   demand to balance relationship between citizen and government. According
   to the complexity of civil society meaning, the ambition of paper is to
   focus the attention to the one of civil participation forms,
   specifically the impact of grassroots movement Tea Party to the
   different levels of local and national decision-making processes in the
   United States of America. The hypothesis is based on; the United States
   of America creates incomparable preconditions to establish various civil
   movements as a conservative movement the Tea Party. The article
   examines, with the help of analysis and synthesis methods, the
   organizational base of the Tea Party as a unique grassroots movement
   with potential to enforce civil activism and to influence established
   political party.},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {90-109},
Abstract = {Although terrorism is widely understood to be the politically motivated
   creation of fear by means of violence in a target group, the nature of
   that fear is seldom explained or even considered. The present article
   attempts to close that gap by proposing a definition of terror as the
   apprehension of (more) violence to come. Because every terrorist act is
   perceived to be part of a potential series, terror is oriented towards
   the future and involves the imaginary anticipation of prospective
   events. On the basis of this definition, I will examine the
   problematical role of counterterrorist discourse. As the statements of
   public officials and security experts in the run-up to, and during, the
   ``War on Terror{''} demonstrate, the peculiar dynamic of terror is,
   seemingly paradoxically, reinforced by counterterrorist rhetoric. With
   its insistence on the escalatory nature of terrorist violence and its
   repeated prediction of even worse attacks, counterterrorism contributes
   to the evocation of terror in the sense proposed here.},

   analysis of nature, context and organizational structure of mercenary
   armies from Classic Greece to the new forms of corporate mercenarism,
   for instance private military companies. Conclusions show that this type
   of actors constitutes a characteristic element in international

Abstract = {Despite widespread reference in international development discourses to
   the importance of ``effective states,{''} the meaning of effectiveness
   is often unclear. This article presents a theoretical framework for
   analyzing state effectiveness and evaluates it through a comparative
   empirical study. Focusing on efforts to regulate and tax the lucrative
   informal urban transport sector, it maps out the landscape of
   institutions and political interests that underpinned remarkably
   effective outcomes in Rwanda and serial failure in Uganda in the decade
   2000-2010. The article argues that the divergent outcomes are not so
   much a function of differing bureaucratic capacity as the interaction
   between factors such as the credibility of government policies, sources
   of legitimacy, and the role of ``infrastructural power,{''} and how
   these are mediated through differences in political space.},

Abstract = {The colonial Northwest of Western Australia was a harsh frontier, where
   demands for Aboriginal land, labour and knowledge led to dispossession,
   loss of rights, massacre and generations encumbered with the colonial
   legacy. In the Pilbara, there are some rare attempts to engage with this
   difficult colonial history, mainly in the form of heritage site
   interpretation and heritage trails. Overall, the difficult colonial
   history of the Northwest is poorly represented. Colonialism and its
   legacy are not effectively commemorated, nor are distinct local cultural
   and civic attributes highlighted as `lessons from the past'. In this
   paper, we explore the memorialization and commemoration of the
   Northwest's traumatic colonial history and consider a history of how
   heritage has been represented across the landscape. We suggest that the
   affective heritage of the Northwest especially cross-cultural or
   multi-cultural sites and histories can provide a basis for commemorating
   difficult colonial history or violent events that are underrepresented
   in dominant heritage regimes.},

Abstract = {Against the backdrop of the 2008 Obama campaign, participatory online
   tools were one main component of parties' campaigning strategy in
   Germany 2009. They used a wide variety of online tools to communicate
   directly with the voters. While political actors reiterated to
   accentuate the discursive potential of such tools, sceptics questioned
   whether such instrumental campaign communication can facilitate sound
   political discussions. The article analyses whether or not the internet
   fostered citizen participation during the 2009 national election
   campaign for the German Bundestag. A content analysis of the posts and
   comments in the weblogs of the major parties, CDU and SPD, was
   conducted. Results reveal that participation took place only on a very
   low level. Furthermore, the few comments published (370 in four weeks)
   failed to meet basic requirements of deliberation such as objectivity or
   argumentativity. Moreover, both parties actively prevented a free
   discourse as single comments may not have been authorised.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that governance can engender undemocratic inequality,
   exclusion and populism. It does so by analysing the concept of
   governance, and unearthing three theoretical justifications for it: one
   libertarian, one radical and one republican. These justifications are in
   turn refuted by showing how they respectively undermine a process-view
   of democracy, neglect structural avenues for accountability and
   encourage elites to wield power.},

Abstract = {Games Theory constitutes a model by means every player tries to predict
   what they will make the other players in reply to his own actions, and
   to optimize the result of the above mentioned actions in his benefit
   knowing that the others are thinking to about the same form. The
   development of the theory supposed a boom after the World War II, which
   happened of analyzing exclusively competitive behaviors to considering
   situations with competitive and cooperative characteristics.
   Nevertheless, the advance of the humanity and the disappearance of both
   geopolitical blocks have eliminated the balance of power and have
   produced the emergence of a world the most based on the exclusive
   conquest of the power. This has originated the model change and
   dilemmas, happening from the most cooperative models (Prisoner's
   Dilemma) or from the models of the Cold War (Dilemma of the Gallina) up
   to reaching the dilemmas of the Leader or of the Hero. This change of
   paradigm owes to the extension of the globalization, which originates an
   immeasurable loss of economic, social, political power, of human rights,
   which they have affected negatively to the poor people. In this paper is
   studied the change of paradigm caused by the consequences of the
   globalization and the geopolitical transformations in a monopolar world,
   analyzing the consequences on the basis of the Theory of Games},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {77},
Number = {1},
Pages = {188-201},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article develops a model of immigrants' attitudes towards
   immigration. We focus on two competing motivations to explain these
   attitudes: while kinship, solidarity, and shared experiences with other
   immigrants should lead to more favorable attitudes towards immigration,
   formal integration into a new society may create a new allegiance to the
   host country that produces more critical views toward immigration. Using
   the European Social Survey (ESS) 1-5 data collected 2002-11 in 18 West
   European democracies, coarsened exact matching (CEM), and multilevel
   estimation techniques, our analyses reveal that foreigners support
   immigration more than natives. However, newcomers who have acquired
   citizenship in their host countries are more skeptical about the
   consequences of immigration and admitting new arrivals than noncitizen
   immigrants. This negative relationship between citizenship and support
   for immigration is particularly pronounced among those who are
   dissatisfied with their host country's macroeconomy.},

Abstract = {Elaborating on the problematics of the political form that the author
   started in the series of his previous research papers, S. Kaspe
   addresses the topic of an autonomous subject i.e., the one who produces
   and establishes this form. Revealing the internal contingency of both
   notions that are firmly entrenched in the language of political
   philosophy and political science, the author shows that the widely
   spread hopes in Russia for the autonomy of a subject as the best means
   of correcting political form are poorly justified. According to Kaspe's
   opinion, non-autonomous subjects within the autonomous political is the
   state that the Russian society should aspire to.},

Abstract = {A large field experiment sent mail to randomly selected lowturnout
   propensity, young Latino voters in Colorado during the 2008 presidential
   election. One treatment reported that 90\% of young Latinos intended to
   vote in the election. A second treatment added the fact that only 20\%
   of young Latinos actually voted in 2006. A third treatment provided the
   additional fact that 40\% of older Latinos voted in 2006. Compared to
   the control group, the treatment reporting low levels of prior turnout
   decreased participation in the 2008 election. This unintended
   consequence of the campaign provides evidence of the effectiveness of
   descriptive social norms for purposes of electoral mobilization.},

Title = {`And ever give us cause': Understanding the investments of the
   `Ur-anthem', `God Save the King/Queen'},
Journal = {NATIONAL IDENTITIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-61},
Abstract = {This paper engages a close analytical reading of the lyrics of `God Save
   the King/Queen' in order to understand what the functional survival of
   this song tells us about the rhetorical/affective investments of
   national devotion in the British sense. This study asks also how the
   lyrics of `God Save the King/Queen' figure in the general definition of
   anthem and in the generic classification of anthems worldwide? Because
   of the song's international spread, and status as `Ur-anthem', much may
   be gleaned from it as to both the nature of the speech act entailed in
   the prayer-type of anthem and the nature of `anthem quality' more
   generally. `Anthem quality', for the purposes of this paper, is defined
   as that soul stirring effect which certain combinations of music and
   lyrics achieve, most typically in the service of national affiliation.
   Theories of nation and nationalism are drawn on to frame affective
   relations between nation, state and citizenry as implied by, fostered by
   and utilized in anthems. Parodies and other derivative texts are
   considered in order to reach a better understanding of the sources and
   the pragmatic uses of anthem quality in the world today.},

Abstract = {In this article, we critically reflect on the production and measurement
   of `success' and `failure' both in social movements and social movement
   research. We do so by focusing on the Radical Imagination Project, an
   experiment in politically engaged, ethnographically grounded social
   movement research we have sustained in Halifax, Nova Scotia since 2010.
   We discuss our methodological strategy of `convocation,' distinguishing
   it from other social movement research approaches, and reflect on the
   difficulties inherent in practicing these methods within the austere
   realities and pressures of the neoliberal university. We explore the
   ways in which the particular complexities of the fraught field and
   habitus of the would-be academic-activist might be critically assessed
   and best mobilized to assist in the reproduction of movements, without
   also unduly reproducing the neoliberal university or its architectures
   of privilege and power.},

Abstract = {The state-orchestrated plunder of Armenian and Jewish property
   immediately impoverished its victims; this was simultaneously a
   condition for and a consequence of the respective genocides. A series of
   laws and decrees as well as complex bureaucratic mechanisms were devised
   in the Ottoman-Turkish Republican and Nazi Germany periods concerning
   the administration of the belongings left behind by the deported
   Armenians and Jews. This article analyses processes of expropriation of
   these two victim groups on a comparative basis by examining how
   properties of Armenians and Jews changed hands under the veneer of
   legality. The article also highlights similarities and differences
   between the two dispossession processes.},

Abstract = {For decades, scholars have uncovered evidence that male and female
   legislators' priorities and preferences differ and that women's
   inclusion brings to elite-level politics a more cooperative leadership
   style. They also point to the symbolic benefits associated with more
   diversity among candidates and office holders. Although these effects
   are not uniform, there is no question among political scientists that
   women's presence in US political institutions bears directly on issues
   of substantive and symbolic representation. Accordingly, it is important
   to understand why we have so few women in politics, whether they are
   willing to run for office, what happens when they do, and the extent to
   which their presence systematically affects the legislative process. I
   cover each of these topics in this review, emphasizing the latest and
   most interesting research that speaks to these questions.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {433-452},
Abstract = {Although the literature on settler colonialism intends to identify what
   is specific about the settler colonial experience, it can also
   homogenize diverse settler colonial narratives and contexts. In
   particular, in Canada, discussion of the `logic of elimination' must
   contend with the discrete experiences of multiple Indigenous groups,
   including the Me ` tis. This article examines relationships between
   Me'tis people and settler colonialism in Canada to distinguish how
   Me'tis histories contribute to a broader narrative of settler colonial
   genocide in Canada. Cast as `halfbreeds' and considered rebels by the
   newly forming Canadian nation-state, Me'tis peoples were discouraged
   from `illegitimate breeding'. Moreover, their unique experiences of the
   residential school system and forced sterilization have heretofore been
   underexplored in historiographies of genocide and settler colonial
   elimination in Canada. These social, political and racial divisions in
   Canada are magnified through genocidal structures and they reach a
   critical juncture between colonialism and mixed ethnicities. At that
   juncture, groups like the Me'tis in Canada are within a metaphorical gap
   or, more accurately, a jurisdictional gap. Colonial treatment of the
   Me'tis demonstrates, in part, the broad reach of colonial control and
   how uneven it is, often to the detriment of the Me'tis and Indigenous
   groups in Canada.},

Abstract = {The number of aforados has been discussed in recent times in Spain. Most
   authors, after saying that this procedural exception exists only
   exceptionably in the Comparative Constitucional Law, request a
   substantial decrease of its figure in our country. However, this
   research of Comparative Constitutional Law reveals that the aforamiento
   is usual in relation to the Head of State and the Government members in
   the European constitutionalism. By contrast, the parliamentary
   aforamiento is an exceptional situation. Anyway, the Comparative
   Constitutional Law, although useful, should not be decisive in order to
   take a decision about the future of this privilege in our country. In
   this regard, it is absolutely necessary to take into account its
   objectives and the causational and proportionately relationship between
   the adopted measure (aforamiento) and the achievement of those
   objectives in the political, institutional and social context of the
   specific country. And the truth is that the arguments to justify this
   institution, an exception to the principle of equality, are certainly
   weak.},

Abstract = {Using the examples of Germany and UK the article analyses the impact of
   personality (BIG FIVE) on long term stability of important political
   predispositions (political interest, party identification, the strength
   of party identification). Latent growth curve models and regression
   models based on data from the British Household Panel Surveys and the
   German Socio-Economic Panel show that extraverted and open persons are
   more willing to change. Conscientious, by contrast, tend to have a
   stabilizing effect whereas Emotional Stability has no influence on the
   long term stability of party identification and political interest.},

Title = {Unity and Distinctiveness in UK Coalition Government: Lessons for Junior
   Partners},
Journal = {POLITICAL QUARTERLY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {86},
Number = {1},
Pages = {101-109},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Parties in coalition governments must address the unity/distinctiveness'
   dilemma: how to maintain governing cohesion, while sustaining individual
   identities. Within the Cameron-Clegg government this is a challenge for
   both parties, but it is more so for the Liberal Democrats as the junior
   partner. This paper considers how the Liberal Democrats negotiated this
   dilemma in relation to ministerial portfolio allocations. While the
   Liberal Democrat strategy of placing ministers in almost all departments
   has served the Coalition well in terms of governing unity, it has
   limited the extent to which they have been able to assert their
   distinctive contribution to Coalition policy-making. This is
   demonstrated through an examination of the Liberal Democrats' influence
   on Coalition welfare policy. A lack of clear policy contributions is
   potentially highly damaging to the Liberal Democrats electorally, as it
   suggests that they have made little substantive contribution to the
   Coalition beyond propping up their Conservative partners. Accordingly,
   the paper reflects on lessons for junior partners in future UK coalition
   governments, suggesting that concentrating ministers within one or two
   departments may provide a more viable means of carving out a distinctive
   governing legacy.},

   enterprise, where the performers of necessary and surplus labor control
   the production, appropriation, and distribution of the surplus they
   produce. This analysis reveals the shallowness of categorizing
   enterprises based exclusively on whether they are in the private or
   public sector. Funding and ownership are only two of the many
   characteristics needed to specify the social relations of production

Abstract = {Bolivia and Peru adopted the same instruments of social policy -
   conditional cash transfer programs-to solve the same public problems
   under different political regimes. By means of the qualitative
   methodology of discourse analysis, this paper studies the
   representations of poverty and State made by key actors of those social
   programs. Underlying more differences than similarities, one
   demonstrates that the same social policy is linked to opposite social
   representations of poverty and the State role in every country. The main
   explanation for this is, far from being imposed by international
   organizations, those programs are adopted and adapted by each political
   regime.},

Abstract = {The year 1989 was one of the greatest turning points in the history of
   Poland. After the decades of Soviet dominant influence on the shape of
   polish reality, Poland finally gained the opportunity to decide about
   itself. As a result of political transformation and democratic changes,
   Poland achieves possibility to become one of the important elements of
   worldwide security. Reference to the history of formation of the
   Alliance allowed to show the opportunities and challenges which Poland
   had to face on its way to NATO. Participation in a programme ``the
   Partnership for peace{''} (PfP) was crucial for Poland and
   simultaneously, this unique cooperation formula was treated by Poland as
   a mechanism leading to the future membership in the Alliance.},

Title = {The New Anarchism in Britain and the US: towards a richer understanding
   of post-war anarchist thought},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {134-155},
Abstract = {This article challenges the assumption that the post-war era was
   relatively insignificant in the development of anarchist thought. In
   fact, many of the most important figures within the post-war anarchist
   milieu in Britain and the US were concerned with questions of theory as
   well as practice, and their thought comprises a distinct and coherent
   ideological configuration of anarchism. In adapting anarchism to the
   post-war political context, this `New Anarchism' revised key concepts of
   classical anarchism like `revolution' and `utopia', while placing
   stronger emphasis on concepts like `education' and `planning'. The New
   Anarchists were more `practical' than their predecessors, as Ruth Kinna
   has noted-they looked for liberatory potential within the status quo,
   they eschewed sectarianism and they embraced piecemeal change. But the
   New Anarchists shared more than just practicality-they shared an
   innovative vision of anarchism with potential relevance to the present
   day. This article provides an account of the historical context that
   gave rise to the New Anarchism, develops an outline of the New
   Anarchism's main features and proposes some reasons as to why the New
   Anarchism has been neglected.},

Abstract = {This article deals with the question whether and how activation
   processes can be detected by utilizing the concept of attitude
   accessibility, measured by response time. On the basis of
   Rolling-Cross-Section-Data for the German Bundestag elections in 2005,
   2009, and 2013 the accessibility of party identifications and vote
   intentions were analyzed for different sub-groups. While we find a
   slight increase in the accessibility of vote intentions over the course
   of the campaign, the accessibility of party identifications remains
   unchanged. In contrast to studies in other countries, we find that the
   analyzed German elections were not able to activate partisan ties in a
   substantial way.},

Title = {Two Political Worlds? Multi-level Campaign Integration in Canadian
   Constituencies},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {165-182},
Abstract = {The purpose of this article is twofold. First, using survey data from
   Canadian constituency associations, the article explores the extent to
   which federal and provincial parties engage in cross-jurisdictional
   coordination. In doing so, this study builds on and empirically tests
   findings that have been derived from earlier case studies (i.e. Koop,
   2011). Far from inhabiting `two political worlds' the data reveal that
   parties are much more connected than previously thought. Second, the
   article seeks to uncover why some parties and associations are more
   integrated than others. Examining organizational design, the article
   concludes that vertical party integration is not simply an
   organizational phenomenon, as organizationally truncated parties still
   engage in modest levels of informal integration. In addition,

Abstract = {This essay responds to the exchange between Jodi Dean and Stephen Healy
   at the 2013 Rethinking Marxism International Conference. By shifting
   ever so slightly the debate about ``whether or not we need a communist
   party{''} to the question of what such ``communist partying{''} actually
   entails, it seeks to focus attention on the question of communist
   method, practice, and responsibility. What does it mean to ``party{''}
   like a communist? What are the key tasks that a communist party needs to
   take up, and which of them can we-as individuals and as members of
   existing organizations and networks-take up where we are now? How can we
   transform our praxis, our organizations, our audiences, and ourselves in
   advance of the formation of a formal communist party?},

Title = {EU ``Mobility{''} Partnerships: An Initial Assessment of Implementation
   Dynamics},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {117-128},
Abstract = {Cooperation with non-EU countries is a central migration policy priority
   for the EU, and since 2008 eight Mobility Partnerships have been signed.
   Given the importance attached to this policy area, it is essential that
   policy-makers understand how EU external migration policy works in
   practice. However, the literature on the implementation of EU external
   migration policy is very limited. This article addresses this deficit,
   by conducting a conceptual assessment of implementation dynamics in the
   Mobility Partnerships. At this stage in the implementation process, it
   is not yet possible to assess whether the Mobility Partnerships have
   contributed to mobility, which is their stated aim. Instead, the
   literature on implementation is applied in a ``backward{''} fashion,
   starting with the implementation dynamics at play. The article concludes
   that standard analytical frameworks for assessing implementation
   processes will need to be adapted for ``new{''} policy tools featuring
   elements of flexibility or voluntary participation, in order to
   accurately capture implementation processes. Future research should
   adopt a critical, human rights-centred approach to the issue of
   implementation of EU external migration policy.},

Abstract = {As a consequence of the euro crisis, economic and fiscal policy-making
   competencies have been transferred to the EU-level. At the same time,
   national parliaments have seen their capacity to influence the policies
   to combat the crisis curbed. This contribution explores the reaction of
   national parliaments to the crisis and demonstrates stark variation in
   their capacity and willingness to adapt institutionally to the crisis.
   The analysis underlines the causal relevance of existing EU- and
   budget-related competencies that national parliaments possess to account
   for their willingness and ability to adapt institutionally. The euro
   crisis thus cements and perpetuates already existing differences between
   strong and weak parliaments.},

   Member Ideology},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {234-263},
Abstract = {Reformers advocate the use of commissions rather than legislatures to
   redistrict as a way of promoting less partisan districts and
   ideologically moderate congressional members. Much of the evidence in
   political science suggests that gerrymandering is not a cause of
   congressional polarization, but whether or not commissions produce
   different types of districts or members remains an important and
   unanswered question, especially now that many states have adopted
   reforms. This article examines whether commissions reduce district
   partisanship or ideological extremity using time-series-cross-sectional
   data. We find that bipartisan districts promote member moderation, but
   there is no evidence that commissions have distinct effects on districts
   or members as compared to districts drawn by legislatures, consistent
   with the notion that limiting gerrymandering is not a solution for
   polarization. These conclusions call into question the appropriateness
   of redistricting reform, especially when one considers the undemocratic
   nature of commissions.},

Abstract = {What are the conditions under which the promise of citizenship after
   orientalism could be fulfilled? This rather ambitious question, which
   has haunted our work together for some years in myriad manners and
   continues breathing through this volume, is the point of departure of
   this chapter. Of course, such a question cannot be answered in all its
   dimensions. In fact, this is an open question whose value rests less in
   the definite answers it could deliver than in the orientation that it
   proposes, one that indicates the need to question basic assumptions
   inherited from Western political thought. As an entry point to this
   question, then, here I focus on the need to rethink the entanglement
   between the imaginaries of autonomy and citizenship. This entanglement
   becomes perhaps most apparent when we look at it along the lines of
   gender.},

Abstract = {The article examines trends and prospects for political development of
   the leading states in the developing world. The author analyses the
   factors which encourage the rise of new centers of power, as well as
   trends and prerequisites of their emergence in such regions as
   Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. In the post-Cold War international
   system the emergence of neo-imperial integrative centers in the
   developing world is more probable, given such factors as authoritarian
   political regimes in the leading developing countries, inconsistent and
   fragmented modernization, increased multi-polarity in international
   relations, scarce natural resources and expansion of technologies. The
   main characteristics of political relations in Sub-Saharan Africa are
   authoritarianism, political instability, the use of violence and the
   sacred political power. These features as well as a high level of
   competition for natural resources increasingly foster the emergence of
   neo-imperial formations by external forces, relying on the most
   aggressive authoritarian regimes, or by the leaders of African
   development (above all, South Africa). The statehood of Latin American
   countries looks more mature than that of Sub-Saharan Africa; the US
   influence in the region Is likely to be decisive again for its political
   development. Nevertheless, intensifying integration in Latin America
   coupled with further economic fragmentation and political instability
   might lead to the establishment of neo-imperial associations around the
   main centers of power in the region. Thus, the imperial paradigm has the
   potential to be realized in the policy of some states in the both
   regions. Amid increasing political influence of the considered countries
   and their consolidating dominance, subordinate position of the
   peripheral regions and states to the regional powers turns out to be a
   reality.},

Abstract = {Under Norwegian law, the registration of children at birth is regarded
   as the minimum guarantee for their enjoyment of children's rights. But
   how does the legal gender assigned at registration impact on gender
   non-conforming children's and adolescents' experiences? How does the
   regulation of gender assignment under Norwegian law chime with the human
   rights of gender non-conforming children, particularly the right to
   respect for one's private life and non-discrimination? Are there any
   possibilities for children to change their legal gender? This article
   gives voice to the experiences, challenges, and wishes of gender
   non-conforming children. The aim is to show how legal gender intertwines
   with feelings of recognition, self-confidence, selfrespect, and
   self-esteem.},

Abstract = {This article considers the role of principles in perceptions of what
   constitutes acceptable rhetoric in election campaigns. Previous research
   suggests that citizens use principles of what is an acceptable attack in
   campaigns when evaluating charges and countercharges, while
   acknowledging that under some circumstances citizens accept rhetoric
   that would seem to breach their principles. This research has not
   adequately considered how partisanship can affect a respondent's
   proclivity to call upon principles in assessing campaign rhetoric. This
   article draws on three original surveys to test competing models of the
   role of partisanship and finds robust results in support of a strong
   partisan bias. It concludes that it is not that citizens are resilient
   to violations of their principles, but that nearly the opposite is the
   case: citizens' sensitivity to attacks on their preferred candidate
   leads them to take a very partial view of when to apply their principles
   faithfully to a judgment and when not to.},

Abstract = {In much of the literature, the Nordic states are presented as models for
   woman-friendly and gender equality policy. Differences between the
   gendered dimensions among the Nordic countries are less frequently
   explored. From a historical perspective, Norway was a latecomer in
   supporting women working outside the home, yet the Norwegian welfare
   state pioneered support for motherhood and lone mothers. Norway is one
   of the few countries in the world with a specific allowance for lone
   mothers. Today, the need for special welfare benefits for lone mothers
   is in question. This article follows the rise and reduction of the
   Norwegian allowance for lone mothers throughout the 20th century and
   into the early 21st century. While a core reason for developing welfare
   benefits for lone mothers at the start of the 1900s was to support women
   in their traditional, unpaid motherhood roles, this article shows how
   today's dual-earner and dual-career model and workforce policies exclude
   lone motherhood as a social category in need of particular support.},

   proposes a model assessing the development of social space - time from

   implications nature and geography had for societal development and by
   the specific characteristics of local cultures and industrial society,
   where the diffusion of industrial technologies, material artefacts and
   forms of social regulation became the main trend influencing this
   development - through to the present day, when the multiplication of
   identities forming new social spaces and the communicative,
   project-oriented and virtual transformative activities of the individual
   and small groups are gaining priority importance.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-81},
Abstract = {In long-standing democracies, the partisan attachments of most citizens
   are stable and not responsive to short-term political events. Recent
   studies from younger democracies, however, suggest that partisanship may
   be more malleable in these contexts. In this paper we develop hypotheses
   about how political corruption might affect voter attachment to the
   parties of corrupt officials or to the party system as a whole. Using
   data from an original survey experiment in Brazil, we show that prompts
   about political corruption shift patterns of partisan attachment for
   highly educated respondents - specifically, that corruption associated
   with one political party reduces nonpartisanship and significantly
   increases identification with other political parties. In contrast, we
   find that information on corruption has no consistent measurable effect
   on partisanship for less educated respondents. We conclude by discussing
   the implications of malleable partisanship for democratic
   accountability.},

Title = {The pathway out of neoliberalism and the analysis of political ideology
   in the post-crisis world},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {109-133},
Abstract = {Neoliberalism has not simply `survived'; it has failed to die, seemingly
   outlived the socio-economic conditions that gave rise to its existence.
   In this way, the non-death of neoliberalism raises some important
   questions about the nature of ideology, principally: its relationship to
   socio-economic determinants, how it exercises its grip over subjects and
   how this grip, or hold, can itself be exorcised. Seeking insights into
   these questions, this paper tells the story of the scholarly response to
   the non-death of neoliberalism over a ten-year period of crisis: a
   pre-crisis era beginning with the Asian financial crisis (19972007) and
   a post-crisis era beginning with the global financial crisis to the
   present day (2008-2015). The paper considers key scholarly responses to
   the persistence of neoliberalism at three fundamental levels: (a) the
   trajectory of their analytical technique, or the key concepts that
   underpin their wider project; (b) their critique of neoliberalism, or
   how these concepts render the construction of core neoliberal ideals;
   and (c) their ideological response to neoliberalism, or their
   recommendations regarding the pathway out of neoliberalism. On this
   basis, the paper engages in a discussion of the most plausible
   explanation for the non-death of neoliberalism and the most likely
   avenue along which the post-crisis world might build an escape.},

   example with G7) as well as a set of countries with common specifics of
   development. The author divides the analogies into internal and
   external. Among internal analogies there are the level of socio-economic
   development and the political systems. The external analogies include
   the positions of countries in the structure of international relations,
   the striving for multipolarity and the emerging role in the world
   community that means the striving for the promotion of national
   interests and the similar approaches to peaceful settlement of the
   international conflicts. The author highlights the actual mechanisms for
   collaboration between the parties and the future model of cooperation.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {73-89},
Abstract = {This contribution investigates the strategies that environmental
   agencies develop to enhance their policy autonomy, in order to fulfil
   their organisational missions for protecting the environment. This
   article asks whether there are particular strategic moves that an agency
   can make to augment this policy autonomy in the face of the principals.
   Critiquing principal agent theory, it investigates the evolution of
   three environmental agencies (the European Environment Agency, the
   England and Wales Environment Agency and the United States Environmental
   Protection Agency), focusing on the case study of climate change. The
   contribution examines how the agencies influence environmental policy on
   domestic, regional and global levels, with a special focus on the
   principals that constrain agency autonomy. A greater focus on different
   multi-level contexts, which the three agencies face, may create other
   possible dynamics and opportunities for agency strategies. Agencies can
   use particular knowledge, network and alliance building to strengthen
   their policy/political positions.},

Abstract = {We often question how electoral rules will impact elections around the

   literature is that district magnitude (M) will be a key determinant of
   the number of candidates with the number of candidates reduced to
   approximately M + 1. However, using district-level returns, I find that
   the effective number of candidates regularly departs from our
   theoretical expectations of M + 1 candidates. I further explore Jordan's
   unique case with an analysis of both district level characteristics and
   elite level sources of this coordination failure. On the one hand, even
   under authoritarian conditions, the relationship between the number of
   candidates and district magnitude is consistent with the larger
   literature. On the other hand, there is wide variation across districts,
   even among small magnitude ones, suggesting other factors at play that
   dampen the reductive effect of electoral institutions on the number of
   candidates. In particular, I argue it is the regime's strategic
   manipulation of the electoral rules that undermines strategic
   coordination and subverts the expected effects of both institutional and
   sociological factors on the number of electoral competitors. In
   addition, the tribal nature of Jordanian politics, and specifically the
   inability of tribal elites to limit entry, is a significant source of
   the large number of candidates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Based on the 2009 National Survey of Elderly Dependency we characterize
   older people who are dependent in Chile, and we compute multivariate
   logistic regression models to assess the factors associated with
   dependency. In addition to age and the presence of diseases, there are
   other factors that are associated with increased prevalence of
   dependence, such as educational level, quality of family relationships
   and conducting activities such as physical exercise and reading. We also
   characterize and describe the level of well-being of the informal
   caregivers of the dependent persons. Stress informal caregiver is
   expressed both by an increase in depressive feelings and overload, as
   well as by a deterioration of physical health, who also tend to be
   women, older, low educational levels, intensifying further vulnerability
   context of this group.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Political scientists often need to evaluate whether samples are
   comparable, for example, when analysing different countries or time
   points or when comparing data collected using different methods. A
   necessary condition for conducting such meaningful cross-group
   comparisons is the establishment of measurement invariance. One of the
   most frequently used procedures for establishing measurement invariance
   is the multigroup confirmatory factor analysis. This method was
   criticised in the literature because it may suggest that a model fits
   the data although it may contain serious misspeciflcations. We present
   an alternative method to test for measurement invariance using detection
   of local misspecifications and illustrate its use on two data sets
   assessing value priorities that are often analysed in political science
   and collected using paper-and-pencil and web modes of data collection.},

Abstract = {The challenge of public administration reform is well known: Politicians
   often have little interest in the efficient implementation of government
   policy. Using new data from 439 World Bank public sector reform loans in
   109 countries, we demonstrate that such reforms are significantly less
   likely to succeed in the presence of non-programmatic political parties.
   Earlier research uses evidence from a small group of countries to
   conclude that clientelist politicians resist reforms that restrict their
   patronage powers. We support this conclusion with new evidence from many
   countries, allowing us to rule out alternative explanations, including
   the effect of electoral and political institutions. We also examine
   reforms that have not been the subject of prior research: those that
   make public sector financial management more transparent. Here, we
   identify a second mechanism through which non-programmatic parties
   undermine public sector reform: Clientelist politicians have weaker
   incentives to exercise oversight of policy implementation by the
   executive branch.},

Abstract = {As policy making for Indian gaming and other tribal issues has shifted
   from the federal government to state politics and state legislatures
   over the past several decades, the role of American Indians in the
   electoral process in state legislative elections deserves greater
   scholarly attention. We examine changes in voting patterns among state
   legislative elections over a 40-year period for districts with and
   without casinos. In the past, Democrats held a large advantage in casino
   districts both in terms of the two-party vote share and in terms of
   incumbents running unopposed when seeking reelection. Since the 1990s,
   this traditional Democratic advantage has largely disappeared to a point
   where the two parties compete at rough parity in these districts. In
   several states, American Indians represent a sizeable and potentially
   influential voting bloc.},

Abstract = {Presidential elections are conducted in two stages. The November general
   election is proceeded by a series of contests where delegates are
   selected to national party conventions, which is where the parties
   select their candidates for the fall election. These nominating
   contests' political environments vary: the rules regarding who can
   participate; the levels of electoral competition, which are related to
   when they are held; and that other offices present on the ballot, if
   any. We explore the effects of these conditions on voter participation
   in recent presidential contests and generally find turnout highest in
   competitive and inclusive contests where other offices are on the
   ballot. Examining the 2008 American National Election Panel Study, we
   find primary voters are more ideologically extreme than general election
   voters, but there is little difference between voters in closed and open
   primary states. We suggest primary type has little effect on the
   ideological composition of the electorate because modern nomination
   contests are low turnout elections that draw only the most politically
   interested.},

Abstract = {This written constitutes one of the first contributions to the study of
   the conflict over the lands of the resguardos between the indigenous
   people and the government in Colombia by making an emphasis in the
   historic process in which the dispute has developed examining also the
   perspectives of these two parties over the land through time. The
   analysis of this article is unique because it is focused specifically in
   the analysis of the indigenous reservation lands, considered as one the
   continuous reasons which keep maintaining the scuffle between these two
   parties over the ownership of the land that seen from the point of view
   of the government is a mere mean of production for economic progress
   while on the contrary from the perspective of the indigenous people is a
   sacred area in which the deities manifest and their historic traditions
   are maintained alive.},

Abstract = {The future of reconstructive presidential leadership is in question. It
   is increasingly difficult to tear out and replace institutions in
   today's constraining environment. However, historical-institutional
   theory suggests that alternative leadership possibilities exist. A
   reconstructive president may be able to reorder the political regime
   through application of a multiple modalities of change strategy. This
   project explores this prospect through study of Ronald Reagan's
   accomplishments in the budget battles of 1981. It applies a new analytic
   approach to determine if his well-known successes can be translated into
   the historical-institutional conceptual framework. It confirms that
   previously hypothesized leadership possibilities exist and demonstrates
   the utility of the new analytic approach to the study of institutional
   change. Pros and cons of modern reconstructive leadership are
   illuminated and the new change-framework is recommended for broader
   application in presidential studies.},

Title = {Organizations and the Democratic Representation of Interests: What Does

Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {13},

Pages = {1017-1029},

Abstract = {This article documents the prevalence in organized interest politics in
   the United States of organizationsfor example, corporations, think
   tanks, universities, or hospitalsthat have no members in the ordinary
   sense and analyzes the consequences of that dominance for the democratic
   representation of citizen interests. We use data from the Washington
   Representatives Study, a longitudinal data base containing more than
   33,000 organizations active in national politics in 1981, 1991, 2001,
   2006, and 2011. The share of membership associations active in
   Washington has eroded over time until, in 2011, barely a quarter of the
   more than 14,000 organizations active in Washington in 2011 were
   membership associations, and less than half of those were membership
   association with individuals as members. In contrast, a majority of the
   politically involved organizations were memberless organizations, of
   which nearly two-thirds were corporations. The dominance of memberless
   organizations in pressure politics raises important questions about
   democratic representation. Studies of political representation by
   interest groups raise several concerns about democratic inequalities:
   the extent to which representation of interests by groups is unequal,
   the extent to which groups fail to represent their members equally, and
   the extent to which group members are unable to control their leaders.
   All of the dilemmas that arise when membership associations advocate in
   politics become even more intractable when organizations do not have
   members.},

Abstract = {Love is often a key factor in migration decisions. Partner relationships
   and union formation have also been identified as forming an intrinsic
   part of intra-European migration. Nevertheless, empirical research into
   intra-European love migration remains rather scarce. In this paper, we
   focus on the often neglected but substantial intra-European moves. We
   analyse the relationship between bi-national couple formation,
   identification as a European and European transnational solidarity. The
   analyses are based on the EUMARR survey, investigating bi-national
   marriages in a unified Europe, comparing European bi-national and
   uni-national couples. In this paper, we focus on the Netherlands (n=898)
   and compare Dutch-Dutch with Dutch-EU couples. Our findings indicate
   that bi-national couples are more likely to identify as European
   compared to uni-national couples, but this is not reflected in more
   solidarity to European countries in times of crisis. Implications of
   these findings are discussed in light of the European integration
   process.},

Abstract = {In 2014, 67 women were murdered in Chile due to gender reasons; however,
   only 40 were reported as femicide under current legislation that
   punishes only those murders of women by their partners or former
   partners, excluding other types of gender violence, resulting in death.
   This omission adds the fact that this type of crime has been recorded as
   femicidio in detriment of feminicidio, a name that is used in other
   parts of the world. This, because chilean state denies its share of
   responsibility in these crimes. Questioning the definition and rethink
   the laws designed to safeguard the lives of women should be the first
   step for a particular change in legislation, as well as in the
   consciousness of all the Chilean people.},

Abstract = {How do the states in Western Europe turn outsiders into insiders? This
   article examines that question by introducing a new qualitative
   framework that we term national membership conditionality structures
   (MCS). This framework includes not only status acquisition rules, such
   as those governing naturalisation and settlement, but also, crucially,
   civic integration requirements and social benefit eligibility standards.
   The article illustrates how linkages across these policy sectors shape
   different membership-making processes for third-country nationals by
   examining the MCS variation in Great Britain and Germany, two countries
   that both experienced significant migration inflows beginning in the
   first post-war decades. As a contrast to these two mature' MCS cases, a
   study of Spain is also included as a nascent' case, whose recent
   experience with large-scale immigration provides an opportunity to
   consider an MCS under active construction. The article concludes that
   while EU-level policies and institutions have extended their reach to
   cover ever more sectors, the components of national MCS remain largely
   outside supranational purview. As such, membership remains a core
   imperative of the contemporary nation-state.},

Abstract = {This analysis considers the emergence of South Africa's parliamentary
   diplomacy, or the role of Parliament on the international stage, since
   1994. The early discourse both within Parliament and in academic
   analysis, reflects an emphasis on the role of oversight and the role of
   Parliament in the foreign policy decision-making process. Recognition of
   the role of parliamentary diplomacy has been slow to develop, although
   Parliament is increasingly acknowledging its role as an international
   actor. This has seen the development of structures and policy to support
   this. The value of parliamentary diplomacy as part of a country's
   international relations, however, remains an area in need of further
   deliberation. This analysis begins by unpacking the concept of
   parliamentary diplomacy before addressing the emerging role and value of
   parliamentary diplomacy for South Africa, particularly through the
   linkages between parliamentary diplomacy and soft power in promoting
   foreign policy.},

Abstract = {Ilya Somin's Democracy and Political Ignorance represents a missed
   opportunity to fully examine the implications of public ignorance in
   modern democracies. Somin persuasively argues that existing levels of
   public ignorance undermine the main normative accounts of democratic
   legitimacy, and he demonstrates that neither cognitive shortcuts nor
   heuristics can provide a quick fix for democracy. However, Somin seeks
   to find a simple explanation for public ignorance in the conscious,
   rational choices of voters. He thus commits to the position that voters
   choose to be ignorant and irrational-and to the simplistic implication
   that given the right incentives they would choose otherwise. This
   position is empirically problematic, methodologically flawed, and
   theoretically redundant. On the more plausible view that ignorance is
   the inadvertent result of social complexity, it is clear that simply
   focusing on incentives tells us little about what voters would or would
   not know under different institutional circumstances.},

   in cross-border succession within the EU. This study was carried out as
   a part of a bachelor thesis conducted on the same subject. The data were
   collected from relevant jurisprudence, international law, national acts,
   the EU published materials and case law. These results suggest that the
   legally undefined LHR is an unstable connecting factor for the purposes
   of the Succession Regulation, since it cannot guarantee sufficient legal
   certainty, and hence, the EU citizens are not able to fully utilize
   their right to free movement. The findings indicate that there might be
   a need to amend a legal definition for the LHR, not only for the EU
   Member States to be able to apply the concept in an harmonized way, but
   also for the EU citizens to know whether they are considered habitually
   resident in a state or not.},

Abstract = {This article analyses Egypt and Iraq in the context of the electoral
   system design during the post-dictatorial transition process. Regime
   changes in both countries were followed by free and fair elections.
   However, as of late 2014 both countries arc in a heavy state of
   uncertainty. The Iraqi electoral system was designed so as to
   materialize a high level of proportionality. On the one hand, this made
   the fair representation of different ethnic, religious and sectarian
   groups in the parliament possible. On the other,it made political
   groupings nothing but the reflection of the ethnic and sectarian
   identities. In the districts where the PR applied in Egypt the seat
   distribution proved to be proportional, however in the single member
   districts the Islamists won a much larger proportion of seats than their
   vote share. This contributed to their dominance in the parliament.},

Abstract = {Models of decision-making with outcome uncertainty are common in
   political science and related fields. Recent work in flagship journals
   has challenged canonical work by modeling outcome uncertainty as
   Brownian motion. This theoretical innovation has resonated because it is
   highly tractable and captures intuitively important realities of many
   decisions in ways that earlier models cannot. As theoretically
   attractive as the new models are, they have not yet been evaluated
   empirically. This is especially important because Brownian motion models
   place actors in more cognitively demanding situations than previous
   models. We offer what we believe to be the first experimental test of
   actors' ability to behave in ways consistent with the Brownian motion
   model by evaluating subjects' ability to rationally learn from another
   actor's experiences. We show that subjects adjust their actions in
   response to the Brownian motion uncertainty. However, they deviate from
   optimal behavior in important ways, particularly in more complex
   situations.},

Abstract = {If one accepts that religious arguments ought to be included in
   democratic deliberations, three problems immediately arise. First,
   religious arguments will not persuade those who do not accept the
   religious premises, so religious arguments do not seem to contribute to
   deliberative opinion and will formation. Second, democratic arguments
   will not persuade religious citizens who prioritize their religious
   commitments ({''}integralists{''}), who seem to be excluded from
   deliberative opinion and will formation. Third, if an integralist makes
   a religious argument intending to persuade, then she seems to be
   appealing to an invidious double standard: she expects her fellows to be
   potentially persuaded by her religious argument when she is not
   reciprocally open to persuasion on the basis of their comprehensive
   views. I argue that approaching deliberation from a deliberative systems
   view provides a powerful approach to each of these three problems
   unavailable to more traditional understandings of deliberative
   democracy.},

Abstract = {The crises of the American republic from climate change to economic
   inequality to overextended empire make the subject of political
   imagination pressing. What future do we want for ourselves? How do we
   reconcile that vision with empirical reality? Political imagination
   concerns the scope and shape of the possible. Democratic theorist Jason
   Frank makes conflicts over political imagination the center of his
   scholarship. This symposium focuses on his recent work. That work helps
   us address two significant challenges in democratic struggles over
   political imagination. First, how does a democratic people wanting to
   make a new start, to revolutionize the polity, orient itself to the
   founding myths of society, especially when those myths such as that of
   the American founders have such a strong hold on public imagination?
   Second, how can a democratic people recover the transformative power and
   possibility of the idea of ``the people{''} that authorized the work of
   the founders, and that may authorize their supersession? This
   introduction outlines the contours of the Polity symposium on
   ``Political Imagination and The Problem of Founding: The Work of Jason
   Frank{''} and provides background on Frank's scholarship.},

Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {50},

Pages = {399-416},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The main focus of this article is on how the Swedish mainstream parties
   on the centre-left and the centre-right have dealt with the immigration
   issue. After brief overviews of trends in immigration and public
   opinion, the history of immigration in Swedish politics since the 1980s
   is discussed. It is argued that the 2002 election campaign was of
   pivotal importance for a number of reasons; most importantly because it
   politicised labour immigration. The main empirical part consists of a
   qualitative content analysis of 25 election manifestos from 2002, 2006
   and 2010. The analysis shows a clear difference between the mainstream
   parties and the Sweden Democrats. More importantly, there are
   differences also among the mainstream parties, in terms of the relative
   amount of space devoted to immigration as well as substantive content.
   This is most evident on the centre-left. There is more coherence on the
   centre-right, but also here underlying tensions can be detected. Thus,
   the issue of immigration has the potential to destabilise the two main
   political blocs, as well as the entire party system.},

Abstract = {This article critiques the increasing claims in scholarly and diplomatic
   circles of a putative South African hegemony in Africa. On the backdrop
   of the recalibration of Nigeria's GDP making it Africa's largest
   economy, there have been counter arguments that South Africa's regional
   influence is dwindling as a result of its staggering economy among other
   domestic impediments. In this paper, I take the position that although
   South Africa's capacity to fulfil a hegemonic role may be hindered by
   internal and external ambivalences, these factors do not in any way
   disqualify the country from playing a hegemonic role. I conclude by
   making the assertion that our regional understanding of hegemony in the
   African context must be one that operates beyond the realm of the
   preponderant material capabilities of a state into reasonable measures
   of ideational characteristics.},

Abstract = {Despite a growing interest in investigating the causes of political
   corruption, far less attention has been devoted to analysing the
   conditions under which political actors have an incentive to highlight
   corruption in electoral competition. Do parties talk about corruption
   just as a reaction to exogenous factors (i.e. scandals reported in the
   press)? Or are there systematic patterns in the way parties emphasize
   this issue during campaigns? Assuming that corruption is a valence issue
   (i.e. an issue universally supported/disclaimed by electors), we put our
   investigation in the framework of a one-dimensional model and
   hypothesize that spatial considerations can affect parties' incentives
   to emphasize corruption issues. Empirical analysis based on CMP data
   shows that such an incentive exists for both cabinet and non-cabinet
   parties, and increases with proximity on the ideological scale.},

Abstract = {Candidates to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives vary considerably
   with regard to the extent to which they run personalized campaigns.
   However, very few candidates get elected on the basis of preference
   votes. In light of this weak link between preference voting and, the
   actual allocation of mandates, this paper asks about why Belgian
   candidates run personalized campaigns at all. Our findings point to the
   impact of the following factors in this regard: district magnitude,
   party magnitude, electoral safety, and seniority with regard to party
   organizational offices. Furthermore, our findings also demonstrate
   considerable differences between Belgian parties with regard to the
   extent to which their candidates run personalized campaigns. (C) 2014

Abstract = {The article analyses how the setting of EU simulations influences
   negotiation outcomes, that is, the content of the simulated directives.
   We have played the same simulation of the chocolate directive - the same
   roles and the same Commission proposal - in various settings (with
   different kinds of participants, various group sizes, for one or two
   days, with instructors or participants playing the European Parliament
   (EP)). A quantitative analysis elucidates relations between settings and
   outcomes we would not see when considering only one simulation at a
   time. First, the simulation scales well. Simulation duration, number and
   kind of participants have little impact on the range of outcomes.
   Second, the directive is more liberal if participants play the EP,
   indicating that our instructors play the EP too tough. Third, Swiss
   participants negotiate stricter and more consensual directives. These
   results can inform the further evolution of the simulation based on hard
   data.},

Abstract = {Scholars have suggested that interest groups affect the diffusion of
   innovations across states by creating a network of information between
   the states that aids in the spread of policy ideas. Still, the unique
   role that interest groups play in policy diffusion networks is not fully
   understood, in large part because the current methodology for studying
   diffusion cannot parse out interest group influence. We address this
   problem by analyzing the actual text of legislation, moving away from
   binary adoption to a more nuanced measure of policy similarity. This
   allows us to distinguish whether states emulate other states or interest
   group model legislation. We use text similarity scores in a social
   network analysis to explore whether early-adopting states or interest
   groups are more central to the network. We apply this analytical
   framework to two policiesabortion insurance coverage restrictions and
   self-defense statutes. Based on this analysis, we find that a
   fundamentally different picture of policy diffusion networks begins to
   emergeone where interest group model legislation plays a central role in
   the diffusion of innovations.},

Abstract = {With the adoption of subsidiarity as a key norm in governance structures
   of the European Union, the principle has gained a degree of public
   currency. In this article, I consider subsidiarity as it has been
   invoked in support of decentralization and federalist political
   arrangements generally. I note that prevailing conceptions of
   subsidiarity have tended to neglect or only superficially appreciate its
   foundations in Catholic social doctrine. This, I contend, is no mere
   genealogical oversight: the separation of subsidiarity from its
   theological grounding obscures important features of the normative
   principle. These features-principally assumptions regarding social
   ontology and the normative function of civil associations-ultimately
   render the Catholic principle of subsidiarity incompatible with some of
   the prescriptive conclusions it is regularly alleged to support.},

Title = {Reevaluating the sociotropic economic voting hypothesis},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {39},
Pages = {15-25},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {One of the canonical causal claims in political science links
   individuals' evaluations of the national economy with their votes. Yet
   there are reasons to expect that these economic perceptions are
   endogenous to vote choice, meaning that existing cross-sectional models
   cannot provide a valid test of the causal retrospective voting claim.
   Using an instrumental variables approach, we assess the effect of
   sociotropic evaluations on the decision to vote for the incumbent
   president or his party's candidate in eight recent U.S. presidential
   elections. In contrast with prior work, our results reveal that while
   there is a correlation between sociotropic evaluations and vote choice,
   individuals' subjective evaluations only exert a causal effect on votes
   when there is not an incumbent president on the ballot. These results
   suggest that, when incumbents are on the ballot, individuals' economic
   perceptions are particularly clouded by appraisals of the incumbent and
   thus do not operate as an exogenous influence on votes. (C) 2015

Abstract = {This essay assesses the several phases of denial from the time of the
   1915 Armenian Genocide to the present, with emphasis on the most recent
   stage and contemporary deniers in the United States. The study analyzes
   their arguments and approaches, with particular attention on negationist
   assertions relating to intent and the claimed necessity of
   counterinsurgency measures against the Armenian population of the
   Ottoman Empire. It gives numerous examples of the factual errors and
   fallacies in the rationalizations that are employed. Modern denial is
   characterized by increased sophistication, which can include the use of
   seemingly sound research methods and critical-thinking techniques.
   Because it can look to be legitimate scholarship, denial in this form
   can be particularly deceptive for students and others who might not be
   well informed about the historical facts and extensive evidence of the
   Armenian Genocide. The essay concludes with a reflection on the need for
   strong peer-evaluation standards for journals and presses to avoid
   publication of denialist material.},

Abstract = {Ballot initiatives are consequential and common, with total spending on
   initiative campaigns in the US rivaling that of Presidential campaigns.
   Past work using observational data has alternately found that initiative
   campaign spending cannot affect initiative outcomes, can increase the
   number of votes rejecting (but not approving) initiatives, or can affect
   outcomes in either direction. We report the first field experiment to
   evaluate an initiative advocacy campaign with precision. We find that
   campaigns can influence both rejection and approval of initiatives by
   changing how citizens vote, as opposed to by influencing turnout or
   ballot completion. Our experiment (involving around 18 \% of Oregon
   households in 2008) studied a statewide mail program conducted by a
   Political Action Committee. Results further suggest that two initiatives
   would have passed if not for the advocacy campaign to reject them. We
   discuss implications for theories about direct democracy, campaign
   finance, and campaign effects.},

Abstract = {This article analyses problem framings in public debates on family
   migration in Finland. The study focuses on the less-examined category of
   age and how it intersects with gender, race and religion. We examine the
   discursive context within which parliamentarians and the media negotiate
   questions of migration policies, belonging and citizenship. Our analysis
   identifies problem framings by combining frame analysis with the What is
   the problem represented to be?' approach, which understands policies as
   problematizations. We found that the debates held up the rather common
   notion of vulnerable women and children as groups that tighter family
   migration policies protect. The debates excluded certain racialized
   migrant families from cultural citizenship. Simultaneously, however, the
   public debate whitewashed' other families to make them suitable for
   inclusion. Here, the right to care for elderly family members played a
   central part in negotiations over cultural citizenship.},

Abstract = {This paper interweaves an ancient conceptualization of movement and
   mobility with the paradigmatic case of early twentieth-century Chinese
   migration to the USA in order to explore migrants' ability to both
   re-interpret institutional control of movement and generate identities
   that garner institutional and community acceptance. By not settling'
   migrants into the discourse of (undocumented) immigrants, the paper (i)
   develops a framework for the study of migrants-state interactions that
   goes beyond claims to citizenship and demands for rights and (ii)
   explores practices and means through which migrants gain access to
   restricted territories and maintain presence in otherwise unwelcoming
   communities. The paper argues that such practices explicate the autonomy
   of migration: a phenomenon that is constitutive to processes of
   political transformation and is critical to the study of state
   sovereignty, citizenship rights, and political agency.},

Abstract = {Under what circumstances do new constitutions promote democracy? Between
   1974 and 2011, the level of democracy increased in 62 countries
   following the adoption of a new constitution, but decreased or stayed
   the same in 70 others. Using data covering all 138 new constitutions in
   118 countries during that period, we explain this divergence through
   empirical tests showing that overall increased participation during the
   process of making the constitution positively impacts postpromulgation
   levels of democracy. Then, after disaggregating constitution-making into
   three stages (drafting, debating, and ratification) we find compelling
   evidence through robust statistical tests that the degree of citizen
   participation in the drafting stage has amuch greater impact on the
   resulting regime. This lends support to some core principles of
   ``deliberative{''} theories of democracy. We conclude that
   constitutional reformers should focus more on generating public ``buy
   in{''} at the front end of the constitution-making process, rather than
   concentrating on ratification and referendums at the ``back end{''} that
   are unlikely to correct for an ``original sin{''} of limited citizen
   deliberation during drafting.},

Abstract = {Social cooperation is critical to a wide variety of political and
   economic outcomes. For this reason, international donors have embraced
   interventions designed to strengthen the ability of communities to solve
   collective-action problems, especially in post-conflict settings. We
   exploit the random assignment of a development program in Liberia to
   assess the effects of such interventions. Using a matching funds
   experiment we find evidence that these interventions can alter
   cooperation capacity. However, we observe effects only in communities in
   which, by design, both men and women faced the collective action
   challenge. Focusing on mechanisms, we find evidence that program effects
   worked through improvements in mobilization capacity that may have
   enhanced communities' ability to coordinate to solve mixed gender
   problems. These gains did not operate in areas where only women took
   part in the matching funds experiment, possibly because they could rely
   on traditional institutions unaffected by the external intervention. The
   combined evidence suggests that the impact of donor interventions
   designed to enhance cooperation can depend critically on the kinds of
   social dilemmas that communities face, and the flexibility they have in
   determining who should solve them.},

Abstract = {This essay examines John Locke's engagement with monsters as a question
   of toleration in the Essay Concerning Human Understanding. Recounting a
   monster's birth as a case of uncertain identity, Locke endorses a
   provisional form of judgment. I compare this response with Michel de
   Montaigne's treatment of monsters in his Essays in order to highlight a
   politics of imagination and reason relevant to political judgment and
   toleration. Montaigne alerts us to significant silences in Locke's
   treatment of monsters that reveal unrecognized dimensions of his
   tolerationist position in the Essay. The provisional judgment forwarded
   by each thinker resituates toleration from epistemological questions of
   identity toward various practices of acknowledgment as theorized by
   Stanley Cavell. Some of these practices of acknowledgement, I contend,
   are better suited to the conditions of democratic membership.},

Abstract = {Saliency approaches derive from the basic idea that political parties
   define their policies by emphasising certain topics more than others,
   particularly in public documents and debates. However, the approaches
   diverge on whether parties always emphasise the same `owned' issues or
   can emphasise different ones in different elections with a view to
   winning votes. The article explores the way these differences developed
   and summarises them in a typology of `issue ownerships', within which
   models linking `ownership' to election outcomes can be located.},

Abstract = {Existing research considers issue ownership to be a positive attribute
   of political parties, which are seen as `owning' those policy areas
   where they are particularly competent and engaged. However, for some
   citizens a party may also be a negative issue owner if it has a
   particularly bad reputation for its handling of an issue. This article
   describes and explains aggregate and individual-level patterns of
   negative issue ownership using a survey-based measure of handling
   perceptions from the 2013 Austrian National Election Study (n = 3,266).
   Naming a particular party as a negative issue owner is affected by
   partisanship, but also by policy preferences and government performance
   evaluations. The effects of issue importance vary across issues. These
   findings lay the groundwork for more research on negative attributions
   of issue ownership and their empirical consequences on vote choice.},

Title = {The changing nature of the Australian welfare state: A critical analysis
   of the ACOSS campaign to increase the Newstart Allowance},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {50},
Number = {3},

Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {The Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) is Australia's leading
   welfare advocacy group. During 2011-13, ACOSS coordinated a high-profile
   campaign to lift the rate of the Newstart allowance for the unemployed.
   The campaign used a number of advocacy strategies such as policy
   reports, petitions, media releases, support from other key interest
   groups and consultations with parliamentarians, but was unsuccessful in
   persuading the Labor government to amend the payment rate. This article
   argues that the campaign was always going to struggle to succeed given
   the Australian welfare state's historical preference for labour market
   engagement over broader social rights. Other barriers included the
   budget deficit, the increasing influence of social-investment philosophy
   which prioritises active rather than passive social protection, the
   general international trend towards payment conditionality and the
   challenge of advocating policy change against combined opposition from
   the two major political
   parties.???????????????????????????2011??2013??,??????????????,?????????

Journal = {REVISTA ESPANOLA DE CIENCIA POLITICA-RECP},
Year = {2015},
Number = {38},
Pages = {63-84},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article explores the applicability of the model developed by
   Chourabi et al. (2012) to the urban reality of Shanghai, China. The
   eight variables of the model: 1) governance and public urban planning 2)
   management and organization 3) technology 4) policy context 5) people
   and communities 6) economy 7) built-in infrastructure, 8) and natural
   environment, are examined against the Shanghai case. The findings are
   that for Shanghai the smart city plan inherits a process of
   transformation in place from the beginning of 1990s in four areas of
   public policy: governance, technology, built-in infrastructure and
   economy. The smart city plan, however, develops specificities for
   management and organization and shows a built-in capacity to develop a
   favorable policy context with the central government more recently. We
   have found a limited scope for people and communities and the natural
   environment shaping changes which are so-called smart. The framework
   applied allows us to show the significant role that the local government
   plays in the city through public policy. This framework contributes to
   extend the scope of comparative urban theory and analysis beyond the
   western world, in the East Asian context, allowing further comparison
   across cities. Final results might be used to complete new research
   programs, as we conclude.},

Abstract = {The question posed in this article is how parliamentary position affects
   the attitudes of political representatives: Do attitudes towards
   democratic game rules and policy content differ between members of the
   ruling majority and the opposition? And if there is such an effect, what
   could be the possible causal mechanisms? The data derive from a unique
   survey of all 13,044 councillors in the 290 municipalities in Sweden.
   The results show that, within all political parties, opposition members
   are more positive towards participatory democracy, while majority
   members favour representative democracy. Furthermore, being in office
   de-radicalises representatives on the left-right scale, while being out
   of office has a radicalising effect.},

Abstract = {This text analyzes stories about the armed conflict told by secondary
   school students from three public schools. The first section identifies
   common elements related to the origins, development, and key actors of
   the armed conflict. The students' voices express naturalization of the
   war, immobilizing fear, and a hegemonic story of ``good guys{''} and
   ``bad guys.{''} The second section explores the stories, which identify
   different occurrences, actors, and victims as a result of the armed
   conflict. These nuances show the contradictions present in society
   regarding the conflict, its possible solutions, and the construction of
   democratic relations. Finally, the empirical material is connected with
   theoretical discussions related to memory and the teaching of history.},

   analysis of policy drift in Belgium},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {50},
Number = {3},
Pages = {297-319},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Government agreements (GAs) are key drivers of future policies in most
   countries with multi-party coalitions and also serve to limit policy
   initiatives not included in the GA. However, little is known about how
   this `grip' of GAs over policies changes over time. Throughout the
   legislative term, new policy issues arise and public demands change. If
   governments are responsive, they address these issues, leading to
   increasing divergence from the GA: policy drift. The central question
   this study addresses is whether the changing social and
   politico-strategic environment leads to a fading grip of the GA on
   policy, causing policy drift vis-a-vis the initial policy program. Using
   an agenda-setting approach, we map the policy priorities of the GAs to
   two measures of policy priorities of Belgian governments from 1992 to
   2006: ministerial council decisions and state of the union speeches.
   Despite evidence of intrusion of policy issues from beyond the GA, we do
   not find policy drift, in terms of systematic temporally determined
   deviation from the `original' policy priorities. Hence, this study finds
   that GAs, at least in Belgium, maintain control over the policy agenda,
   both as a source and a constraint, on future policies throughout the
   legislature.},

   to problematize the discursive strategies that conceal the structural

Abstract = {One of the key questions in studies of voting behaviour is how voters
   rank or form preferences between parties. In this article, we study how
   the set of alternatives provided by the party system affects voters'
   preference formation. More specifically, we study whether the proximity
   of a political party in the conventional left-right dimension is a
   better predictor of a voter's preference when parties offer distinct
   positions than when parties' positions are close to each other. Using
   the data provided by the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, we find
   convincing evidence that supports the argument that proximity is more
   salient in polarized party systems compared with party systems where
   polarization is low.},

   double challenge raisen by this new law at the legal systems: the
   overcoming of the pathologizing perspective of transsexuality as well as
   the challenge to the male / female binary system from which the rights
   onwership is built.},

Abstract = {The Republic of Macedonia has twenty-four years' tradition of
   parliamentary democracy. The goal of this paper is to determine effects
   of professionalization of the Macedonian parliamentary elite in seven
   parliamentary terms from 1991 to 2011. The professionalization of
   parliamentary elite is defined as process that means creating high
   standards for access to a parliamentary seat. Effects of
   professionalization are detected in the research of the parliamentary
   elites of the European countries. The effects of professionalization
   could be detected by using indicators that measure a few aspects of
   transformation of parliamentary elites as the age structure, the level
   and the type of education, the professional occupation, the political
   experience and the percent of re-elected members of parliament. The
   effects of professionalization detected in this paper show growth and
   decline of the trend of professionalization of the Macedonian
   parliamentary elite.},

   tops Li Keqiang's agenda for 2015. Having gained confidence from the
   experience of 2014, the government aims to employ more flexible and
   targeted policy instruments in macroeconomic management. Modifying
   growth targets downwards, the Li government also aims to push forward
   reforms in several areas, including administrative streamlining,
   deregulation and liberalisation of investment financing, and fiscal and
   taxation reforms.},

Title = {Contested sovereignty as an opportunity: understanding democratic
   transitions in unrecognized states},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {610-630},
Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that democratic transitions can take
   place even in political entities that lack international sovereignty, or
   recognition. Based upon democratic transitions in several unrecognized
   states, they have argued that such a process requires mainly the
   existence of a functioning government and basic state institutions.
   Other studies have further developed this argument, demonstrating that
   non-recognition can in fact facilitate democratization. This article
   develops the latter argument and provides a thorough analysis into the
   manner in which non-recognition can serve as a catalyst for democratic
   transitions. It identifies the crisis of legitimacy that results from
   non-recognition as a key factor in this process, arguing that this
   crisis often leads to extensive interaction between the unrecognized
   states and the international community, subsequently making the
   leaderships of unrecognized states more vulnerable to scrutiny and thus
   creating opportunity structures for transnational advocacy networks. To
   support this argument, this article examines the democratic transition
   which has taken place in the Kurdistan Regional Government since its
   emergence as an unrecognized state in 1991. This transition, it asserts,
   cannot be understood without relating to the KRG's status as an
   unrecognized state and its pursuit of international legitimacy.},

Abstract = {What effect do International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank programs
   have on collective labor rights? Labor rights advocacy networks and
   organized labor groups have long been critical of neoliberal policy
   prescriptions attached to loans by international financial institutions
   (IFIs), claiming that they harm the interests of workers. IFIs dispute
   these claims, noting that they work with relevant labor organizations
   and that many of their arrangements call for compliance with core labor
   standards. Yet very little research has been devoted to whether IFI
   programs affect labor laws and the actual labor practices of recipient
   countries. We argue that IFI programs undermine collective labor rights.
   Specifically, recommended policy reforms, as well as the broader signals
   connoted by participation in the programs, undermine labor organizations
   and the adoption of protective laws. To substantiate these claims, we
   use time-series cross-national data for a sample of 123 low- and
   middle-income countries for the years 1985 to 2002. Our findings suggest
   that programs from both IFIs are negatively and significantly related to
   labor rights, including laws designed to guarantee basic collective
   labor rights as well as the protection of these rights in practice.},

Abstract = {As the contributions to this special issue each demonstrate,
   modernisation is a slippery word. Although commonly used in political
   rhetoric, it is often unclear exactly what is meant by the term, or how
   successful modernisation can be discerned. This article reflects on the
   theory and practice of Conservative modernisation to cast some light on
   these issues. Exploring the party's modernisation from 2005 to 2015 it
   is argued that modernisation can occur at different levels. Using the
   notion of micro, meso and macro level modernisation, it is argued that
   Conservative modernisation was pursued at the micro and meso levels but
   was derailed by events that altered party strategy. As such this article
   judges that David Cameron did not successfully modernise his party and,
   utilising this case, examines the challenges of delivering modernising
   change more broadly.},

Abstract = {Despite the plethora of studies demonstrating that economic perceptions
   affect how a person votes, relatively little is known about how economic
   perceptions affect whether individuals will vote. Using the calculus of
   voting as our starting point, we develop a simple, but novel, hypothesis
   regarding the influence of sociotropic evaluations on voter turnout. We
   argue that this relationship will be curvilinear, with particularly
   negative and particularly positive evaluations of the economy increasing
   the likelihood of voting. Using an instrumental variables approach with
   individual-level data from eight recent U.S. presidential elections, we
   find that economic evaluations affect the decision to vote in the
   curvilinear manner hypothesized, but-counter to existing theory-only
   when there is not an incumbent president seeking reelection.},

Abstract = {Most politicians polarize society through the direction, the values, and
   the words they use; in other words, they do not unite. Instead, they
   play up ethnic, religious, and nationalist sentiments, as well as other
   concepts that can be easily inflamed, in order to ensure specific voting
   outcomes. This process summarizes a violent vicious cycle that has been
   in use for centuries. In this article, the author lays out a vision for
   a holistic model that combines a direction, a set of values, and a
   language that can unite everyone. According to the author, experiences
   built around this model can empower humanity, which will in turn root
   out systems that breed prejudices and begin the process of healing.},

Title = {Referendums and deliberative democracy},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {38},
Pages = {139-148},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The theoretical concepts of deliberative democracy and the institutions
   and processes associated with direct democracy often pull in different
   directions, despite their surface similarity. A deliberative model
   emphasizes the importance of voice whereas referendums prioritize votes.
   A deliberative model would involve citizens at every stage of the
   political process, whereas a referendum typically brings them in only at
   the very end. A deliberative democratic process is less interested in
   resolving an issue than in discussing it, while a referendum often takes
   place solely for the purpose of settling a particular question. However
   without institutions, deliberative democracy remains an elusive and
   idealistic concept. Here, I examine four specific areas in which the
   conduct of referendums often tends to inhibit deliberation, and consider
   ways in which the quality of deliberation within existing rules and
   practices might be improved. These are: the intrusion of politics, the
   absence of clarity, the amount and quality of information, and the
   degree of participation and engagement of citizens in the process.
   Together, the cases considered here suggest some ways in which the
   familiar institutions of initiative and referendum could be retooled to
   approximate a more deliberative form of direct democracy. (C) 2015

Abstract = {The re-emergence of European integration as a difficult issue for the
   Conservative Party exposed the limits of Cameron's modernisation
   project. In opposition, Cameron had defused the EU issue by lowering its
   salience but this suppressed rather than effectively addressed the
   issue, allowing Eurosceptics who favour withdrawal or fundamental
   renegotiation to shape the agenda. In office, new and familiar
   challenges emerged. The Eurozone sovereign debt crisis changed the
   dynamics of the UK's relationship with the EU. Domestically, coalition
   with the Liberal Democrats and dissent from Eurosceptic Conservative MPs
   restricted Cameron's room for manoeuvre, while the rise of the UK
   Independence Party (UKIP) added a new dimension to the problems the EU
   issue poses for the Conservatives. Cameron responded by promising that
   if the Conservatives win the 2015 general election, he will negotiate a
   `new settlement' in the EU and hold an `in-out' referendum. This article
   assesses whether this position amounts to a belated modernisation of
   Conservative policy that might both resolve inta-party divisions and
   settle the question of the UK's place in the EU.},

Abstract = {The objective of this article was to make an empirical attempt at
   reflecting the popular concept of brand personality within the realm of
   voting behaviour. We assumed that voters can perceive political parties
   in terms of features which are characteristic for people. Parties could
   be identified as separate brands which, in the process of communicating
   with voters, represent unique, more or less distinct personalities. The
   study used a set of eighteen selected adjectives to describe both the
   personalities of an ideal party, as perceived by a voter, and the
   personalities of the voters. Two factor analyses revealed a four-factor
   structure of voters' and ideal party's personalities. These factors were
   utilised to obtain personality profiles of the participants and of the
   ideal party, and to examine the relationship between them. Afterwards, a
   cluster analysis was applied in order to assess the types of the ideal
   party's personalities, which were next analysed in terms of the Polish
   political market. We found evidence that there was a positive
   relationship between preferred ideal party's personality and voting
   behaviour.},

Abstract = {The surge in support for Eurosceptic parties in the 2014 Euroelections
   is investigated through a case study of Greece, a country which suffered
   a dramatic dealignment of its party system after the onset of the
   Eurozone crisis. The extent to which crisis-era developments represent a
   rupture is assessed by setting the recent rise of party Euroscepticism
   in its historical context. Eurobarometer data is used to investigate the
   relationship between party and popular Euroscepticism and an alternative
   domestically-driven explanation of causality. The conclusion is that the
   crisis era has been a game-changer in attitudes towards European
   integration. The rising vote for Eurosceptic parties is not simply a
   side-effect of domestic protest. Instead the EU has become a significant
   electoral target.},

Abstract = {Many democratic and jurisprudential theorists have too often
   uncritically accepted Alexander Bickel's notion of ``the
   countermajoritarian difficulty{''} when considering the relationship
   between judicial review and democracy; this is the case for arguments
   both for and against judicial review. This framework is both
   theoretically and empirically unsustainable. Democracy is not wholly
   synonymous with majoritarianism, and judicial review is not inherently
   countermajoritarian in the first place. In modern democratic political
   systems, judicial review is one of many potential veto points. Since all
   modern democratic political systems contain veto points, the relevant
   and unexplored question is what qualities might make a veto point
   relatively democratic. Proceeding on the assumption that democracy's
   primary normative value is found in its opposition to domination by both
   state and private actors, we make a preliminary effort to delineate what
   qualities a democratic veto point might have, identifying five criteria,
   and evaluate judicial review using these criteria. We conclude that
   judicial review's performance against these criteria is decidedly mixed,
   but in the final balance is likely to be a modest net positive for
   democracy, particularly when compared to other veto points commonly
   found in contemporary democratic political systems.},

Abstract = {The variation among countries when it comes to the admittance of forced
   migrants - refugees and asylum seekers - is substantial. This article
   explains part of this variation by developing and testing an
   institutional explanation to the admission of forced migrants; more
   precisely, it investigates the impact of domestic welfare state
   institutions on admission. Building on comparative welfare state
   research, it is hypothesised that comprehensive welfare state
   institutions will have a positive effect on the admission of forced
   migrants to a country. There are three features of comprehensive welfare
   state institutions that could steer policies towards forced migrants in
   a more open direction. First, these institutions have been shown to
   impact on the boundaries of social solidarity. Second, they enhance
   generalised trust. And third, they can impact on the citizens' view of
   what the state should and can do in terms of protecting individuals. The
   argument is tested using a broad comparative dataset of patterns of
   forced migration, covering 17 OECD countries between 1980 and 2003. This
   analysis shows that comprehensive welfare state institutions have a
   significant positive effect on the admission of forced migrants, under
   control for a number of factors often highlighted in migration research.},

Abstract = {How do marginal voters differ from regular voters? This article develops
   a method for comparing the partisan preferences of regular voters to
   those marginal voters whose turnout decisions are influenced by
   exogenous factors and applies it to two sources of variation in turnout
   in the United States-weather and election timing. In both cases,
   marginal voters are over 20 percentage points more supportive of the
   Democratic Party than regular voters-a significant divide. The findings
   suggest that the expansion or contraction of the electorate can have
   important consequences. Moreover, the findings suggest that election
   results do not always reflect the preferences of the citizenry, because
   the marginal citizens who may stay home have systematically different
   preferences than those who participate. Finally, the methods developed
   in the article may enable future researchers to compare regular and
   marginal voters on many different dimensions and in many different
   electoral settings.},

Abstract = {While the collapse of party membership in the last half-century has
   consumed much of the focus of party scholarship, the notion of
   membership itself is surprisingly under-theorised. This article presents
   a tripartite framework for understanding party membership as a
   constructed concept: from the perspective of the state, the individual
   and the political party. As organisational mediators and strategic
   electoral actors, political parties construct varying notions of
   membership in order to mobilise resources and gain legitimacy, while
   balancing the participatory demands of citizens with the legal and
   normative expectations imposed by the state. Using a number of
   illustrative examples from Europe and beyond, the article analyses the
   development of supporters' networks and the extension of participatory
   opportunities to non-members. Designed in part to address this
   membership decline and to offer individuals a different way of engaging
   with political parties, these initiatives are seen as a crucial step in
   the evolution of modern parties towards looser, more individualised and
   amorphous networks of affiliation.},

Abstract = {Supporting business associations in developing countries to influence
   public policy is increasingly seen by development partners as an
   important contributor to improving the business enabling environment
   and, as a consequence, to improving the vibrancy of the private sector
   leading, in turn, to more job creation and greater poverty alleviation.
   This approach requires that business associations are supported to build
   their capacity and engage in dialogue and advocacy. Initiatives to do
   this are being funded, inter alia, in Kenya, Tanzania and Ghana.
   Evaluation of these programmes requires that there is a means of
   assessing both whether business association competence has improved and
   whether higher levels of competence are associated with business
   association ability to influence policy. This article describes a
   diagnostic tool which is being used to assess the competence of business
   associations and explores whether they have become more successful as
   their competence has improved. While it cannot offer a full picture -
   participation in training does not mean that organisations become expert
   and success in influencing public policy is dependent on more than
   competence - the evidence suggests that business associations do raise
   their competence and that raised competence does lead to greater success
   in influencing public policy.},

Abstract = {Political campaign contributions are not made in a vacuum. Rather,
   contributions from individuals are affected by the political and legal
   environment experienced by potential donors. I study itemized
   contributions to candidates, parties, and political action committees
   (PACs) aggregated by congressional district for 1994-2006. The timing
   and competitiveness of presidential, congressional, and even state
   elections affect the expected benefits and opportunity costs of
   contributing to all types of committees, and this is reflected in the
   amounts contributed through different channels. Political party
   committees raising hard money contributions relied more on districts
   with high per capita income, education attainment, and urbanization
   after the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) than before, but were
   still less dependent on these districts than soft money committees
   before the BCRA. Overall, the BCRA led to less reliance on districts
   with high socioeconomic status as sources of itemized contributions to
   committees regulated by the Federal Election Commission.},

Abstract = {This conclusion summarizes the major findings of this special issue and
   discusses their implications for research on democratization and
   international democracy promotion. First, I compare the interactions
   between EU and US democracy promotion and the responses of
   non-democratic regional powers. In the cases in which Russia, Saudi
   Arabia, and China chose to pursue a countervailing strategy, I match the
   reactions of the US and the EU and explore how the combined
   (inter-)actions of democratic and non-democratic actors have affected
   efforts at democracy promotion in the target countries. The second part
   discusses the theoretical implications of these findings and identifies
   challenges for theory-building. I argue that the literature still has to
   come to terms with a counter-intuitive finding of this special issue,
   namely that non-democratic actors can promote democratic change by
   unintentionally empowering liberal reform coalitions as much as
   democracy promoters can unwittingly enhance autocracy by stabilizing
   illiberal incumbent regimes. I conclude with some policy considerations.},

Abstract = {Despite political progress in Northern Ireland, the polity may arguably
   only fully stabilise when its population regards themselves as `Northern
   Irish' rather than merely as subsets of British and Irish parent
   nations. Power-sharing and relative peace since the 1998 Good Friday
   Agreement may have offered the possibility of the development of a
   common Northern Irish identity, to allow consolidation of a political
   entity challenged by sections of the nationalist minority since its
   formation in 1921. Alternatively, the consociational nature of the
   Agreement may have legitimised `separate but equal' identity politics
   constructed on the British versus Irish faultline. This articles tests
   whether there has been a significant growth of cross-community Northern
   Irishness since the Agreement, capable of eroding inter-communal
   rivalry.},

Title = {Rawls on the embedded self: Liberalism as an affective regime},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {209-228},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In recent years, political theorists have come to recognize the central
   role of affect in social and political life. A host of scholars, coming
   from a number of distinct traditions, have variously drawn our attention
   to the importance of the emotions to the tradition of the history of
   political thought, as well as to normative political theory. This
   attentiveness to affect is often cast as a break with earlier,
   Enlightenment-inspired liberal approaches towards politics, approaches
   that marginalized the emotions, dismissing the passions as potentially
   dangerous, or neglected them altogether. According to the conventional
   liberal view, emotions are said to have no place in the public sphere,
   while proceduralist institutions abstract away from citizens' affective
   attachments, now cast as private preferences of individuals qua
   citizens. In this paper we challenge this prevalent view. We argue that
   no less a liberal theorist than John Rawls is deeply attentive to the
   place of emotions in his account of liberalism. This may seem
   counterintuitive given that Rawls' work has been frequently criticized
   for epitomizing some of the deepest problems of contemporary liberal
   theory, as a result of the emphasis on rationalism and reasonableness in
   his account of liberal justice. However, against this prevalent reading,
   we demonstrate that Rawls is in fact highly concerned with the role of
   affect and presents us with an account of the embedded liberal subject.
   By drawing out these dimensions of Rawls' thought, we hope to contribute
   to upending the conventional view of liberalism as affect-blind in order
   to encourage a more nuanced reading of the liberal tradition.},

Abstract = {Scholars in the fields of instructional development and pedagogy note
   that learning outcomes can be improved when teachers use
   ``narratives{''} to communicate how complex processes work or how
   problems are addressed. In this article, the authors describe a
   narrative-centered approach to graduate-level instruction in research
   methodology. This approach is intended to supplement, not replace,
   conventional graduate seminars in quantitative or qualitative methods.
   In a series of lectures, scholars reflected on how their published
   articles originally were framed, the trade-offs that were necessary to
   advance the investigation, the methodological challenges and
   non-findings that had to be addressed-but may not have been printed-and
   the evolution of a piece as it progressed through the peer-review
   stages. This approach to exposing graduate students to the entirety of
   the research process is termed Social Science Mechanics: A Look under
   the Hood at Innovative Research Designs. Surveys used to evaluate the
   series confirmed that graduate students who attended the presentations
   found them to be highly engaging and beneficial. Many faculty members
   also attended and found the lectures to be equally instructive.},

Abstract = {While the existence of pre-electoral coalitions fundamentally modifies
   the bargaining environment in which potential cabinet formulas are
   negotiated, the survival chances of cabinets that include them follow
   predictable yet different patterns to those of `regular' coalition
   governments. This article combines original and existing data sets on
   Western and Central and Eastern European cabinets with information about
   pre-electoral coalitions (1944-2008) in order to estimate the impact of
   such alliances on government survival rates. In doing so, I employ a Cox
   Proportional Hazard model and a `competing risks' research design which
   distinguishes between replacement and early election hazards. The
   findings indicate that both Western and post-communist cabinets formed
   by pre-electoral coalitions exhibit considerably lower rates of
   discretionary terminations. This effect is reversed in the case of
   incumbent pre-electoral coalitions. Last but not least, Western European
   cabinets that replicate pre-electoral coalitions are significantly less
   likely to end through dissolution and early elections.},

   This article explores the difficulties in instituting a similar system

   of competition between the two parties that might be able to deliver
   upon such a commitment. It concludes that the prospects of moving
   towards a Nordic-style social investment model are slight, given the
   political, institutional and attitudinal barriers in place.},

Abstract = {In 1990, after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its clandestine
   propaganda machine, the West became increasingly confident that
   globalization supported by an information technology network, the
   Internet, would increase openness, liberalism, and democracy; the core
   values of the `free world'. Western leaders knew then, just as they know
   now, a quarter of a century later that the power of the Internet would
   grow as the technology that controls its use develops. And developed it
   has. However, no development is all good and the Internet is no
   exception. It seems that the technology that has enabled us to create a
   ``global village{''} where people are able to communicate in a way that
   is open, free and that bypasses the encumbrances of class and ethnicity
   has also brought with it a very dark underworld, an uncontrolled rhizome
   or meshwork, where propaganda, trolling and hate speeches are rife.},

Abstract = {There is considerable literature in the area of information security
   management (ISM). However, from an organizational viewpoint, the
   collective body of literature does not present a coherent, unified view
   of recommended security management practices. In particular, despite the
   existence of `best-practice' standards on information security
   management, organizations have no way of evaluating the reliability or
   objectivity of the recommended practices as they do not provide any
   underlying reasoning or justification. This paper is a first step
   towards the development of rigorous and formal instruments of
   measurement by which organizations can assess their security management
   practices. The paper identifies nine security practice constructs from
   the literature and develops measurement items for organizations to
   assess the adequacy of their security management practices. The study
   uses a multiple case study approach followed by interviews with a panel
   of four security experts to validate and refine these security practice

Abstract = {This article explores the relationship between policy transfer through
   time and the quest for political legitimacy in developing countries. It
   is concerned with instances where contemporary figures reach back a long
   way in history in the search for items that can be used to legitimate
   present or future political arrangements. The first part of the article
   broadly classifies the various ways in which time has been used, but
   acknowledges the relative neglect of the temporal dimension in policy
   transfer studies. However, in the process of the search for political
   legitimation in developing countries, there has been a regular use of
   policy transfer through time. This is explored in a detailed case study
   of President Hugo Chavez's Bolivarian revolution in Venezuela. From this
   case study, a four-stage sequence of policy transfer through time is
   constructed.},

Abstract = {Do voters regard male and female candidates equally? Does apparent
   religiosity of candidates help or hurt their electoral chances? Where
   biases exist, what explains them? We present a novel explanation of
   political bias, drawing from role congruity theory. It posits that
   political contexts shape citizens' perceptions of qualities that make a
   ``capable leader,{''} which subsequently drives their willingness to
   vote for candidates. Evidence from a survey experiment embedded in the
   2012 Tunisian Post-Election Survey demonstrates that this theory
   explains biases based on gender and religiosity better than dominant
   modernization and social identity theories. Moreover, these mechanisms
   are also likely to drive political biases related to other features and
   in other countries. This has important implications for policymakers
   aiming to reduce political biases in Tunisia, the MENA, or globally. It
   should encourage them to pay careful attention to stereotyped traits of
   underrepresented groups and successful leaders, and to use institutional
   solutions (e.g., electoral quotas) to shape expectations about
   underrepresented groups and leadership.},

Abstract = {This article theorizes the strategies used by parties to expand their
   support base, with a particular focus on the allocation of party goods.
   Here, we theorize that nascent parties with goods to hand out will
   favour a particular type of societal group, which we name
   private-gain-seeking groups. We utilize Peru's party system collapse
   following Fujimori's rule as an opportunity to test our hypotheses,
   which state that political parties will favour electorally volatile
   groups with restricted access to information or compromised
   opportunities to process it. Evidence for the hypotheses is found using
   data on the FONCODES allocation patterns of approximately 750 mayoral
   districts in Peru. The data suggest that groups expected to be favoured
   could end up receiving shares 34 percent greater than the least
   attractive groups.},

Abstract = {In contrast to modern federations, the federalization of the EU has
   taken place without a constitutional answer to the question of the
   system's democratic legitimacy. The process of compound polity building
   under the shadow of the dilemma of the Union's finalite politique can be
   described as ``hidden federalism{''}. The major consequence of this
   process has been a gradual migration of decision-making from an
   intergovernmental toward a supra-governmental power-holder. On the one
   hand, due to an excessive Europeanization of governing tasks, national
   democratic institutions have lost the political autonomy necessary for
   shaping the relation between state and society, politics and the market,
   and individual and collective autonomy within member states. On the
   other hand, reforming the EU by creating democratically suspicious
   control mechanisms within its members' budget policies has not
   substituted the absence of the EU's governance autonomy to regulate
   politically sensitive fields such as fiscal, employment and social
   policies. With the escalation of the Eurozone crisis it has become
   evident that neither member states nor the EU have a sufficient level of
   autonomy to make policy choices related to the most sensitive issues of
   distributive justice. The implementation of the Fiscal Compact will
   decisively affect economic and social life in Europe; yet it is hardly
   possible to discern who should take credit or the blame for the
   nontransparent penalty mechanism embedded in this contract and aimed at
   regaining the Eurozone's stability. In this new historical context,
   institutions of constitutional democracy, being present on the national
   and to an extent on the European level, have been deprived of their
   original purpose. Instead of making power visible and accountable, they
   have actually enlarged the scope of an unaccountable power by
   maintaining the illusion that citizens can still determine their
   collective destiny through the political process.},

Abstract = {Contemporary museum anthropology is collaborative anthropology.
   Illustrated through the case study of the National Museum of the
   American Indian's process of community curating for its inaugural
   exhibitions, this account provides a window into the everyday practice
   of collaborative anthropology in museum practice through ethnographic
   attention to an exhibition in the making. Artifacts that are not from
   the collection come to the fore - artifacts of collaboration, like text
   panels, which signify Native voice. An attention to authorship reveals
   the process of collaboration between museum curators and Native
   community members developing the Our Lives gallery, including how
   exhibition contributors imagined their audiences differently and
   experienced the challenges and rewards of mediating
   (self)representations of contemporary Native identity for public
   consumption.},

Abstract = {This paper uses argumentation tools to show by means of analyzing nine
   cases from law and politics how argument strategies using persuasive
   definitions and quasi-definitions are powerful rhetorical tools of
   persuasion. By bringing to lightthe argumentation structure found in
   these examples, it is shown that definitions and redefinitions can have
   serious legal and political implications. Persuasive definitions and
   quasi-definitions are modeled as two distinct strategies for altering
   the relationship between classification and evaluation of a state of
   affairs. Persuasive definitions are aimed at modifying the relationship
   between the definiendum and its referent. In quasi-definitions some
   characteristics of an entity or event leading to a specific value
   judgment are selected and made accessible, while other conflicting ones
   are excluded. Reframing an issue is shown to be related to both
   strategies.},

Abstract = {The network has become an important channel for current college and
   university students to exchange information and communication, and
   become an important part of University life. Although college and
   university students very like network but most college and university
   students cannot use the network effectively. Network with its openness
   and vitality also makes some college and university students freely,
   lack of moral self-discipline in the network environment. More and more
   college and university students pay attention to the protection of their
   rights in the network environment, but a few college and university
   students have unconsciously infringe upon the rights of other people.
   So, universities need to carry out effective rule of law education and
   morality education for University students. Countries should strengthen
   the network legislation; regulate the constraints on the network
   infringement and cyber crime. At the same time, we should purify network
   environment through technical means and help college and university
   students grow up healthily in the network environment.},

Abstract = {How does post-conflict reconstruction embody citizenship agendas? By
   emphasizing the intersections between urban planning, architecture and
   political community in Hizballah's reconstruction discourse following
   the 2006 war, this article explores the articulation of such agendas in
   the historical production of urban space. The first section explores the
   denial of urban space and membership in the political community to
   Lebanon's Shi'a in the reconstruction of Beirut following the 1975-1990
   civil war. The second section introduces Harat Hreik and the struggle
   over its reconstruction as resistance, on the part of Hizballah and its
   cadres, to this exclusion. The party's approach, anchored in an
   innovative not-for-profit NGO, The Solemn Promise Project' (Mashru'
   Wa'ad al-Sadiq), asserted the claims of its constituency to a place in
   both the city and the nation over considerations of profit. This
   citizenship agenda, inclusionary in sectarian terms, however, entailed
   its own set decidedly class-based inclusions and exclusions.},

Abstract = {The paper considers the role of Scottish culture and history, real or
   imagined, in the commercialisation of iconic Scottish creations such as
   tartan and Scotch whisky. It notes that many of the forms of legal
   protection available to the producers of such products were developed to
   encourage individual innovation, not designed to address communal
   interests in the preservation of national or group identities and
   heritage. This may be one reason why, as is illustrated by the case of
   tartan, these rights offer patchy and incomplete protection to
   `authentic' Scottish products. Over time, however, the UK has developed
   various forms of collective protection for cultural products such as
   Harris Tweed, the effectiveness of which is explored in this article.
   The final part of the paper considers the importance, in a globalising
   world, of European Union and international protection for valuable
   cultural `products'. But protection, whether at the national or
   international level, necessitates a difficult balance to be drawn
   between the interest in cultural innovation and development, on the one
   hand, and cultural preservation and the protection of the commercial
   interests of specific communities, on the other. The article concludes
   by exploring some of the practical and conceptual challenges associated
   with determining whether a product should be considered part of the
   cultural patrimony of the world or, rather, the property of a specific
   nation or cultural group.

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-62},

Abstract = {Republicans understand freedom as the guaranteed protection against any
   arbitrary use of coercive power. This freedom is exercised within a
   political community, and the concept of arbitrariness is defined with
   reference to the actual ideas of its citizens about what is in their
   shared interests. According to many current defenders of the republican
   model, this form of freedom is understood in strictly negative terms
   representing an absence of domination. I argue that this assumption is
   misguided. First, it is internally inconsistent. The central republican
   focal point of arbitrariness is a necessarily socially constructed ideal
   that only exists as the creation of the citizens themselves. Second,
   republican freedom operates in two distinct realms or spheres. There is
   freedom under a law that is required to uphold the collective good as
   reflected in society's norms, and there is freedom within that very
   system of norms. The threats to freedom from within each sphere are
   different and must be addressed accordingly. The negative approach,
   however, conflates the two and emphasises only the dangers faced under
   the law. This exposes citizens especially those from marginalised social
   groups to domination in the second realm from oppressive social norms.
   Only by clearly recognising the nature of both kinds of threats can a
   comprehensive republican freedom be formulated.},

Abstract = {Acknowledging the role played by character valence issues in affecting
   parties' fortunes, several recent papers have investigated the possible
   intentional use of such issues in electoral contests. A corollary of
   this line of research has focused on identifying conditions under which
   parties are expected to invest more in valence campaigning. In this
   article, we focus on the role played by parties' relative ideological
   positions in a multiparty setting. We identify the existence of an
   inverse relationship between the distance of a party from its
   ideologically adjacent competitors and its incentive to campaign on
   character valence issues. However, the extent of this relationship can
   be conditional on institutional and electoral factors. We test these
   hypotheses by focusing on the emphasis a party places in its electoral
   manifestos on the specific character valence issue of corruption.
   Statistical results largely confirm our hypotheses.},

Title = {The politics of fiscal policy during economic downturns, 1981-2010},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {54},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-22},

Abstract = {This article investigates fiscal policy responses to the Great Recession
   in historical perspective. It explores general trends in the frequency,
   size and composition of fiscal stimulus as well as the impact of
   government partisanship on fiscal policy outputs during the four
   international recessions of 1980-1981, 1990-1991, 2001-2002 and
   2008-2009. Encompassing 17-23 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
   Development (OECD) countries, the analysis calls into question the idea
   of a general retreat from fiscal policy activism since the early 1980s.
   The propensity of governments to respond to economic downturns by
   engaging in fiscal stimulus has increased over time and no secular trend
   in the size of stimulus measures is observed. At the same time, OECD
   governments have relied more on tax cuts to stimulate demand in the two
   recessions of the 2000s than they did in the early 1980s or early 1990s.
   Regarding government partisanship, no significant direct partisan
   effects on either the size or the composition of fiscal stimulus is
   found for any of the four recession episodes. However, the size of the
   welfare state conditioned the impact of government partisanship in the
   two recessions of the 2000s, with left-leaning governments distinctly
   more prone to engaging in discretionary fiscal stimulus and/or spending
   increases in large welfare states, but not in small welfare states.},

Title = {Intersectionality as Disarticulatory Practice: Sex-Selective Abortion
   and Reproductive Politics in the United Kingdom},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},
Pages = {509-524},
Abstract = {Many authors have argued that sex-selective abortion (SSA) poses a
   problem for defenders of reproductive choice: the notion that a woman
   has ``freely chosen{''} to abort a female fetus becomes problematic when
   she faces compelling pressure to bear a male child. This argument
   reflects the broader concern of the reproductive justice movement that
   mainstream pro-choice discourse has defined ``choice{''} in narrow,
   legalistic terms, and overlooks the barriers to reproductive choice
   often faced by poor women and women of color. This article examines
   recent debates surrounding a proposed ban on SSA in the United Kingdom.
   It finds that despite attempts by the ban's proponents to make
   intersectional claims around gender, ethnicity, and class, their
   arguments also invoke xenophobia by constructing Indian migrants as a
   threat to ``British{''} values of gender equality. Thus, the article
   suggests that the concept of disarticulation may fruitfully be used to
   make sense of such ``intersectional{''} claims.},

Abstract = {The digital revolution has made it easier for political scientists to
   share and access high-quality research online. However, many articles
   are stored in proprietary data-bases that some institutions cannot
   afford. High-quality, peer-reviewed, top-tier journal articles that have
   been made open access (OA) (i.e., freely available online) theoretically
   should be accessed and cited more easily than articles of similar
   quality that are available only to paying customers. Research into the
   efficacy of OA publishing thus far has focused mainly on the natural
   sciences, and the results have been mixed. Because OA has not been as
   widely adopted in the social sciences, disciplines such as political
   science have received little attention in the OA research. In this
   article, we seek to determine the efficacy of OA in political science.
   Our primary hypothesis is that OA articles will be cited at higher rates
   than articles that are toll access (TA), which means available only to
   paying customers. We test this hypothesis by analyzing the mean citation
   rates of OA and TA articles from eight top-ranked political science
   journals. We find that OA publication results in a clear citation
   advantage in political science publishing.},

Abstract = {Structural equation modelling was utilised to develop and test three
   models while exploring the causality effect of constructs. The models
   hypothesised that trust in the government was a result of interactions
   of several other forces: namely, citizens' expectation, perception of
   service quality and satisfaction with these services. The article
   validates and replicates the findings on the question of causality
   between performance and trust. The findings were very consistent with
   the previous ones. The model incorporating citizen's demographic data
   provided the best fit. According to this model, citizen demographics,
   expectations and quality of services influence citizen satisfaction; and
   ultimately, citizen satisfaction influences trust in government. The
   perceived quality of all services provides significant standardised
   estimates. However, congestion in streets, parking facilities, parks and
   recreation and schools are the most salient drivers of citizen
   satisfaction. The variables of income, education level, years living in
   Abu Dhabi and marital status exert the highest influence on this
   satisfaction construct. Perception of quality of services has a
   significant effect on overall satisfaction; and overall satisfaction
   drives trust in local government officials. In addition, citizen
   expectation influences perceptions of the quality of service and overall
   satisfaction.},

Pages = {209-227},
Abstract = {Dahl's critics have often called attention to important aspects of power
   relations - e.g. the suppression of issues and consciousness control.
   The critics, however, have not always portrayed Dahl's views as
   accurately as one might wish. Distinguishing between an abstract concept
   of power and operational definitions adopted for purposes of specific
   research projects is fundamental for Dahl. Furthermore, Dahl's concept
   of power implies nothing about the preferences of B, is not zero-sum,
   does not necessitate compulsion, may or may not be subtle or visible, is
   not confined to material resources, and may be either direct and
   immediate or indirect and long term.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {249-263},
Abstract = {Student response systems, or ``clickers,{''} have been presented as a
   way of solving student engagement problems, particularly in
   large-enrollment classes. These devices provide real-time feedback to
   instructors, allowing them to understand what students are thinking and
   how well they comprehend material. As clickers become more common, it is
   important to assess their impact on student learning and engagement.
   Utilizing individual-level data from introductory courses in political
   science, we demonstrate that students both approve of clicker usage and
   that they are positively associated with class performance. Using
   clickers to test students' understanding of class concepts has positive
   effects on exam and essay scores even after controlling for previous
   levels of academic achievement, students' evaluation of the technology,
   and other socioeconomic traits.},

Abstract = {Loss in social movement campaigns is commonplace; as in any political
   contestation, some parties win and some lose. For social movements, the
   costs of defeat can be enormous, yet such defeats rarely result in the
   demise of the movement itself. Instead, social movement activists who
   lose persist in their efforts and engage in repeated attempts to achieve
   their goals-often, to achieve the same goals. How do losers persevere?
   One answer to this question may be found in the narratives of defeat
   articulated by a social movement after loss. This article develops the
   concept of a narrative of defeat and presents a typology of defeat
   narratives to hypothesize about how narratives of defeat might effect
   remobilization efforts, using examples from labor movements in Great
   Britain and the United States. The article concludes with reflections on
   the strategic utility of narratives of defeat and suggestions for
   further research.},

Abstract = {Traditionally in Canada, attention to political or civic education has
   been at the primary-or secondary-school level. This study focuses on the
   place of civic engagement in introductory Canadian politics and
   government university courses in Canada by surveying instructors on
   their attitudes and approaches to civic engagement in the classroom.
   Surveying 28 instructors from across the country from large and small,
   English and French institutions, we compared survey results to collected
   course syllabi from the participants. In our study, we found that there
   is a clear disconnect between what instructors believe is the most
   effective way to foster civic engagement and what they are assigning
   their students to complete for course requirements.},

Abstract = {This article presents an interpretative case study utilizing the concept
   of tutelary powers to analyse specific organisations in Czechoslovakia
   1945-1948. Tutelary institutions are one of the key issues in
   contemporary discussions about transitions to democracy in Latin
   America. One of the major problems of the concept of tutelary
   institutions is their rather vague definition. This article presents a
   new classification to use it on organisations which had influence on the
   operation of the political regime in postwar Czechoslovakia. The
   political system of postwar Czechoslovakia was influenced by a whole
   range of specific factors, but among them, the most important appear to
   be the low level of civil liberties and political rights, along with the
   existence of actors outside the electoral system who were able to
   influence processes that were supposed to be under control of elected
   representatives. The range of tutelary actors analyzed in this article
   includes the Soviet Union, military counter-intelligence and various
   state security institutions. Though all of them appear to manifest the
   basic attributes of tutelary institutions at some time between 1945 and
   1948, they also seem to bear some context specific features pointing at
   the complexity of the postwar situation, as well as at the limits of the
   concept.},

Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Article II Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution gives both the Senate and
   the President a role in the appointment of public bureaucrats. Yet,
   since the drafting of that constitutional passage, changes within the
   Senate and Executive have created new ways for officials to influence
   who gets appointed to the public bureaucracy. The Senate has developed
   intricate vetting procedures within its committees, while the Executive
   Branch has created new methods - such as the Schedule C designation - to
   facilitate the unilateral staffing of ``inferior offices.{''} To what
   extent do these institutional changes affect the ideological composition
   of appointments to the public bureaucracy? Our formal theory predicts
   that the investigative procedures of Senate committees allow chairs to
   block ideologically disparate nominations, thus compelling presidents to
   nominate moderates to Senate-confirmed post while placing extremists in
   Schedule C positions. Empirical analyses support these predictions: the
   probability of Senate confirmation declines with a nominee's ideological
   distance from the relevant committee chair and Schedule C appointees
   exhibit greater ideological extremism than Senate-confirmed appointees.
   These findings reveal how modern, institutional modifications of Article
   II Section 2 influence both the ideological composition of appointed
   federal bureaucrats and the struggle for power between branches of the
   U.S. federal government.},

Abstract = {In this article, we develop an argument for better integrating the
   political science curricula on methodology with gender politics. We
   demonstrate how these two areas are presently distinct and
   nonoverlapping with an analysis of commonly used methodology and women
   and politics textbooks. We examine the implications of these results for
   female students' engagement with political methodology-an area in which
   women are persistently underrepresented-by drawing on research from STEM
   educators. Stereotype threat (Steele 1997; Steele and Aronson 1995)
   provides a framework for thinking about the myriad of ways the
   curriculum influences learning outcomes for female students and
   highlights the utility of greater crossover between the two subject
   areas. To facilitate better integration of methodology and gender
   politics, we identify opportunities for instructors to incorporate
   methods into courses on gender and gender into courses on methods. We
   also develop a number of different in-class activities and resources to
   help faculty to bridge the gap between gender and methodology.},

Abstract = {After the Crimean referendum was held and the war in south-eastern
   Ukraine broke out, Russia began looking with increasing interest towards
   Asian countries (e.g., China, Japan, Korea, India, countries of ASEAN),
   while the relations with the West were badly hit by anti-Russian
   sanctions. Remains of the Westphalian system, established in 1648 after
   the end of the Thirty Years War and based on the principle of balance of
   power, as well as the Yalta system have practically collapsed. Can the
   East offer something constructive as a replacement? The author analyzes
   ``a new bioethics{''} theory proposed by the Japanese political
   scientist Hyakudai Sakamoto, which is based on the principle of
   harmonization of interests and the use of soft power. Japan is among
   those countries that are most effectively use their soft power to create
   its positive image. Firstly, Tokyo consciously renounces the use of
   ``hard power{''} in its security policy that is dictated by the Article
   9 of the Constitution in spite of the September 2015 amendments of
   military ilk. Second, ideas of the virtues of soft methods as a value
   are present in the national consciousness of the Japanese since ancient
   times. Official Tokyo efficiently and pragmatically exploits cultural
   diversity of the country, specifically the promotion of cultural
   diplomacy focuses on creating an attractive national brand. The article
   deals with the strategy and tactics, and methods for their use of
   Japan's soft power in the global world and in the Russian and Chinese
   directions. The author examines the reasons why the Japanese
   socio-cultural values has a special appeal. Analyzed are positive
   aspects and difficulties that accompany the establishment of
   intercultural dialogue. A separate analysis is devoted to the diverse
   aspects of the Japan Foundation's activities, the main agent of the
   Japanese soft power.},

Title = {Political Branding: Political Candidates Positioning Based on
   Inter-Object Associative Affinity Index},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1-2, SI},
Pages = {152-174},
Abstract = {The article presents the conception of positioning politicians based on
   a three-stage approach to political branding. The main assumption is
   that a political brand-and politician's image as its crucial
   component-is conceptualized as consisting of a node in memory to which a
   variety of associations are linked. These associations-positive,
   negative, or neutral-must be shared with other rival candidates as well
   as with an prototypical ideal candidate, understood as a model and
   standard of comparison while developing detailed marketing strategies.
   One of the most valuable methods that has been used to measure these
   associations is associative overlap technique developed by Szalay. This
   measure is based on free verbal associations and it expresses the degree
   of similarity among objects (words, persons, groups) based on the number
   of similar responses (associations) they elicit in common. The first
   stage of branding, candidates' positioning in various segments of
   voters, focuses on such affinity between politicians and is based on
   multidimensional scaling techniques. At the second stage, mutual
   relationships between particular elements (positive and negative, common
   and distinctive), of which a politician's image consists, are defined.
   The third level of political branding links the results of positioning
   to voters' decisions. This framework of branding political candidates is
   presented on the basis of empirical research focused on Polish
   presidential candidates' perception and evaluation in the 2005
   presidential election. The results of the performed research show that
   it is not only the strengthening of politicians' positive features but
   also neutralizing the negative ones that contributes to his higher
   expected quality.},

Abstract = {This article explores the notion of preventism and how it relates to
   disaster risk reduction (DRR). It then ponders how the combination of
   preventism with disaster risk reduction may influence human rights.
   Different scenarios are considered in which the interaction of these
   concepts is relevant. The main argument is that preventism may lead to
   more drr initiatives and that this may well be considered a positive
   development to a certain extent, but that care should be taken not to
   jeopardize human rights in this process.},

Abstract = {This article examines how the French family policy has been driven by
   familialism in at least two of its objectives: reconciling work and
   family life and easing parenting responsibilities. We explore how these
   objectives reflect both the social order and the gender order produced
   by the French family policy, and maintained despite the family and
   societal transformations. Initially, the consideration will extend to
   work-life balance, which was primarily intended for mothers. Secondly,
   the analysis of parenting support shows a normative management of social
   roles.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1, SI},

Abstract = {In this article we develop a typology of European Union (EU) integration
   to capture how, to what extent and according to which policy aims EU
   involvement in Member States has altered with respect to labour market
   and social policy and what it signifies in terms of institutional
   change. On this basis, we show first that new instruments the Six-Pack,
   Fiscal Compact and Two-Pack have been layered onto the existing
   institutional framework governing the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
   Furthermore, we show that the instruments strengthening budgetary
   discipline to improve the functioning of European Monetary Union have
   become more explicit in terms of policy objectives, particularly
   specifying new benchmarks to obtain fiscal discipline. They are also
   stricter in terms of surveillance and enforcement. Second, we show that
   there are initiatives to address and improve the social dimension of the
   EU Europe 2020, the Social Investment Package and the Youth Guarantee
   and that these have also emerged through a process of institutional
   layering. However, the aims around Europe 2020 and Social Investment
   continue to be based on the voluntary Open Method of Coordination, with
   comparatively weak surveillance and enforcement. In the current context,
   and in order to attain economic growth together with social cohesion and
   welfare, it is of utmost importance that EMU criteria should be altered
   to take account of social investments.},

Abstract = {The murder of 1.5 million Armenians by the Young Turk government in the
   late Ottoman Empire casts long shadow. This was one of the first
   genocides of the 20th century. Since then, Armenians and Turks have
   remained locked in confrontation. In spite of the intransigence and
   estrangement on both sides, the Armenians with their trauma and the
   Turks with their fear of acknowledging the truth are chained to one
   another in an almost pathological way. In order to move forward in the
   Armenian question, dialogue should take the place of confrontation. It
   would be prudent to put the static, symbolic conflict surrounding the
   term ``genocide{''} on the back burner.},

Abstract = {Empirical political science is not simply about reporting evidence; it
   is also about coming to conclusions on the basis of that evidence and
   acting on those conclusions. But whether a result is substantively
   significant-strong and certain enough to justify acting upon the belief
   that the null hypothesis is false-is difficult to objectively pin down,
   in part because different researchers have different standards for
   interpreting evidence. Instead, this article advocates judging results
   according to their ``substantive robustness,{''} the degree to which a
   community with heterogeneous standards for interpreting evidence would
   agree that the result is substantively significant. This study
   illustrates how this can be done using Bayesian statistical decision
   techniques. Judging results in this way yields a tangible benefit: false
   positives are reduced without decreasing the power of the test, thus
   decreasing the error rate in published results.},

Abstract = {In this paper an analysis is developed of some economic aspects of the
   historical context within which contemporary democracies are called upon
   to function. In the first section, these aspects are briefly
   reconstructed in light of current economic literature. In the second
   section, the political philosophical implications of the new economic
   predicament are explored: the thesis is put forward that markets, once
   subjected to the absolute power of monarchs, are now in turn exerting a
   kind of absolute power over the liberal-democratic regimes that
   liberated them from the absolute power of kings. Finally, in the third
   section, some tentative reflections on possible ways of curbing the new
   absolute power of disembedded financial markets are explored.},

Title = {From Aspirations to Aspirin? The Afghan campaign and Europe's
   quasi-strategic inertia},
Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {122-149},
Abstract = {Recent literature dealing with the European security and defense policy
   tends to paint a bleak picture, basically telling a story of decline or
   complacency; an ESDP/CSDP that started with high aspirations, and now
   ``fades out{''} with a headache after it ``died over Libya{''}. This
   paper acknowledges the seriousness of the situation. Challenging these
   ``declinist{''} approaches, however, it considers the case of
   Afghanistan and proposes to think about a European ``role by default{''}
   with quasi-strategic effects. Thus, the paper accepts the lack of
   convergence between Europe's national strategic cultures as a given. It
   highlights the paradox that European convergence around this default
   role is both a function of a European desire for - or complacency
   vis-a-vis - the US' security leadership, as well as a quasi-strategic
   expression of accumulated inertia vis-a-vis the US, which preserves a
   modicum of e a modicum of strategic autonomy from the US. This notion of
   a role by default is a more adequate approach to Europe's security role
   than attempts to think up a ``European strategic culture{''}.},

Abstract = {Is living in a politically competitive state beneficial for democratic
   citizenship? Given citizens' generally limited information about state
   politics, we argue that the most effective method of evaluating this
   question is by examining the degree to which the two parties generally
   compete for control of state government. Using data on citizens'
   political attitudes and participation from the American National
   Election Studies and the Ranney measure of state party competition, we
   investigate the relationship between state party competition and citizen
   engagement from 1952 to 2008. Our analysis reveals that citizens report
   more interest in politics and participate at higher rates when there is
   greater competition between the two parties in their state. We also find
   that the relationship between competition and engagement has varied over
   time and that it is the strongest among citizens with lower levels of
   education and income. These findings suggest that vigorous competition
   for control of state government has important implications for citizens'
   political engagement and, ultimately, the quality of democracy in the
   American states.},

Abstract = {This chapter argues that constitutional realism, financial realism, and
   aesthetic realism all work in the same way - they unify experience in a
   universal time that exists beyond any person or people. Britain is the
   paradigm of `capitalist realism', indeed is capitalist realism,
   demanding a very high degree of adjustment of experience to public truth
   - something again familiar from the demands for personal performance in
   neoliberalism. And conversely self-determination can be understood as a
   conflict with realist time or universalist time, growing from the 1980s
   (the `Scottish Literary Renaissance') through the 2010s - and the desire
   to build not from adjustment but from experience. In this sense the `14
   independence referendum can itself be understood fundamentally as an
   interruption of realist or universalist time.},

Title = {Identifying Judicial Empathy: Does Having Daughters Cause Judges to Rule
   for Women's Issues?},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {59},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-54},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In this article, we consider whether personal relationships can affect
   the way that judges decide cases. To do so, we leverage the natural
   experiment of a child's gender to identify the effect of having
   daughters on the votes of judges. Using new data on the family lives of
   U.S. Courts of Appeals judges, we find that, conditional on the number
   of children a judge has, judges with daughters consistently vote in a
   more feminist fashion on gender issues than judges who have only sons.
   This result survives a number of robustness tests and appears to be
   driven primarily by Republican judges. More broadly, this result
   demonstrates that personal experiences influence how judges make
   decisions, and this is the first article to show that empathy may indeed
   be a component in how judges decide cases.},

Abstract = {As Boko Haram continues to evolve, especially in ideology, tactics, and

   accrued. Through a qualitative analysis, this study examines key
   transformations in Boko Haram's evolution with a view of identifying
   catalysts driving this change. Findings indicate that Boko Haram has
   undergone four phases of evolution and are linked to Nigeria's security
   intelligence agencies' counterstrategy and operational countermeasures,
   concluding this to have resulted from a failure of military and civilian
   expertise within Nigeria's security intelligence agencies as well as
   interagency rivalry and a lack of cooperation, cohesion, and oversight.},

Abstract = {Why does the strength of class voting vary over time? Recent research
   has emphasized factors related to the structure of political choice at
   the party level. This article examines different aspects of this choice,
   and investigates whether voters are more likely to respond to the social
   or policy cues that parties send voters. The results from the British
   context suggest that the former are more important than the latter. The
   central implication of this finding is that social representation
   matters, and that the social background of political representatives
   influences how voters relate to political parties.},

Abstract = {This article revisits the different notions and concepts of
   `presidentialization' that have held an exceptionally prominent status
   in recent comparative European politics but have conspicuously failed to
   capture the attention of the American political science community. It
   then applies a slightly amended version of the influential conceptual
   framework suggested by Thomas Poguntke and Paul Webb to the analysis of
   presidential leadership in the United States to demonstrate the
   analytical usefulness of the concept beyond the family of parliamentary
   democracies. This stock-tacking exercise reveals that there are some
   manifestations of presidential leadership that could in fact be
   described as `presidentialization' and others that are better
   characterized as `de-presidentialization'. Interestingly, the recent
   developments towards a less `presidentialized' mode of politics and
   leadership seem to have been induced by the institutional incentives of
   the presidential system.},

   Historical Analysis of the Dynamics of Bangladeshi Society and Politics},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {This paper develops the theme that the ongoing political polarization
   and political crisis in Bangladesh since its independence from Pakistan
   in 1971 reflect the fundamental weaknesses of the pillars of Bangladeshi
   society and national identity. The paper adopts an historical approach
   to explain why and how Muslim nationalism, which was the basis for the
   establishment of Pakistan, has re-emerged in contemporary Bangladeshi
   society and politics and is competing against Bengali ethnicity,
   language, culture and secularism ('Bengali nationalism') within an
   emerging `two-party' political system. However, instead of establishing
   a stable political system following the Hotelling-Downs principle of
   democracy, the Bangladeshi society/polity has been polarized and divided
   almost vertically on the question of national identity and political
   philosophy and created sustained political instability and uncertainty.
   This has stifled the formation and consolidation of a national identity
   based on ethnicity/language/culture or religion/territory/political
   history or that have elements of both. Neither
   ethnicity/language/culture/secularism-based nationalism (Bengali
   nationalism) nor predominantly Muslim-territorial nationalism
   ('Bangladeshi nationalism') alone can dominate and flourish in
   Bangladeshi society and polity; instead, the objective conditions in the
   country dictate that a competitive democratic system of politics which
   accommodates aspects of secularism, language, Muslim identity and
   Islamic ethical-moral codes remains the feasible political discourse for
   forming and consolidating the country's multi-racial, multi-religious
   national identity over the long run and its survival as a sovereign
   state.},

Abstract = {Japan is the region's oldest, and, debatably, most robust democracy.
   Nevertheless, Japanese democratic governance has been bedeviled by
   accusations that the elites govern in their own interests, and only
   superficially in the interests of those who are governed, let alone with
   a truly democratic degree of accountability This chapter, therefore,
   addresses the structural and political culture impediments to good
   democratic governance in Japan. It finds that the qualitative depth of
   Japanese democratic governance leaves a lot to be desired, with Japan
   perhaps only bearing a superficial resemblance to a ``true{''}
   democratic state. Furthermore, this chapter identifies forces in the
   current government administration which perhaps seek further to
   undermine the quality of democratic life in Japan.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes several development trends of pirate parties in
   cross-national perspective. The author studies dynamics of pirates'
   political program and conducts a correlation analysis of factors that
   determine the degree of institutionalization of their organizations.
   According to Yu.Kabanov's conclusion, in most cases pirate parties lack
   sufficient resources and often a desire to actively participate in the
   established party system. Neither popularity of their ideas nor their
   electoral results enjoy stability. However, one can already spot some
   potential growing points of pirate parties, especially in Europe.
   According to the author's forecast, transformations of the pirate
   movement will continue to take place and will become decisive for its
   future development. The latter will largely hinge upon the final choice
   of pirate parties: whether to retain their radical, anti-elite positions
   or move toward the median voter and common policy.},

   new contribution to debates on critical mass theory, exploring the
   conditional effects of women's increased presence in organizations
   stemming from the use of different decision-making rules. Distinct from
   other work, they focus on the process of representation, theorizing
   gendered opportunities and constraints for women to exercise political
   influence. Like other critical mass scholars, however, they overlook the
   possibility of backlash and resistance in the face of women's growing
   numbers - dynamics which undercut women's ability to participate as
   equals and thus potentially undermine recent policy initiatives like
   gender quotas to elect more women and give women greater voice in
   policy-making processes.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we question the common wisdom that more polarised voters'
   opinions imply larger policy polarisation. We analyse a voting model in
   which the source of the polarisation in voters' opinions is correlation
   neglect, that is, voters neglect the correlation in their information
   sources. Our main result shows that such polarisation in opinions does
   not necessarily translate to policy polarisation; when the electoral
   system is not too competitive (that is, when there is some aggregate
   noise in the election's outcome), then voters with correlation neglect
   may induce lower levels of policy polarisation compared with rational
   electorates.},

Abstract = {In this contribution, we address the question if and under which
   circumstances voters are able to identify the utility maximizing choice
   in multi-party systems with coalition governments. With help of a
   laboratory experiment we test the influence of specific variables on the
   likelihood of rational voting decisions. In accordance with our
   theoretical expectations, we find that the subjects are more likely to
   identify and vote for the rational choice, if i) the rational choice
   corresponds to the closest party, ii) the distance between the rational
   choice and the voter's ideal point is smaller, iii) simple heuristics
   are available to identify the rational choice, and iv) the scenarios do
   not include characteristics making them more complex (like, e. g.,
   signals for unconnected coalitions).},

Title = {Trading in Paranoia: Exploring Singapore's Security-Trade Linkages in
   the Twenty-first Century},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {184-206},
Abstract = {Singapore's rude awakening to independence has led to the creation of
   one of the most important and strategic entrepots in the Asia-Pacific.
   The country's limited territorial lands and natural resources, combined
   with huge per capita income, high population density and sensitive
   racial mix, make Singapore the quintessential pragmatic trading state of
   the twenty-first century. This paper examines how Singapore has embedded
   itself at the centre of regional and global trade systems by exploiting
   various forms of free trade activities including multilateral, regional
   and bilateral FTAs that underpin its security and survival. It argues
   that in order to maintain the city-state's geo-economic and
   geo-political viability, the Singaporean government has progressively
   linked its security interests with its multilevel free trade activities.
   Given the `vulnerability fetish' and siege mentality that confront
   Singaporean leaders and policymakers, the pursuit of economic
   development via free trade has become the heart of its national security
   policy and strategy. The paper concludes by arguing that the enhancement
   and preservation of Singapore's survival as a sovereign nation-state
   demands a strategic utilization of FTAs with different trade partners,
   especially with regional and trans-regional powers such as the United
   States and China.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on income inequality and government redistribution in
   120 countries between 1980 and 2010. It begins by describing variation
   in inequality across countries and over time, distinguishing between
   income before and after government redistribution by way of taxes and
   social transfers. It then goes on to explore the sources of
   cross-national and over-time variation in inequality and redistribution
   with reference to a number of variables widely employed in the
   literature, including development level, economic globalization, ethnic
   fractionalization, political democracy and the partisan orientation of
   governing executives. We find that, other things being equal, per capita
   income is positively related to greater government redistribution and a
   more egalitarian distribution of post-government income, while ethnic
   fractionalization is related to less redistribution and greater
   inequality of disposable income. We find little evidence that economic
   globalization, democracy or partisan orientations are strongly related,
   in either direction, to the degree of government redistribution or
   post-government inequality in the countries we examine.},

Abstract = {The 2014 Israel-Gaza war was the third of a string of conflicts to erupt
   between the State of Israel and Hamas in neighbouring Gaza and quickly
   became the deadliest for both sides. Even with the extensive media
   attention this crisis received, calls for more objective reporting were
   widespread, as locating sources that were not clearly influenced or
   reflective of political biases seemed near impossible. This paper seeks
   to explore the role ``cultural proximity{''} plays in informing casualty
   count reporting in times of conflict. Qualitative content analysis is
   conducted on news coverage of the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict in the
   American daily newspaper, The New York Times, and the Israeli daily
   newspaper, Haaretz, to assess whether significant differences exist in
   the way casualty figures are addressed across varying degrees of
   political and cultural involvement. This research reveals that
   variations in casualty count reporting do indeed exist across cultural
   and national contexts, and deems this subject worthy of further
   research.},

Abstract = {Thisv paper presents a spatial analysis of the Communist Party of
   Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) voter support in the 2006, 2010, and 2013
   Czech parliamentary elections. The main method applied for classifying
   electoral results was the spatial autocorrelation and spatial regression
   which play an important role in spatial statistics and spatial
   econometrics. The result of the analysis showed that regional stability
   of the KSCM support is very stable and is ``rooted{''} in certain
   regions, which are almost identical through the whole period since Czech
   transition to democracy in 1990. In these areas, therefore, we can
   assume the existence of intergenerational transmission of the party
   identification, or mobilization of young voters. An important
   characteristic of these regions is also the fact, that they are affected
   by structural problems. Overall, there is a gradual increase in the
   influence of economic variables for the KSCM support. Successful
   environment for the KSCM support are especially the units that are
   characterized by a higher unemployment, lower educational level, lower
   proportion of entrepreneurs and small number of foreigners living there,
   i.e. characteristics that in socio-economic, or socio-ecological terms
   define the peripheral areas.},

Abstract = {The following article analyzes the career of the 110 individuals who
   served as vice president in the 17 presidential regimes of the American
   continent in the period spanning from 1985 to 2012. First, the article
   analyses the variables which influence the selection of succesful
   vicepresidential candidates, and seeks to elucidate if presidential
   tickets seeks to increase their political and socio-demographic
   representation with said candidate. The article also studies the
   relationship between presidents and their respective vicepresidents, and
   suggests that the key variables which explain this relationship are the
   vicepresident's preexisting loyalty towards his running mate, the
   president's job performance and the vicepresident's own political power.
   Finally, the paper proposes that the vicepresidency can not be perceived
   as a stepping stone towards the presidency, as very few sitting or
   former vice presidents are ever elected to the highest office.},

Abstract = {In the autumn of 2011, there was significant discussion in the British
   press about the level of support among women for the Conservatives and
   for Prime Minister David Cameron, arguing that he had a `problem with
   women' and suggesting that this had arisen since the general election
   the previous year. We examine the opinion polls over the period, and
   find that they mostly point towards an opposite conclusion. Further,
   there seems little to suggest that attitudes to David Cameron personally
   were damaging Conservative standing among women, as much of the coverage
   implied. We consider how the reporting came to give a misleading
   impression, and why it matters.},

Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},

Volume = {24},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {451-468},
Abstract = {Social media like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are the latest
   innovation in modern e-campaigning. They allow candidates to address
   voters in a personalised, responsive and dialogue-oriented manner that
   is hoped to improve the strained connection between citizens and
   political elite. Whether and in what ways German MPs on different
   political levels make use of this facility is unclear since studies in
   this area are still missing. The paper fills this void by providing the
   first comprehensive assessment of German politicians' social media use.
   The study is based on a large-scale content analysis that compares the
   use of all major platforms (Facebook, VZ, Twitter, YouTube and Twitter)
   by German MPs in the Bundestag, the European Parliament and five federal
   state parliaments in 2012. The results show that on all levels MPs began
   to employ social media and that first steps towards interactive voter
   relations were made, especially on Facebook.},

Abstract = {Discourses about Internet and rights generate ideological, economic, and
   policy debates that bring to prominence the question of citizenship in
   today's digital age. But what does Internet access as a citizen's right
   imply? What are the pragmatic meanings of the intersection of
   citizenship, rights, and technology access? Specifically, what does
   citizens' right to technology mean for African states? This paper
   examines citizenship, rights, and Internet in South Africa, and attempts
   to move the discourse beyond philosophical rhetoric to practical policy
   interpretations. To do this, the study examines interpretations and
   reactions of policy-makers to the idea of Internet access as a citizen's
   right, and through a survey explores the views of many youth on this
   subject. Findings reveal strong opinions about rights and technology
   access in South Africa. For policy-makers, the reality of the
   socioeconomic challenges of Africa humbles an egalitarian aspiration of
   rights and Internet access.},

Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {28},
Number = {109},

Abstract = {``Gender mainstreaming{''} is a method of promotion of gender equality
   goals carried out by the European Union, institutionalizing feminist
   approaches. To what extent has this method fostered the diffusion of
   gender equality goals in public policies, outside the boundaries of
   state feminism? This article tackles this question by exploring the
   implementation of employment policy in Berlin during the 2000s. It shows
   that even if the work of some ``gender mainstreaming advocates{''} has
   led to a certain institutionalization of the theme of equality in the
   employment sector, the re-appropriation of this goal by employment
   policy actors remains limited. This can be accounted for by the concrete
   modalities of gender mainstreaming implementation and by the existence
   of normative and cognitive resistances from the employment sector
   actors.},

   Domingo Silva with the purpose of specifying what aspects of the
   anarchist ideology apprehended by the author, during his youth, maintain
   validy in his subsequent writing practice. The melodrama Aires de la
   Pampa tries to represent the social unrest experienced in Iquique at the
   beginning of the twentieth century, revealing a construction of the time
   which coincides with the assumptions described by Mijail Bakunin in his
   libertarian utopia. That is to say, the preponderance of the Present for
   the construction of a Future society by means of the Revolution.},

Title = {INFLUENCE OF CULTURAL CONTEXT ON FORMATION OF SCIENCE POLICY (French
   Experience)},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2015},
Number = {5},
Pages = {119-129},
Abstract = {The article examines the science policy as an element of national public
   policy. The author gives the definition of the term ``science policy{''}
   and analyzes all the stages of formation of science policy in France.
   Based on the concept of the Neal, Smith and McCormick, based on the fact
   that the development of science policy is related to the beginning of
   the space era and the launch of the first satellite by USSR, the author
   analyzes in detail the formation of science policy in France after WW
   II. A special role in this formation played the activity of Pierre
   Mendes-France, and Charles de Gaulle in the 1950s. The author also
   investigates the background of the French science policy and begins with
   the analysis of the establishment in the 16th century of the College de
   France. The author attempts to identify the national specifics of
   research activities in France and its impact on the actual science
   policy. The existence of axiological pluralism in science suggests that
   scientific communities in different countries are influenced by their
   national cultures, which consist of different sets of values. To make a
   structure of the model for research culture in France, the author uses
   the description model of national cultures composed by D. Oyzerman for
   describing culture as a set of three interrelated sets of factors. The
   first group includes religious and philosophical beliefs, historical
   context and linguistic tradition. The second involves social
   institutions associated with the legal and economic systems of society,
   as well as education and upbringing. The third one is internalized by
   the individual part of the culture, which includes cultural norms and
   values. Guided by the proposed model, the author examines the scientific
   culture in France in terms of three dimensions: linguo-cultural,
   institutional, and axiological. This approach allows to cover fully all
   the most important factors affecting the national peculiarities of
   French research school, and demonstrate inconsistency of the positivist
   interpretation of scientific knowledge as based on universality and
   supra-national nature.},

Pages = {217+},
Abstract = {The electoral success of political candidates is influenced by their
   physical attractiveness. A number of empirical studies have demonstrated
   this impressively. The theoretical part of the paper outlines the
   transmitting mechanisms of the effects of physical attractiveness on
   electoral success. The empirical part shows that attractive constituency
   candidates are better remembered and judged by the voters. These
   analyses are done exemplarily with data of the 2005 German federal
   election. Additionally, the examples of the German federal elections
   2005, 2009 and 2013 demonstrate that the influence of the attractiveness
   of the constituency candidates on their election result is robust over
   time. The final section of the paper discusses prospects for future
   research.},

Abstract = {This article aims to explore the concept of political theology in
   contemporary philosophical and theological debates. In the sense of Carl
   Schmitt the political theology is based on a structural correspondence
   between political concepts and theological concepts. From this paradigm
   depends the importance of ``analogy{''} for the modern end postmodern
   age. In the contest of the global pluralism the contemporary political
   theology needs to focus on the concept of inclusiveness rather than on
   the concept of sovereignty. The post-secular age is an opportunity for a
   new relationship between political philosophy, theory of modern
   institutions and fundamental theology.},

Journal = {CANADIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {9},

Pages = {128-146},
Abstract = {This paper focuses attention on the political orientation and civic
   behaviour of people working in the non-profit, private, and public
   sectors. While considerable research has been completed to understand
   how variables such as age and gender influence voting patterns, one
   variable that remains understudied is employment by sector. To develop
   hypothesis statements for this research, this paper begins with the
   Bureau Voting Model which is rooted in rational choice theory. The
   hypothesis statements are tested using data from the SSHRC-funded
   Canadian Provincial Election Project (CPEP) Survey, conducted
   post-provincial election in 2011-2012 in eight provinces. The paper
   concludes that while there were diverging orientations amongst employees
   in the three sectors, there were also some areas of convergence to
   suggest that there may be substantial diversity within each sector.},

Abstract = {Who profits from the redesign of German government portfolios? The
   article explains jurisdictional changes as the outcome of a distributive
   conflict during coalition formation in which coalition arithmetic and
   the policy profiles of the coalition partners are decisive. Statistical
   analyses of all jurisdictional changes since 1957 show that portfolios
   held by parties that are quantitatively underrepresented in the cabinet
   and portfolios of high electoral salience are more likely to gain
   competencies. Underrepresented partners are compensated by strengthening
   low-salience portfolios. The politics of portfolio design has broad
   implications for coalition research, policy studies, and institutional
   reforms in the executive branch.},

Abstract = {The theory of democracy states that political parties attract voters
   through election programs which they intend to implement upon election.
   This article examines the programme-to-policy fulfilment of election
   pledges in the Czech Republic in 2010-2013. It explores the factors that
   should influence the fulfilment of pledges. The article concludes that
   Czech political parties try to fulfil their election pledges, although
   the rate of fulfilment is not high because of the way the party system
   is structured. In addition, five factors influencing outcomes are
   tested. Consensus among parties, inclusion of the pledge in the
   Programmatic Declaration of the Government and whether pledges maintain
   the status quo influence the probability of pledge fulfilment. On the
   other hand, there appears to be no relation between pledge fulfilment
   and participation by a party in the government or its control of a
   ministry.},

Title = {When Do Close Elections Matter for Higher Turnout? Gauging the Impact of
   the Interaction Between Electoral Competitiveness and District Magnitude},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {178-194},
Abstract = {A conventional rational choice perspective assumes a positive
   relationship between close elections and higher turnout because of the
   increased probability that few votes might actually matter for the
   election outcome. However, this hypothesis should only hold in electoral
   districts where one or few candidates are elected. In contrast, close
   elections should have less of an impact in districts where many members
   are elected because these districts are characterized by a proportional
   translation of votes into seats. Testing the foregoing logic, this
   article evaluates the interactive influence between the closeness of an
   election and the district magnitude on turnout. The results of the
   multivariate regression analysis, which includes data for over 600
   elections across the globe, support the idea that close elections boost
   electoral participation in districts with one or few elected members,
   but not in districts with many elected representatives.},

Title = {Measuring Institutional Trust: Evidence from Guyana},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {85-115},
Abstract = {Institutional trust is often measured by several items that are analyzed
   individually or as sum-scores. However, it is difficult to summarize the
   results of individual-items analyses, whereas sum-scores may be
   meaningless if the dimensions that the items are assumed to measure are
   not verified. Although these limitations are circumvented by using
   factor analysis, response styles may still bias research results. We use
   data from Guyana to show that a second-order factor model is appropriate
   for measuring institutional trust. We also demonstrate that response
   styles can inflate item and factor convergent validity and may either
   distort regression effects or create completely spurious ones. We
   therefore recommend using factor models with corrections for response
   styles in institutional trust research instead of sum-scores and
   individual-items analyses.},

Abstract = {This article argues that religion, as it represents itself in political
   conflicts, has as many occurrences as individuals confess to it and how
   those individuals interpret ``their{''} religion in different contexts.
   A simple substantial or functional conceptualization of religion
   therefore has grave analytical shortcomings. This is also because the
   origins of religion, seen from the perspectives of anthropology and
   theology, are of violent nature. Moreover, there is only a gradual, no
   principal difference between religious and secular identity markers. All
   of this leads to the necessity of alternative approaches for
   theoretically capturing religion in the context of politics and
   international relations: interpretative approaches; the possibilities
   mimetic theory brings with it to the social sciences; as well as the
   circumstance that political theology should be understood as a
   supplement of political sciences analysis.},

Title = {When politics becomes news: An analysis of parliamentary questions and

Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},

Abstract = {This study addresses two questions that are part of the larger debate on
   mediatized politics. First, we want to know to what extent the work of
   members of parliament is mediatized. Second, we want to know how the
   interaction between media and parliamentary politics is determined by
   the institutional context. To address these questions we present a
   content analysis of oral parliamentary questions (PQs) and press
   coverage in three West European countries: the Netherlands, France and
   Germany. This way we improve the insight in when and why specific
   political initiatives receive media attention, and if specific
   characteristics of these initiatives and the institutional context in
   which they are used increase the chance and amount thereof. Results from
   the regression analysis show that the most important factor in
   determining newsworthiness is the amount of media attention for a
   certain topic preceding the PQ. In addition, the analysis has shown that
   in the Netherlands and France voicing criticism towards a member of
   government in a PQ slightly increases the chances of getting covered by
   a newspaper. Finally, as expected, in the Netherlands the oral PQs are
   the most newsworthy, and in Germany the least, with France taking a
   middle position.},

Abstract = {Despite the many challenges and questions that European integration
   raises to political science, this research topic still maintains a
   strong reputation of boredom. The difficulty certainly relates to the
   ``bad reputation{''} of the European Union itself, most often thought of
   as baroque and incomprehensible. This brief article takes the
   opportunity of the anniversary of Politique europenne to question the
   part that the scholarly field of ``European studies{''} itself may have
   in such reputation, delineating possible ways out through the
   development of ``social sciences of Europe{''}.},

Pages = {178-199},
Abstract = {Multicultural societies have been formed since the dawn of history, and
   the approach of a democratic state and society to the treatment and
   understanding of minorities reflects the changes occurring in the social
   and political awareness of the citizens. For some, ethnicity is just a
   relic of history, and a source of conflicts. For others, it is a
   much-valued pluralism, a touchstone of social justice, contributing to
   the exchange of cultural property and general development. The
   fundamental principle of the Republic of Poland is equal treatment of
   all of its citizens regardless of their nationality. It guarantees the
   minorities the freedom to maintain and develop the native language,
   habits and traditions as well as to nurture their cultural identity.
   Cultural security refers to the public and social spheres. At present,
   it is defined as a state where society may consolidate and cultivate
   values underpinning its identity, while drawing on the example of other
   nations. It is perceived as a set of norms, conditions and various
   mechanisms which guarantee the ethnic groups the sense of safety,
   unthreatened development of identity and unhindered perpetuation by
   active cooperation and tolerance.},

Abstract = {Democratic accountability requires that citizens can assign
   responsibility for policy outcomes, yet multilevel structures of
   government complicate this task as they blur lines of accountability and
   leave voters uncertain about which level of government is responsible.
   This study examines the extent to which Europeans are able to navigate
   the complex and ever-changing divisions of responsibility between their
   national governments and the European Union (EU). Specifically, we
   compare citizen and expert responsibility attributions to evaluate if
   and how voters can competently assign policy responsibility to the
   European Union. Using multilevel modeling to analyze survey and media
   data from 27 EU member states, we demonstrate that extreme attitudes
   reduce citizen competence by motivating biased information processing.
   Yet at the contextual level, highly politicized environments result in
   more correct allocations of responsibility by creating an
   information-rich context.},

Abstract = {In late 2013, the Kansas Board of Regents proposed a social media
   policy, a policy which the board eventually unanimously approved. The
   policy authorized ``the chief executive officer of a state university.
   to suspend, dismiss or terminate from employment any faculty or staff
   member who makes improper use of social media.{''} A strong and unified
   condemnation of the policy followed, led primarily by the faculty of
   those institutions and their various faculty governance organizations.
   This conflict between the free speech rights of academics and the
   governing authority of government and university administrations in the
   state of Kansas was neither the first nor last such conflict; U.S.
   courts had already established a doctrine over the free speech rights of
   public employees. Therefore, this conflict presents an opportunity to
   observe how the judicial establishment and definition of rights affects
   subsequent political conflict and discourse. The conflict over the
   social media policy adopted by the Kansas Board of Regents raises
   questions of whether the established judicial articulations of free
   speech in an academic setting shaped the efforts of Kansas faculty in
   opposition to this policy and the crafting of the policy itself.},

Abstract = {The `policy communities' literature has stood the test of time because
   it describes a `universal' logic for groups and governments to interact.
   To deal with complex government, policymakers divide their
   responsibilities into manageable units, and delegate responsibility for
   policymaking to bureaucrats, who form relationships with the groups from
   which they seek information and advice. Governments come and go, and
   these relationships vary from issue to issue, but the logic of
   consultation does not change. In this article, we describe this process,
   situate it within a broader discussion of policy theory, and use these
   insights to respond to the points made by Marsh and Mc Caffrie.},

Abstract = {The association between education and political participation is one of
   the strongest and most reliable in American politics, but it is poorly
   understood. Whether human capital acquired through education affects
   participation remains unknown. Most studies of this question restrict
   measurement of human capital to years of schooling (attainment) or
   civics knowledge. But attainment is a weak instrument for human capital,
   which varies considerably within attainment levels. And skills beyond
   civics-particularly verbal communication skills-are politically
   important. With data from the National Education Longitudinal Study, I
   examine the relationship between verbal skills acquired in school during
   adolescence and participation later in life. I find a strong positive
   effect, showing that when young people learn to use their voices in
   school, they are more likely to speak up as participatory adults. The
   findings reveal an important mechanism by which education affects
   democratic life, call for a broadening of the empirical treatment of
   education in political science, and suggest an answer to the puzzle of
   participation.},

Abstract = {The Front National (FN) has made an impressive come back into France's
   electoral politics since 2012. Adopting a supply-side approach, this
   article places the electoral rejuvenation of the FN in the context of
   the global crisis and looks at how the party has adapted
   programmatically to socio-economic demands emerging from this context.
   On the basis of manifesto data analysis, we find that despite having
   recently broadened its economic programme, the FN maintains a niche
   status in the party system. Our findings show, however, that the party
   has significantly shifted its economic platform, moving from a
   predominantly right-wing to a left-wing location since the mid-1980s.
   This move is characterized by an increase in egalitarian and nationalist
   economic policies, espousing also a populist framework. The
   reconfiguration of the FN suggests that the party may have moved to a
   pivotal position in recent years by converging around the economic
   preferences of the median voter. We discuss the role of internal and
   external factors in explaining the economic policy shift by the FN, and
   consider possible implications of our findings for understanding current
   populist radical right electoral dynamics in Europe.},

Title = {Targeting voter registration with incentives: A randomized controlled

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {Does an incentive-in the form of a lottery-increase voter registration,
   particularly among poorer members of society? In the summer of 2012, two
   groups of 20,000 randomly selected households from a London Borough were
   informed that they would be placed into a prize draw if they registered
   to vote by 28 September 2012. One group was offered 5000 and the other
   1000 while the remaining households in the borough received the standard
   letter with the same deadline but no lottery offer. The registration
   rates after the deadline were 46.2 per cent in the 1000 group and 46.6
   per cent in the 5000 group compared to 44.7 in the control. Levels of
   registration in the two treatment groups are statistically different to
   the control, but not from each other. Households in poorer locations are
   more receptive of the lottery offer whereas there is no effect in places
   where richer households live. After the face-to-face canvass of all
   remaining non-registered households, which took place after the
   experiment, there were no statistically significant differences between
   the treatment groups and the control. The study builds on the work of
   Raja and Schaffner (2012) and Panagopoulos (2013) by finding that
   incentives work in different ways depending on their level and who is
   targeted. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   first time, the concept of centrifugal democracy is attributed to the
   Bosnian-Herzegovinian model of democracy. This attribution is confirmed
   through an analysis of the historical institutional development, and of
   existing cleavages and conflicts among political elites. The development
   of Swiss consociational democracy is examined since 1848, while the
   development of Bosnian-Herzegovinian centrifugal democracy is assessed
   since 1878. The paper also considers ``political correctives{''}, which
   stabilize and direct the work of political elites in Switzerland and
   Bosnia and Herzegovina. These comprise referenda and popular initiatives
   in the first case and international community in the second case. The
   paper concludes with an assessment of a possible process of
   transformation of Bosnian-Herzegovinian centrifugal democracy into
   consociational democracy, and provides examples of potential
   institutional innovations that would follow the Swiss model.},

Abstract = {A long debate continues whether international trade institutions
   (specifically preferential trade agreements {[}PTAs]) affect security
   relations between states. Contradicting theories and empirical claims
   are put forward by realists and liberals. The former posit that the
   institutions are epiphenomenal and possess no power to constrain state
   behavior whereas the latter claim that the institutions are likely to
   promote cooperation by supplying forums for consultation, arbitration
   and adjudication, thus reducing the risk of war between states. This
   study identifies an important channel through which the legal dimension
   of trade agreements (hence dispute settlement mechanisms {[}DSMs] in
   PTAs) may have pacifying effects on the outbreaks of war. DSMs of PTAs
   do have strong implications for militarized interstate disputes (MIDs),
   although not directly, but through low-level of foreign policy disputes,
   such as economic sanctions. If economic sanctions are believed to
   escalate to violent conflict, PTA DSMs may reduce the probability of war
   by mitigating the escalation of economic sanctions. However, the level
   of legalism differs among DSMs in PTAs. The present study first confirms
   empirically that sanction disputes escalate to militarized disputes and
   further, addresses the selection issue by using bivariate probit model.
   I find a sizeable impact of medium level of legalism reducing the
   sanctions escalation into war whereas high level of legalism, in which
   the state sovereignty is limited, do reduce the probability of sanctions
   but have no impact on war probability. Further, the interstate political
   cooperation proves to be a strong determinant for highly legalistic PTAs
   but not in the case of medium level of legalism.},

Abstract = {According to more than a half-century of scholarship, a president's
   prestige is one of his primary sources of power. In this article, we
   examine the public's attitudes toward the levers of presidential power.
   Using data from a nationally representative survey, we show that
   respondents who provided higher approval ratings of the president were
   significantly more supportive of presidential powers. These findings
   provide striking evidence that views toward executive power are shaped
   by presidential approval and suggest that popular presidents can use
   their prestige to expand the scope of powers available to the
   presidency.},

Abstract = {Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma caused massive destruction in the Gulf of
   Mexico in 2005 but circum-Caribbean countries responded differently to
   the storms in terms of hurricane preparedness and disaster management.
   What accounts for these dissimilarities, and are the roles expected of
   governments and societies to mitigate loss of life and physical
   devastation different across political systems and countries? This
   article examines etiologies of hurricane destruction advanced by
   political rulers and public opinion leaders in Mexico and Cuba. Reports
   in the Spanish-language printed media provide evidence of the types of
   critiques made by Mexican and Cuban leaders of U.S. mismanagement of
   disaster response to hurricane Katrina. How they assessed their own
   country's management of hurricane Wilma's destruction is also analyzed.
   A key theoretical question which the article addresses is whether the
   effectiveness of hurricane responses depends on the state's capacity,
   including social capital, public policy priorities, social values, and
   quality of leadership. Explanations are offered and factors identified
   as to why a state with massive resources and broad legitimacy like the
   U.S. responded ineffectively to Katrina while the Cuban government with
   limited resources and much less legitimacy performed effectively in
   managing Wilma. In turn, how did the first post-PRI government in 70
   years with limited experience and neoliberal values manage its hurricane
   Wilma crisis?},

Abstract = {Since coming to power in 2002, the AKP government has enacted a series
   of urban transformation projects that have significantly altered the
   urban landscape of cities across Turkey. In this article, the author
   takes up the latest item on the government's agenda - the 2012 Draft Law
   on the Regeneration of Areas under Disaster Risk - which would empower
   the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization with a capacity to
   appropriate all property it deems ``risky,{''} and build new structures
   in their place. According to the author, this law would allow the
   government to impose its will on urban spaces without accountability,
   transparency, or popular consent. Instead, the author advocates for the
   implementation of urbanization projects that take a citizens-based
   approach, respect housing and shelter rights, and aim to conserve rather
   than threaten the cultural and historical heritage of Turkey's cities.},

   activism in Turkey has not translated into party politics, nor has
   another similar wave of protests followed. However, the line of
   criticism directed against the government and its leaders during the
   protests is still present, and is particularly visible online. Besides
   more serious political criticism found online, certain satire websites,
   Facebook groups, and some so-called benign Twitter trolls have developed
   a critical, humorous voice of their own. This article is an analysis of
   the humor and youth activism displayed in these venues, placing both

Abstract = {Existing political theory, particularly which deals with justice and/or
   rights, has long assumed citizenship as a core concept. Noncitizenship,
   if it is considered at all, is generally defined merely as the negation
   or deprivation of citizenship. As such, it is difficult to examine
   successfully the status of noncitizens, obligations towards them, and
   the nature of their role in political systems. This article addresses
   this critical gap by defining the theoretical problem that
   noncitizenship presents and demonstrating why it is an urgent concern.
   It surveys the contributions to the special issue for which the article
   is an introduction, drawing on cross-cutting themes and debates to
   highlight the importance of theorising noncitizenship due to both the
   problematic gap that exists in the theoretical literature, and the real
   world problems created as a result of noncitizenship which are not
   currently successfully addressed. Finally, the article discusses key
   future directions for the theorisation of noncitizenship.},

Abstract = {What is the level of voter-elite congruence in Europe and how is it
   affected by institutions? This article presents a different
   conceptualisation and new data to comparative research on congruence
   between voters and their representatives in 15 European countries. The
   originality of this work is mainly in its use of the most appropriate
   cross-national data for the conceptualisation of congruence as a
   many-to-many' relationship, using for the first time a survey of
   representatives to replace expert and public opinion on legislators'
   attitudes. The study's results show that congruence in European
   countries is relatively high in terms of left-right positions and,
   surprisingly, even higher regarding the question of EU integration.
   However, while we find enough evidence to link ideological congruence to
   mostly electoral institutions, it seems the same factors have no
   relation to the European unification dimension of congruence. This
   indicates the different nature of congruence in both the ideological and
   EU integration dimensions. Additionally, the present study found
   congruence to be higher for the group of voters rather than non-voters,
   and also higher for voters interested in politics as well as voters with
   a university degree.},

Abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of vote-buying is essential for improving
   accountability in elections in developing democracies. While list
   experiments are useful for attenuating social desirability bias
   associated with measuring vote-buying, they are not conducive to
   multivariate analyses, and the question of what types of individuals are
   targeted is left inadequately explored. We overcome this limitation by
   combining a population-based list experiment with an estimator (LISTIT)
   that allows for multivariate analyses in an efficient manner. Our
   analysis suggests that in the 2011 parliamentary elections in Turkey
   over one-third of the electorate was targeted for vote-buying, which is
   more than double the proportion willing to admit when asked directly.
   Additionally, we find that strong partisans of the ruling Justice and
   Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkinma Partisi), less-educated
   individuals, and urban residents are significantly more likely to be
   targeted for vote-buying. We present compelling evidence for the
   hypotheses that parties target their core supporters and
   socio-economically vulnerable individuals. The strength of our evidence
   derives from the use of original data on vote-buying that has been
   collected in an unobtrusive manner and analyzed at the level of
   individuals.},

Abstract = {Central Eastern European party politics offers a good example of the
   trend towards centralizing internal party decision making, as well as
   encouraging strong personalities in the role of party leader. This trend
   is visible in all three major spheres of party activity: election
   campaigning, the internal organization of parties, and governmental
   politics. This paper focusses on the party systems of the Czech
   Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia to demonstrate that
   there are actually two processes of presidentialization that occur in
   party politics. On the one hand, the role of the leader is gaining
   importance in more traditional, well-established parties such as the
   Civic and Social Democrats in the Czech Republic and Fidesz in Hungary.
   On the other hand, perhaps an even clearer presidentialization process
   is evident in the emergence of new protest parties focussed around
   strong personalities that often make no attempt to establish and
   maintain a more complex internal party organization.},

Abstract = {Why do some countries tolerate dual citizenship while others do not? The
   answer concerns the interaction between regime type variation and
   international migration. Democracies with a relatively large migrant
   stock are more likely to tolerate dual citizenship than democracies with
   a low migrant stock. Meanwhile, democracies with relatively high
   emigration rates for the highly educated population are more likely to
   tolerate dual citizenship than democracies with low emigration rates of
   the highly educated. In authoritarian states, the opposite is the case:
   emigration of the highly educated and immigration both reduce the
   likelihood of dual citizenship toleration. These claims are supported by
   the evidence from a large n examination of contemporary cross-national
   data. Understanding dual citizenship helps us address larger questions
   about the significance of democracy and the nature and scope of nation
   states.},

Abstract = {Aleksandr Rodchenko's photographs have become icons in which the young
   Soviet Union seems to be captured in artistically valid form: pictures
   showing everyday life made by an engaged observer. But the political and
   social upheavals that the country went through after the October
   Revolution are hardly visible in Rodchenko's photographs. Rather, they
   appear in passing vis-a-vis the photographic composition as such.
   Rodchenko and his new visual language increasingly came into conflict
   with the ideological and propagandistic precepts of proletarian art. His
   photographic oeuvre is eloquent testimony to the forced extinction of
   his own experimental aesthetics and the Soviet avant-garde in general.},

Title = {Black knights and elections in authoritarian regimes: Why and how Russia
   supports authoritarian incumbents in post-Soviet states},

Abstract = {In the last decade, studies have documented how autocrats use elections
   as a way of legitimising and stabilising their regimes. Simultaneously,
   a literature on negative external actors (also known as black knights')
   has developed, emphasising how various international actors use
   anti-democracy promotion strategies to undergird authoritarian regimes.
   In this article, these two literatures are fused in an attempt to shed
   light on the external dimension of authoritarian elections and what is
   termed black knight election bolstering'. First, five mechanisms are
   elucidated, through which external assistance increases the chances of
   winning' elections in authoritarian settings (signaling invincibility,
   deterring elite defection, undermining opposition activities, dealing
   with popular protests, and countervailing pressure from foreign
   democracy promoters). Second, it is argued that external actors are most
   likely to offer election bolstering when they face a particularly
   acquiescent partner or when electoral defeat is perceived to lead to
   radical and undesired regime change. The relevance of both factors is
   augmented when uncertainty of the electoral outcome is high. Finally,
   four cases of Russian intervention during elections in three
   authoritarian neighbour countries (Ukraine in 2004, Belarus in 2006, and
   Moldova in 2005 and 2009) are analysed. The case studies corroborate the
   theoretical arguments: not only does Russia engage in all five types of
   black knight election bolstering, but it does so only when one or more
   of the three explanatory factors are present.},

Abstract = {In response to rising popular disenchantment with elected officials,
   numerous scholars have sought to defend politics and restate why it
   matters. For the most part, however, these theoretical arguments
   overlook the views and reflections of politicians themselves. As a step
   towards filling this gap, the author surveys politician-centred studies
   from around the world and the reflections of academics who have become
   politicians. By paying careful attention to what `insiders' say about
   life in politics, the author constructs a practical rather than
   theoretical defence of the vocation and the people who undertake it. The
   author argues that politicians' views remind one that human endeavour is
   central to the purpose and function of politics and associated political
   institutions. To link the practical views and experiences of politicians
   with the emerging literature on demonisation, the author revisits the
   work of Arendt and Weber. The author concludes that while one may not
   always like who politicians are or the ways they operate, revaluing
   endeavour allows one to give credit where credit is due; politicians may
   regularly disappoint people but representative democracy does not work
   without them.},

Abstract = {This article recovers ``evangelical toleration{''} as a neglected
   tradition in early modern political thought with important consequences
   for contemporary political theory and practice. Many political theorists
   dismiss the prudential arguments made by ``proto-liberal{''} thinkers
   like Roger Williams or John Locke in favor of toleration as a necessary
   precondition for evangelism and conversion as intolerant, unacceptably
   instrumental, and inessential to their deeper theories. By contrast,
   critics of liberalism treat them as smoking gun evidence for an imperial
   and civilizing mission underlying liberal toleration. I argue that both
   sides underestimate evangelical toleration's genealogical and
   theoretical importance. Not only were evangelical considerations
   essential in shaping the particular institutions associated with
   toleration in England and America, the varieties of evangelical
   toleration represented by Williams and Locke shed significant light on
   the very different institutions-and intuitions-governing the expression
   of religious difference in liberal democracies today.},

Abstract = {How does the risk of gridlock affect the type of legislative output? Do
   bureaucratic agents expand their activities when they can expect that
   the principals are unable to overrule them? This article introduces a
   novel approach for calculating the risk of gridlock in bicameral
   legislatures in order to estimate its impact on bureaucratic activities,
   combining data on all secondary and tertiary acts of the European Union
   (EU) from 1983 to 2009. The findings reveal that bureaucratic activities
   expand when the risk of gridlock increases and an overruling of tertiary
   acts becomes less likely. This may sustain the EU's overall
   decision-making productivity, but its bureaucratic nature may raise
   further questions about democratic legitimacy and principal-agent
   problems in the representation of interests.},

Abstract = {This article aims to shed light on the ambiguous notion of equality. It
   comments on and criticizes the major claims regarding equality
   maintained by certain prominent authors belonging to the
   liberal/libertarian tradition. Political equality, as distinguished from
   substantive equality, is the object of the analysis. Since the
   liberal/libertarian tradition has targeted various egalitarianisms
   starting from utopian socialism, the most representative contemporary
   egalitarian doctrines - equality of outcome and arithmetical
   equality-are also assessed here. The investigation eventually allows us
   to build a theoretical framework for politics that rests upon three
   kinds of equality: formal equality, ideological equalities, and
   normative equality.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {59},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1072-1087},

Abstract = {An underlying assumption of proportional hazards models is that the
   effect of a change in a covariate on the hazard rate of event occurrence
   is constant over time. For scholars using the Cox model, a Schoenfeld
   residual-based test has become the disciplinary standard for detecting
   violations of this assumption. However, using this test requires
   researchers to make a choice about a transformation of the time scale.
   In practice, this choice has largely consisted of arbitrary decisions
   made without justification. Using replications and simulations, we
   demonstrate that the decision about time transformations can have
   profound implications for the conclusions reached. In particular, we
   show that researchers can make far more informed decisions by paying
   closer attention to the presence of outlier survival times and levels of
   censoring in their data. We suggest a new standard for best practices in
   Cox diagnostics that buttresses the current standard with in-depth
   exploratory data analysis.},

Abstract = {How does the 1994 electoral reform affect the rapid turnover of Japanese
   prime ministers in recent years? This article explores possible ways
   that the electoral reform affects the duration of Japanese leadership
   tenure and empirically assesses three hypotheses regarding this effect.
   Statistical analysis from the late 1960s to the end of the 2000s
   suggests that the effect of the reform depends on a prime minister's
   popularity. The institutional structure enforces the negative effects of
   public disapproval on leadership duration but rarely affects popular
   leaders. In other words, under the new reform, only prime ministers with
   rapidly declining public support face a tremendous risk of being
   short-lived leaders. This also means that public disapproval matters
   more for durability of administrations under the new electoral system
   than under the old system.},

Abstract = {A British decision to leave the European Union (in what has become known
   as a potential Brexit') could have a significant effect on the UK's
   relationship with the Western Balkans, argues James Ker-Lindsay. It
   would almost certainly reduce the country's influence over Bosnia and
   Herzegovina and its ability to shape the process of engagement between
   Serbia and Kosovo. At the same time, the UK would gain no material
   advantage in terms of its ability to handle other regional issues that
   may havea direct or indirect effect on Britain, such as illegal
   migration and the flow of fighters from the Balkans into Syria.},

Abstract = {The Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) is a founding member of the
   African Union (AU) and is the sovereign governing authority in Western
   Sahara. The SADR government believes that the territory's significant
   natural resources will play an important part in the development of a
   viable, self-reliant and democratic nation which will contribute to
   peace, stability and progress of the Maghreb region. The paper examines
   the SADR's efforts to manage its natural resources through the
   establishment of the SADR Petroleum and Mines Authority, the launch of
   licensing rounds, its claim to an exclusive economic zone in the
   Atlantic Ocean and the recent enactment of a Mining Code. The paper
   discusses the SADR's efforts to protect its natural resources in a
   territory that is under occupation, and examines the SADR oil and gas
   licensing rounds as an example of SADR's assertion of sovereignty. The
   SADR natural resources strategy has two basic goals: to deter Morocco's
   efforts to exploit the country's natural resources and to prepare for
   the recovery of full sovereignty.},

Abstract = {As an enterprise, election forecasting has spread and grown. Initial
   work began in the 1980s in the United States, eventually traveling to
   Western Europe, where it finds a current outlet in the most of the
   region's democracies. However, that work has been confined to
   traditional approaches - statistical modeling or poll-watching. We
   import a new approach, which we call synthetic modeling. These forecasts
   come from hybrid models blending structural knowledge with contemporary
   public opinion, to generate ongoing nowcasts of Western European
   national contests, from six months prior to Election Day itself. These
   test results, based on election pools from Germany, the United Kingdom,
   and France, encourage similar research on other European electorates.

   literature, this article aims to interpret the changes to regional
   governance and powers enacted in France in the last 5 years, in the
   light of decadelong political competition on this dimension. The laws
   no. 2010-1563 and 2015-29 aimed to rationalize a cumbersome and costly
   local government system. They confirm the divisive nature of territorial
   government reform in a majoritarian political system such as France.},

Abstract = {The paper explores the understanding of external voting in the context
   of the 2014 Turkish presidential election in which migrants from Turkey
   were enabled to cast votes abroad. This first experience of external
   voting provided an opportunity for an inquiry into the motivations,
   expectations and concerns underlying emigrants' electoral participation.
   Drawing from original fieldwork investigation in Germany, this
   exploratory study finds that citizens' motivation for voting abroad was
   largely dictated by the symbolic dimension of citizenship, and desire to
   formally participate in Turkish politics. Also, evidences demonstrate
   that external voting led to growing concerns about public security as
   well as allegiance of immigrants in major hosting countries,
   particularly in Germany. Focusing on the case of Turkey's external
   voting experience as a large sending country, this paper aims to provide
   a contribution to growing empirical research on the understanding of
   external voting and the effect of migrant electoral participation.},

Abstract = {Within international relations theorizing, political leaders are rarely
   cast as norm entrepreneurs or change agents. As heads of government,
   they have their own sources of legitimacy and authority, but also
   significant constraints. This article, based on new archival research,
   adds nuance to this model by exploring the leadership roles of Franklin
   Roosevelt and Harry Truman on influencing global views on refugee
   protection. The role both presidents played at the international level
   was moderated by constraints at the domestic level within the
   congressional and executive branches. While both presidents demonstrated
   a strong commitment to refugees, only Truman was able to bring about
   change in U.S. policy by deploying the tools of norm entrepreneurship.},

Abstract = {In the past two decades there has been increased international
   recognition of the role of specialised parliamentary bodies in promoting
   gender equality. Such bodies began to proliferate in the 1990s and data
   on them has been collected by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) since
   2006.
   IPU data collection focuses on two main types: single portfolio or
   multiportfolio Standing Committees and women's caucuses. Standing
   Committees may have a strongly institutionalised role in applying a
   gender lens to the legislative process, for example, the FEMM Committee
   of the European Parliament. By contrast, a cross-party women's caucus
   such as those found in sub-Saharan Africa may be a much more informal
   body, specialising in providing support to members through mentoring,
   capacity-building and networking.
   A third type of specialised parliamentary body that can have a gender
   equality mandate is the all-party parliamentary group. Such groups
   require a minimum number of parliamentary members from across parties
   and need to be approved by a presiding officer or comparable
   parliamentary authority. The number of such bodies with a gender focus
   has also been increasing.
   This paper uses a comparative institutional approach to examine these
   different types of specialised bodies and their ability to perform
   functions including legislative scrutiny and providing a channel for
   community groups and gender experts to participate in the legislative
   process. It examines existing parliamentary bodies specialising in
   gender equality in terms of their structure, membership, mandate,
   working methods and relationships and draws attention to their relative
   absence in Australia.},

Title = {Cleavages - Dead and Gone? An Analysis of Cleavage Structure and Party
   Choice in Contemporary Finland},
Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {In cleavage research in political science, few studies have tested the
   applicability of a threefold cleavage strategy when analysing national
   cleavage structures. This study, which has contemporary Finland as a
   test case, makes two contributions in evaluating the continued relevance
   of cleavage research. First, it assesses both old and new social
   structural positions simultaneously in order to explore how they are
   reflected in the values and attitudes in the electorate. Second, it
   analyses how these cleavage elements are manifested in party choice and
   discovers whether value/attitudinal dimensions act as intermediate
   variables between social structural position and the vote. The
   statistical analyses are conducted with data from the Finnish National
   Election Studies from 2003-11. The results show that threefold cleavage
   definition is not satisfactory for identifying the dynamics in the
   party-voter-ties despite Finland often being regarded as the epitome of
   a cleavage-based system. The effect of social structural position on
   value/attitudinal dimensions is fairly weak and the effect of the social
   structural position on party choice is mediated through values and
   attitudes only in some cases. Even though the remnants of cleavage
   politics remain in Finland, with conflicts based on native language and
   type of residential area best fulfilling the cleavage criteria, the
   threefold cleavage does not serve to describe the whole complex set of
   political conflicts. Since Finland has had an archetypical status as a
   system of cleavage-based party support, further elaborations on
   cleavages are needed to understand the complexity of present conflict
   structures in any established Western democracy.},

Abstract = {The Cuentame! study interviewed 25 Spanish-speaking gay and bisexual men
   in Toronto. Their migration experiences are traversed by economic
   rationales, security concerns and the embodied experiences of race,
   gender, culture and sexuality. Most express narratives of empowered
   opportunity in distancing themselves from restrictive sexual regimes of
   their place of origin, but at the same time, many migrants trade a new
   sense of social acceptance as gay for marginalized statuses defined by
   diminished social and economic capital. The social participatory rights
   of citizenship are particularly affected by sexuality and social class.
   The need and desire to establish social and sexual connections in a new
   environment often characterized by economic vulnerability shape
   experiences of social capital and citizenship rights.},

Abstract = {Historically, judicial campaigns in America centered on candidate
   appeals to experience and expertise in the law. In more recent years,
   state supreme court campaigns have become more issue-based, representing
   a ``new style{''} campaign as termed by public law scholars. This study
   examines how voters respond to judicial candidates policy-based appeals
   versus traditional appeals to experience. Using an experiment embedded
   in the 2010 Cooperative Congressional Elections Study survey, we examine
   how these different messages affect the vote choice of individuals
   toward judicial candidates. Our results show that judicial voters do not
   react negatively to policy promises per se, as some public law scholars
   have feared. Rather, these voters respond favorably to specific issues
   when a judicial candidate promotes a position consistent with the
   voter's opinions. Interestingly, however, we find that some candidates
   benefit more from ``New Style{''} campaign messages than others.},

   Militarized Conflict, 1979-2010},

Abstract = {The recent years have witnessed a heated debate on China's rise. Using
   various theoretical arguments, existing research has generated quite
   divergent conclusions on whether China rises peacefully. Liberals argue
   that China has significantly benefited from the existing international
   economic system and therefore China is rising peacefully. On the other
   hand, realists such as John Mearsheimer argue that because China is
   likely to challenge the status quo, a rising China poses a threat to
   international security. Surprisingly, despite the ample scholarship on
   this topic and the existing divergent conclusions, a large-N empirical
   evaluation of China's rise is missing in the existing research. This
   study fills this important gap by providing a large-N empirical
   investigation of militarized interstate disputes between China and other
   states from 1979 to 2010. We find that although China's GDP, military
   spending, and CINC score have increased remarkably since the start of
   its economic reform, no empirical evidence points to more conflicts
   between China and other states. Furthermore, trade exerts only a weak
   effect on China's conflict, a surprising yet interesting finding that
   revises the conventional wisdom in the literature.},

Abstract = {Many citizens across the globe suffer domination and injustice in
   silence. It is not a silence of apathy or approval, but is another sort
   of silent citizenship born of deep inequality. This article attempts to
   come to terms with the global scope of silent citizenship as a form of
   domination that has become increasingly common among the worst-off in
   society. I argue that identifying problems of silent citizenship
   requires us to give priority to injustice over justice in future efforts
   to promote global justice. To illustrate how this might be done, I
   broaden the scope of republican theories of nondomination to consider
   how they might be applied to silent citizenship from a global
   perspective.},

Abstract = {This assay uses the cinema as an expression of culture that has the
   ability to portray different ways to build identities, to condense on an
   image different identities path. For example, in the film Machuca, we
   can see how political identities experience a social split; in Memoria
   del saqueo we can observe how social and political construction of an
   identity could be understood as a sign of the past that came back to the
   present; in Fresa y chocolate and also the films Santera, La estrategia
   del caracol and La ley de Herodes, we can observe the identity clash
   with the ``other{''}, that shapes and stressed that thing ``we{''} are;
   finally, a film is also becomes a field to think about identity
   construction process that open a new future like in Diario de
   motocicleta, or open the possibility to return to our old certainties
   like in El hijo de la novia.},

Abstract = {Social sciences have experienced the return of institutions into the
   main research agenda, and a new institutionalism has been developed to
   understand the role of institutions. The award of the 2009 Nobel Prize
   in Economics to the political scientist Elinor Ostrom for her ``analysis
   of economic governance, especially the commons{''} has promoted the
   recognition of modern institutional analysis and resized contemporary
   political economy. This paper is an integral approach to Ostrom's
   contributions and analyzes the evolution of her thinking throughout the
   major advances of her work over time. Her early contributions on public
   policy and polycentric systems, her seminal study on social norms in the
   governance of the commons, the focus on social capital and her
   multi-level framework of socio-ecological systems are her main
   contributions on polycentric governance.},

Abstract = {The aim of this short article is not to provide a summarized history of
   the constitutions but a history of constitutional thought in twentieth
   century Brazil. However, it cannot be denied that these perspectives
   tend to travel side by side. Moreover, it can be said that the history
   of this constitutional thought is also the history of the country's
   political thought. But this last coincidence is only partial. Since the
   beginning of the century (actually since Brazil's independence in 1822)
   until 1945, constitutional thought and political thought were largely
   coincidental. It is not by chance that the leading constitutional
   lawyers of this period were also the leading minds of Brazilian
   political thought. After 1945, however, there was a progressive
   distancing between political-institutional thought and constitutional
   thought. One trivial reason for this distancing is surely the fact that
   during the first period mentioned, the main (and at times the only)
   academic education available in the country was in law. But the simple
   increase in the opportunities for academic education does not appear to
   be a sufficient explanation for the gradual decrease in the role of
   jurists in the political and institutional debate. Although a
   comprehensive analysis of all the reasons that led to this decrease
   would go beyond the scope of this article, some of them will be analyzed
   here.},

Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},

Volume = {24},
Pages = {246-283},

Abstract = {In October 1906 GV Plekhanov sent a questionnaire to the leaders of
   international Social Democracy, formally requesting their opinion about
   the class character of the Russian revolution and the tactics which
   followed from this analysis for the Russian Social Democratic Labour
   Party. He received twelve responses, which overwhelmingly supported the
   Menshevik position: the Russian revolution is not socialist, at most it
   is bourgeois revolution with socialist elements; the boycott of the Duma
   is considered an error and cooperation with the parties of the bourgeois
   opposition, essential. The exception to this rule was the response of
   Karl Kautsky, which we have translated and edited for the first time in
   Spanish for this article. While Kautsky's answer is cautious and
   ambiguous enough so that both Lenin and Trotsky considered it as a
   confirmation of their theories, it categorically rejected the
   possibility of a coalition with the bourgeoisie, the posture favoured by
   Plekhanov, and therefore constitutes a clear refutation of the Menshevik
   prospects on the Russian revolution. Moreover, Trotsky, in the preface
   to the anthology In Defense of the Party, dated January 1, 1907, which
   we have also included in this article, referred to Kautsky's work as a
   vindication of his ideas on permanent revolution, as presented in his
   famous book Results and Prospects, originally published in 1906.},

Abstract = {Are the effects of candidate selection through party primaries largely
   disruptive for political parties or do they have some redeeming
   features? Icelandic parties have used inclusive nomination procedures
   since the early 1970s on a scale that is without parallel in other
   parliamentary democracies. The Icelandic primaries thus offer a unique
   opportunity to study the effects of primaries in a context that is quite
   distinct from the most studied primary election system, i.e. the United
   States, which is characterized by federalism, presidential government
   and two-party competition. Our findings indicate that, despite four
   decades of primaries, the Icelandic parties remain strong and cohesive
   organizations, suffering almost none of the ailments predicted by
   critics of primary elections. We are careful to point out, however, that
   context matters and the way parties have adapted also plays a role.},

Abstract = {Acquiescence response bias, or the tendency to agree with questions
   regardless of content, is a prominent concern in survey design. An often
   proposed solution, and one that was recently implemented in the American
   National Election Study, is to rewrite response options so that they tap
   directly into the dimensions of the construct of interest. However,
   there is little evidence that this solution improves data quality. We
   present a study in which we employ two waves of the 2012 American
   National Election Study in order to compare the reliability and
   concurrent validity of political efficacy questions in both the
   agree-disagree and construct-specific formats. Construct-specific
   questions were not only as reliable and valid as agree-disagree
   questions generally, they were also as valid among respondents that were
   most likely to acquiesce. This suggests two possible outcomes: Either
   agree-disagree questions do not negatively impact data quality or that
   construct-specific questions are not a panacea for acquiescence response
   bias.},

Abstract = {Lecture-capture software allows instructors to record their class
   presentations for students to review as necessary. Although this
   technology has long been considered too expensive for large-scale use,
   it is quickly becoming ubiquitous and deployable using ordinary
   computers and consumer-grade software. Using survey and final-grade data
   from a three-semester trial in a large introductory-level political
   science course, the authors demonstrate students almost universally
   approve of the technology and support its use in future classes.
   Students are most likely to use recordings when they study for exams and
   catch up on material after being absent from class. Additionally,
   certain subgroups-primarily international students and those who are
   performing poorly in the class-are more likely to watch archived
   recordings. However, these data demonstrate that positive evaluations
   and increased usage may not translate into better grades; viewing
   lectures does not appear to substantially improve individual
   performance.},

   peace agreements must contain prison sentences for guerrilla and must

   forgetfulness are not considered as political choices or the
   deactivation of the confrontation. The object of this study is to
   analyse peace dialogues process between the government and the guerrilla

   transitional justice must be. The article discusses the arguments of the
   FARC, the position of the government regarding to a final agreement and

Abstract = {Although environmental justice and conflict transformation have many
   common goals, they rarely talk to each other. In this article we try to
   bring these two bodies of knowledge closer with a discussion of the
   contributions that the theory and practice of conflict transformation
   offer to the field of environmental justice. In order to do so, it draws
   on an Environmental Conflict Transformation framework developed by Grupo
   Confluencias, a consortium of professionals from Latin America, who have
   been working since 2005 as a platform for deliberation, joint research
   and capacity building on this topic. Central to this framework is the
   focus on understanding the role that power dynamics and culture play in
   environmental conflicts and their transformation. We discuss this
   framework and its practical use in the light of ongoing experiences with
   indigenous peoples in Latin America, where Grupo Confluencias has been
   developing conflict transformation processes that seek to impact on
   hegemonic powers, in order to reduce the asymmetries and injustices that
   give rise to environmental conflicts. We emphasize, in particular, both
   the need and efficacy to create impacts, simultaneously or not, in three
   different spheres: people and networks, institutions and cultural power.
   We show that, through strengthening the power of agency of vulnerable

Abstract = {How do parties decide which issues to emphasize during electoral
   competition? We argue that the answer to this question depends on how
   parties of the left and of the right respond to economic inequality.
   Increasing inequality shifts the proportion of the population falling
   into lower socioeconomic categories, thereby increasing the size of the
   electoral constituency that is receptive toward leftist parties'
   redistributive economic appeals. In the face of rising inequality, then,
   leftist parties will emphasize economic issues in their manifestos. By
   contrast, the nonredistributive economic policies often espoused by
   rightist parties will not appeal to this burgeoning constituency.
   Rather, we argue, rightist parties will opt to emphasize values-based
   issues, especially in those cases where social demand in the electorate
   for values-based representation is high. We find support for these
   relationships with hierarchical regression models that draw from data
   across hundreds of parties in a diverse set of the world's democracies.},

Abstract = {Cultural Diplomacy as an element of foreign policy has been used by a
   variety of States in order to obtain prestige and create a positive
   image of their countries. The success of this strategy has been also
   used in the international relations of countries seeking to generate
   sympathy and appreciation to their national causes. An example of the
   latter is the case of Quebec that through its foreign relations has used
   Cultural Diplomacy manoeuvres to promote its distinct character as a
   nation within Canadian federation. In this sense, the article highlights
   the role of cultural factor in Quebec's international relations to
   emphasize the distinct character of Quebec's society rather than
   emphasize the internal competences of their international relations.},

Volume = {68},

Abstract = {Former military service has long been considered a plus for the resume
   of a political candidate, presumably because voters may rely on this
   information as a shortcut by which to make inferences about the
   candidates and cast ballots accordingly. Previous research has
   demonstrated that such heuristics frequently affect vote decisions, but
   few studies have examined the impact of candidates' military background
   on support at the polls; moreover, existing research is largely
   observational, leaving open crucial questions about causal impact. We
   build on this work by conducting an original survey experiment imbedded
   in a national survey in 2008 to test the effects of labeling a candidate
   an Iraq War veteran. Formulating our hypotheses from known issue and
   trait stereotypes of the military, we demonstrate that military
   experience can be helpful to some candidates under some conditions. The
   experimental evidence we present shows that stereotypes based on both
   issue position (military intervention) and issue ownership (Republican
   ties) matter to voters facing a military candidate, but only when that
   candidate is a Democrat. The results we report support the notion that
   voters rely on information shortcuts, but we find that there is
   considerable heterogeneity in the impact of heuristics.},

Title = {Choosing whom to betray: populist right-wing parties, welfare state
   reforms and the trade-off between office and votes},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {This article analyses the impact of populist right-wing parties (PRWPs)
   on welfare state reforms in Western Europe in the light of the trade-off
   that they face between office and votes. On the one hand, PRWPs appeal
   to traditionally left-leaning blue-collar `insiders' supportive of
   social insurance schemes. On the other hand, they have only been able to
   take part in government as junior coalition partners with liberal or
   conservative parties who are more likely to retrench these very same
   welfare programmes. In this context, the article argues that these
   parties have to choose between betraying their electorate (and losing
   votes), and betraying their coalition partners (and losing office). When
   they choose office, it enables welfare state retrenchment by allowing
   their coalition partners to curtail left-wing opposition, but entails
   high electoral costs for PRWPs. When they choose votes, it generates
   deadlock and potentially jeopardizes their participation in government.
   The paper draws on a comparative analysis of pension reforms during
   three periods of government participation of PRWPs: the Schussel I and
   II cabinets in Austria (2000-06), the Rutte I cabinet in the Netherlands
   (2010-12) and three pension reforms in Switzerland between 1995 and
   2010. The analysis draws on original primary material and interviews.},

Abstract = {In this article, we use a new data set describing governments, political
   parties and institutions to make an explicit comparison between Western
   Europe (WE) and Central Eastern Europe (CEE) in the investigation of
   three different topical issues found in the coalition literature,
   namely, coalition formation (that is, which factors affect who forms the
   winning coalitions), the number of cabinet members (that is, what
   affects the number of ministers in a cabinet) and cabinet duration (that
   is, which factors affect how long a new government lasts). Our findings
   indicate that, regardless of all the discussions about how CEE is
   different from WE because of the post-communist heritage or the
   volatility of voters in the CEE region, structural attributes such as
   the size and number of political parties are important determinants of
   coalition formation and cabinet duration patterns in both the West and
   the East. In fact, precisely because of the unsettled nature of CEE
   party politics, structural attributes tend to matter even more in the
   East.},

Title = {Preference for radical right-wing populist parties among

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {21},

Pages = {367-380},

Abstract = {The literature on authoritarianism and exclusive forms of nationalism
   often implies that authoritarian and exclusive-nationalist individuals
   will prefer radical right-wing populist parties such as Austria's FPo.
   The theoretical case for such implications appears sound as party
   programmes for radical right-wing populist parties invoke rhetoric that
   should appeal to individuals with either of these characteristics. To
   date, these implications have not been examined. This article examines
   quantitative survey data from five Western European countries with
   electorally viable radical right-wing populist parties to determine
   whether radical right-wing populist parties are preferred by
   authoritarians and/or exclusive-nationalists. Analyses indicate that the
   radical right-wing populist parties studied here are consistently
   preferred by exclusive-nationalist individuals, though not necessarily
   to all other parties, but only inconsistently preferred by authoritarian
   individuals. While more nuanced investigation is still needed, it is
   clear that, contrary to the assumptions in the authoritarianism
   literature, radical right-wing populist parties cannot always rely on
   authoritarian individuals for support.},

Abstract = {This study explores the financialisation of sovereign debt through an
   in-depth study of institutional change in German debt management.
   Between 1998 and 2006, the Ministry of Finance fundamentally altered the
   management of federal public debt by not only disempowering the
   Bundesbank and Federal Debt Administration as debt managers and
   outsourcing this task to a new agency, the Federal Finance Agency;
   moreover, the conservative debt strategy was replaced by strict market
   orientation. Conceptualising this change as institutional innovation,
   the paper argues that the Ministry of Finance played a leading role in
   the reform process. It shows that the arrival of the Euro brought with
   it a power struggle between the Ministry and the Bundesbank. The
   evidence fits better the concept of institutional innovation as a result
   of entrepreneurship than approaches which conceptualise institutional
   innovations as consequences of profit maximisation or layering and
   displacement.},

Abstract = {This paper documents the reallocation of financial and economic
   resources after political violence to other countries. It analyzes the
   impact of 66 political violence events that took place in 32 countries
   on 57 stock exchanges over a period of 20 years. Using the event study
   methodology, this paper is the first to document a positive financial
   impact from political violence in other countries. The results show that
   in globally integrated markets, the substitution of financial and
   economic activities away from afflicted countries magnifies their
   losses. On average over a 20 day window, event countries suffered a
   2.9\% drop in stock valuation while other countries picked a windfall of
   0.8\%. Additionally, the paper investigates the geographic, economic,
   and risk determinants of this cross-border flow of capital.},

Abstract = {How did gays in the military go from being characterized as dangerous
   perverts threatening the state to potential heroes fighting on behalf of
   the state? Numerous studies have identified various legal and political
   conditions that can account for resistance to this change. This article
   explores popular culture as a contributor to public understanding that,
   in turn, supported these political developments. Using the James Bond
   film series to track shifts in public understanding of gender and
   sexuality norms, I argue that such developments can be seen as a
   contributing factor leading to lifting the ban on gays in the military,
   an important step in a classic civil rights narrative in the United
   States in which the interests of a previously excluded minority group
   and the liberal state gradually converge, leading to greater political
   inclusion overtime. I conclude by suggesting that popular culture
   analysis may also provide the basis for a more critical civil rights
   narrative that reveals persistent divergences between state and minority
   group interests, highlighting an ongoing basis for dissent from state
   power.},

Abstract = {Social trust ameliorates collective action problems by allowing
   multicultural societies to adopt more inclusive and equitable public
   policies directed toward newly arriving immigrants. However, existing
   research warns that increasing ethnic diversity from immigrant
   populations can undermine levels of social trust, hindering mass support
   for redistributive policies that empower low-income minority
   populations. This article examines the relationship between U.S.
   state-level social trust and immigrant access to social welfare programs
   using multilevel regression with post-stratification to estimate
   state-level attitudes of distrust. Distrust is found to be associated
   with reduced immigrant access to redistributive social programs, such as
   Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Supplemental Security Income,
   and Medicaid. Interestingly, patterns of distrust and strict immigrant
   welfare exclusion are more pronounced among low immigrant Southern
   states, while high immigrant states exhibit relatively inclusive and
   accommodative policies.},

Number = {2},
Pages = {357-371},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Why do some politicians tolerate the violation of the law? In contexts
   where the poor are the primary violators of property laws, I argue that
   the answer lies in the electoral costs of enforcement: Enforcement can
   decrease support from poor voters even while it generates support among
   nonpoor voters. Using an original data set on unlicensed street vending
   and enforcement operations at the subcity district level in three Latin
   American capital cities, I show that the combination of voter
   demographics and electoral rules explains enforcement. Supported by
   qualitative interviews, these findings suggest how the intentional
   nonenforcement of law, or forbearance, can be an electoral strategy.
   Dominant theories based on state capacity poorly explain the results.},

Abstract = {The main goal in this analysis is to explore the principal theories
   regarding nationalism and ethnicity. With that purpose in mind, this
   work will explore the most relevant contributions to the study of their
   emergence, evolution and possible manifestations. Thus, this work
   addresses the most representative theories in the subfield and considers
   specifically the interdisciplinariety that is inherent to the
   understanding of this phenomenon. A chronological approach is proposed
   here, which in addition allows us to incorporate the most recent
   researches alongside with the classical works. To incorporate the
   dynamic component in the field is therefore relevant, since new studies
   are produced even nowadays, establishing a dialogue between them and
   with the pioneer works. A central conclusion in this article is that
   these theories display all their potential when they are considered as
   complementary rather than as exclusively rivals.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that since the 1990s the welfare state has been
   transformed into a workfare state. It proposes a stylized framework to
   understand the influence of unemployment on inequality and the effects
   of labor market policy. Using this framework, the paper shows that the
   transformation of the welfare state has made the effects of unemployment
   more inegalitarian. I analyze OECD data on inequality and redistribution
   from the mid-1970s to the late 2000s and provide preliminary but
   systematic regression results. They suggest that the generosity of labor
   market policy promoted higher levels of market income equality only
   during the traditional welfare period. They also suggest that the
   responsiveness of redistribution to unemployment has become weaker in
   the era of workfare.},
