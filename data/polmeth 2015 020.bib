Abstract = {ObjectiveWe model Pickett's Charge at the Battle of Gettysburg to see
   whether the Confederates could have achieved victory by committing more
   infantry, executing a better barrage, or facing a weaker defense.
   MethodsOur mathematical modeling is based on Lanchester equations,
   calibrated using historical army strengths. We weight the Union
   artillery and infantry two different ways using two sources of data, and
   so have four versions of the model.
   ResultsThe models estimate that a successful Confederate charge would
   have required at least one to three additional brigades. An improved
   artillery barrage would have reduced these needs by about one brigade. A
   weaker Union defense could have allowed the charge to succeed as
   executed.
   ConclusionsThe Confederates plausibly had enough troops to take the
   Union position and alter the battle's outcome, but likely too few to
   further exploit such a success.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Objective: I hypothesize that individuals with depression lack the
   motivation and physical capacity required to participate in politics due
   to somatic problems and feelings of hopelessness and apathy.
   Furthermore, I hypothesize that depression in adolescence can have
   negative downstream consequences for participation in young adulthood.
   Method: Using the 1998 General Social Survey and the National
   Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, I employ logistic regression
   and mediation analysis to test the relationship between depression and
   voting as well as adolescent depression and political participation.
   Results: The results show that both depression and adolescent depression
   reduce the probability of political participation. The effect of
   adolescent depression on political participation is mediated by
   educational attainment and partisan affiliation. Conclusion: Depression
   reduces participation and merits further attention as a political
   phenomenon. The possibility of depression as a disability is discussed,
   including potential efforts to boost participation among this group.},

Title = {What Explains the Gender Gap in Schlepping? Testing Various Explanations
   for Gender Differences in Household-Serving Travel},

Abstract = {Objectives. Many gender differences in travel have begun to converge.
   Has convergence occurred for household-serving travel, which constitutes
   a very large and growing share of all trips? Moreover, what explains the
   division of household-serving travel in heterosexual couples? In
   answering these questions, we test the salience of three theories about
   the gendered division of household labor: (1) time availability, (2)
   microeconomic, and (3) gender socialization. Methods. Using data from
   the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) from 2003 to 2012, we calculated the
   female-to-male ratio of household-serving trips in several types of
   households (i.e., singles vs. couples and male vs. female breadwinner
   households). Results. There was some empirical support for each theory,
   but we find the most consistent and compelling evidence for gender
   socialization. We observe substantial gender differences in child-and
   household-serving trips apart from household formation; even in
   households where women earn more, are better educated, or work more
   hours than their partners, women still make about half again as many
   child-serving and grocery-shopping trips as their male partners.
   Conclusion. Despite dramatic changes in women's labor force
   participation over the past half-century, the gender division of
   household-serving travel remains strong.},

Abstract = {A peculiar monetary institution emerged during the period of interregnum
   in Somalia from January 1991 to August 2012. Without a functioning
   government to restrict the supply of notes in circulation, Somalis found
   it profitable to contract with foreign printers and import forgeries.
   The exchange value of the largest denomination Somali shillings note
   fell from US \$0.30 in 1991 to US \$0.03 in 2008. However, the
   purchasing power eventually stabilized at the cost of producing
   additional notes.},

Abstract = {Voters are often trusting of elections, but distrustful of government.
   We test whether voter confidence represents a different measure of
   system support from trust in government and external efficacy.
   Theoretically, we describe the inherent differences in these measures as
   one reason to suspect they are so. Empirically, we consider frequency
   distributions, crosstabs, exploratory factor analysis, reliability
   tests, and regression analysis to determine the independent validity of
   each system support measure. We find strong theoretical and empirical
   evidence to support that voter confidence is different from other system
   support measures previously studied and examined. As such, it is an
   important new area of scholarship.},

Abstract = {Since the late 1950s, when Americans completed their military bases in
   Spain, U.S. officials knew they were caught in the middle of an almost
   impossible dilemma: they had to maintain their collaboration with the
   Francoist regime, while fostering relations with some opposition groups
   that could have a voice in a post-Franco Spain. In the 1960s, American
   officials and local technocrats found common ground in the formula
   modernization and development'. The Spanish authorities understood the
   need for reforms in the fields of education and science, in order to
   sustain short and long-term economic growth. To implement them the
   country required more and better instructed technicians able to direct
   the country's modernization. The U.S. government, always looking for
   soft-power ways of influencing the evolution of Spanish society, saw the
   situation as an opportunity to achieve its goals while downplaying
   America's identification with Francoism in the eyes of the `leaders of
   the future'. The support of U.S. officials to the reformist General Law
   of Education of 1970 became the last chapter in the fine line American
   Public Diplomacy had to walk between its association with the Spanish
   regime and its support for democratic changes.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveFew issues in athletics today receive more attention than drug
   and alcohol usage, especially when it comes to college athletics. We
   seek to address self-report biases related to drug usage and heavy
   drinking.
   MethodsWe employ an experimental measurement technique.
   ResultsOur results suggest that a greater percentage of student-athletes
   from a major conference knowingly engage in these two behaviors than
   self-reports indicate. Specifically, we find 37 percent of respondents
   seem to have taken banned performance-enhancing drugs (compared to 4.9
   percent who directly admit to doing so when asked), and 46 percent seem
   to have consumed more than five drinks in a week (compared to about 3
   percent who openly admit to doing so).
   ConclusionsWe provide evidence for the extent of self-underreporting
   when it comes to drug and alcohol usage among college athletes. That
   said, future work is needed to accurately pinpoint specific substances
   and the frequency with which they are taken; for example, it could be
   the percentage of individuals using banned substances stems from
   consuming significant concentrations of caffeine (e.g., multiple cups of
   coffee).},

Abstract = {We present a formal model of intra-party politics to explain candidate
   selection within political parties. We think of parties as heterogeneous
   groups of individuals who aim to implement a set of policies but who
   differ in their priorities. When party heterogeneity is too great,
   parties are in danger of splitting into smaller yet more homogeneous
   political groups. In this context we argue that primaries can have a
   unifying role if the party elite cannot commit to policy concessions.
   Our model shows how three factors interact to create incentives for the
   adoption of primary elections, namely (1) the alignment in the preferred
   policies of various factions within a party, (2) the relative weight of
   each of these factions and (3) the electoral system. We discuss the
   existing empirical literature and demonstrate how existing studies can
   be improved in light of our theoretical predictions to provide a new,
   structured perspective on the adoption of primary elections.},

Abstract = {This article discusses changes to what were seen by government planners
   as out-dated British and American propaganda systems following 9/11 and
   the Iraq War. It presents qualitative research examining how government
   propaganda strategies responded to global asymmetric threats in a
   post-9/11 media environment. The article draws on both documentary
   evidence and the accounts of elite sources from Britain and the United
   States including Public Relations professionals, journalists, and
   foreign policy, defense, and intelligence personnel. Recently, the
   intelligence contractor Edward Snowden revealed the extent to which the
   speed of adaptation in surveillance practices has left policy and
   oversight behind, raising concern over ethics, privacy, and
   transparency. The article will explore an adaptation of propaganda
   systems that also occurred unhindered by public debate. It will show how
   U.S. and U.K. Governments believed existing propaganda systems were not
   responding to the information environment and discusses legal,
   structural, and cultural issues in propaganda practices, post-9/11.
   Planners assisted in gradually changing structures and cultures of
   propaganda in both countries for reasons of operational effectiveness.
   The Anglo-American relationship will be highlighted as one tool capable
   of overcoming obstacles or restrictions in propaganda for purposes of
   counterterrorism. Interviews indicated that this was enabled by the
   countries' different capabilities and weak legislative restrictions,
   which some highlighted as advantageous to planning. The article will
   consider the resilience of U.S./U.K. restrictions and governance of
   propaganda, highlighting areas for concern.},

Abstract = {The essay explores the implications of a new campaign launched by the
   Soviet authorities against violent youth behaviour, especially amongst
   working-class youngsters, after Stalin's death in 1953. Relying largely
   on official sources from the archives, newspapers and other
   publications, and also on personal sources such as interviews and
   memoirs, the study explores what the new campaign reveals about everyday
   working-class youth violence in the post-Stalin Soviet Union. The new
   initiative represented part of a broader Thaw-era endeavour to
   reinvigorate the attempt to construct a socialist version of modernity,
   specifically by reforming the population's everyday way of life, in a
   fashion perceived as helping to create model citizens, New Soviet
   People'. The findings contribute to a recent re-evaluation of the Thaw
   as a time not only of liberalizing reforms, but also of new coercive
   elements. Further, working-class violence reveals the extent of class
   differences in the supposedly classless Soviet Union, with working-class
   youth behaviour departing from the official model of normative conduct,
   predicated upon middle-class standards. The article focuses on male
   violence in particular, providing a glimpse of a working-class
   masculinity that is at variance with the officially prescribed model of
   socialist masculinity. By showing the frequency of collective violence
   amongst young workers, the author also questions the official
   discourse's frequent depictions of collectivism as a panacea for
   delinquency. Nonetheless, this account does not equate worker violence
   with conscious opposition to the government. Instead, it positions such
   behaviour within a wider context of the traditional working-class male
   youth milieu.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThe 1966 gubernatorial campaign provides an interesting
   retrospective examination of Georgia politics during a period of seismic
   change that included the dawn of two-party competition, black
   enfranchisement, and legislative determination of the chief executive.
   MethodThis article provides an empirical evaluation of the 1966
   gubernatorial election in Georgia, including action that occurred in the
   General Assembly following the election.
   ResultsOur findings clearly define the various coalitions supporting the
   three gubernatorial candidates and also explain why the plurality
   popular winner loses the legislative vote.
   ConclusionThe 1966 election is not only interesting as a case study in
   its own right, but one that had a major impact on two-party politics and
   legislative-executive relations in Georgia for decades to come.},

Title = {Homeland, territory, property: Contesting land, state, and nation in
   urban Timor-Leste},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {This article considers contestations over land, state and nation in
   Aitarak Laran, an urban settlement in post-independence Timor-Leste.
   Since 2010 the settlement has been resisting eviction by the East
   Timorese state, which wishes to use the land it occupies to build a
   National Library and Cultural Centre. In exploring the contestation, the
   purpose of this article is two-fold. Firstly, it explores the nature of
   social connection to land within postcolonial state- and
   nation-building. Here, the contestation at Aitarak Laran reveals
   counter-posed imaginings of land as homeland, territory and property.
   Secondly, the article draws out the implications of these counter-posed
   imaginings for thinking about the `right to the city', a notion first
   theorised by Lefebvre (1996 {[}1968]) and subsequently developed to
   encompass a range of modes of urban protest. In the settlement, the
   promises of independence unity, equivalence, and inclusion within the
   sovereign nation-state are at odds with residents experiences of what
   independence has in fact brought. Land, in its multiple imaginings,
   becomes a crucible upon which this painful disjuncture plays out.
   Reading Aitarak Laran as an instance of `right to the city' struggle,
   these tensions emerge as well not only in practice but also in theory,
   reflected particularly in the limitations and ambiguities of rights
   discourse. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article maps the prospects of crowdsourcing technologies in the
   area of corruption reporting. Despite a flurry of initiatives and media
   hype in this area leading to hopes of an effective tackling of
   corruption, the potential of crowdsourcing has so far been mainly
   approached from a technology-centric perspective. Where challenges are
   identified and worked on they are primarily technical and managerial in
   nature, such as challenges of privacy protection, data management,
   information validation, and fundraising. However, little attention has
   been paid to insights from a growing body of multidisciplinary
   literature on how corruption works, how it can be tackled, and more
   generally how observed logics of collective action and social
   mobilization interact with technological affordances to condition the
   success of these efforts. Linking the technology-centric experience of
   crowdsourcing more closely to our evolving understanding of corruption
   makes it possible to move beyond common-sense conjectures in this area,
   to identify some little-discussed challenges, and develop some fresh
   ideas around the future of crowdsourcing corruption.},

Abstract = {This is an essay review of the literature on utility maximization as a
   managerial objective in pro team sports. It ends up that there is a
   heretofore-unrecognized parallel development of the idea, in English
   football by Sloane {[}Scottish Journal of Political Economy (1971), 17,
   121] and in North American pro sports by Quirk and El Hodiri, presented
   in that same year but not published as a conference proceeding until
   1974. I review these works and place the rest of the extant literature
   chronologically, noting their level of generality along a couple of
   dimensions. I also observe a lack of a clear reference lineage in this
   literature and suggest one. Adopting it should aid future researchers
   who are trying to place their work in the context of this literature.

Abstract = {Beside the competitive balance or the relative quality of teams in a
   sports league, also a league's absolute quality matters to attract
   spectators. If the absolute quality depends among other variables, on
   the total budget of the league, it can be shown that that revenue
   sharing enhances the absolute quality by improving the allocation of
   talent over the teams in both a profit- and a win-maximisation league,
   even if it worsens the competitive balance.},

Abstract = {This chapter considers events and developments from 2009 onwards. It
   looks at the emergence and growth of the Tea Party movement, the ideas
   and constituencies upon which it drew, the impact of the 2010 mid-term
   elections, the tensions between the movement and Republican Party
   elites, and the character of the relationship between the Right and the
   institutional landscape. Following the approach adopted in other
   chapters, it argues that both policy and policy outcomes were largely
   shaped by processes of interaction between these different elements.},

Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the possible impacts of the fully-funded (FF)
   pension system (the so-called Chilean model), which was introduced in
   the Czech Republic in 2012, on future pensions of contributors to the
   system and on state expenditures related to the pension system reform.
   The author performed calculations for 3 model examples of individuals
   who would participate solely in the FF and also of individuals who would
   contribute to both the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) and the FF during their
   lives. The calculations in all model examples were made for 4 average
   real annual interest rates and for 4 standardised income levels. The
   income replacement rates of the examined individuals were compared with
   the existing PAYG and with a hypothetical balanced PAYG. The aim was to
   determine the minimum rate of the pension funds' appreciation from which
   the transition to the FF would be profitable for all examined
   individuals. The article also attempts to identify the duration of the
   transition period, the moment after which the FF would become
   budget-neutral, and the approximate cost of the transition process.},

Abstract = {This review-essay analyses John Beverley's post-subalternist perspective
   on the intertwinement of theoretical discourse and politics - so-called
   Latinamericanism - in the Latin American context. This conjuncture is
   characterised by the marea rosada, or pink tide, of moderate leftist
   governments. I contend that Beverley grasps the change introduced by
   this trend and lucidly criticises the neoconservative, moderate, and
   deficient political implications of different theoretical views. This
   contribution notwithstanding, I argue that Beverley's theoretical
   project fails effectively to conceptualise this political tide as an
   object of theoretical inquiry: namely, to grapple with the marea
   rosada's Latinamericanism as a populist political logic that
   simultaneously neutralises and drives socialist transformation.},

Journal = {INTERSECTIONS-EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {1},

Pages = {55-77},
Abstract = {The most stigmatised area of Budapest, the Eighth District (Jozsefvaros)
   has been undergoing significant urban and social change since 1989.
   However, compared with what rent gap theory would have forecast,
   gentrification took off relatively late. After a historical narrative of
   how rent gap in Jozsefvaros had been produced throughout the 20th
   century, we will argue that examining the mechanisms and outcomes of the
   three dominant dynamics of rescaling urban governance in Hungary -
   decentralisation without the redistribution of resources in the 1990s;
   EU accession and Europeanisation of public policies from the 2000s; and
   recentralisation after 2010 - help us understand when, where and how
   gentrification has been unwinding in Middle-JOzsefvaros, the most
   dilapidated area of the Eighth District. The article will present three
   case studies of local urban regeneration as paradigmatic for the three
   rescaling dynamics. Corvin Promenade, Magdolna Quarter Programme, and
   the ongoing Orczy Quarter project. It will show the underlying
   revanchist policies and discourses in each case. The main aim of the
   current paper is to illustrate how a scale-sensitive political economic
   approach can go beyond the mainstream public and political discourse in
   scrutinising gentrification, through shedding light on structural
   factors contributing to exclusion, criminalisation, displacement, and
   othering.},

Title = {Social Movement Studies for East Central Europe? The Challenge of a
   Time-Space Bias on Postwar Western Societies},
Journal = {INTERSECTIONS-EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {1},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {16-36},
Abstract = {The paper claims that through its genealogy, Social Movement Studies
   (SMS) as a discipline incorporated a time-space bias on postwar Western
   affluent societies which defined the way it conceived of movements and
   their socio-institutional contexts. Two interrelated effects of that
   bias were the assumption that material claims belong to the past, and a
   focus on short-term contextual factors in movement dynamics. As a new
   wave of movements after 2008 raise material claims in Western contexts
   again, earlier frameworks of SMS are being transformed so as to capture
   the relationship of movements to long-term structural processes.
   However, a newly forming consensus that links new movements to the
   ``crisis of democratic capitalism{''} seems to maintain the bias on
   Western experience. East Central European (ECE) countries, where
   austerity and democratization came hand in hand after 1990, hardly fit
   that picture. The paper asks whether new transformations within SMS, and
   an increased attention toward ECE movements due to their new
   proliferation provides a possibility for comparative perspectives beyond
   the time-space bias. It identifies a tendency in SMS of post-socialism
   to translate the time-space bias of SMS frameworks into a normative
   framework of development toward Western models (or lack thereof), which
   worked to obscure the long-term history of movements in ECE, as well as
   forms of popular politics and state-society relations different from
   Western models. The paper proposes a world-systems approach to the task
   of comparative understanding of movements in different contexts, and
   illustrates its possible gains through the conceptualization of new
   middle class movements in ECE.},

Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},

Abstract = {The paper uses Heckman correction to estimate gravity models of trade of
   the Czech and Slovak Republics for the period 1995-2012. Additionally,
   separate gravity models are estimated for 4-year panels of the period
   using Tobit method. The research shows that importance of common border
   for the countries' bilateral trade with third countries has been
   gradually declining. This is in line with accelerating globalization and
   lower shipping prices. On the other hand, contrary to expectations
   importance of distance in bilateral trade has not been decreasing; it
   appears that the so-called ``distance puzzle{''} is present in the Czech
   and Slovak Republics. The model also confirms that membership in the
   European Union is an important determinant of bilateral trade its
   statistical significance has been detected since 2004.},

Title = {A Right-wing Extremist or People's Protector? Media Coverage of Extreme
   Right Leader Marian Kotleba in 2013 Regional Elections in Slovakia},
Journal = {INTERSECTIONS-EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2015},

Abstract = {The paper focuses on the coverage of the extreme right leader Marian
   Kotleba in the media during the 2013 regional elections in Slovakia. It
   examines how the media shaped the discourse regarding Kotleba in a
   six-week period, covering the time before and after the elections.
   Applying the frame analysis, it identifies ten issue-specific frames
   that problematize Kotleba in relation to either his general political
   actions or the regional elections and analyses 359 articles, leading to
   1095 claims made by various sources. The findings show that the extreme
   right politician was mainly framed in terms of extremist threat and the
   failure of authorities. However, although the prevalent framing in the
   media may be perceived as negative, the media attention for the leader
   radically increased after the elections' first round, making Kotleba
   highly salient in the public debate, while the counter-frames appealing
   to legitimate side of politician's candidacy can be observed. The paper
   contributes to the literature on the media representation of the extreme
   right in Central and Eastern Europe.},

Abstract = {The implementation of the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base
   (hereinafter as CCCTB) system will have the impact on the distribution
   of group tax bases across the EU, for the draft of CCCTB directive
   includes also the suggestion of allocation formula, based on which the
   group tax base should be allocated. As a consequence of this, it will
   also generate impact on tax revenues of individual EU Member States. The
   aim of the paper is to identify whether the implementation of CCCTB will
   result into the decrease or increase of corporate tax base in the Czech
   Republic in comparison with present situation - i.e. in situation when
   no group taxation or consolidation regimes are allowed in the Czech
   Republic. The results shows that Czech Republic would gain in the
   situation when CCCTB would be implemented in EU28, for its total
   allocated tax base would increase by 11,61\%.},

Abstract = {How does gender equity fare in the digital public sphere(s)? To
   understand the mechanism of the gender gap, this study analyzes the
   interaction of gender with class, age, and parenthood. With American
   national survey data, this research compares different types of online
   content production practices in this blurred digital public sphere(s).
   Findings show differences between men and women in five of six digital
   content creation activities. Women are more likely to consume online
   content; men are more likely to produce it. From more public blogging to
   more private chatting, inequality persists. Interactions with gender
   show (1) women from higher educational levels face more inequality
   compared to their male counterparts than do women from lower educational
   levels; (2) age is not a factor in the gender gap; and (3) generally,
   parental status fails to explain the production divide. Understanding
   the gender gap and its mechanisms can help ameliorate inequalities. Some
   argue that the Internet is a more egalitarian public platform for women
   while others find gender inequality. But neither body of research has
   attended to the blurring of the public and private spheres on the
   Internet.},

Volume = {40},
Number = {B, SI},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The vintage political business cycle framework of Nordhaus (1975)
   represents the idea that the macroeconomic business cycle is manipulated
   opportunistically by an incumbent government to achieve re-election. A
   key assumption in this prototypical framework is that voters discount
   their memories about unemployment and inflation at a constant rate. Yet
   starting with Ebbinghaus (1885) and Jost (1897), a large body of
   research in psychology documents an empirical regularity that has come
   to be known as Jost's Second Law of Forgetting individuals discount
   recent memories at a higher rate compared to the rate at which they
   discount older memories. I find that incorporating this insight from
   psychology (i.e., hyperbolic memory discounting) into the benchmark
   framework moderates the amplitude of the predicted political business
   cycle. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Recent studies suggest psychological differences between conservatives
   and liberals, including that conservatives are more overconfident. We
   use a behavioral political economy model to show that while this is
   undoubtedly true for election years in the current era, there is no
   reason to believe that conservative ideologies are intrinsically linked
   to overconfidence. Indeed, it appears that in 1980 and before,
   conservatives and liberals were equally overconfident. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {The revival of classical liberal thought has reignited a debate about
   economic freedom and social justice. Classical liberals claim to defend
   expansive economic freedom, while their critics wish to restrict this
   freedom for other values. However, there are two problems with the role
   economic freedom' plays in this debate: inconsistency in the use of the
   concept and indeterminacy with respect to its definition. Inconsistency
   in the use of the concept freedom' has mistakenly made a certain kind of
   left-wing' critique of poverty, and of markets generally, appear to be a
   concern with inequality in means to enjoy freedom, not with freedom
   itself. Indeterminacy about which beings and doings the basic liberties
   protect misrepresents the left-wing position as about something other
   than economic freedom. Inconsistency and indeterminacy lead to
   artificial narrowness in current debates and to a failure to see that
   disagreement is based not just on moral differences but also on
   conceptual confusion. This confusion leads both classical liberals and
   their critics to claim more than they may legitimately do, and to ignore
   a position that accepts the standard of definition of freedom but
   arrives at different institutional conclusions about what secures that
   freedom.},

Abstract = {The 2008 Plan de carriere enabled a newly recruited Maitres de
   Conferences (equivalent Assistant Professor) salary revaluing as well as
   a significant increase in promotion numbers, which translated into a new
   flattening of the hierarchies for research professors. The
   reconstruction of each of the promoted professors from the section 5
   (economics), on the 2009-2014 period enables an apprehension of the
   global and individual effects of this increase in promotion numbers.
   This has reduced the overload in the sub rank 1, enabled a better
   fluidity from the sub rank 2 to the sub rank 3, population of which has
   more than doubled, creating an stranglehold when going up to the sub
   rank 4. To understand the effects at the individual level, we offer two
   measures of net gains obtained from each promoted professors. The
   demographic analysis of the promoted shows that those who were rewarded
   by the national committee (CNU) are in average younger than those going
   through the local committees. The dispersion of the age of the
   national,committee promoted varies a lot from one mandate to the other.},

Abstract = {Objective. Immigration and the economy were the most salient issues in
   British politics at the 2010 general election, yet the relationship
   between them remains unclear. This article questions whether perception
   of the economic situation influenced hostility to immigration to Britain
   during the 2010 general election campaign. Method. This article employs
   a logistic regression model using the 2010 British Election Study to
   test the effect of economic perception and other previously identified
   factors on hostility to immigration. Results. The results show that
   perception of the economy did have an effect on hostility to immigration
   at the 2010 British general election. However, the effect is negligible.
   Conclusion. The findings highlight the influence of other factors in
   predicting hostility to immigration, particularly identity and culture,
   party identification, and policy-based factors. The prominence of
   analyzing the effect of economic concerns in determining attitudes to
   immigration appears misplaced.},

Abstract = {Scholars have widely demonstrated that the process by which officials
   frame their communications significantly impacts how citizens
   understand, evaluate, and respond to policy issues or events. This study
   attempts to build on existing framing research in two important ways.
   First, we seek to illuminate the importance of cultural resonance in
   determining whether an individual frame is likely to gain acceptance
   among its intended audience. Second, we assess the impact of frame
   contestation on the adoption of such frames. We explore these dynamics
   in the context of the U.S. war in Afghanistan. Specifically, we
   conducted an experiment in which U.S. adults were exposed to a news
   story about U.S. military transgressions in Afghanistan. Our results
   indicate that frames, designed to appeal to and protect the national
   identity, broadly resonated among respondents, impacting their
   perceptions of the character, causes and consequences of the
   transgressions, as well as their broader attitudes about the nation, the
   U.S. military, and the war in Afghanistan. Nonetheless, when these
   frames were presented, and then explicitly contested within the same
   news story, it diminishedbut not entirelythese framing effects. We
   reflect on the theoretical and practical implications of these findings
   for journalists, officials, and the broader public.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of a supermajority rule on the law of
   1/n, which posits that a larger number of districts increases the size
   of government. Our analysis suggests that supermajority rule, despite
   the claim that it restrains excessive spending, increases the 1/n
   effect, because qualified majorities require logrolling to attract
   additional members. Using data from US states from 1970 to 2007, we find
   that the adoption of a supermajority rule has a robust, worsening effect
   on the fiscal commons problem identified by the law of 1/n.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveWith the proliferation of new data sets and measures of
   identity-based diversity, especially regarding ethnicity, it is
   essential that scholars who use these data sets on ethnicity understand
   their theoretical underpinnings, as well as their points of convergence
   and divergence.
   MethodsWe conduct a review of existing cross-national measures of ethnic
   diversity.
   ResultsDifferent data sets involve inclusion boundaries for groups that
   vary drastically, and operationalize the relationship between the
   enumerated groups and outcomes of interest in ways that have often
   unacknowledged theoretical implications.
   ConclusionsWe describe the advantages and disadvantages of different
   data sets, and build on this description to point toward future
   directions in assessing the relationship between diversity and social
   phenomena, specifically focusing on the mechanisms that link groups to
   these outcomes. We also provide appendices listing the data sets
   discussed in the article, enabling scholars to conveniently access them.},

Abstract = {Recent geopolitical changes and the strengthening of the
   security/economy nexus have multiplied the types and functions of
   territorial borders in the Baltic Sea Region (BSR). These borders have
   been insufficiently addressed in previous research even though
   macro-regions cross over multiple borders, which are highly affected by
   geopolitical events and conflicts. This paper contributes to the debate
   about multiple borders with particular emphasis on the question how de-
   and re-bordering affect the regionalisation process in practice and how
   it influences the cooperation within the BSR. The results, which are
   based on a discourse analysis of a corpus of documents, show that the
   region-building process in the BSR itself creates new borders, which
   define the level of the member state's political participation in the
   region. The governance of macro-regions would benefit from the
   development of such analytical frameworks that take into account the
   impact of the multitude of borders on the practical level.},

Abstract = {Psychologists and scholars of politics and political communication
   suggest that portrayals of the others impact emotions and behaviors
   toward them, particularly during conflict. When extremely negative,
   these portrayals can be used to justify harmful behaviors. Other
   scholars have found that the norms and structures of professional
   journalism can moderate extreme portrayals. This paper examines two
   factors that help construct the othersone that polarizes and one that
   tempers portrayals. By comparing three variables related to portraying
   foes in five Northern Ireland publications, the research shows two
   important variations: The first, variation across the partisan divide,
   suggests the role of identity and ideology in perpetuating us versus
   them and good versus bad framing. The second, variation between the
   professional newspapers and nonprofessional, more partisan publications,
   suggests that professional journalism may moderate extreme portrayals.
   These findings may have implications for journalism and for conflict
   management.},

Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {47},
Pages = {1-10},

Abstract = {Contemporary political geographers accommodate everyday practice in
   accounts of state power but arguably tend to retain a bias towards sites
   easily identified with the state. This bias complements a frequent
   conflation of policing and the state in recent scholarship on the
   post-political. This article challenges these assumptions by showing how
   rituals of anti-stateness may themselves paradoxically give to the
   senses a partitioned world of state domination and non-state resistance
   that delimits political possibility. I specifically examine activist
   participation in such policing through analysis of student-left
   commemorations of 1968 in Mexico City. My analysis of such activism also
   reveals tension in processes that consolidate a partitioned
   state/non-state world. I show that, through vinculacion, some activists
   establish unaccounted-for solidarities that exceed the categories
   through which state power has in the past been exercised, reconfiguring
   relations between people whose place vis-a-vis the state would otherwise
   be predictable. I therefore reveal ongoing interplay between processes
   of politics and policing, not a ``post-political condition{''} that
   would demand, as politics, the negation of any social-spatial order. (C)

Abstract = {Taking into account the most recent publications in historiography on
   Cold War, the article aim at comparing how this conflict affected the
   dictatorships of Franco and Salazar with the analysis of the
   relationship established since 1945 with the USA. The other objectives
   are to measure if the bilateral relationships US-Spain and US-Portugal
   had any repercussion on the global development of the Cold War and to
   estimate the influence of that connection with the USA on the
   socio-economic modernization which happened in both countries till 1975.
   This last process can't be considered as just Americanization, but
   Westernization, considering the simultaneous influence of different
   European processes and countries.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Buchanan's last book declares an antipathy to one aspect of
   ``conservatism{''} as he identified it-namely, conservatism's defense of
   hierarchy in social relations. Buchanan's anti-hierarchy stance owes
   something to the rural populist background of his early years. That
   stance also explains something about his professional and individual
   personality: his contentment to remain at non-elitist institutions; his
   preparedness to challenge establishment thinking on the nature and role
   of government; his antagonism to inherited wealth and the privileges of
   dynasty; and his life-long affection for elements of the simple rural
   life. The aim of this short piece is to highlight these various
   connections between Buchanan's political commitments and the content and
   conduct of his work.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {37},
Pages = {220-240},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Private military and security companies (PMSCs) have been gaining
   increasing media and scholarly attention particularly due to their
   indispensable role in the wars in Afghanistan 2001 and Iraq 2003.
   Nevertheless, theoretical insights into the agency problems inherent
   when hiring PMSCs and how to optimally incentivize them are scarce. We
   study the complex relationship between intervening state, host state,
   and PMSC, taking into account the diverging interests of all involved
   parties as well as potential agency problems. We develop a theoretical
   model to characterize a state's optimal choice whether to perform a task
   associated with an intervening mission itself, or hire a PMSC and
   optimally design the contract
   We find that it might be optimal to hire PMSCs even if they are expected
   to do a worse job than the intervening state would do itself.
   Furthermore, the government's reputation in rewarding PMSCs for a good
   performance is crucial and might render it optimal to only deal with a
   limited number of PMSCs who are not necessarily always the most
   efficient providers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesThe objectives of this study were to examine the relationship
   between a public vote on the right to carry (RTC) concealed weapons in
   the state of Missouri and the subsequent demand for concealed-carry
   permits.
   MethodsWeighted logit analysis of the referendum vote and the proportion
   of the population holding concealed-carry permits was performed to
   investigate the factors that influence them.
   ResultsWe find vast differences in the factors that significantly
   influenced the vote and the decision to hold a concealed-carry permit.
   Crime rates are positively related to the vote, but have no influence on
   the decision to carry.
   ConclusionsOur analysis shows that most voters do not appear to vote for
   the RTC based on a latent desire to carry concealed weapons. Instead,
   our evidence suggests that voters in favor of concealed carry may be
   voting for moral or philosophical reasons, and that they may be hoping
   to free ride on the concealed carry of others.},

Abstract = {From a mechanism design perspective, a valuation exercise can be
   analyzed in terms of its incentive compatibility. However, a
   non-incentive compatible exercise does not automatically imply that
   participants will engage in strategic behavior. The likelihood of this
   behavior can be tested through lab experiments. In this regard, choice
   modeling has received little attention compared to the contingent
   valuation method. This article reports a laboratory experiment using
   contingent grouping, a choice modeling valuation Variant. The main
   conclusion is that the manipulability of this type of valuation
   exercises may be too difficult to realize by the participants to behave
   strategically unless they are made aware in advance.},

Title = {The impact of national fiscal rules on the stabilisation function of
   fiscal policy},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {37},
Pages = {1-20},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We study the relationship between discretionary fiscal policy and
   macroeconomic stability in 21 OECD countries over the 1985-2012 period.
   The novelties of our contribution lie in the use of annual panel data,
   whereas most of the existing evidence is cross-sectional, and more
   importantly in the thorough investigation of how fiscal rules affect the
   policy-macroeconomic stability relationship. We find that the aggressive
   use of discretionary fiscal policy, particularly of government
   consumption items, leads to higher volatility of output and, to a lesser
   extent, inflation. However, when strict fiscal rules are introduced,
   discretionary policy becomes output-stabilising rather than
   destabilising. This result can be more easily achieved by rules on
   balanced budgets, rather than on expenditures, revenues, or debt. On the
   other hand, fiscal rules are unable to affect the
   inflationd-estabilising nature of discretionary policy, if any, probably
   because of the higher importance of central banks in that respect. (C)

Abstract = {The chapter considers events and processes in Britain during the

   exigencies of coalition politics) and the fortunes of UKIP, the
   different core constituencies to which the Right was tied, economic
   logics and the character of the institutional structures within which
   British policymaking was undertaken. In particular, the chapter surveys
   two ideational shifts. First, the Conservative leadership committed
   itself to radical and sustained fiscal retrenchment. This was, however,
   rationalized on largely pragmatic grounds. Then, second, it reframed
   retrenchment so that it became an explicit commitment to shrink and
   restructure the British state, thereby reconfiguring its relationship
   with both the economy and civil society.},

Abstract = {`Sounding the Border' is a conversation between the editors and artist
   duo, Bambitchell, about their 2011 installation, Border Sounds. Focusing
   on the material elements of their site-specific installation, the
   artists reflect on their use of passports, dubstep, a parking garage,
   and dance to interrogate the complex and nuanced web of affects and
   intimacies produced and experienced at the site of the border. Blending
   contradictory elements and objects in the production of their work,
   Bambitchell aligns Border Sounds with queer critiques of mobility by
   taking into account the deeply subjective aspects of movement in
   relation to borders and border-crossings while foregrounding a sense of
   intimacy within processes commonly understood and depicted as only ever
   alienating.},

Abstract = {This study seeks to understand the efficacy of online political campaign
   communication. We do this by measuring the changes in online influence
   of political candidates by utilizing Klout, a new, publicly available
   measure incorporating a variety of behaviors online. We collected daily
   Klout data of nearly all major congressional and presidential campaigns
   during the 2012 election cycle and compare them to other traditional
   measures of online influence and campaign success. We conclude that
   Klout offers valuable advantages as a sophisticated research tool for
   evaluating real-time online influence of political campaigns, but
   caution researchers about some limitations in its use.},

Abstract = {The idea that military operations should not be disproportionately
   harmful is an essential element of just war theory, of which two
   versions are described. The orthodox conception rules out both the use
   of means for giving military advantage that are disproportionately
   harmful to enemy combatants and actions which are excessively costly in
   civilian casualties. A more recent revisionist view distinguishes the
   narrow proportionality of military actions against those liable to
   defensive harm, primarily unjust combatants, from the wide
   proportionality of acts that unintentionally harm innocents. These
   accounts are set in the context of some distinctive features of
   contemporary armed conflict.},

Abstract = {The major global financial crises of 1997 and 2008 demonstrated the need
   for multilateral economic cooperation and prompted the creation and
   growth of the G20 forum. Made up of leaders of advanced and emerging
   economies, the G20 promotes discussion and collaboration on how to
   mitigate the amplified effects of financial shocks on the increasingly
   interconnected and interdependent global economy. Within this
   multilateral body, the middle powers have the potential to play an
   important role in mediating the opinions of different economies and
   ensuring that global financial measures are comprehensively adopted by
   all. While numerous obstacles still inhibit the formal setup for middle
   power cooperation, there are several areas of financial regulatory
   reform that can bring middle powers together and lend them the
   opportunity to facilitate effective dialogue among the G20 members.},

Journal = {INTERSECTIONS-EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {1},

Pages = {38-54},
Abstract = {This paper discusses the changing housing regime during Bulgaria's
   transition from socialism to post-socialism. Focusing on the Roma
   minority in Sofia I trace the present-day legacy of socialist housing
   policies. After 1989 the displacement of Roma people drastically
   increased. As their self-built houses and annexes were informally
   legitimisied but not formally legalised under socialism, they were
   evicted by neoliberal urban authorities to clear the way for new private
   developments. Many small Roma neighbourhoods were pronounced `illegal'
   and destroyed and their inhabitants were pushed out to zones without
   economic and education opportunities. Triangulating archival and
   secondary sources with ethnographic observation and qualitative
   interviews, I ask what past and present legal regulations, policies, and
   practices made Roma settlements in Sofia vulnerable to demolition and
   their inhabitants to displacement. I claim that, as in other periods of
   the development of the Bulgarian capital, quick-fix solutions were
   characteristic of the socialist period. In the case of Roma, in order to
   provide a temporary solution to the overall housing shortage the state
   turned a blind eye to the increasing amount of semi-legal housing.
   Furthermore, as Roma mostly remained low-skilled workers, they did not
   benefit from the redistribution that championed certain occupations
   privileged by the one-party state.},

Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {63},

Abstract = {This article proposes an approach to an interest rate analysis for
   purposes of risk management of financial portfolio consisting of assets
   or liabilities linked to interest rates and held to maturity in the
   Czech environment. Czech financial market is characterized by relative
   underdevelopment and relatively low liquidity, and in an environment of
   high uncertainty due to interventions and regulations of central banks
   and other authorities. This article first describes the volatility of
   the Czech koruna and euro interest rates using the GARCH model. Based on
   this description, relationships between levels of koruna and euro
   swaptions volatilities are determined. After obtaining estimates of
   koruna swaptions implied volatilities, the BGM interest rate model is
   applied to Czech koruna and euro interest rate simulations. They are
   then compared with the real development of given interest rates. It
   turns out that although the BGM model was developed for the purpose
   financial derivatives valuation in the environment of developed and
   liquid financial markets without significant distortions, resulting
   simulations are relatively good, and their use can improve interest rate
   risk management even in the Czech environment.},

Abstract = {Pierre Macherey's Hegel or Spinoza? suggests that Hegel was driven to
   his now legendary misinterpretations of Spinoza because he could not
   accept Spinozism without compromising his own philosophy. Macherey shows
   us a Spinoza that pre-emptively resists and challenges Hegel's
   understanding of Spirit as Subject realising itself through
   self-negation and contradiction. This review draws out the central
   arguments in the book, and those arguments most salient for contemporary
   theories of capitalism and revolution, and points towards possible
   implications for Marxist theory.},

Abstract = {In aftermath of violence, both governments are operating in a state of
   crisis management. For the Unionist government, the rising number of
   anti-partitionist statements and the mobilisation of the Irish army
   posed real problems for moderates within the government. The fear of an
   invasion and rising violence on the streets created a narrative of
   subversive Irish activity. This sense offear was only heightened
   following' the Arms Crisis which implicated ministers in a plot to
   smuggle arms toe Northern Nationalists. Whilst an attempt to end the
   violence was examined the rise of the Provisional IRA had a hugely
   destabilising impact on North-South relations. The ensuing tough
   security policies such as internment, made an improved relationship next
   to impossible.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses movements created, initiated and maintained by
   political parties: a quite neglected area of social movement studies.
   Between 2010 and 2014, the biggest demonstrations were pro-government
   marches in Hungary. The engine of pro-government actions was the
   movement of the Civil Cooperation Forum (CCF) implicitly founded by the
   incumbent party Fidesz - Hungarian Civic Alliance. The purpose of this
   article is to analyze this relationship within a constructivist
   analytical framework. Through intertextual analyses I will draw up the
   narrative of the movement focusing on four key challenges (constructing
   identity, strategic visions, organizational tactics, appropriate and
   persuading communication). I will demonstrate how independent the
   movement is. After the descriptive case study, two hypotheses will be
   generated about the political parties' reason for launching a movement
   entrepreneurship; and the citizens' motivation for participating and
   expressing their preferences between elections through a collateral
   organization like CCF.},

Abstract = {Seaford's recent work has revived and further substantiated a line of
   argument that had been developed by Marxist scholars claiming a central
   role for money in the genesis of philosophical thought. In a nutshell,
   this line of argument holds that beneath the abstractions in which
   philosophy breathes and with which philosophy works we can trace the
   real abstraction of the money form as embodiment of abstract social
   labour. Following this perspective, I will try to demonstrate the role
   money plays in Plato's Republic, focusing on Book I.},

Abstract = {This study examined the effects of negative news on Twitter users'
   emotional, cognitive, and behavioral responses. Four hundred twenty
   subjects participated in an online experiment and read 10 news stories,
   modified as Twitter newsfeed. The results show that news negativity had
   a significant effect on anger and disgust. A significant link was found
   between exposure to negative news and information seeking. The impact of
   news negativity on emotions and political learning was moderated by age.
   Findings also reveal that experiencing negative emotions as a result of
   exposure to negative news on Twitter is not necessarily at odds with
   achieving political learning.},

   Post-structuralist Perspective},
Journal = {INTERSECTIONS-EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Pages = {183-206},
Abstract = {This article analyses the securitization of LGBTIQ population in the
   narratives of Serbian far-right organizations, i.e. the discursive
   construction of the LGBTIQ minorities as a threat. The analysis relies
   on securitization theory in order to demonstrate how the issue of gay
   rights is taken beyond `normal politics' and constructed as a security
   issue. By drawing upon post-structuralist reading of securitization
   theory, this article argues that the narratives of Serbian far-right
   groups acquire legitimacy due to their coherence with the mainstream
   discourses on homosexuality and LGBTIQ rights. Moreover, it argues that
   through the securitization of sexual minorities in the far-right
   discourses, the Serbian national identity is being re-defined and
   strengthened. This article uses discourse analysis as main method. The
   sources of data include press statements and other media pieces, reports
   by civil society organizations and government institutions, public
   opinion surveys and websites of the far-right groups. The analysis is
   focused on the period from the adoption of the Anti-discrimination Law
   in 2009 onwards, as the period in which the issue of LGBTIQ rights has
   become increasingly topical in the Serbian public sphere.},

   Lenin and Jean-Toussaint Desanti but also to such successors as Pierre
   Macherey and Pierre Raymond. The thesis of the article is that
   Althusser's project to establish a philosophical practice that would be
   appropriate for Marxism did not simply consist of identifying and
   defending a `materialist' position in philosophy against external
   `idealist' challenges or threats. On the contrary, it recognised that
   there exists an interminable struggle between inextricably linked but
   ever-shifting materialist and idealist tendencies a struggle that
   operates as a defining feature in the history of philosophy. As a
   result, the problem explored in this article concerns how best to
   conceptualise this struggle and to determine whether or not the term
   `tendency' genuinely holds analytical value and can serve as an
   important conceptual resource for Marxists working within the field of
   philosophy.},

Abstract = {Milli Gorus is the general denominator of an Islamic political movement
   founded in the 1970s. Political leader Erbakan was critical about the
   strict control of the Turkish state on religious issues, but first and
   foremost he opted for a strong Turkish economy and an acknowledgement of
   the deeply religious attitude of the Turkish people. Erbakan founded
   several political parties since 1970 and was successful until the early
   2000s. The ruling AK party originates in the MG movement, but diverted
   considerably from the Erbakan political agenda under the leadership of
   the current president Erdogan. In the late 1970s members of the MG
   founded organizations in many countries in Europe. They have always been
   successful among young Muslims and counted as the most important
   competitors of Diyanet.},

Abstract = {Despite voluminous literature explaining the emergence and the electoral
   contours of right wing radicalism in Europe, little is known about the
   location of radical right mass communication channels in the media
   sphere. The aim of this article is to fill the gap by identifying and
   analysing the positions of the radical right media within the network
   structure of the general media sphere. To do so, Hungary is an excellent
   illustrative case as a country in which the radical right wing Jobbik
   party won 21 percent of the votes in the 2014 parliamentary election
   that cemented its status as by far the largest radical right group in
   Central Europe. We provide an issue-centred approach in which the media
   networks of two of the most controversial political topics of the year
   2014 in Hungarian politics are explored. To compose the networks, we
   concentrate on the interaction ties that are defined here as direct, and
   explicit citations or hyperlinks to the content of other media products.
   The empirical test of ideal typical networks reveals that the radical
   right products stay under the radar of the mainstream media. It is our
   finding that the representatives of the radical media remain on the
   fringe of the media sphere in Hungary.},

Abstract = {Social movement scholars have been actively debating the importance of
   organizational structures for solidarity and new social movements. This
   article investigates how queer festivals build on the horizontal
   structure legacy of those movements, constructing their own
   prefigurative models through a set of specific organizational practices.
   Queer festivals constitute a dynamic repertoire of action of queer
   politics in Europe, expanding across the continent. Based upon their
   belief in the limits of strict identity politics of gender and
   sexuality, queer festivals attempt to construct new identities, based
   upon their anti-identitarian ethos. Beyond their discursive frames,
   queer festivals, as prefigurative spaces, attempt to build their new
   identities through specific practices, reflected among others on their
   organizational choices. The article posits three key elements for the
   prefigurative model that queer festivals attempt to build: (1) Squats as
   the spaces in which queer movement actors build their anti-authoritarian
   identity; (2) the organizational choice based on horizontality; (3) the
   role of the Do-It-Yourself model for festivals' deployment. Insight into
   queer festivals is based on ethnographic research conducted in five
   European capitals, including semi-structured interviews.},

Abstract = {We provide an explanation for why estate taxation is surprisingly little
   used, given the skewness of the estate distribution. Taxing estates
   implies meddling with intra-family decisions, which is frown upon by
   many. At the same time, given the concentration of estates a small
   proportion of the population stands to gain a lot by decreasing estate
   taxation. We provide an analytical model, together with numerical
   simulations, where agents bequeathing large estates make monetary
   contributions to play up the salience of the encroachment aspects of
   estate taxation on family decisions and to decrease its political
   support.},

Volume = {49},
Number = {SI},

Abstract = {This paper uses a focus on the relations between maritime labour and
   internationalism to explore the subaltern geographies of
   internationalism. It uses a discussion of a number of such seafarers
   involved in organisations such as the International of Seamen and Habour
   Workers Union and the International Trade Union Committee of Negro
   Workers to develop an engagement with the production of forms of black
   internationalism `from below'. The paper traces the following key
   `agentic spatial practices' that were constituted through the political
   networks of black internationalist seafarers' organising. Firstly, I
   argue that subaltern maritime actors were able to use their, albeit
   marginal, position in relation to flows and trade networks creatively to
   bring diverse relations of power into contestation. Secondly, there are
   important ways in which such networks were used to generate connections
   between differently placed groups and to circulate, often in contexts of
   government repression of `seditious' literature and ideas. Thirdly,
   following the political trajectories shaped by maritime workers and
   activists opens up important possibilities for moving beyond
   understandings of internationalism as the product of elite groups
   brokering between different left traditions in particular nations.
   Fourthly, it engages with the structuring effect of the racism of
   elements of the `white left' on the practices of maritime
   internationalist politics, and recognizes forms of subaltern agency
   shaped through contesting such racism. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {In a recent article, Michael Otsuka and Alex Voorhoeve argue that
   prioritarianism fails to account for the shift in moral significance in
   gains to individuals in interpersonal as compared to intrapersonal
   cases. In this article, I show that the priority view escapes this
   objection but in a way that deprives it of (some of) its
   anti-egalitarian stance. Despite Otsuka and Voorhoeve, prioritarianism,
   rightly understood, provides consistent and attractive recommendations
   in both single- and multi-person cases. Yet prioritarians, the article
   goes on to show, cannot do so while availing themselves of the leveling
   down objection (LDO) to egalitarianism. They may not do so because
   similarly to egalitarianism, prioritarianism also must reject the
   principle of personal good. That is, egalitarians and prioritarians may
   sometime recommend certain actions and outcomes even when these are
   better for no one. Prioritarians may survive the Otsuka-Voorhoeve
   critique, but to do so they must abandon their anti-egalitarian stance
   (or at the very least, the LDO).},

Abstract = {This article provides a detailed decomposition analysis of the gender
   differences in workplace training throughout the working life with a
   particular focus on parental leave and supervisors using personnel
   records from a large German firm. Females obtain less training during
   the early career, and more at higher age. The timing of the training gap
   seems to be driven by diverging career paths associated with employment
   interruptions. However, we find no evidence for catching-up effects
   after parental leave. Furthermore, including supervisor-fixed effects
   cannot explain the gender differences in training. The training of both
   male and female employees is positively associated with the training of
   the supervisor.},

Abstract = {Although agricultural productivity is critical for economic development
   very little is known about the causes of the large dispersion in
   agricultural productivity across the world. Microeconomic studies
   increasingly stress the lack of land rights in many poor countries as an
   important source of low productivity. This paper examines the role
   played by land titles in explaining differences in agricultural
   productivity for 93 countries. Using the per capita accumulated value of
   gold and silver production in the 16th and 17th centuries as instruments
   for land rights it is shown that enforcement of land titles is a
   significant source of agricultural productivity inequality across the
   world. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {From the mid-1970s, Greenpeace began to expand its influence beyond its
   original base in North America. As it did so, it encountered an array of
   environmentalist and social movement cultures in the various countries
   in which it sought to set up branches. This article focusses on the
   establishment of the West German branch in the early 1980s. It analyses
   the friction Greenpeace by then an increasingly professional
   organisation with a hierarchical structure caused when it entered a West
   German environmentalist culture that was committed to grass roots
   democracy and consensus politics.},

Abstract = {The modern military profession encompasses two seemingly contradictory
   roles, those of warrior and peacekeeper. The question is whether
   soldiers can identify with both roles simultaneously. In order to answer
   this question, an instrument for measuring the warrior and peacekeeper
   role identity as a multiple role construct is required. This article
   describes the construction of the Warrior-Peacekeeper Role Identity
   Survey (WPRIS), measuring the extent to which soldiers identify with the
   warrior and the peacekeeper role. The internal consistency and validity
   of the instrument are promising. Practical implications as the
   predictive value of military role identity for performance of soldiers
   during deployment in general and the buffering role of peacekeeper role
   identity in particular are discussed.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The paper investigates policy options for a successful fight against
   child sex tourism in a context of increased human mobility inherent to
   the global economy era. Using state and district-level data on
   child-related crimes in India we find that international policy
   coordination is necessary. Coordination involves a combination of
   policies aimed at providing a safer environment for children by removing
   them from the streets (supply-side policies) with those intended to deal
   with child-related offences (demand-side policies). One-standard
   deviation increase in coordination efforts reduces the illegal
   importation of minor girls by 124 standard deviation. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   medium-sized states. It is argued that with regard to small states,
   Kjellen did not maintain a consistent separation between ``soft{''}
   cultural resources of power and ``hard{''} laws of nature. Rather, he
   placed the mutually constitutive tension between geography (nature) and
   politics (culture) at the centre of his politico-scientific analysis,
   arguing that active ``biopolitics{''} could supplement geopolitics. In
   Kjellen's conception, cultural and natural resources are instruments of
   an otherwise integrated notion of power which challenges the
   contemporary separation between hard and soft power.},

Abstract = {This study draws on the ``cascading activation{''} model of press-state
   relations to explore U.S. political and news discourse surrounding the
   1968 My Lai Massacre. We systematically analyze White House, military,
   congressional, and news communications and draw upon scholarship in
   social psychology to assess why the press might challenge certain frames
   in response to My Lai but indiscriminately echo others. In particular,
   within these communications, we examine how serious and widespread the
   actions at My Lai were conveyed to be, how the circumstances were
   portrayed, how the actors involved in the incident were characterized,
   and the extent to which America's core values were questioned. Our
   findings suggest that the Nixon administration employed frames designed
   to downplay the severity of the My Lai incident, highlight extenuating
   circumstances faced by those directly involved, denigrate the alleged
   low-level perpetrators, and bolster the national identity. These frames
   were then largely echoed in the press, despite consistent and forceful
   challenges by congressional Democrats. These findings, we argue, align
   with the cascading activation model, and we build on it by highlighting
   the underlying importance of ``cultural resonance{''} in the framing
   process. We reflect on the theoretical and practical implications of
   these patterns and, in doing so, engage the broader scholarly debate
   over the process through which U.S. news coverage aligns with the
   communications of government officials, particularly in moments of
   national dissonance.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes spillover effects in sports leagues that are
   embedded in a system of promotion and relegation. Based on a contest
   model of a professional sports league with a top division and a second
   division, we show that league prizes and club efficiencies have opposing
   effects; while a stronger second division that offers a higher league
   prize leads to a more balanced top division, the opposite is true for a
   stronger second division whose clubs become more cost efficient.
   Moreover, we demonstrate that a higher second-division prize induces a
   lower investment level, but higher profits in the top division, while
   higher club efficiency in the second division leads to both a lower
   investment level and lower profits in the top division. These results
   have important policy implications for the organization of sports
   leagues.},

Abstract = {Signature requirements are often used as hurdles to prevent overuse of
   direct democratic instruments such as citizen initiatives. We evaluate
   the causal effect of lowering signature requirements on the number of
   observed citizen initiative petitions. Based on municipal-level data for
   Germany, we make use of changes in signature requirements that occur at
   specific population thresholds to build an identification strategy using
   a regression discontinuity design. We find that reducing the signature
   requirement by 1 \% point increases the probability of observing an
   initiative petition in a given city-year by 8-10 \% points.},

Abstract = {This chapter outlines the political structures and processes that shape
   Central American migrants' precarity in the transnational space that
   comprises migrants' homes in the countries of the Northern Triangle,
   Mexico, and the United States. It suggests that both poverty and the
   violence perpetrated by criminal organizations and individuals in the
   migrants' countries of origin propel out-migration. This chapter further
   argues that the precarity of migrants' journeys is related to the United
   States biopolitics of citizenship, comprising techniques that include
   the tightening of migration control in both the United States and
   Mexico. Despite a degree of humanitarianism extended to Central American
   migrants by the Mexican state, the dominant framework continues to be
   couched in the discourses of national security and migration control.
   Finally, the chapter also illustrates that the rise in the migration
   industry, a spin-off of the United States biopolitics of citizenship,
   shapes migrants' precarity in specific, and, at times, contradictory
   ways.},

Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {63},
Number = {6},
Pages = {689-713},
Abstract = {The paper deals with an impact of new Basel III liquidity regulation on
   bank's liquidity and solvency conditions. It analyzes a change from
   qualitative to quantitative based regulation and compares bank's
   liquidity approaches within an application of LCR regulatory measures.
   Strict definition of LCR causes a change in bank's liquidity allocation
   and funding which is less effective, more costly and restrictive for
   providing credits comparing with pure economic determinants. Empirical
   part shows a simulation of an impact of aggregate liquidity shock and
   credit risk shock on annual rate of capital return consistent with
   bank's solvency. It proves huge liquidity buffer of the Czech banking
   sector due to systematic liquidity surplus, its rising capital endowment
   and high capital profitability. VAR estimation shows that links among
   bank's liquidity characteristics, sources of liquidity shocks, market
   illiquidity and central bank's liquidity facilities withdrawal are quite
   weak with non-persistent features.},

Abstract = {Oriented, descriptively, by recent liberal definitions of populism, this
   essay pursues a historical-materialist definition that grounds populist
   antagonisms in class struggles as `crystallised' in the capitalist
   state. A critical assessment of Laclau's early equation of populism and
   socialism inaugurates the reading of Poulantzas's relational account of
   class and state as a nascent framework for a theory of populism, centred
   on the state and its ideological crystallisation of individualisation,
   the mental/manual-labour division and the `people-nation'. This
   framework is then expanded to articulate the political-economic core of
   populist antagonisms, the specific character of `neoliberal populism'
   today, and the potential, in relation to theories of `popular politics'
   and a `communist people', that left-wing populism might hold as a
   process of new political productions of class. This reading provides for
   a more expansive account of such movements' potentials, beyond a threat
   to or correction of pre-determined democratic or Marxist schemas.},

Abstract = {We apply the iterative algorithm by Merrill and Adams (Political
   Analysis 9:347-361, 2001) to compute the optimal positions of
   vote-maximizing parties along a one-dimensional space for a large number
   of elections. This allows us to systematically evaluate factors that
   push parties toward more centrifugal locations in equilibrium. Our
   findings largely corroborate expectations suggested by the theoretical
   literature, albeit with one notable exception: the relative size of a
   partisan constituency reduces, rather than enhances, the likelihood of a
   party having an extreme optimal position. We then compare derived
   equilibrium positions with actual party positions, with the aim of
   understanding the nature of electoral incentives and offering insights
   about party-system competition. In particular, we show that the age of a
   party, the party family to which it belongs, post-election expectations,
   and internal rules for candidate and leader selection, are all factors
   that increase the probability of a party approaching the position
   predicted by pure vote-maximizing considerations.},

Abstract = {The aim of the paper is to find out what is the effect of different
   types of government spending and taxes on economic growth in developed
   economies. The analysis is performed on a sample of 27 OECD countries in
   the period 1997-2011. It is based on the neoclassic growth model
   extended with the level of human capital and fiscal variables. Those
   include particular types of government spending (according to the COFOG
   classification) and taxes (according to the OECD classification), and
   state budget deficit. From a methodological point of view, panel data
   estimation is used. We support the view that only some types of
   government spending are growth-enhancing, and only if they are financed
   through indirect taxes. However, the results show that only. expenditure
   on defense, education and health, and general public services may be
   labeled as productive. In addition, we show that direct taxes,
   especially corporate taxes, negatively affect the growth, also in case
   they are used to finance productive spending.},

Abstract = {There has been a tremendous decline in the use of the death penalty in
   the United States. Recent research using county-level data shows that a
   small minority of locales in the country account for death sentences and
   even fewer for executions. Drawing on theoretical work that seeks to
   account for why these locales continue to use capital punishment, we
   provide in this chapter a thick description of Maricopa County, Arizona,
   one of the most active death penalty locales in the contemporary United
   States. In doing so, we demonstrate how capital punishment operates in a
   field of violently defended racial boundaries. Our chapter shows the
   roles of various local actors across time in fortifying such racial
   boundaries through historical white terrorism and more recent
   reinforcement of zones of racial exclusion that are embodied especially
   in communicated fears of ``illegal immigrant gangs.{''} We contend that
   the case of Maricopa County points to the importance of attending to
   racist localisms as a catalyst for the continued implementation of the
   death penalty in the United States.},

   Hungary: `Change and Reform' and the Financial Research Institute in
   Context},
Journal = {INTERSECTIONS-EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY AND POLITICS},

Abstract = {The paper addresses this issue's subject of the question of East/West
   hierarchies in academe, and the conditions of the epistemic position and
   public authority of East and Central European scholarship, through a
   case study of a major institute of Hungarian reform economics, the
   Financial Research Institute (FRI), and a moment of political critique
   by its experts in 1986, asserted in the political pamphlet `Change and
   Reform'. Through placing the expert and political critique developed at
   FRI into that context, the paper contributes to a perspective on ECE
   social science that goes beyond measuring local scientific paradigms to
   Western ones, and which understands the epistemic position and public
   authority of local social science as shaped by formative interactions
   embedded in a common global history.},

Abstract = {The lead up to the outbreak of the Troubles sets the scene for the rest
   of the book. The unpreparedness of Lynch and O'Neill for the civil
   rights campaign left their North-South policy in tatters. The ensuing
   pressure from hardliners within Unionism forced O'Neill to make much
   more critical statements on his Irish counterpart. This in turn provoked
   more anti-partitionist statements from Dublin. The resignation of
   O'Neill and the rise of James Chichester-Clark provides interesting
   insight into the muddled approach that always existed on North-South
   co-operation. Clark initially tried to keep open the prospect of formal
   co-operation with the Irish government, whilst telling conservative
   Unionists that he would be more cautious than his predecessor. This
   approach ended with the outbreak of violence in August1969.},

   the Czech economy data is therefore tested the relationship between

Abstract = {Climate change is a global problem that requires international
   cooperation. Unfortunately, developed and developing countries are
   divided in their commitment to tackling the issue. These different
   national interests undermine efforts to establish an environmentally
   effective global regime. With the expiration of the Kyoto Protocol,
   there is space for MIKTA to facilitate a new agreement-one that will be
   ``applicable to all parties{''}. By playing the crucial bridging role
   between developed and developing states, middle power countries can help
   create a collaborative agenda that focuses on different national
   circumstances to establish a more nation-driven approach to effectively
   mitigating the effects of climate change.},

Abstract = {George Ciccariello-Maher's We Created Chavez is the most important book
   available in English proposing an anti-capitalist framework for
   understanding the Bolivarian process in contemporary Venezuela, as well
   as its historical backdrop dating back to 1958. The book contains within
   it a laudable critique of Eurocentrism and a masterful combination of
   oral history, ethnography, and theoretical sophistication. It reveals
   with unusual clarity and insight the multiplicity of popular movements
   that allowed for Hugo Chavez's eventual ascension to presidential office
   in the late 1990s. We Created Chavez has set a new scholarly bar for
   social histories of the Bolivarian process and demands serious
   engagement by Marxists. As a first attempt at such engagement, this
   paper reveals some critical theoretical and sociological flaws in the
   text and other areas of analytical imprecision. Divided into theoretical
   and historical parts, it unpacks some of the strengths and weaknesses by
   moving from the abstract to the concrete. The intervention begins with
   concepts - the mutually determining dialectic between Chavez and social
   movements; `the people'; and `dual power'. From here, it grounds these
   concepts, and Ciccariello-Maher's use of them, in various themes and
   movements across specific historical periods of Venezuelan political
   development - the rural guerrillas of the 1960s, the urban guerrillas of
   the 1970s, the new urban socio-political formations},

Abstract = {The international order will face increasing challenges over the coming
   decades, including climate change, management of maritime territorial
   disputes, resource competition, new conventional arms technologies,
   cyberweapons, and human rights abuses. However, the current order is
   inadequate for meeting these challenges. The growing disconnect between
   the intent and consequence of the order calls for greater
   multilateralism and transformation. Within this framework, middle powers
   are best positioned to promote a multilateral pivot. Albeit divergent in
   interests and perspectives, middle powers can help reform and strengthen
   global structures by virtue of their special interest in a healthy and
   rule-based international order.},

Title = {The `ugliness' of economic efficiency: technology, species-being, and
   global poverty},
Journal = {ETHICS \& GLOBAL POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {1-20},
Month = {DEC 9},
Abstract = {In this paper, I argue that contemporary philosophical approaches to the
   problem of global poverty overlook a critical issue in terms of
   causality: the actual labor in which the poorest people of the world
   engage. More specifically, I challenge the current economic system's
   maniacal worship of economic efficiency in production and the way in
   which this goal is pursued through the implementation of labor-saving
   technology. Although it is considered economically efficient to save as
   much as possible on labor costs by using new technologies, I argue (with
   reference to Karl Marx's concept of our human nature as `species-being')
   that we are not being efficient on human terms. Instead, we are
   `wasting' human beings by forcing them into poverty and denying them the
   opportunity to labor meaningfully. Given such results, I argue that we
   must revisit the role that economic efficiency and labor-saving
   technology should have in the productive process. To do so, I
   incorporate the work of economist and philosopher E.F. Schumacher and
   his focus on providing `good work' through intermediate technology. This
   is a level of technology that is not wasteful in production but requires
   an appropriate amount of actual human labor. By altering our conception
   of efficiency to one that is `human' and utilizing technology only
   insofar as it enhances the character of labor, there will be more
   opportunities for the poorest people of the world to labor in a way that
   not only helps them avoid poverty but also allows them to feel humanly
   productive.},

Abstract = {We investigate whether development aid stimulates growth in transition
   economies, paying particular attention to the possibility of spatial
   spillovers arising from aid. We find that common borders and a shared
   historical and political heritage result in a complex set of
   associations between aid and growth. Aid has a positive impact on growth
   in the recipient country. However, the impact of aid also spills over to
   affect other nations. Aid appears to create positive spillovers through
   improved total factor productivity and possibly currency appreciation.
   At the same time, aid depletes human capital through emigration and it
   particularly adversely affects democracy and governance quality in other
   transition economies. On balance, aid generates net adverse growth
   spillovers in transition economies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Noel Pearson is one of Australia's most prominent and influential
   Aboriginal intellectuals. This article examines a major idea in his
   writing: the quest for a radical centre. Through the concept of the
   radical centre, Pearson articulates both his desire to transcend
   existing policy paradigms and an ethics of partisanship which emphasizes
   the importance of listening to and negotiating with one's political
   adversaries. Pearson's development of this concept is explored in light
   of the role Pearson has played as leading advocate for Indigenous
   welfare reform, and especially his pivotal contribution to the public
   debate over the introduction of the Northern Territory Emergency
   Response Intervention by the Howard government in 2007.},

Journal = {POLICY AND INTERNET},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {This article considers claims made by various authors that the use of
   filtering and recommendation technology on the Internet can deprive
   certain communities of feedback, and instead amplify groups' viewpoints,
   leading to polarization of opinion across communities, and increases in
   extremism. The `echo chamber' arguments of Cass Sunstein are taken as
   representative of this point of view, and examined in detail in the
   context of a range of research, theoretical and empirical, quantitative
   and qualitative, in political science and the sociology of religion,
   from the last quarter century. The conclusion is that the case has not
   been made either (a) that echo chambers are necessarily harmful, or (b)
   that the Internet is complicit in their formation.},

Abstract = {Debates over European integration allow the articulation of an English
   nationalism based upon an Anglo-British identity committed to
   Parliamentary sovereignty and British exceptionalism. This was seen
   during debates over entry to the European Economic Community between
   1970 and 1975, which ended with a referendum. Tony Benn and Enoch Powell
   emerged as leaders of the campaign. With Benn a leading figure of the
   Labour Left and Powell a prominent yet contradictory figure on the
   right, they presented unlikely allies. However, since European
   integration conflicted with their Anglo-British identity, partisan
   politics were secondary to nationalist sentiments. By examining Benn and
   Powell's anti-Market rhetoric, this article considers 1970-1975 as the
   period in which the paradox of Anglo-British nationalism was affirmed:
   that its populist expression can be used to reinforce parliamentary
   sovereignty.},

Title = {The Partisan Battle Over College Student Voting: An Analysis of Student
   Voting Behavior in Federal, State, and Local Elections},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {96},
Number = {5},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Objective. We aim to test the hypothesis that college students provide
   Democratic candidates with greater electoral support and whether this
   varies among federal, state, and local elections. We also test whether
   college students mobilized by presidential campaigns are more likely to
   abstain from voting for state and local elections. Methods. To examine
   these questions, we employed OLS and difference-of-means tests to
   analyze the distribution of votes cast in competitive elections for the
   November 2008 elections in 86 precincts located on 42 college campuses
   across five states as compared to the distribution of votes cast in
   noncollege precincts. College precincts were identified by
   representatives from each community's local Board of Elections. Results.
   In line with conventional wisdom, the results of the analyses indicate
   Democratic candidates for federal offices do consistently receive
   greater electoral support from precincts located on college campuses as
   compared to noncollege precincts. However, the analyses of state and
   local elections highlight substantial variation in the level of support
   that Democratic candidates receive from precincts located on college
   campuses. Moreover, we found many college students in 2008 cast their
   ballots for Obama, but chose not to participate in lower-level
   elections. Conclusion. Republican fears regarding college students
   turning small towns on their heads via the ballot box are not supported
   by our analyses. On average, students vote more democratically than
   nonstudents but they are also more likely to simply choose not to vote
   for local candidates. By and large, they come to the polls to vote for
   national offices, not local ones.},

   Distribution of Human Capital},
Journal = {ECONOMICS \& POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article presents a simple model of endogenous institutions linking
   property rights to the distribution of human capital between political
   and economic elite groups. In the absence of institutional constraints,
   the commitment problem of the political elites is intensified, because
   their human capital can turn out to be a double-edged sword raising
   their efficiency in predation as well as in production. In general, the
   more human capital the political elites have, the stronger the
   institutional concessions they are ready to offer to attarct investment.
   Provided that predation depends sufficiently on human capital, the
   political elites can credibly commit to respect property rights by
   specializing in fields that are relevant for the priavte sector. Brain
   drain can undermine the transition to stable property rights even when
   the political elites are well-educated. Comparative narratives from
   Malaysia and Zimbabwe are presented to motivate the theoretical
   discussion.},

Abstract = {Objective. We explain how economic and political predictors shaped
   levels of American media coverage of the European financial crisis
   between 2008 and 2012. Methods. We link exchange rates, unemployment
   rates, inflation, trade, protests, votes of no confidence, elections,
   and U.S. presidential remarks with financial crisis stories produced by
   The New York Times, the Associated Press, and television newscasts.
   Error-correction modeling is utilized to determine whether relationships
   exist contemporaneously and across future months. Results. We find
   evidence across multiple models that changes in the exchange rate and
   elections shaped levels of media coverage. We find some evidence that
   votes of no confidence, protests, change in unemployment, and
   presidential remarks matter as well. Conclusion. A combination of
   economic change, specific political events, and broader newsworthiness
   norms journalists utilize in determining which stories are worthy of
   attention drove American coverage of the European financial crisis.},

Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {96},
Number = {5},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Objectives. In the past, research focusing on local service decisions
   was dominated by the exploration of make-or-buy choices (i.e., how to
   produce services). In this article, we extend this venue of research to
   explore service termination (i.e., whether to provide). In doing so, we
   adopt four theoretical strands developed in the fields of public policy
   and management to guide our research: policy termination, political
   economy, make-or-buy, and policy diffusion. Methods. We utilize multiple
   International City/CountyManagement Association surveys for our
   analysis. We supplement these data with information gleaned from a
   variety of other sources, including Census data, to construct a binary
   logistic regression model examining the determinants of service
   termination. Results. We find that local governments are likely to
   terminate their services when they were previously outsourced to
   third-party contractors rather than produced by their own employees.
   Further, our results indicate that locales tend to drop services more
   often when they are not commonly provided by peer jurisdictions,
   supporting the idea of diffusion. Conclusions. Our findings suggest
   that, despite a dearth of research undertaken, service termination is
   surprisingly common and widespread across service areas.},

Abstract = {The war on drugs' has been an important discursive and juridical tool
   for maintaining a spatialized order in the city. Scholars have gone to
   great lengths to document the victimization and exploitation of this
   war's victims' - primarily black and brown young men in cities across
   the globe. While applying a spatial analytic to understand the global
   effects of the war on drugs', it is also necessary to attend to the drug
   economy's situated, micro-practices of territory, politics, and
   governance. This paper contributes such an understanding by applying a
   feminist and urban geopolitical frame to understand the intimate
   practices of the drug war in US inner cities. It draws from a
   combination of ethnographic fieldwork and oral histories collected in
   Grays Ferry, Philadelphia, and offers a discursive analysis of local
   newspapers and policy documents to understand the framing of Grays Ferry
   as the front line of the war on drugs'. Through such a framing the city
   block becomes a site of contestation as the spaces targeted by the drug
   war also serve as spaces of survival for residents. Through a feminist
   analysis of the city block, I demonstrate the resistance to the drug war
   is a fight for survival by residents. ExtractoLa guerra contra las
   drogas' ha sido una importante herramienta discursiva y juridica para
   mantener un orden espacial en la ciudad. Los academicos no han
   escatimado esfuerzos para documentar la victimizacion y explotacion de
   las victimas' de esta guerra, principalmente hombres jovenes de raza
   negra y piel oscura en las ciudades de todo el mundo. Aunque mediante un
   analisis espacial es posible entender los efectos globales de la guerra
   contra las drogas', es tambien necesario prestar atencion a las micro
   practicas situadas de territorio, politica y gobernanza que caracterizan
   la economia de las drogas. Este articulo nos ayuda a entender esto
   empleando un marco feminista y geopolitico urbano con el objetivo de
   comprender las practicas intimas de la guerra contra las drogas en los
   barrios pobres de las ciudades estadounidenses. A partir de una
   combinacion del trabajo de campo etnografico y los relatos orales
   recogidos en Grays Ferry, Filadelfia, presento un analisis discursivo de
   los periodicos locales y los documentos politicos que explica el motivo
   de enmarcar a Grays Ferry como la primera linea de la guerra contra las
   drogas'. A traves de este enfoque, la zona urbana deprimida se convierte
   en un epicentro de confrontacion de la misma manera que los espacios que
   son el blanco de la guerra contra las drogas sirven tambien de espacios
   de supervivencia para los residentes. A traves de un analisis feminista
   de la zona urbana, demuestro que la resistencia a la guerra contra las
   drogas es una lucha por la supervivencia de los residentes.

   et juridique important pour assurer l'ordre spatial dans la ville. Les
   chercheurs ont fait de grands efforts afin de documenter la
   victimisation et l'exploitation des victimes' de cette guerre -
   principalement des jeunes hommes noirs et de couleur qui habitent en
   ville partout dans le monde. En appliquant une analytique spatiale pour
   comprendre les effets mondiaux de la guerre contre la drogue', il est
   toujours necessaire d'aborder au niveau micro les pratiques
   contextualisees de l'economie de la drogue quant au territoire, a la
   politique et a la gouvernance. Cet article contribue une telle
   comprehension en appliquant un cadre geopolitique feministe et urbain
   pour comprendre les pratiques minutieuses de la guerre contre la drogue
   dans les quartiers desherites des villes aux E-U. On puise dans une
   combinaison de travail ethnographique sur le terrain et d'histoires
   orales receuillis a Grays Ferry, a Philadelphie, et fournit une analyse
   discursive des journaux locaux et des documents politiques afin de
   comprendre l'elaboration de Grays Ferry comme la premiere ligne dans la
   guerre contre la drogue'. Grace a une telle elaboration, le quartier
   devient un lieu de contestation parce que les espaces vises par la
   guerre contre la drogue servent aussi d'espaces de survie pour les
   habitants. Au moyen d'une analyse feministe du quartier, on demontre que
   la resistance a la guerre contre la drogue constitue une lutte des
   habitants pour la survie.},

Abstract = {This article argues that coup-proofing does not necessarily reduce the
   general propensity among military officers to stage coups d'etat against
   authoritarian incumbents. Sophisticated coup-proofing terminates coup
   cascades and buys incumbent rulers time in office, but general coup risk
   remains high even if they maintain power for long periods of time. The
   article uses a new data set on coups in the Middle East and North Africa
   covering the period 1950-2013. The data reveal that the number of coup
   instances has decreased over time, but the risk for incumbents of
   falling to a coup during their extended time in office remains constant,
   even in coup-proofed autocracies. When autocrats apply coup-proofing
   measures, timing and agency become increasingly important. Plotters
   attempt coups either immediately after power turnovers or when
   incumbents turn into lame ducks after excessively long periods of rule.
   Success rates increase when coup plotters are supported by central
   military leaderships.},

Abstract = {Despite ongoing efforts to articulate radical methods and theoretical
   frameworks for social movement research, the field remains embedded in
   exploitative, oppressive, and hierarchical modes of knowledge
   production. Following Foucault, I argue that this is because societies
   like ours, founded through racial and patriarchal violence, are invested
   in a regime of truth supportive of that violence. In light of this, I
   argue that social movements scholars need to adopt a radically different
   form of knowledge practice. Building on anarchist, anti-racist feminist,
   and anti-colonial scholarship, this paper begins by analysing how
   liberalism constrains social justice organizing and how academic norms
   foreclose accountable social movements scholarship. I then introduce
   three unique ethics emerging in resistance to this situation:
   movement-relevant, anti-oppressive, and prefigurative. The first
   confronts the extractive imperatives of enlightenment truth-making; the
   second resists its neutral and disinterested tendencies; and the third
   models a rejection of its hierarchical and exclusive mode of authority.
   I argue that together they provide scholars with a strategy for
   re-/orienting their research towards what Foucault theorizes as an
   insurrection of knowledges. These three ethical frameworks combine to
   facilitate an insurrectionary power/knowledge that fosters collective
   struggle as it progressively dismantles the regime of truth underlying
   social movements research.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesTo understand the politics of population census in
   postconflict countries and salience of the categories imposed through
   census. By doing so, it seeks to shed light on the mechanisms of
   identity construction in the post-Yugoslav context.
   MethodsThe article analyzes the categories and the responses to
   post-Yugoslav censuses, focusing on national, religious, and linguistic
   identity markers.
   ResultsThe analysis shows that a varying, yet significant, share of the
   population refuses to identify according to the identity markers
   proposed by the state and promoted by key political actors.
   ConclusionThe article proposes a novel way of studying censuses and
   argues that even in a postconflict context national identities are less
   fixed than often supposed and highlights the need to focus more on
   nonconformist identities in postconflict settings.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveWe argue that the everyday nationalism approach is both useful
   and necessary for improving existing constructivist approaches in the
   comparative study of nationalism and ethnic politics.
   MethodsA meta-analysis of existing studies reveals pervasive conceptual
   and methodological problems of contemporary constructivist approaches.
   We consider the implications of replacing individuals or groups with
   ethnic or nationalist practices as units of analysis.
   ResultsEveryday nationalism promises to address the gap between
   constructivist theory and the methodological individualism of existing
   studies. This approach proceeds from ethnographic observation and
   utilizes methods reliant on observing societal interaction or relational
   meaning making for verification. We illustrate such a research strategy
   using examples of nationalist legitimation in authoritarian regimes and
   the ethnicization of economic development.
   ConclusionThe everyday nationalism approach promises to overcome the
   shortcomings in much contemporary constructivist work. The potential for
   developing qualitative data sets of nationalist or ethnic practices
   further promises to complement constructivist insights.},

Title = {The fantasy of access: Neoliberal ordering of a public beach},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {48},
Pages = {49-59},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Neoliberal governance has led to the progressive privatization and
   ordering of urban public spaces, restricting their use as domains of
   political expression and visible identity formation. While the processes
   of privatization have taken a variety of forms, the end result either
   produces new privately-owned spaces or restricts access and behavior in
   extant public space. A programmatic, bourgeois-public space emerges
   where a fantasy of open-access occludes the experience of exclusion.
   This fantasy of inclusive public space is upheld by dualistically
   countering its faux-democratic state management against private
   ownership. Though scholars have theorized the neoliberal production of
   public spaces elsewhere, this paradigm has rarely been applied to the
   large and proximate public beaches and coastlines that bound US lands.
   This paper seeks to complicate our understanding of the process of
   privatization by countering legal and experiential exclusions that
   govern access to beaches in Connecticut. A study of the Eastern Point
   beaches in Groton, Connecticut is used to analyze the impacts of a
   Connecticut Supreme Court case that struck down residents-only
   restricted beaches. Supported by empirical data from beachgoers at the
   small public and private beaches, the mechanics of exclusion are shown
   to hinge upon race class and locality. Though Connecticut beaches are
   now more legally inclusive, results from this research indicate that the
   ruling has had negligible effects upon the practice of social exclusion
   from the beach. Using anarchist theories of spatial practice, I suggest
   that a democratic public space can only be achieved through occupation
   and embodied resistance to neoliberal ordering. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Islamist parties' electoral performance is a hotly debated question. Two
   arguments dominate the literature in terms of Islamist parties'
   performance in democratic elections. The conventional argument has been
   the ``one man, one vote, one time{''} hypothesis. More recently, Kurzman
   and Naqvi challenge this argument and show that Islamists tend to lose
   in free elections rather than win them. We argue that existing arguments
   fall short. Specifically, we theorize that moderateness of Islamist
   platform plays a key role in increasing the popularity of these parties
   and leads to higher levels of electoral support. Using data collected by
   Kurzman and Naqvi, we test our hypothesis, controlling for political
   platform and political economic factors in a quantitative analysis. We
   find that there is empirical support for our theory. Islamist parties'
   support level is positively associated with moderateness; however, this
   positive effect of moderation is also conditioned by economic openness.},

Abstract = {Media attention is a crucial political resource for protest groups. This
   study examines the description of protests in Belgian television news.
   Specifically, it analyzes the degree to which the coverage of protests
   is episodic (event- or exemplar-oriented) or thematic (issue-oriented)
   and looks into the factors that drive these coverage types. Protest
   event data from police archives (Brussels; 2003-2010) are combined with
   detailed measures of television news content (public and private
   broadcasting) to analyze media description (N = 564). The results show
   that the coverage of protest is primarily thematic. Episodic coverage is
   dominated by coverage about the details of the event; exemplars are
   rarely used. Protests that are disruptive, staged by organizations with
   low media standing, and covered by the commercial station are more
   event-oriented. Reports of large demonstrations and reports with
   follow-up items contain more episodic-exemplar coverage. Results are
   discussed in light of the conditionality of the protest paradigm.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article is to reflect upon the role played by the Ford
   Foundation, a giant of American philanthropy in Latin America. The time
   frame spreads itself over four decades: since the first contact
   established by Henry Ford in Brazil in 1927, before the very birth of
   the Foundation, until the opening of the first official branch in Latin
   America at the beginning of the 60s. The analysis of the archive sources
   allows us to focus on two main issues, which are worth special
   attention. On the one hand, the type of ``modernizing{''} interest of
   the Foundation with respect to the American subcontinent, which did not
   consist of one simple transfer of American know-how orientated towards
   ``development{''}, but which had a more global objective of the
   exportation of the American way of life in a cultural, social and
   political sense. On the other hand, it highlights the broad context of
   the Cold War, in the sense of the multiple intersections that were
   showed by this modernizing interest with strictly political dynamics.},

Abstract = {Several scholars investigate the link between news media and political
   attitudes of citizens, showing that media exposure affects confidence in
   political institutions. Beginning from this perspective, we analyze
   trust in government in twenty-seven European countries, testing the
   interactive relationship between citizens' policy views and media slant.
   Under the assumption that news media bias content in the direction of
   their audiences or are compliant with potential influence exerted by the
   government, we use Eurobarometer survey data to measure the effects of
   the ideological slant of newspapers and public television on trust in
   government. Our results show that the pro- or antigovernment slant of
   media outlets interacts with the individual ideological views of each
   citizen and confirm that media act like echo-chambers that reinforce
   preexisting attitudes. Conversely, the consumption of
   counter-attitudinal information barely alters trust in government nor
   does it produce hostile media effects. We also find a slight difference
   between newspaper readers and public service broadcaster (PSB) users,
   which seems related to mechanisms of cognitive dissonance.},

Abstract = {The use of ``Big Data{''} in policy and decision making is a current
   topic of debate. The 2013 murder of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich,
   London, UK led to an extensive public reaction on social media,
   providing the opportunity to study the spread of online hate speech
   (cyber hate) on Twitter. Human annotated Twitter data was collected in
   the immediate aftermath of Rigby's murder to train and test a supervised
   machine learning text classifier that distinguishes between hateful
   and/or antagonistic responses with a focus on race, ethnicity, or
   religion; and more general responses. Classification features were
   derived from the content of each tweet, including grammatical
   dependencies between words to recognize ``othering{''} phrases,
   incitement to respond with antagonistic action, and claims of
   well-founded or justified discrimination against social groups. The
   results of the classifier were optimal using a combination of
   probabilistic, rule-based, and spatial-based classifiers with a voted
   ensemble meta-classifier. We demonstrate how the results of the
   classifier can be robustly utilized in a statistical model used to
   forecast the likely spread of cyber hate in a sample of Twitter data.
   The applications to policy and decision making are discussed.},

Abstract = {Participatory democracy was one of the core tenets of the New Left
   student movements that emerged in Australia in the 1960s. However, scant
   attention has been given to the idea within the literature on the New
   Left. This article examines an experiment in participatory democracy
   that took place in the Department of Philosophy at Sydney University in
   the 1970s. Following a series of strikes, the Philosophy department was
   split in two, with one half, the Department of General Philosophy,
   operating under a democratic constitution for six years from 1973 to
   1979. This case study reveals a great deal about the intellectual
   history of the student New Left and the centrality of participatory
   democracy within it.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {38},
Pages = {82-86},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Piketty's influential book Capital in the Twenty-First Century and its
   prominent review by Milanovic in the Journal of Economic Literature both
   assert the inevitability of an increasing share of capital in total
   income, given a higher rate of return to capital than the rate of growth
   in income. This paper shows by a specific example, a logical argument
   and its intuition that the alleged inevitability is not valid. Even just
   for capital to grow faster than income, we need an additional
   requirement that saving of non-capital income is larger than consumption
   of capital income. Even if this is satisfied, the capital share may not
   increase as the rate of return may fall and non-capital incomes may
   increase with capital accumulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis article explores how income inequality and social mobility
   affect attitudes about redistribution in global perspective.
   MethodsIndividual-level data on over 50,000 individuals from 38
   countries in the International Social Survey Programme are combined with
   country-level data from the World Bank, Standardized Income Inequality
   Database, and the Economic Freedom of the World data. OLS regression
   models with robust, clustered standard errors are estimated to account
   for the presence of unobserved, country-level effects in the error
   terms.
   ResultsSocial mobility is found to be a more important predictor of
   preferences for redistribution than income inequality. Specifically,
   those who live in countries with greater social mobility are more
   supportive of redistribution while individuals who have experienced
   upward mobility themselves are less supportive, although an upwardly
   mobile individual in a more mobile society is more supportive of
   redistribution than an upwardly mobile individual in a less mobile
   society.
   ConclusionsThe central finding of this study is that the tangibility of
   redistributive social policies may bolster support for social spending.
   The structures and institutions that facilitate upward mobilityand
   potentially attenuate some of the detrimental effects of income
   inequalityare generally the products of more comprehensive
   redistribution policies, and public opinion may reflect this.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates how terror threats and international openness
   affect the savings retention coefficient in the Feldstein-Horioka
   equation. We find that terrorism marginally increases the size of this
   coefficient, which may result from an increase in the precautionary
   saving motives. However, even a small increase in openness offsets this
   effect and significantly lowers the propensity to retain domestic
   savings for investment. This suggests that, given more channels, capital
   leaves domestic boundaries to land in safe places abroad. At least
   partly, the results explain the paradoxical finding in the literature
   that capital is more mobile in developing countries, even though they
   are less open. We also find that all types of terrorism reduce
   investment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how economic growth affects government spending in
   non-democracies. A robust finding is that positive growth induces a
   significant increase in defence spending but a decrease in non-defence
   spending in dictatorships, with little effect in democracies. Government
   spending is slightly sensitive to negative growth across regimes. Higher
   growth rate in a country than its neighbours induces more spending than
   their average. Corruption causes a reduction in defence spending but an
   increase in non-defence spending. Primary education stimulates
   non-defence spending but reduces defence expenditure, secondary
   education causing the opposite effect. An under-developed country spends
   less than a developed country. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Data on campaign contributions of PACs (political action committees) in
   the US does not contain the PACs' issues of concern. Additionally, while
   recent US lobbying data details the issues of concern for an interest
   group, it does not detail the Congressional representatives lobbied by
   the interest group. Expanding the time-frame of earlier work, I confirm
   that PACs engaging in lobbying and campaign contributions account for
   the majority of such political money despite representing a small
   minority of all PACs. I show how this allows the construction of a novel
   dataset that decomposes representative-specific contributions across
   issues as well as issue-specific lobbying expenditures across
   representatives. This decomposition can qualitatively affect results
   regarding the relationship between political money and Congressional
   voting behavior on trade policy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Left and right libertarians alike are attracted to the thesis of
   self-ownership (SO) because, as Eric Mack says, they believe that it
   best captures our common perception of the moral inviolability of
   persons'. Further, most libertarians, left and right, accept that some
   version of the Lockean Proviso (LP) restricts agents' ability to acquire
   worldly resources. The inviolability of SO purports to make
   libertarianism more appealing than its (non-libertarian) egalitarian
   counterparts, since traditional egalitarian theories cannot
   straightforwardly explain why, e.g. forced organ donation and forced
   labor are serious wrongs even when they generate more equitable outcomes
   or benefit the greater good. I argue that, when SO is coupled with LP,
   this appeal is unfounded. SO, as usually construed, allows for the
   possibility of justified incursions of non-culpable agents up to and
   including forced organ donation. I conclude by considering a few
   possible responses on behalf of the libertarian, assessing each one's
   plausibility.},

Abstract = {In December 2008, the killing of a fifteen-year-old boy by the Greek
   police triggered the country's worst civil unrest in decades and an
   outbreak of rage and violence, which turned into a wider protest
   expressing deep popular discontent and frustration with ageing problems
   in the country. Through a content analysis of themes appearing in eight
   media of different genre and political orientation, and using solely
   images as units of analysis, this paper examines the visual framing of
   these protests and its function in the public screen. The findings show
   that two frames are used to imply a distinction between Us (as normal
   citizens who protest peacefully) and Them (as `hooded hooligans' who
   protest violently).},

Abstract = {The conceptual evolution of borders has been characterised by important
   changes in the last twenty years. After the processual shift of the
   1990s (from border to bordering), in recent years there has been
   increasing concern about the need to critically question the current
   state of the debate on the concept of borders. Within this framework,
   this article explores the critical potential of the borderscapes concept
   for the development of alternative approaches to borders along three
   main axes of reflection that, though interrelated, can be analytically
   distinguished as: epistemological, ontological and methodological. Such
   approaches show the significant potential of borderscapes for future
   advances of critical border studies in the era of globalisation and
   transnational flows, thereby contributing to the liberation of
   (geo)political imagination from the burden of the `territorialist
   imperative' and to the understanding of new forms of belonging and
   becoming that are worth being investigated.},

Abstract = {Massimiliano Tomba's book, Marx's Temporalities, stresses the centrality
   of the body for the critique of exploitation and suggests that a new
   phenotype is produced by consumerism and by the dynamic of capitalist
   accumulation, with its plural temporalities. However, both the body of
   the worker and the new phenotype do not appear to have a sex or a gender
   in Tomba's book. In this intervention, I read some of Tomba's insights
   about the body, the new phenotype, and primary accumulation in the light
   of a critical gender and feminist perspective.},

Booktitle = {ASHGATE RESEARCH COMPANION TO MILITARY ETHICS},
Series = {Justice International Law and Global Security},
Year = {2015},
Pages = {371-382},
Abstract = {In the Christian tradition-and the secular thought it has shaped-the
   proper goal of just war is peace. This follows from the characteristic
   prominence of the themes of forgiveness and reconciliation in Christian
   ethics. Accordingly, to be morally justified, war must include among its
   aims reconciliation with the enemy, repudiating any interest in their
   suffering or annihilation as such. Since a just war's immediate goal is
   to rectify injustice, it is punitive; but since that rectification
   includes ultimate reconciliation, it is not vindictive. Insofar as it
   intends reconciliation with the enemy and regards them with compassion,
   just war is forgiving and so qualified by love. Nevertheless, the
   interpersonal paradigms of love, forgiveness, and reconciliation should
   be distinguished from their weaker political or inter-state analogues.
   The peace intended by just war is better specified as political
   ``accommodation{''} or ``co-existence{''} than ``reconciliation.{''} The
   intention of political coexistence usually shapes military action
   indirectly by constraining its belligerent means. Sometimes, however,
   armed forces can be directly engaged in diplomatic efforts to persuade a
   hostile enemy into peaceful politics.},

Abstract = {Targeted killing has become a frequently used and highly controversial
   tool of operational counterterrorism. This chapter analyzes the
   international law applicable to targeted killing, both during armed
   conflict and as a tool of offensive counterterrorism outside of armed
   conflict. In particular, this discussion highlights key legal and policy
   debates regarding: the authority to use lethal force, the identification
   of legitimate targets and enemy personnel, the consequences of civilian
   participation in such strikes, and the nature and parameters of the
   rules governing the conduct of strikes. Beyond the legal issues, the
   practice of targeted killing also raises significant questions regarding
   the appropriate measures of transparency and accountability that should
   be provided regarding the legal authority for strikes and the civilian
   harm caused.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the rent-seeking process in small, remote
   economies, considering the case of the French overseas territories. We
   first present stylized facts about the functioning of these economies
   and societies. We particularly show how these facts combine themselves
   to create economies wherein most of the actors depend on protection and
   rents. A theoretical model is further presented that explains the -
   otherwise apparently weird - alliance between labour and capital to
   support protection demands, founding endemic rent seeking behaviours.},

Booktitle = {ASHGATE RESEARCH COMPANION TO MILITARY ETHICS},
Series = {Justice International Law and Global Security},
Year = {2015},
Pages = {59-71},
Abstract = {The doctrine of anticipatory self-defense allows a state to ``beat his
   opponent to the draw,{''} attacking before a declaration of hostility
   under certain clearly defined circumstances. For such an action to
   qualify as preemption, the overriding concern is immediacy: preemptive
   self-defense is military action in the face of an immediate threat of
   attack. This immediate threat provides the justifying cause. Lacking it,
   the use of armed force in anticipatory self-defense is preventive, not
   preemptive, and is both morally and legally of a different character.
   New developments including the development of jus ad vim, or actions
   short of war, as well as the involvement of non-state actors in
   conflict, present new challenges to an understanding of anticipatory
   self-defense. In particular, post-9/11 applications of the Bush Doctrine
   have led to increasing claims for anticipatory self-defense, leading
   some to conclude that the principle has created more ethical problems
   than it solves, including the increased prevalence of warfare and a less
   robust understanding of when attacking first is appropriate or morally
   justified.},

   EGALITARIANISM},
Year = {2015},
Pages = {249-270},
Abstract = {One of the central motifs of G. A. Cohen's work was his opposition to
   capitalism in the name of justice. This motif was fully in view in
   Cohen's work on Robert Nozick's libertarianism: Cohen carefully
   reconstructed and relentlessly criticized Nozick's apologetics of the
   free market, which, he thought, was internally coherent but
   unconvincing. This chapter suggests that Cohen's opposition to
   libertarianism did not, however, go far enough, and identifies two
   respects in which Cohen's position could and should have been more
   critical of that philosophy.
   The first concerns Cohen's negative agenda, that is, his critique of
   Nozick's libertarianism, the second Cohen's more positive agenda, the
   formulation of his egalitarian view. With regard to the first, this
   chapter argues that Cohen did not subject to full critical pressure the
   idea of self-ownership libertarians endorse, and consequently accorded
   it greater inequality-engendering power than libertarians may claim for
   it. With regard to the second point, this chapter suggests that Cohen
   implicitly assumed a market-friendly answer to the question of what
   consequences people who make choices should be held responsible for,
   which he could and should have questioned.},

Journal = {HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {3-22},
Abstract = {The first three sections of this lecture address the need for better
   historical-materialist theorisations of capitalist competition,
   capitalist classes and capitalist states, and in particular the
   institutional dimensions of these which is fundamental for understanding
   why and how capitalism has survived into the twenty-first century. The
   fourth section addresses historical materialism's under-theorisation of
   the institutional dimensions of working-class formation, and how this
   figures in explaining why, despite the expectations of the founders of
   historical materialism, the working classes have not, at least yet,
   become capitalism's gravediggers. While recognising that a better
   historical materialism along these lines will not necessarily provide us
   with a GPS route to a socialist world beyond capitalism, it does suggest
   a number of guidelines for socialist strategy, with which the lecture
   concludes. This includes the need for building new institutions capable
   of defining, mobilising and representing the working class broadly, as
   well as recognising that the types of parties that can transform working
   classes into leading agents of social transformation have yet to be
   invented. A strategic priority must be to start anew at creating the
   kinds of working-class political institutions which can rekindle the
   socialist imagination, and develop the socialist capacities to get
   there.},

Year = {2015},
Pages = {201-211},
Abstract = {During the Gulf War of 1990-1 and the war against Yugoslavia in 1999,
   air forces of the U.S.-led coalitions attacked dual-use targets:
   infrastructure such as electrical generation and transmission systems,
   bridges and other transportation sites, communications facilities, and
   other infrastructure with both civilian and military application. Some
   hold that many dual-use targets should be put off-limits to attack in
   future conflicts due to the effect on civilians whereas others argue
   that attacks on dual-use facilities offer an opportunity to wage war
   more efficiently and humanely than by targeting only fielded military
   forces. This chapter summarizes the arguments made for and against more
   restrictive rules on targeting dual-use facilities and puts these in the
   context of the broader principles of jus in bello. To this end, it first
   analyzes what constitutes a dual-use target; second, it looks at what
   defines a military target and makes somebody or something liable to
   attack; and third, it shows how differing concepts of liability play
   into the debate about dual-use targets.},

Abstract = {Suleymanlis belonged to the first Turk migrants in Western Europe who
   established religious organizations, provided Islamic education for
   children, and created facilities for ritual prayer. They paved the way
   for other movements to follow As followers of the Turkish teacher
   Suleyman Hilmi Tunahan, they understood the importance of providing
   religious service to migrants, even if they would be in Europe
   temporarily. In the first decades of migration the movement was rather
   closed to the outside world. Today they have successfully created their
   own spiritual, quietist niche in the Turkish Islamic landscape. They
   continue to focus primarily on educational activities. The younger
   generation who is now in charge in most of the local organizations is
   generally well-educated and more ready to engage with the surrounding
   society.},

Year = {2015},

Pages = {50-63},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {There is widespread agreement within academic literature that the NSDAP
   systematically and effectively targeted the rural areas beginning with
   the Agrarian Crisis in 1927/8. However, one issue is left unresolved:
   were specific levels of agricultural strata differently attracted to the
   Nazis, and if so, how? In light of the economic and political incentives
   offered to German peasants with differing farm sizes, we expect that
   regions characterized by middle peasants were most likely to have
   electorally swung in a distinct, asymmetric and relevant way towards the
   Nazis. In order to test this hypothesis, we have used a country-wide
   data set, which includes the original categories of `parcel peasants'
   (0-2 ha), `small-sized' (2-5 ha) and `medium-sized' farmers (5-20 ha).
   These specific classifications were introduced and behaviorally
   legitimated by the Statistical Office of the Weimar Republic at that
   time. We present the first analysis applying generalized additive models
   (GAM) for the assessment of ecological relations. In order to account
   for the construction of political spaces and therefore of spatial
   dependencies, we offer a new mechanism based on stipulations of the
   electoral system. Even after controlling for pre-established impact
   factors (Protestantism, urbanization, etc.) and for spatial effects, we
   identify a clear impact of the agrarian middle classes (5-20 ha) on the
   Nazi vote beginning with the election in July 1932. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {Philosophers and social scientists have recently turned to game theory
   and agent-based models to better understand social contract formation.
   The stag hunt game is an idealization of social contract formation.
   Using the stag hunt game, we attempt to determine what, if any, barrier
   diversity is to the formation of an efficient social contract. We
   uncover a deep connection between tolerance, diversity, and the social
   contract. We investigate a simple model in which individuals possess
   salient traits and behave cooperatively when the difference between
   their trait and the trait of their counterpart is less than their
   tolerance level'. If traits are fixed and correspond to permanent or
   semipermanent features of the individual, such as religion or race,
   social contract formation is a remote possibility. If traits are
   malleable, social contract formation is possible but comes at the steep
   cost of diversity and tolerance, that is, individuals are unwilling to
   cooperate with those much different from themselves. Yet homogeneity and
   intolerance are not a long-term feature of the population. Over time
   mutations allow for increasingly tolerant agents to prosper, thereby
   ushering in trait diversity. In the end, all reap the benefits of
   cooperation.},

Abstract = {Condorcet polling provides additional information about pairwise
   rankings often obscured in standard polls when there are three or more
   candidates. This paper analyzes an original dataset collected from Duke
   University students in North Carolina concerning the 2014 Senate race,
   wherein a Democrat, a Republican, and a Libertarian contested the
   election. The results illustrate that Condorcet polling is feasible in
   such a context, and that the information provided changes the strategic
   calculus of voters in ways that may have a positive impact on the way
   votes are cast and choices considered.},

Abstract = {I develop a positive theory of sovereignty that is rooted in political
   exchange. The key concept I use to characterize sovereignty is
   self-enforcing exchange of political rights. I conclude that a sovereign
   is an individual or body party to political exchange that does not rest
   on third-party enforcement. Importantly, sovereignty is an emergent
   phenomenon, defined in the process of bargains between holders of
   political power. I describe how political bargains within and across
   polities influences the distribution of political rights characterized
   by sovereignty, and I conclude by showing how my conception of
   sovereignty is compatible with theoretical understanding, and practical
   existence, of polycentric governance.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {39},
Pages = {25-40},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper studies the political economy of realignments to fixed
   exchange rates and suggests that the use of realignments is less likely
   when there are political benefits from stable exchange rates and when
   linkages across other issue areas increase the costs of realignment.
   More specifically for the case of the European Monetary System (EMS),
   the expectation is that realignments are related to partisanship,
   support for the broader European integration, trade integration,
   resource transfers from the European Community, as well as countries
   reacting to the political and economic costs of realignment in other EMS
   members. Hypotheses are tested using binomial logit models on monthly
   data on exchange rate realignments for all EMS countries from 1979 to
   1993. I find lower realignment risk for left wing policy-makers and
   countries with more trade links to Germany, whereas more intra-European
   Community resource transfers appear to go to countries facing higher
   realignment risk. Also, realignments are less likely when the rest of
   EMS member countries have stable international reserves and their
   governments are pro-European. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Both analysis of international trade and the knowledge resource theory
   of the firm imply that language skills should play a vital role in
   exporting. This may be apparent to large multinationals with sites in
   many different linguistic locations, but we show it is less obvious to
   smaller companies. With data on the language used by each of a large
   sample of European small- and medium-sized enterprises in their export
   markets, we test and estimate the effects of language assets on language
   performance in export markets and on export sales. Controlling for the
   possibility that language skills may be acquired by exporting, we find a
   very substantial export return to linguistic expertise, indicative of
   unexploited gains from investment in languages. There is also evidence
   of greater under-investment in language skills in English-speaking
   Europe.},

Title = {Political cycle and reported labour incomes in Italy: Quasi-experimental
   evidence on tax evasion},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {39},
Pages = {269-280},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Tax evasion is a complex phenomenon affected by many factors and shaped
   by policymakers' and citizens' behaviours. Distinct claims about the
   acceptability of tax evasion between centre-right and centre-left
   coalitions have clearly emerged in Italy in the last decades. According
   to the ruling coalition, these different attitudes could have influenced
   tax compliance, affecting reported incomes of the self-employed, who
   have much more room to engage in tax avoidance or evasion strategies
   than employees. Using a longitudinal administrative dataset recording
   the entire working life of the sampled individuals, we focus on the
   period 1996-2005 (the only period when a complete bipartisan political
   cycle took place in Italy) and, following a difference in differences
   design and carrying out fixed effects estimates, we test whether
   self-employed earnings, compared to employees earnings, significantly
   changed after the change in the ruling coalition. We find a clear
   reduction in self-employed reported earnings when the centre-right
   coalition ruled.

Abstract = {Political interest fundamentally influences political behavior,

   Carpini \& Keeter, 1996; Luskin, 1990; Zukin, Andolina, Keeter, Jenkins,
   \& Delli Carpini, 2006). Since the early 1960s, the American National
   Election Studies (ANES) has sought to measure respondents' general
   interest in politics by asking them how often they follow public
   affairs. In this article, we uncover novel sources of measurement error
   concerning this question. We first show that other nationally
   representative surveys that frequently use this item deliver drastically
   higher estimates of mass interest. We then use a survey experiment
   included on a wave of the ANES' Evaluating Government and Society
   Surveys (EGSS) to explore the influence of question order in explaining
   this systemic gap in survey results. We show that placing batteries of
   political participation questions or feeling thermometer items before
   this measure significantly influences reports of mass interest.
   Ultimately, the results reported here serve as further caution on the
   use of this measure.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND RELIGION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {544-564},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article argues that a new form of religious freedom is emerging
   within the contentious field of United States politics today. Despite
   the commitment to separating church and state that is characteristic of
   American secularism, implementation of the new religious freedom appears
   likely to contribute to processes that are actively reshaping religious
   and political landscapes. Recent US Supreme Court cases such as
   Hosanna-Tabor v. EEOC and Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, Inc. present clear
   examples and this article uses the former case to bring the dynamics of
   the new religious freedom to light. The push for religious freedom in
   contemporary United States law and politics should be assessed in terms
   of its transformative consequences in both ``religious{''} and
   ``political{''} spheres. These consequences include refashioning
   religious communities as increasingly hierarchical and isolated
   enclaves, undermining the rights and freedoms of citizens, and further
   fracturing the public sphere.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the historical meanings of the assertion of the
   catholic unity of the Spanish nation by the 19th Century liberalism.
   From the starting point of recent assumptions, which renovate the
   knowledge of the relationships between religion, politics and the
   nation, the authors consider the wide range of meanings of the
   illustrated legacy in the 18th Century and the confessional uniformity,
   enacted by the sovereign nation that the Constitution of 1812 had
   outlined. Religious denominationalism didn't prevent any possibility of
   individual emancipation. On the contrary, early liberalism tended to
   mutually reinforce both identities, religious and national. At the same
   time, early liberals were confident that the new social conditions,
   enacted by liberal governments, should broaden gradually the operational
   range for the free individuals. Under queen Isabel II liberals kept hope
   on this way to the progress in confessional matters. However, the
   situation in the mid-19th Century led progressive liberals to a new
   expression of their ideas, that weakened their former postulates
   concerning individual emancipation and the citizens' ability to choice},

Abstract = {Why has the military dimension of the US-Japan relationship remained the
   central point of reference for Japanese foreign relations, despite the
   demise of the Soviet Union? Why has Japan, deepening economic
   interdependence notwithstanding, remained politically distant from East
   Asia? Based on analysis of statements by Japanese and US political
   elites and academics regarding the US-Japan alliance, this article
   argues that the rise of China, coterminous with the rise of `Asia',
   challenges the notion of the `West' as, according to standards of
   industrial modernity, a superior social and political order. These
   moving ideational boundaries question Japan's position as the most
   advanced Asian nation and member of the (Western) international society
   of states. Therefore, the US-Japan alliance has since the mid-1990s
   become increasingly important for securing Japan in the `West' and the
   `West's boundaries in East Asia.},

   Gordon Tullock, and the Bloomington or Institutional Analysis and
   Development school, centered on Elinor Ostrom and Vincent Ostrom. We
   apply the perspectives of each school to issues of intellectual property
   and develop new insights, questions, and focuses of attention. We also
   explore tensions and synergies between the two schools on issues of
   intellectual property.},

Abstract = {This article analyses a recent media campaign by Animals Australia and
   the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in
   association with the Australian Broadcasting Commission which exposed
   the cruelties of the live animal export trade in Australia. The
   television story `A Bloody Business' aired by the country's leading
   investigative programme Four Corners caused an immediate and
   unprecedented expression of anger by thousands of viewers who were
   horrified by the spectacle of Australian cattle being abused in a number
   of Indonesian abattoirs. The focus of the article is on the activists'
   campaign to ban the trade and in so doing both confirms and challenges a
   number of social movement theories and concepts. As a classic `hot
   cognition' issue, the moral crusade seemed destined to succeed such was
   the publicity the programme generated. However, an increasingly nervous
   and vulnerable government lifted its temporary ban on the trade only a
   month after the controversy began. The paper suggests why this initially
   promising media campaign failed to pressure the government to
   permanently ban the trade and how the activists might utilise ideas from
   the social movement literature to their advantage in their continuing
   campaign.},

Abstract = {This paper reconsiders forest biodiversity valuation, and the extent to
   which information affects the value individuals attach to forest
   biodiversity attributes. A choice,experiment design was applied to the
   survey protocol. A split-sample technique was then used out to obtain
   two datasets. The first dataset corresponds to the choices from
   individuals who responded to the neutral survey protocol. The second
   dataset was obtained from the same choice sets as for the neutral survey
   protocol, but the survey used also specific information to respondents
   on each biodiversity attribute. We then applied the latent class
   approach to ascertain preference heterogeneity according to respondents'
   environmental knowledge and sensitiveness to issues of biodiversity. We
   found that willingness to pay (WTP) values were higher for
   ``familiar{''} respondents, i.e., those who make regular use of forests
   and are more sensitive to biodiversity concerns, as opposed to
   ``unfamiliar{''} participants. For the former, giving more information
   had an influence on choices. For the latter, giving more information
   increased WTP for preferred. biodiversity attribute levels. We then
   concluded that giving specific information on biodiversity to the public
   does affect preferences. However, environmental sensitiveness combined
   with forest use constitutes the main explanatory variables of higher
   WTP.},

Abstract = {Several Australian universities have research, publications, subjects,
   programmes of study, or even Centres focusing on Europe and the European
   Union (EU), but European and EU studies in Australia have also
   encountered significant challenges. This article analyses their
   evolution from 1987 to 2014 and the sometimes discordant EU and
   Australian policies which have shaped their development. It first
   examines the origins of European Studies Centres in Australia, as well
   as links with the European University Institute (EUI) in Florence and
   the creation of the Contemporary European Studies Association of
   Australia (CESAA). It then considers specific EU initiatives and funding
   in the twenty-first century, such as EU Centres and Jean Monnet Chairs,
   and the impact they have had on EU studies in Australia. It concludes
   with reflections about the factors that have encouraged or impeded
   teaching and research on Europe and the EU in Australia and ways to
   mitigate them.},

Abstract = {Pre-natal-diagnosis technologies allow parents to discover whether their
   child is likely to suffer from serious disability. One argument for
   state funding of access to such technologies is that doing so would be
   cost-effective, in the sense that the expected financial costs of such a
   programme would be outweighed by expected benefits, stemming from the
   births of fewer children with serious disabilities. This argument is
   extremely controversial. This paper argues that the argument may not be
   as unacceptable as is often assumed. In doing so, it sets out a more
   general framework for assessing the relevance of efficiency calculations
   to policy-making. The final section also investigates the relationship
   between the paper's arguments and claims about parental responsibility
   for child-bearing and rearing, with reference to Scanlon's work on
   substantive responsibility.},

Abstract = {In this chapter, I delineate three central moral frameworks from which
   arguments for the use for force can be garnered-the just-war doctrine,
   the Responsibility to Protect norm, and a framework to govern the use of
   limited force-jus ad vim. Taking the United States' use of force since
   the fall of the Berlin Wall-ranging from acts short of war (limited air
   strikes, drone strikes, and no-fly zones) to full-scale war for the sake
   of regime change-as an illustrative case study, I elucidate the
   renegotiation of the just-war doctrine, the emergence of the
   Responsibility to Protect norm, as well as highlighting the need for a
   framework of jus ad vim.},

Abstract = {Nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction (WMD) will be a part of
   our world for the foreseeable future. This chapter will concern itself
   with questions that arise from the possession and potential use of WMD.
   I will first examine the possibility of a WMD use that is both
   proportionate and indiscriminate, then look at three likely scenarios in
   which the use of WMD may be justifiable: to destroy WMD arsenals,
   particularly biological and chemical weapons, to destroy deeply buried
   targets which are impervious to conventional attack, and to deny
   ultimate victory to an adversary. I will also consider the need to have
   all WMD use conform to the jus post bellum and the continuing debate
   about just nuclear deterrence.},

Abstract = {The paper analyses young people's interpretation of the past, evaluation
   of the present and political behaviour patterns based on semi-structured
   interviews (n=60) conducted in two contrasting constellations of
   modernization, Sopron and Ozd. First the perception of the most pressing
   social and political problems, second the potential of political and
   civic actions are compared. Finally an attempt is made to outline a
   ``hopeless{''} and an ``indifferent{''} idealtype of political culture.
   Together they create the opportunity for both the birth of
   antidemocratic tendencies and the space in which they can evolve. In
   this sense they provide the preconditions for ``mainstreaming the
   extreme{''} that is the incubation of radicalism in Hungary.},

Abstract = {Mayor Robert F. Wagner constructed an interest group coalition to
   support the extension of social services in New York and an increase in
   the size and scope of local government. Mayor Wagner also increased the
   administrative strength of local government by reforming and
   professionalizing city agencies, and developing policy and budget
   capacity within the office of the mayor. Mayor Wagner allowed city
   workers to organize unions, established the municipal hospital system,
   increased education spending and built public housing. While Mayor
   Wagner initially partnered with Tammany Hall leader Carmine De Sapio in
   the 1950s, tensions mounted as the mayor sought to establish his
   independence from the city's political party leaders, and to avoid
   traditional patronage politics at a time when reformers were growing
   increasingly unhappy with clubhouse politics.},
