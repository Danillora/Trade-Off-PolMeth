Abstract = {China and Russia have devoted significant resources to developing their
   international broadcasting capacity as an instrument of public
   diplomacy. Focusing on CCTV-N (China) and RT (Russia), this article
   discusses the strategies each has developed to communicate with
   international audiences and further the foreign policy ambitions of
   policy makers in Beijing and Moscow. It highlights the differences
   between the two stations - namely CCTV-N's ambition to rectify perceived
   distortions in the global flow of news about China, and RT's focus on
   reporting events in the US. Hence the case studies expose the fine line
   between propaganda and public diplomacy.},

Abstract = {The right-making properties of wars, if there are any, have been
   scrutinized in Just War Theory. Recently, authors have turned to a blind
   spot in that context: Just War Theory has started to focus on moral
   implications of warfare regarding soldiers who fight a war. In this
   contribution, we reconstruct that recent turn of normative theory
   towards the soldier. We argue that in order to give a conclusive account
   of the moral implications of the soldier's actions, it is necessary to
   include religion. Religion is not only part of the motivational setting
   of `the committed soldier'; it is also an important institutional factor
   in realizing war. In order to explain the various functions of religion,
   we discuss examples of religiously committed soldiers in World War I.
   Research in this context reveals clusters of personal religious
   convictions, a religiously founded culture of comradeship, and a visible
   organization of collectivity in terms of religious institutions. Our
   claim is that this acknowledgment of religion contributes to another
   theoretical twist in Just War Theory.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {There is increasing international concern about the growth of organized
   crime in Africa. Important criminal organizations and professional
   criminals are present in Africa, but we argue that the term ``organized
   crime{''} is not a very useful description of their activity, since what
   we are actually witnessing is a reformulation of politics and crime into
   networks that transcend the state/non-state boundary in ways that are
   hardly subsumed in standard concepts of organized crime. Similar
   processes are taking place in various parts of the world, and thus
   African countries are not exceptional in this regard. The process,
   however, does take particular forms in Africa that arise out of the
   histories of individual countries. The article describes the evolution
   in countries as diverse as Libya, Guinea-Bissau, and Zimbabwe of a
   market for protection, as business people - legitimate and otherwise -
   seek protection for their activities and their personnel. This market
   for protection is created by making private arrangements, often with
   state officials working in private capacities. The implications are
   profound: they could amount to a new mode of governance connecting
   Africa to international markets and institutions in which the
   distinctions between licit and illicit economic activity become
   difficult to detect.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},

Volume = {63},

Abstract = {What does the value of political equality imply for the institutional
   design of democracies? The existing normative literature highlights the
   importance of proportional representation and legislative majority rule,
   but neglects the choice of an executive format. This paper explores two
   potential egalitarian trade-offs in this choice. First, while
   presidential systems tend to achieve too little bundling of separable
   decision-making issues (within political parties), parliamentary systems
   often tend towards too much bundling (between political parties), thus
   establishing informal veto positions in the democratic process. This is
   a trade-off between the adversarial' and deliberative' aspects of
   equality. Second, there is a trade-off between horizontal' and vertical'
   equality. Neither pure presidentialism nor pure parliamentarism may be
   able to maximise both dimensions of equality simultaneously. The paper
   argues that certain hybrids between parliamentarism and presidentialism
   have the potential to mitigate both trade-offs. These hybrids establish
   power separation between the executive and legislature without allowing
   for popular executive elections. The argument also has potential
   implications for the democratisation of the European Union.},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of politics on governmental rule
   production. Traditionally, explanations of rule dynamics have focused on
   nonpolitical factors such as the self-evolvement of rules, environmental
   factors, and decision maker attributes. This article develops a set of
   hypotheses about when, why, and how political factors shape changes in
   the stock of rules. Furthermore, we test these hypotheses on a unique,
   new data set based on all Danish primary legislation and administrative
   rules from 1989 to 2011 categorized into 20 different policy domains.
   The analysis shows that the traditional Weberian ``rules breed rules{''}
   explanations must be supplemented with political explanations that take
   party ideology and changes in the political agenda into account.
   Moreover, the effect of political factors is indistinguishable across
   changes in primary laws and changes in administrative rules, a result
   that challenges the depiction of the latter rule-making process as more
   or less disconnected from the political domain.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to bring together approaches to sociospatial theorising
   with debates on the EU's international role. It points to a general lack
   of engagement with the spatial underpinnings of EU geopolitical agency,
   citing the example of four visions for Europe in the world' from the
   EU's key spatial think tank (ESPON). Moreover, this paper illustrates
   how EU geopolitical agency can be better understood when examined in its
   historical and sociospatial context. Space is not defined as physical
   space, but as socially produced spaces of interaction within which
   different actors stand in particular relations to each other. Through
   the history of European integration, the EU can most effectively
   exercise influence if such spaces of interaction are regulated and
   institutionalised, as opposed to disordered and anarchic. Regulated
   spaces of interaction are therefore a key parameter of EU geopolitical
   agency and, consequently, the promotion thereof a key objective of EU
   external relations.},

Abstract = {This article operationalizes an underinvestigated element of the
   Advocacy Coalition Frameworkthe devil shifton the controversial issue of
   water privatization. In doing so, it offers a methodological premise for
   investigating intractable opposition to policies that are politically
   salient and high in technical content. It uses the Q methodology on the
   case of Jakarta, Indonesia to uncover seven discourse coalitions within
   the anti-privatization groups. They confirm two key hypotheses within
   the devil shift, namely the underestimation of a coalition's resources
   compared with their opponents and the exaggeration of opponents'
   unreasonableness. Intriguingly, it finds that the devil is constructed
   in three different ways by this coalitionthe profiteer, the Goliath, and
   the ineffectual governor. The narrative strength of the combination of
   these beliefs answers an apparent paradox in the devil shift viz that of
   rational actors persisting in unreasonable beliefs concerning their
   opponents. It also offers some specific solutions on how to deal with
   public hostility in water privatization in Jakarta.},

Abstract = {States and international organizations have found irresistible cause in
   a globalizing world to coopt nonstate actors (NGOs, private standard
   setters and so forth) to manage the manifold problems arising under
   their stretched mandates and resources. The pooling of capacities in the
   pursuit of common goals seems perfectly sensible. Yet although the
   strategy of cooptation has become a policy of choice, policy makers
   often lack full knowledge of its implications. As Philip Selznick first
   showed, cooptation can have unintended consequences, shifting leadership
   from one organization to another. We place this fertile insight in a
   better specified analytical framework. That is, one capable of
   explaining when and how leadership shifts occur and where the status quo
   leaders will remain at the helm. Using original interview data and
   structured focused comparisons to test the framework, we reveal dramatic
   variation in leadership changes following the cooptation of outside
   actors in global financial and environmental governance.},

Abstract = {This article is a short introduction to a special section on economic
   ideas and the political construction of the financial crash. It begins
   by explaining why economic ideas and the politics of appeals to certain
   ideas are so integral to the historical significance of the crash of
   2008 and the question of whether it can be considered a crisis at all.
   The first section covers the literature on ideas and economic crisis.
   The second section highlights that the contribution of the special
   section is to engage in a stock-taking exercise of the empirical and
   conceptual patterns concerning the politics of ideational change
   underway in the areas of: comparative fiscal policy; monetary policy and
   Euro zone debt management; capital controls; and financial and
   securities market regulation and standard setting. The final section
   outlines the structure and content of the contents of the section
   articles.},

Abstract = {In order for the democratic process to work properly, it is vital that
   the public pays attention to politics and signals its opinions and
   preferences back to its representatives; if this is not the case,
   representatives have less incentive to represent. This article deals
   with the question of whether and how the public responds to welfare
   policy change. The thermostatic model departs from the assumption that
   the public responds to policy change with negative feedback, in relation
   to its preferred level of policy. The empirical analysis tests this
   model on public responses following the implementation of a consumer's
   choice model in Swedish primary health care. Did the reform trigger a
   thermostatic response from the public, and how should this be
   interpreted? A contribution in relation to previous research is the
   inclusion of ideological orientation and proximity, variables which, I
   argue, condition the nature and direction of public responsiveness. The
   study was designed as a natural experiment in which preferences of
   privatization of health care were measured before and after the health
   care reform of 2009/2010. The results provide partial support for the
   thermostatic model: preferences for further privatization decrease after
   the reform, but primarily within one subgroup. Additionally, public
   responses are demonstrated to vary according to ideological orientation,
   where the right-oriented react thermostatically and the left-oriented do
   not. The article contributes to a further understanding of the relation
   between policymaking and public opinion and to the expansion of
   thermostatic theory.},

Title = {The British National Security Strategy: Security after Representation},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICS \& INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Research Highlights and Abstract This article Contributes to the debate
   on British Foreign and Security Policy; Contributes to the literature on
   the British National Security Strategy; Links international relations
   literature with domestic policy formation literature; Introduces the
   concept of legitimacy' to foreign and security policy analysis.
   The publication of the Britain's first National Security Strategy (NSS)
   in 2008 marked a formal shift away from the secret state of the Cold War
   to the highly public protective state of today. This article is
   interested in the question of why the NSS and related framework have
   taken this particular public and explicit form. Both mainstream and
   critically minded academics have argued that contemporary security
   discourses and policies are techniques of power and governance and that
   the public nature of the policies is vital to this function. In this
   article, I argue that there has been a transformation in the nature of
   the British state from a representative state in which the state's
   authority was legitimated through a number of political mechanisms of
   representation, to one in which state elites and institutions need to
   forge new kinds of relationships with the governed. This is a key
   development that has been noticed in political, sociological and legal
   theoretical literature but as yet hardly addressed in international
   relations and security studies. This transformation of the state, I will
   argue, is intimately linked to the form and content of contemporary
   security policies. The contemporary state is undergoing a process of an
   erosion of legitimacy, which has a direct impact upon the capacity of
   the state to govern. In this context, policies take on the role of
   trying to bridge the legitimacy gap. I will argue that this shift in the
   state leads to a different understanding of contemporary security
   policies as representative of a decreasing ability to govern security, a
   state that is losing legitimacy and authority; that is in effect, losing
   its sovereignty. This article argues that British national security
   strategies and policies are representative of this.},

Abstract = {Class analysis has never gone out of fashion in Ukraine, but it has been
   conducted in ways that limit its effectiveness and ability to make sense
   of the world. It is marked by four aspects inherited from Soviet times:
   a focus on large-scale surveys offering only surface presentations of
   findings, a gradational rather than relational orientation to class,
   unwillingness to engage with subjective experiences of class, and a
   tendency towards functional legitimation of the existing order. Data
   showing significant transformation of social structure and high levels
   of inequality tend to be presented with little consideration of its
   meaning for people's lives. The absence of serious theoretical
   reflection, deep ethnographic analysis, or studies of class relations
   and power constitute significant handicaps for Ukrainian sociology. A
   recently created group of young sociologists gathered around the journal
   and website Commons/Spilne has been seeking to overcome these
   limitations. Embracing public sociology's aim of producing reflexive
   knowledge for academic and non-academic audiences alike, this new
   milieu, with its creators trained in western universities and engaged
   with Marxist social science and left-wing politics, has explored topics
   such as changing relations in work, the informal economy, independent
   unions, labor mobilization, and ethnographic study of workers'
   life-worlds. Pressing work still needs to be done on the oligarchical
   business class, middle-class activists, class politics across regions,
   and the Maidan events of 2014 and the conflicts and violence that have
   followed.},

Abstract = {How do biases affect political information processing? A variant of the
   Wason selection task, which tests for confirmation bias, was used to
   characterize how the dynamics of the recent U.S. presidential election
   affected how people reasoned about political information. Participants
   were asked to evaluate pundit-style conditional claims like The
   incumbent always wins in a year when unemployment drops either
   immediately before or immediately after the 2012 presidential election.
   A three-way interaction between ideology, predicted winner (whether the
   proposition predicted that Obama or Romney would win), and the time of
   test indicated complex effects of bias on reasoning. Before the
   election, there was partial evidence of motivated reasoningliberals
   performed especially well at looking for falsifying information when the
   pundit's claim predicted Romney would win. After the election, once the
   outcome was known, there was evidence of a belief biaspeople sought to
   falsify claims that were inconsistent with the real-world outcome rather
   than their ideology. These results suggest that people seek to
   implicitly regulate emotion when reasoning about political predictions.
   Before elections, people like to think their preferred candidate will
   win. After elections, people like to think the winner was inevitable all
   along.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that subsidiarity is a condicio sine qua non for
   sustainability. Through the complexity paradigm, the paper provides a
   historical reconstruction of both concepts to the end of elucidating
   their interdependence. The main thesis is that subsidiarity to
   sustainability is what self-organisation is to emergence. The paper ends
   with a sketch of future global governance structures based on a
   subsidiarity where cities take the lead on sustainability.},

Abstract = {A steady decline in major party support in Commonwealth nations has
   resulted in changing parliamentary compositions, including the growing
   prevalence of minority government. Such situations pose new questions
   for notions of government legitimacy within Westminster systems. For
   instance, is negotiation with cross-benchers an example of government
   illegitimacy? What is the legitimate role of non-ministerial members
   when the composition of parliament gives them the final say on the
   enabling legislation for public policy? What is the legitimate response
   of the public sector regarding policy-making in the context of minority
   government? In this paper, we reflect on how a marginal member' concept
   can provide new insights into such issues and their implications.},

Abstract = {The 2014 European Parliament (EP) election in Spain took place in a
   context of deep economic recession and distrust of political
   institutions. These conditions triggered an unprecedented electoral
   response through which Podemos, a radical leftist party created shortly
   before the election, obtained eight per cent of votes and gained
   electoral momentum thereafter, seriously threatening the two-party-plus
   system. Using data from a panel survey, our analyses reveal some
   unexpected findings. The intensity of protest voting and the timing of
   the contest within the national electoral cycle have had a major impact
   on national politics - with the possibility of eventually producing a
   party-system change.},

Abstract = {This article uses an agent-based model and Selectorate Theory to explore
   the micro-foundations of the systemic democratic peace. Leaders engage
   in an international bargaining game that can escalate to conflict. Upon
   resolving the dispute, leaders distribute winnings to domestic
   constituencies and stand for reselection. The model's assumptions about
   selectorate size in a democracy versus an autocracy make democratic
   leaders more accountable than autocrats and endogenously generates the
   dyadic democratic peace. The model shows no evidence of an autocratic
   peace, as mixed dyads are less likely to go to war than autocratic
   dyads. I further show that democratic leaders invest more resources in
   wars than predicted by the Nash equilibrium and also more than
   autocrats. This overinvestment by democratic leaders results in
   democracies winning more wars than autocrats. This model thus reinforces
   previous findings that democratic leaders respond to domestic
   reselection incentives by using more resources in conflict to gain a
   war-fighting advantage and help ensure victory. Finally, consistent with
   empirical results, I show that increasing the percentage of democracies
   in the system does not have a linear effect on the amount of conflict in
   the system. Below a certain threshold, increasing democracy has no
   effect on conflict, while after this threshold conflict decreases.},

Abstract = {Network governance represents an important approach to managing complex
   environmental challenges because of its capacity to support learning.
   However, multi-scalar problems often require networks to interface with
   hierarchical modes of governance. This paper examines how network
   managers can help mediate the potentially constraining influence of
   external demands on a network's capacity for learning. It finds that a
   trusted lead agency can help bridge the hierarchical and collaborative
   divide by brokering across regional and state-level interests,
   developing processes that transform external requirements into learning
   opportunities, and supporting the development of informal dynamics in
   addition to formal rule compliance.},

Abstract = {In the present article we analyze the characteristics and the reception
   of the first plan for global governance, the New Cyneas by Emeric Cruce.
   With this goal in mind, we examine the history of its readings and the
   possible influence on the Duke of Sully's project for European
   confederation, the case most often cited by historians of ideas. Our
   analysis takes into consideration the 17th century reception, the scant
   dissemination of the work and the possible causes of its limited impact.
   Our conclusions support, on the one hand, the novelty of Cruce's
   principal ideas, and on the other, their limited impact over the time
   with the exception of the period surrounding the creation of the League
   of Nations.},

Abstract = {The rapid global spread of quotas for women constitutes one of the most
   significant political developments of the last thirty years. It
   transformed the composition of legislatures worldwide. Yet we lack a
   solid understanding of the forces driving quota diffusion. In this
   article, we consider how global pressure from the international women's
   movement affects national gender quota adoption. In the first
   quantitative analysis of this question on a global scale, we use event
   history techniques to examine global, transnational, and national
   influences on quota adoption in 149 countries between 1989 and 2008.
   Contributing to work on international norm diffusion, we find a crucial
   role for women's activism, but uncover a negative interaction between
   increased global pressures and domestic ties to women's transnational
   organizing. We suggest global pressure to adopt quotas may be weakened
   by the diverse agendas of women's activist organizations, by perceived
   threats to male elites posed by women's agitation, or both.},

Title = {Urban Chinese Support for the Chinese Dream: Empirical Findings from
   Seventeen Cities},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {143-161},

Abstract = {To what extent do Chinese citizens support the concept of the Chinese
   dream? What is the major source for the support of the Chinese dream
   among Chinese citizens? There is almost no representative-sample study
   to systematically address these questions. To fill in this gap, this
   article examines the intensity and the source of the Chinese people's
   support for the Chinese dream. Based on a seventeen-cities survey, this
   research revealed the following: first, the support for the Chinese
   dream among Chinese urban residents is very high and real; second, the
   concept of the Chinese dream has three dimensions (i.e., national dream,
   social dream, and individual dream) and a strong collectivistic feature
   which is in sharp contrast with the individualistic American dream. The
   construction of the Chinese dream is actually based on Chinese
   traditional culture: respect for political authority, desire for social
   order and support for a powerful government. In the end, this research
   suggests that the construction of the Chinese dream should remain open
   and change with the evolving public values in China.},

Abstract = {Europe is again a divided continent. When it comes to governance,
   political economy, or values, two contrasting poles have emerged: one
   Western, liberal, and democratic, another Eastern, statist, and
   autocratic. The dividing line between them has become ever sharper,
   threatening to separate Europe into two distinct worlds. This new divide
   in Europe arises from a clash between two geopolitical concepts for the
   continent: One is the Western project of a Europe whole and free, an
   enlarging zone of economic cooperation, political interdependency, and
   democratic values. The other is the Russian project of a Eurasian Union
   to rival the European Union. This article shows how these two sides of
   Europe have grown further apart in their conceptions of the European
   space, their values, governance, and economic models. It explores the
   reasons for the belated Western responses to Russian President Vladimir
   Putin's program to divide Europe. The Russo-Georgian war was a turning
   point, but the West took a long time to recognize the full implications
   of Putin's policy. The current confrontation between Russia and the West
   is not exactly like the Cold War. Russia's position is weaker. And the
   battle will be fought out primarily with economic instruments. However,
   it is clear that this conflict places Central and Eastern Europe back on
   the front lines of a divided Europe, raising any number of demons from
   the past.},

Abstract = {This section of Studies in Conflict \& Terrorism is dedicated to the
   reprinting of selected, translated terrorist communiques that provide
   insights into the mindset, worldview, or operational thinking of a
   group. In terms of communiques, this section employs the following
   typology of terrorist communiques. There are three types of terrorist
   communiques: attack, strategic, and special. Attack communiques are
   issued to claim responsibility for an attack, explain the target
   selected, and provide the political rationale for attacking the target.
   A strategic communique is a longer document that is issued to provide
   strategic direction or commentary on political events, issues, and
   developments relevant to the group's cause and constituency. It can be
   used to explain changes of strategy or reinforce the strategic direction
   of the group. The special communique is similar to the attack communique
   in that it is event-driven but addresses non-attack events like
   anniversary dates, hunger strikes, elections, deaths of leaders,
   ceasefires, issuing threats or warnings, annual progress reports,
   issuing apologies, and so on. All three communiques are issued publicly
   and intended to influence various audiences.},

   Representation Reduce the Terrorist Threat? A Time-Series Case Study of

Abstract = {Can electoral reform lead to a reduction in the number of terrorist
   incidents? Economists have shown that the introduction of constitutional
   institutions such as courts in the early eighteenth century had a direct
   effect on investment. Could there be a similar link between the
   introduction of proportional representation (PR) electoral systems and a
   reduction in the number of terrorist attacks? Previous studies using
   cross-sectional data have found a negative correlation between the
   presence of PR-electoral systems and the number of terrorist incidents.
   However, earlier studies were based on aggregate figures, not on
   time-series data. They did not provide a direction that could be used to
   measure the possible effect of the introduction of PR. This research
   note addresses this problem. Using a paired samples t-test it is
   possible to show that the introduction of proportional representation in
   Northern Ireland and Algeria led to a marked reduction in the number of
   terrorist attacks. The note thus adds strength to earlier studies.},

Abstract = {A developed-world consensus ties state failure to new and serious
   international insecurity. But that conclusion rests upon an uncertain
   foundation; insights into the nature and intensity of failure-related
   threats remain tentative and unsystematic. This study begins to remedy
   the problem, examining the broad relationships between weakness,
   failure, and terrorism with panel data for 153 countries (1999-2008). I
   argue that the quantitative literature too often disregards the
   political context determining terrorism's use, that terrorism is
   endogenous to many measures of state failure, and that estimates of the
   failure-related threat of terrorism are overstated. Consistent with
   these expectations, I find that most failing and failed states are not
   predisposed to terrorism. However, among the most failed states, those
   at war or experiencing political collapse are significantly more likely
   to experience and produce terror. These results refine the relationship
   between failure and external threat and highlight the importance of
   terrorism's macro-level political context.},

Abstract = {This paper advances a novel theoretical perspective on the determinants
   of immigrant occupational attainment in western Europe. Previous
   research has not accounted for the process of legal status transition or
   the implications of this for migrants. A new measure of the
   conditionality attached to legal status transitions is advanced and its
   hypothesised role in the determination of migrant outcomes in
   interaction with other features of legal status policy is tested
   utilising large-scale European microdata for 14 countries in the context
   of multilevel modelling. Results support the hypothesis and the paper
   concludes by discussing implications for policymakers and for future
   research.},

Title = {PEACEKEEPING ABROAD, TROUBLE MAKING AT HOME: MUTINIES IN WEST AFRICA},
Journal = {AFRICAN AFFAIRS},

Volume = {114},

Pages = {206-225},

Abstract = {This article draws attention to a trend in which military deployments as
   part of peacekeeping missions have triggered army mutinies in some West
   African countries. It explains how participation in peacekeeping
   missions created new material grievances and a sense of injustice
   amongst the peacekeepers, which under certain conditions sparked
   domestic mutinies. These uprisings in West Africa follow a history of
   military disobedience in the region, and the article places them in the
   context of long-standing tensions within military organizations.
   Mutinies often symbolize and intensify divisions within armed forces,
   which can lead to further instability even after the mutiny is resolved.
   Therefore, it is important for those interested in building and
   maintaining effective militaries to understand the ways in which
   deployments and peacekeeping participation can contribute to unrest
   within the armed forces. The article draws on interviews with former
   mutineers, including peacekeepers, and others military personnel in West
   Africa, as well as media reporting, including public statements made by
   mutineers, academic writing, and archival research.},

Abstract = {Recent research has established that employment risk shapes social
   policy preferences. However, risk is often conceptualized as an
   alternative measure of the socio-economic status. We show that
   employment risk and socio-economic status are distinct, cross-cutting
   determinants of social policy preferences. More specifically, we analyze
   the policy preferences of high-skilled labor market outsiders as a
   cross-pressured group. We first establish that labor market
   vulnerability has spread well into the more highly educated segments of
   the population. We then show that the effect of labor market
   vulnerability on social policy preferences even increases with higher
   educational attainment. We conclude that that labor market risk and
   educational status are not interchangeable and that the high skilled are
   particularly sensitive to the experience of labor market risk. Thereby,
   our findings point to a potential cross-class alliance between more
   highly and lower skilled vulnerable individuals in support of a
   redistributive and activating welfare state. Thus, they have
   far-reaching implications for our understanding of both the
   politicization of insider/outsider divides and the politics of welfare
   support.},

   which terrorists simply need courage. The typical terrorist act can be
   considered part of the sociological category known as ``vile

   placed him or her in a desperate situation that does not allow for any
   escape. This article is based on primary and secondary sources, such as
   the analysis of thirty-five homicides committed in Italy by six
   terrorist units of the extreme left; interviews with extreme left
   terrorists; interviews with victims of extreme left terrorists;
   autobiographies of extreme left terrorists; autobiographies of victims
   of extreme left terrorists; video interviews of extreme left terrorists;
   and written statements of the investigating magistrates.},

Abstract = {This article builds on recent contributions to the academic literature
   on lone wolf terrorism to critically examine key issues that are germane
   to the current state of play in this field of study. It finds that,
   overall, the recent academic literature still suffers from considerable
   problems regarding quality and rigor, including definitional,
   conceptual, methodological, and inference issues. By providing a
   critique of these issues, the article attempts to advance the scholarly
   debate on lone wolf terrorism and inspire greater dialogue and
   collaboration between scholars. Directions for future research are also
   outlined.},

Abstract = {A central challenge confronting Brazilian foreign policy is its
   reluctance to accept measures that might restrict national autonomy.
   This limits the extent to which Brazil can lead and leverage the region,
   particularly in the face of competing visions such as ALBA and the
   Pacific Alliance. The issues is Brazil's continued reliance on a
   consensual hegemony approach to regional relations after neighbouring
   countries opened space for a more assertive leadership closer to
   Pedersen's model of cooperative hegemony. Although consensual hegemony
   allowed Brazil to establish its project in South America, by the end of
   Lula's first presidential term more was being demanded and the failure
   to provide leadership goods weakened Brazil's regional position. Current
   questioning of Brazilian leadership on the continent is found in an
   almost contradictory approach that sees Brazilian diplomats pushing away
   suggestions of assertive leadership while more concrete action is
   quietly taken by other regionally engaged sections of the Brazilian
   state.},

Abstract = {This article explores the role of moral entrepreneurship activism by
   normatively focused groups, often acting nationally as well as
   transnationally in labor rights activism. We focus specifically on
   activism related to US preferential trade agreements (PTAs). We explore
   how labor-related provisions have made their way into these agreements
   and how their inclusion has changed over time. Our main focus is on the
   efforts of interest groups to lobby US policymakers regarding various US
   PTAs. We discuss whether these lobbying efforts are cast in material or
   moral terms. In considering several PTAs during the 1990s and 2000s, we
   find that most efforts are based on material claims, or on a combination
   of material and moral concerns. We rarely observe lobbying activities
   that are cast purely in terms of the normative goal of protecting
   workers' rights.},

Abstract = {This article examines foreign travels and international tourism to and
   from Czechoslovakia in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Based on the
   annual reports of the international department of the uV SM and reports
   on their foreign travels submitted by youth officials, the article
   argues that rather than representing communist efforts to maximally
   isolate Czechoslovak citizens from the outside world and to hinder
   interaction with foreigners, communist restrictions on private foreign
   travel could be interpreted as a shift in emphasis from an individual to
   a collective form of travelling. The article suggests that collective
   travel abroad as a socialist form of travel had a political meaning and
   purpose: it represented society-wide benefit and thus was part of the
   communist societal transformation, educating the labouring classes and
   eliminating inequalities in the realm of transnational mobility. It
   explores how socialist travel abroad was intended to mitigate
   differences of opinion, balance particular interests and create
   ideological consensus.},

Abstract = {This article intends to develop the content of the theory of a rights
   and justice-centered constitutional democracy, as well as show its
   utility, by using it to explain the new stability of the Ecuadorian
   State, after its period of neoliberal minimalist democracy, born with
   the death of Jaime Roldos in 1981.
   The document shows the correlation between the installation of a State
   characterized by neoliberal minimalist democracy, highly damaging to
   rights and justice, and State instability. With the emergence of the new
   constitutional framework of 2008, propelled by the government of the
   Citizens' Revolution, as an alternative for constructing a democratic
   State centered on rights and justice, the Ecuadorian State has
   experienced a remarkable new stability. The new State stability is
   explained by the emergence of a clear alternative elected and with high
   informed approval by the people. This alternative is identified by the
   major public policies employed, especially the economic and social ones,
   and their effects.},

Abstract = {To close the gap between existing country pledges and the necessary
   ambition level to limit anthropogenic climate change to not more than 2
   degrees C average global temperature increase above pre-industrial
   levels, decision makers from both the public and private domain have
   started to explore a number of complementary approaches to the top-down
   targets-and-timetables approach of international climate change policy.
   Referred to as International Cooperative Initiatives (ICI), these
   governance arrangements are now also officially acknowledged under the
   United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Durban
   Platform for Enhanced Action. While proponents see ICIs as important
   bridging devices towards more ambitious climate policy, in particular up
   to 2020, critical observers note that the voluntary nature of ICIs makes
   it difficult to assess their contribution to climate change mitigation.
   This article scrutinizes the potential of ICIs to meaningfully
   contribute to closing the emissions gap along the criteria of
   effectiveness, legitimacy and institutional fit. As means of
   illustration, the analytical framework is applied to a random sample of
   nine ICIs (out of a total of 45 listed on the UNFCCC Secretariat's
   website). We find that while potential technical effectiveness is high,
   legitimacy and institutional fit should be improved with a view towards
   integrating ICIs into the emerging post-2015 climate governance
   architecture.},

Abstract = {In 1967, several countries in the West briefly contemplated proposing a
   series of bold reform initiatives at the First World Conference on Human
   Rights in Tehran, Iran. The primary purposes of the proposals, which
   included establishing the post of the Office for the High Commissioner
   for Human Rights and even replacing the UN Human Rights Commission with
   a new Human Rights Council, were to strengthen the UN's human rights
   system. But they were also part of a larger power struggle between the
   newly decolonized states and the Western European and Others Group
   (WEOG) countries. Although several of the ideas were never pursued, they
   are nonetheless telling. They suggest that the WEOG initially saw Tehran
   as an opportunity to retake control of the UN human rights system. But
   this was quickly abandoned, as governments in the West accepted the
   sober reality that any major reform initiatives would ultimately be
   co-opted against them.},

Title = {Understanding labor conflicts in Chinese manufacturing: a Yin-Yang
   harmony perspective},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {288-315},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to employ a Yin-Yang harmony
   perspective to propose a novel circled 5C model to understand the unique
   harmonizing process of how conflicts are resolved in China. Despite
   increasing research on labor conflicts in Chinese manufacturing, Western
   theories still can not explain how Chinese culture influences conflict
   management.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors investigate a large
   manufacturer where a severe labor strike happened in South China. A
   mixed-methods research design is adopted. The scale of Chinese harmony
   and analysis of variance are used to identify the underlying
   unharmonious factors triggering the labor strike. The grounding theory
   approach (a case study) was adopted to further examine the proposed 5C
   model.
   Findings - ``Harmony with corporate system{''}, ``Harmony between
   departments{''} and ``Harmony with firm leader{''} were found to arouse
   employee grievances the most. Differences in age, gender, marital
   status, educational level, tenure and position were discovered to affect
   workers' perceptions of workplace harmony. The proposed 5C model was
   supported.
   Practical implications - As a lesson in handling escalating labor
   conflicts, this study allows foreign investors to better understand how
   to cope with relevant labor strife issues in China. In addition, this
   project integrates research with consultancy service, which can be seen
   as an exciting step forward in bridging academics and practitioners.
   Originality/value - Based on Yin-Yang harmony thinking, this study
   suggests an integrative, context-specific concern - concern for harmony
   for China to transcend the Western dual-concern model regarding the
   choice of coping with conflicts. The paper constructs a novel circled 5C
   model of the Chinese harmonizing process (conflict, clash,
   communication, comprise and consensus), which characterizes the dynamic,
   contingent and art-oriented nature of Chinese conflict management.},

Abstract = {This article provides a historical background of the evolution of
   transboundary water governance and environmental diplomacy in the Great
   Lakes-St. Lawrence basin, with a focus on the International Joint
   Commission (IJC), during the twentieth century. This study focuses on
   water quantity issues, such as diversions, canals, hydroelectric
   developments, control works, and water levels, revealing the range of
   artificial and natural impacts on water levels in the Great Lakes-St.
   Lawrence basin. Doing so provides for a revealing examination of the
   IJC, which has traditionally been the main forum in which Canada and the
   United States manage their environmental relations and border water
   issues, which allows for an engagement with a range of North American
   transboundary governance theories. While the IJC is often lauded as a
   model of transnational environmental cooperation, this paper
   demonstrates that the evolution of this bilateral institution up to the
   1960s is more complicated.},

Booktitle = {RACE IN THE AGE OF OBAMA, PT 2},
Series = {Research in Race and Ethnic Relations},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {3-29},
Abstract = {Purpose - Barack Obama has had considerable support among scholarly
   circles since his win in the Iowa primary in early 2008. A segment of
   the Association of Black Sociologists (ABS), ``Black and Progressive
   Sociologists Obama Working Group (BPSOWG),{''} was particularly active
   during the 2008 campaign. The purpose of this chapter was to determine
   if the level and type of activism among this group differed from other
   progressive groups of sociologists.
   Methodology/approach - The data for this study were collected from a
   web-based survey administered to approximately 800 professional
   sociologists in the United States. The survey consisted of items that
   focused on the extent to which respondents supported the Obama campaign
   for the presidency and the extent to which they were satisfied with
   and/or agreed with his policies during first two years of his
   presidency.
   Findings - The response rate for the survey was 40\% (N=305) and 96\% of
   respondents (N=293) submitted surveys with complete information. Over
   two-thirds of participants were members of the American Sociological
   Association Section on Race and Ethnic Relations and 5.5\% of
   respondents identified themselves as members of the BPSOWG. A slight
   majority (53.6\%) of study participants were females and the largest two
   racial groups making up the study population were whites (47.1\%) and
   African Americans (36.1\%). Most of the respondents provided support for
   President Obama during his first campaign, including financial
   contributions (66\%).
   Originality/value - Sociologists who responded to the survey were
   generally positive about Barack Obama as a candidate and a President.
   However, the subtle differences between groups about Obama
   administration policies and the use Presidential power highlighted key
   areas in which diverse coalitions for progressive change are needed.},

Abstract = {Many scholars have argued that social programs are marked by a logic of
   increasing returns that makes change difficult. Yet over the past
   decades, reformers across industrialized countries have introduced
   substantial administrative reforms in these services, even as
   entitlement reform remains politically difficult. This paper explains
   these shifts by breaking apart the logic of increasing returns into
   three distinct costs to change: technical, political, and expectations.
   Decreases in a particular type of costs produce different logics of
   institutional changeback end, informal, and front endthat privilege the
   state, professionals or private, or political actors in distinct ways. I
   support these claims by reexamining three cases that were considered
   exemplars of stability but that ultimately had major entitlement reform:
   health care in the United Kingdom and United States and welfare programs
   in the United States. I show that even before radical reforms occurred,
   reformers introduced distinct logics of administrative change that
   underpinned later changes.},

Abstract = {While true that there are numerous works on the history of French
   territorial administration during the contemporary era (19th and 20th
   centuries), they mainly focus on metropolitan situations, thus leaving
   aside overseas affairs which, despite the major role played by France
   throughout colonial expansion, have been largely neglected by the most
   recent studies. The purpose of this article is to briefly present one of
   the tropical forms of the French centralized model of administration, in
   French Cochinchina, a model from which the colonizer had no intention of
   departing. A model, nonetheless, that couldn't be further transposed as
   such. The resulting institutional hybridization was dictated by several
   factors linked with conquest and its legal framework, the conformation
   of a subjected society, but also financial considerations. This
   experience led to the adoption, albeit less through choice than
   necessity, of a form of direct rule which in turn was not without
   consequences on deconcentrated levels. This also meant maintaining the
   Vietnamese commune, although largely impaired by a progressive loss of
   autonomy destined to serve French domination.},

Pages = {79-103},
Abstract = {Almost across the board, recent studies of small arms proliferation and
   policy in Africa seem to have disengaged from historical data and
   analysis. This article contextualizes current debates on small arms and
   how they relate to the African continent, by revisiting historical data
   and analysis. The article draws on the relatively large literature on
   firearms in African history from the slave trade to early independence
   to offer new ways of thinking about small arms imports, the impact and
   prospects for control. Despite the richness of historical studies, they
   tend to be treated as historical conditions, not assessed for their
   implications for the current small arms regime. Reflecting on the
   historical sequence, it appears as if the situation today resembles that
   of the beginning of the 20th century. Enforcement of local leadership is
   often weak and the arms trade is relatively large and liberalized. This
   review finds that historical conditions and structures are built into
   Africa's current arms control architecture, posing significant
   challenges for effectiveness and legitimacy. The large scale of old and
   obsolete small arms frequent in sub-Saharan Africa suggests that weapon
   destruction programmes, rather than marking, recordkeeping and safe
   stockpiling of old stocks or recovered weapons, would often be more
   manageable and offer greater improvements in local security. The
   positive aspects of external influences on African sub-regional arms
   control regimes in terms of financial and technical support should be
   carefully weighed against the risk of reinforcing old patterns.},

Pages = {219-243},
Abstract = {Although recent years have seen more talk about Article 5 and the need
   for NATO to stand up to an expansive Russia, NATO states are unlikely to
   engage in a new Cold War with Russia. Instead the alliance continues to
   explore its agenda in the post-Afghanistan and post-Crimea period. One
   answer to these tensions is to develop an agenda stressing human
   security to counter the pervasive threats of regional instability and
   terrorism. After reviewing the alliance's Military Concept Against
   Terrorism (MCAT), the deliberations of the 2012 Chicago and 2014 Wales
   Summits, and the European Union's Common Defence and Security Policy
   (CSDP), this article explores two propositions. First, that the
   vacillating commitment of alliance members who chose to address security
   issues through EU mechanisms or optional coalitions of the willing
   threatens NATO's relevance. If NATO's members are unclear about the
   alliance's agenda and identity, others cannot know what the alliance is
   willing to do to protect its interests. Second, by developing Military
   Concept against Terrorism and Smart Defence along a human security
   framework coupled with maritime operations would enable the alliance to
   better satisfy the needs of its European members, allowing them to
   employ NATO to support the EU's Common Defence and Security Policy, and
   ensure a continued reliance on NATO. As one area where there is a
   consensus between NATO's European members and the USA, counterterrorism
   is the most promising field that the alliance can focus on. NATO,
   therefore, should position itself as a key counterterrorism force,
   albeit one that is not strictly kinetic.},

Pages = {203-223},
Abstract = {I wrote this paper more than a decade ago, and it has been staring at me
   ever since. I could never decide what its proper venue was: I think this
   is it. What concerned me were two things: first, that the idea of local
   self-government, which was the subject of serious reflection a century
   ago, scarcely gets any attention now, except in some obscure quarters;
   and, second, that the idea has been circumscribed in a way that obscures
   all the issues involved in relating the two concepts, ``local{''} and
   ``self-government,{''} to one another. The conjunction is challenging,
   but it has received very little attention, especially from political
   theorists. Some of the issues should be obvious to any reader of this
   book, but here I try to pare the main concepts back to their origins,
   using ordinary language analysis. That involves some circuitous
   discussion, which ultimately leads back to the questions I am raising in
   this book. I was trying to write a paper that would actually be read by
   people who were so committed to the state and hence to standard ideas
   about liberal democracy that they would shrug off the arguments I
   advanced in Part 2. I tried to orient the piece toward an American
   audience and indirectly toward a European one - because things that
   Americans (or Europeans) believe are taken more seriously than things
   that only Canadians believe. Nevertheless, I ended up with an argument
   that is more radical than most proponents of local self-government would
   expect. My aim was to open up the idea of liberal democracy,
   problematize the relationship between sovereignty and self-government,
   and reverse the standard relationship between municipalities and the
   state by making the former the model for the latter. (So, some of the
   ideas I began to develop in Part 2 do reappear, but with more of a
   normative emphasis.) This leads me toward the idea of democratic
   mutualism, which has its roots in anarchist critiques of the state, 1
   although I use it in a different way, to connect the principle of
   self-government to the problem of localization. That lays the groundwork
   for the specific analysis I offer in chapter 8.},

Volume = {14},

Pages = {401-418},
Abstract = {At Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, a wilderness area on the
   US-Mexico border in Arizona, conflicting policies permit the provision
   of supplementary water for wildlife but not for undocumented immigrants
   passing through the area. Federal refuge environmental policy
   prioritizes active management of endangered and threatened species. Vast
   systems of water resources have been developed to support wildlife
   conservation in this extremely hot and dry environment. At the same
   time, humanitarian groups are not allowed to supply water to
   undocumented border-crossers in the park. Human border-crossers must
   utilize nonpotable wildlife water ``guzzlers{''} for survival and face a
   real risk of illness or death by dehydration. This article analyzes

   after Syria},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {36},
Number = {3},
Pages = {408-431},
Abstract = {The notion that credibility is important in international politics, and
   maintaining it requires following through on threats and commitments to
   establish a reputation for resolve, has been standard diplomatic
   savoir-faire for decades, with its most influential articulation in the
   work of Thomas Schelling. According to a new consensus it also is wrong;
   credibility is linked exclusively to the relative capabilities and
   interests a state can bring to bear. The new consensus was invoked to
   criticize the Obama administration's coercive strategy against Syrian
   chemical weapons use in 2013. This article revisits Schelling to
   determine whether critics have an accurate depiction of coercive
   diplomacy theory. The analysis show that many of Schelling's specific
   arguments related to American-Soviet Cold War rivalry were mistakenly
   offered as general statements about reputation in all coercive
   bargaining encounters. A more nuanced interpretation stresses commitment
   of reputation operating within the complexity of the particular
   bargaining situation. Reputations are relevant but do not determine
   credibility in international politics; they matter more, relative to
   other factors, in iterated encounters (and the expectation of future
   crises) between the same two actors, a situation that approximates
   Schelling's `continuous negotiation', as well as across fundamentally
   similar crises between an adversary and a third party. This qualified
   position was missing in the debate over Syrian chemical weapons in 2013,
   and should be embraced to better manage tense diplomatic relationships
   and periodic crises with other potentially hostile world powers.
   Schelling's work shows that reputation can be an ingredient for peace,
   and not merely a pretense for war.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {43-69},

Abstract = {This article offers two theoretical contributions. First, we develop the
   concept of administrative burden as an important variable in
   understanding how citizens experience the state. Administrative burden
   is conceptualized as a function of learning, psychological, and
   compliance costs that citizens experience in their interactions with
   government. Second, we argue that administrative burden is a venue of
   politics, that is, the level of administrative burden placed on an
   individual, as well as the distribution of burden between the state and
   the individual, will often be a function of deliberate political choice
   rather than simply a product of historical accident or neglect. The
   opaque nature of administrative burdens may facilitate their use as
   forms of ``hidden politics,{''} where significant policy changes occur
   without broad political consideration. We illustrate this argument via
   an analysis of the evolution of Medicaid policies in the state of
   Wisconsin. Across three Governorships, the level of burden evolved in
   ways consistent with the differing political philosophies of each
   Governor, with federal actors playing a secondary but important role in
   shaping burden in this intergovernmental program. We conclude by
   sketching a research agenda centered on administrative burden.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the history of local self-government and
   public administration in relation to waste management to answer a
   question: Is there any relationship between the development of local
   self-government in towns and public administration in the Lands of the
   Bohemian Crown and the current state of development? Findings regarding
   the development of local self-administration are divided into the
   following eras: the period before the arrival of Slays, early and
   developed feudalism, and the beginnings of the industrial revolution,
   ending with the foundation of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1918.
   Particular attention will be paid to municipal self-government in the
   city of Brno.},

Abstract = {The widespread decline of trade unions and the emergence of various
   alternative forms of worker voice and representation have posed a
   challenge to the field of industrial relations and generated significant
   rethinking of the future directions for this field of study. In this
   article, we examine how well industrial relations meta-theories, when
   combined with efforts to build middle-range theories, provide
   distinctive explanations and different predictions for the alternatives
   that have emerged to date to fill the void. We propose new directions
   for theory and research that expand the range of actors or institutions
   that shape employment relations and include social identities outside of
   the employment relationship as the basis for mobilizing collective
   actions and voice. Finally, we suggest using these theoretical arguments
   to test among alternatives as a means of revitalizing and reshaping
   industrial relations as well as carrying forward the problem-solving
   norms that have characterized the field since its inception.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the fundamental question about the `becoming' of
   the landscape of China's neighborhood governance. Based on a
   governmentality framework, it carries out a genealogical review on the
   neighborhood governance in the Feudal dynasties, Maoist era and
   post-Maoist era and summarizes the connection between the historical and
   current governmental rationalities, government technologies and the
   formation of subjectivities. The conclusion indicates that spatial
   practice and social norm have always been regarded by Chinese governors
   as the main approaches to legitimize and consolidate their regimes at
   the neighborhood level, although different governments used different
   technologies to design and organize neighborhoods. The rationality of
   segmenting urban space into administrative unit was inherited by the
   Maoist government to design enclosed `Dan-wei' compounds and used by the
   current government to demarcate the boundary of `She-qu' neighborhood as
   well as implement `Wang-ge' management. The Feudal rituals and Socialist
   norms on the other hand, shaped hierarchy-respecting and collective
   subjectivities and to a large extent regulated Chinese people's
   behaviors and facilitated the government's practices. This paper
   concludes by pointing out that as the fragmenting Chinese society and
   hybrid government technologies shape diverse, multifaceted and ambiguous
   subjects, the government will confront more challenges on neighborhood
   governance.},

   potential to attract both support and criticism. The current study aims
   to examine the international media's discourse surrounding authorities'
   reaction to sporting events that have suffered from terror attacks or
   terror threats. A comparison is made between events that are canceled
   and events that take place as planned despite the attack or threat. Our
   findings indicate no significant differences between the coverage of
   events that are canceled and those that continue as planned. The
   evidence actually exhibits greater levels of support rather than
   criticism of authorities in international media coverage.},

Abstract = {Although state resistance to federal mandates is a prevalent
   characteristic of contemporary American federalism, little is known
   about the factors that separate resisting states from states that do not
   oppose federal policy. This article examines state resistance through a
   framework that classifies public policies by salience and complexity and
   identifies societal interests and government officials who are
   hypothesised to influence policy making on issues of varying types.
   These hypotheses are investigated in the context of state resistance to
   four federal laws - the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, No
   Child Left Behind Act, Help America Vote Act and REAL ID Act. The
   results of the statistical analysis demonstrate the centrality of the
   characteristics of citizens, elected officials and specialised interest
   groups in conditioning state resistance to federal mandates. These
   results suggest that state resistance can be characterised as a
   strategic response to federal mandates that varies systematically across
   types of public policies.},

Abstract = {Slovenia, until recently a ``success story{''} of the transition from
   communism to democracy and the rule of law, is experiencing its biggest
   constitutional and political crisis since its independence in 1991. The
   Slovenian constitutional model is currently facing a simultaneous
   economic and political crisis. The article argues that there are two
   principle reasons for this apparent decline of the Slovenian model.
   First, because of its relatively privileged position vis-a-vis other
   East Central European countries, Slovenia has been a reluctant reformer,
   doing very little to actually change its institutional setup from the
   communist past. Second, when Slovenia implemented reforms, it did it in
   a very particular way: as an uncritical model-taker of policy models
   from the West. This mimicry was done in a fairly top down, bureaucratic
   way, creating institutions without deep enough roots in society, and
   without necessary trial and error style usually needed for successful
   evaluation of proposed reforms. (C) 2015 The Regents of the University

Abstract = {We examine the sector-specific distributive effect of war in the US
   economy. We argue that war generates sector-specific distributive
   effects via demand-side and supply-side mechanisms. We also claim that
   war's distributive effects materialize over time. Our empirical analysis
   utilizes a panel data set with 22,354 U.S. firms for the period from
   1960 to 2007. It probes the impact of the U.S. Government's war making
   on firm performance in the U.S. arms and non-arms (hybrid and civilian)
   sectors in both the short and long runs. Our analysis shows that war
   does not always affect U.S. non-arms sectors adversely. Indeed, war
   exercises a positive total long-run effect for these sectors. It also
   finds that the supposedly positive distributive effect of war for U.S.
   arms sectors proves weaker than analysts generally assume. Finally, it
   demonstrates that war-induced demand and supply shocks can explain these
   results. Overall, our research sheds light on a relatively understudied
   aspect of war and advances the general understanding of the political
   microeconomy of war making.},

Abstract = {Studies of delegated agencies commonly emphasize the importance of
   accountability for these unelected bodies to secure authority to govern.
   This article argues that beyond formal accountability measures,
   developing legitimacy through interaction with external stakeholders is
   critical to agency authority. In doing so, the article makes a
   distinctive contribution by applying a new conceptual model based on
   organizational sociology and identifying multiple dimensions along which
   legitimacy is lost and won, and hence authority secured. The article
   presents original findings from a case study of how the Murray-Darling
   Basin Authority, an Australian water agency established in 2007,
   attempted to achieve political legitimacy'. Findings show that the
   Agency achieved legitimacy via appeals to common normative/ethical
   values and developing commonly used information and news outlets,
   despite facing opposition from stakeholders on the socioeconomic impact
   of its policies. The conclusion argues that the framework can usefully
   be applied to other agencies in wicked problem' policy areas.},

Abstract = {The emergence of the People's Republic of China (PRC, henceforth also
   China) as a major power raises fundamental questions regarding the
   future of global financial governance. China is seen to represent a new
   force in defining the `rules of the game' (Douglas C. North) of global
   finance, particularly within the new G20 framework. This expectation,
   however, contrasts sharply with traditional views of China prioritizing
   sovereignty and therefore distancing itself from ambitious
   multilateralism. From a Chinese perspective, the contrast between
   external expectations regarding China's future role and its traditional
   highly concentrated international involvement is striking. In terms of
   policy initiatives and proposals for institutional reform, the PRC has
   so far kept a low profile. This gap between high expectations due to a
   fundamental shift in opportunities and relatively low policy outcomes
   due to a hesitant revision of China's role conception can be explained
   through an analysis of the effects of domestic demands, foreign
   expectations and traditional role conceptions. The article thus takes a
   role-theoretical approach to analyse the ongoing shift of China's policy
   in global financial governance in the context of the G20. It reveals a
   significant revision of China's key positions regarding global
   governance: it takes on more and more responsibility, compromises on
   sovereignty and supports the emergence of a new global configuration of
   actors. The Chinese leadership has not, however, started to push for
   global financial regulation with Chinese characteristics. As we argue,
   this is because a clear consensus on a new national role conception has
   not emerged (yet).},

Abstract = {Why do states participate in United Nations peacekeeping missions?
   Extant theory revolves around two benefits states derive from
   participation: the financial benefits participants receive for their
   contributions and the ability to further liberal norms abroad. Yet,
   these theories have received limited empirical support. In addition,
   they cannot explain where and when leaders send troops. To rectify these
   limitations, I focus on a more straightforward benefit states receive
   from limiting conflict and providing stability to war-torn regions.
   Namely, stabilizing conflict areas helps stem the externalities caused
   from ongoing conflicts, such as refugees. This explanation of
   participation in peacekeeping predicts who is most likely to send
   support (those fearing refugee inflows), the size of contribution
   (increasing relative to the inflows), and where they send assistance (to
   the specific conflict area producing the externalities). Statistical
   analysis of all UN peacekeeping missions since 1990 provides support for
   this argument and reveals that refugee flows better predict who is
   likely to contribute troops, and to what conflict, than the size of
   those contributions. While other realpolitik considerations strongly
   influence which states participate in UN peacekeeping, neither democracy
   nor state need is a statistically significant explanator of who
   contributes. However, state need does predict the size of contribution.},

Abstract = {This article argues for the continued relevance of the work and theories
   of the British Geostrategist Sir Halford J. Mackinder (1861-1947). It
   asserts that commentators and scholars who seek to marginalise Mackinder
   have too often dismissed his theories without setting them in the
   context of their continued endorsement in crucial areas of the globe.
   After 1945, despite his theories being tainted by association with Nazi
   Germany and Imperial Japan, both Moscow and Washington recognised the
   utility of Mackinder's work and tailored policy accordingly. The end of
   Cold War saw Mackinder fall out of favour as his model was deemed
   unsuitable for policy analysis by a number of influential thinkers. It
   is argued here that, in recent years, the arena of international
   politics has seen a rehabilitation of Mackinder, accompanied by a
   resurgence of interest in Geopolitics. Finally, the piece examines those
   areas of the contemporary globe where Mackinder's influence is greatest.},

Abstract = {The turn to market-based instruments, such as emissions trading, in
   environmental policy has received considerable attention. Contributing
   to a critical assessment of these instruments by investigating the
   political theory of emissions trading, one of their central mechanisms,
   namely their depoliticising effect, is highlighted by discussing the
   early contributions of neoliberal thinkers and proponents of
   market-based instruments (Hayek, Coase, Dales) in environmental
   governance. These thinkers responded to the growing politicisation of
   environmental limits to economic growth by devising a mechanism by which
   the implementation of these limits could be depoliticised. This ensured
   that the fundamental questions of `what is produced, by whom, and for
   whom' (Hayek) are not raised politically. Emissions-trading mechanisms
   are neoliberal, not in the sense that they commodify or privatise
   nature, but because they entrench the power of investors.},

Title = {Expansion of rebellion: From periphery to heartland},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {52},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Why do some rebellions expand gradually as rebel groups challenge in
   sequence, whereas other rebellions explode instantaneously as rebel
   groups challenge in unison? To address this question, we develop a
   dynamic and spatial model of rebellion that illustrates patterns of war
   fought between a hegemon (government) and its challengers (rebel
   groups). Our model incorporates three features into the standard
   coordination game: (a) potential rebel groups (players) are uncertain
   about the government's strength; (b) battle outcomes are unpredictable;
   (c) these groups can be heterogeneous in terms of resolve and strength.
   In contrast to what existing theories commonly presume, our theory
   suggests that the sequence and timing of challenges are determined
   endogenously, depending on rebel groups' resolve and strength. Through
   equilibrium analyses, we demonstrate that while simultaneous challenges
   are likely when rebel groups are relatively homogeneous, sequential
   challenges may emerge when one group is outstanding in terms of resolve
   and strength. Once this group rebels, other groups are inclined to
   bandwagon' as battles evolve, because the government is gradually
   revealed to be weak and because accumulated challenges shift the balance
   of power away from the government. Our theory also addresses why
   rebellious movements often spread across the periphery and can
   eventually reach the heartland as if a siege tightens. With an eye to
   historical incidents, we delineate four patterns of rebellion: (i)
   snowballing rebellion, which gradually escalates as more challengers are
   drawn in (Napoleonic Wars); (ii) catalytic rebellion, in which an
   instigator provokes a galvanizing event to inspire others to challenge
   the government (Boshin War); (iii) partially coordinated rebellion,
   which is initiated by a subset of ex post rebel groups (American Civil
   War, Yugoslav Wars); (iv) fully coordinated rebellion, in which all the
   rebel groups challenge collectively (American Revolution, Glorious
   Revolution).},

Abstract = {In exploring the leadership practices of chief executives of
   intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), this article finds that IGO
   leaders recognize themselves as agents and as brokers. This article
   produces findings from a multiple-case study of the executive leadership
   of NATO from 1995 to 1999 and of the EU Common Foreign and Security
   Policy from 1999 to 2009. The relationship between member states and the
   IGO leader can be conceived as a principal-agent relationship where the
   agent plays a central role in framing a common vision and strategies,
   facilitating member states' involvement in the strategizing process, and
   mobilizing external and internal support. I depart from a restrictive
   principal-agent conceptualization of the relationship because I do not
   envision it as conflictive, but rather as collaborative.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that the effects of war as a performance issue in
   elections are different for a right-wing than a left-wing leader. War is
   consistent with the reputation of right-wing, hawkish governments, but
   does not fit the reputation of left-wing, dovish governments, and
   necessitates a turn away from the domestic issues the public expects
   left-wing governments to prioritize. War therefore varies in its effects
   on perceptions of right-wing and left-wing leaders. War also provides
   more temptation for left-wing supporters to defect to the incumbent
   under a right-wing government than for right-wing supporters to defect
   under a left-wing government. The War in Iraq and elections in the
   United States and UK provide a unique case to test these arguments. The
   results confirm that Blair paid a higher political price as a left-wing
   leader, because perceptions of Blair's trustworthiness became central to
   evaluations of him. Conversely, positive perceptions of strength became
   central to evaluations of Bush as a right-wing leader. The war also had
   asymmetric effects on supporters of the opposition party in the UK that
   resulted in higher costs to Blair. These findings imply that the risks
   of going to war are greater for left-wing leaders.},

Abstract = {This article considers the importance of informal, practice-based change
   as opposed to formal change at the UN. I first evaluate UN reform,
   showing that diplomacy and institutional change within the UN system are
   better understood as having evolved less from major, formal reform of
   the UN Charter (the Charter') than from minor changes in routine
   practices. I then examine what practice theory and diplomatic studies
   can learn from each other in terms of how each views the role of leading
   individuals, illustrating specific practice-based change in relation to
   the Secretary-General's role. Next, I show how the appointment process
   for a new Secretary-General has evolved through informal practice, after
   which I advance an argument that UN diplomatic practices should be
   considered not only within the narrow context of a formal diplomatic
   corps of member state diplomats but also as part of an informal, wider
   diplomatic community of diplomats and non-state actors. Practice theory
   helps students of diplomacy think more abstractly and systematically
   about mundane diplomatic practices. Students of diplomacy can help guide
   practice theory toward empirical diplomatic activities that are often
   internalized and taken for granted. I conclude that a dialog between the
   two fields will promote a better understanding of diplomacy as
   undervalued practices.},

Abstract = {In this article I offer a response to recent debate over direct action
   animal advocacy and legitimate public deliberation in liberal
   democracies. Mathew Humphrey and Marc Stears and Stephen D'Arcy have
   argued that liberal democracies ought to tolerate direct action animal
   advocacy in the interests of promoting the right of proponents of
   non-mainstream views to inform public deliberation and decision making.
   I argue that the precise scope of Humphrey and Stears' and D'Arcy's
   analyses is unclear and important parts of their theory are
   under-described. I highlight the logical and practical implications of
   their claim that direct action is useful as a means of overcoming the
   stifling influence of conventional wisdom. I conclude by arguing that
   tolerance for direct action advocacy ought not to extend to
   controversial animal rights campaigning tactics such as making threats,
   using incendiary devices and damaging property.},

Abstract = {Few studies in public management have assessed whether managerial
   leadership has any influence on job performance of public employees.
   This study employs a well-established theory of leadership,
   leader-member exchange (LMX) theory, to consider the effects of the
   manager-employee relationship on ratings of employee in-role and
   extra-role performance. It also investigates how differences in gender
   between the manager and employee and duration of their relationship may
   influence the effects of LMX on employee job performance. We examine
   these linkages with data from two surveys of 477 employees and 161
   managers working in a large state government agency. We find that when
   the quality of LMX is high, employees receive higher performance
   ratings, and this association is moderated by difference in gender
   between an employee and manager and the duration of time an employee has
   worked for a particular manager. We discuss implications of our findings
   and avenues for future research for public management scholarship. We
   also offer suggestions for public management practice regarding how to
   develop high-quality relationships with employees.},

Abstract = {Anti-insurgent militias and states attempt to erode insurgent groups'
   capacities and co-opt insurgent fighters by promising and providing
   benefits. They do so to create a perception that the insurgency is
   unraveling and to harness inside information to prosecute more effective
   counterinsurgency campaigns. Why do some insurgents defect to a
   paramilitary group and others exit the war by demobilizing, while still
   others remain loyal to their group? This article presents the first
   empirical analysis of these questions, connecting insurgents'
   motivations for joining, wartime experiences, and organizational
   behavior with decisions to defect. A survey of ex-combatants in Colombia
   shows that individuals who joined for ideological reasons are less
   likely to defect overall but more likely to side-switch or demobilize
   when their group deviates from its ideological precepts. Among fighters
   who joined for economic reasons, political indoctrination works to
   decrease their chances of demobilization and defection to
   paramilitaries, while opportunities for looting decrease economically
   motivated combatants' odds of defection.},

Abstract = {Two studies investigated the effects of bringing a highly controversial
   politician to mind on the evaluations of another politician in the
   Mexican political context. We took advantage of the dynamic nature of
   the Mexican political context in which politicians often threaten to
   leave or actually leave their political parties, influencing the
   categorization process. We hypothesized that the same controversial
   politician could elicit assimilation and contrast effects on the
   evaluations of another politician, depending on whether both political
   figures were treated as lateral categories or members of the same
   superordinate category. Study 1 found support for the predicted contrast
   effects but only among those who did not classify both political figures
   as members of the same political party. Study 2 found support for the
   expected interexemplar assimilation effects but only among those who
   classified both political figures as members of the same political
   party. The theoretical and applied implications of our results were
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The causal processes that shape the emergence of environmental attitudes
   in post-Communist Europe are examined. We describe the widening gap in
   environmental policy orientations between West and East, and then cite
   two factors to explain the lower support for environmentalism in this
   region: first, citizens still evaluate environmental issues through a
   distinctive ideological lens carried over from the Communist era; and,
   second, they do not connect environmental issues to other (more salient)
   economic and political questions in a consistent way. Using the three
   waves of the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) environmental
   module, these questions are explored with individual-level and
   multilevel models. It is concluded that the post-Communist effect is
   unlikely to disappear until environmental issues comprise a component of
   citizens' ideological orientations and the programmes of political
   parties.},

Abstract = {The article provides a comparative analysis of the 2014 European
   Parliament elections across the six countries of Southern Europe by
   gauging the performance of the second-order election model. Both the
   aggregate hypotheses of this model and evidence of micro-level
   foundations are analysed. The findings reveal that the political and
   electoral consequences of the economic crisis have not drastically
   challenged the second-order character of these elections in Southern
   Europe. However, electoral behaviour also exhibits some indications of a
   more critical contest.},

Abstract = {Public administration scholars have proposed that efficient monitoring
   and accountability are key performance elements in public services. We
   contribute to this debate by focusing on the so-called ``guarding the
   guardians{''} dilemma: monitoring commissions made up of public
   officials who may refrain from punishing their peers and turn a blind
   eye to certain deviations. In the police, this is the case of internal
   affairs divisions (IADs), which are organizations crafted to monitor the
   behavior of police officers. We expand the existing literature by
   proposing a set of hypotheses that are tested using a distinct data set
   containing detailed information on investigations against police
   officers performed by an IAD. We assess the organizational performance
   of the IAD by examining how various factors influence competing hazards
   of acquittal, mild and harsh punishment of the implicated officers. We
   find that high-ranking, high-tenured officers are less harshly punished
   with termination of duty, whereas the opposite effect is found with
   respect to cases with extensive media coverage. We also find that cases
   judged by specialized investigation officers increase the likelihood of
   punishment compared to cases assigned to temporary, rotating
   commissions, especially for cases with a long time span.},

Abstract = {Scholars have called for a greater attentiveness to and venturing beyond
   the dichotomy of public value created or lost in public-private
   partnering activity. To accomplish this, I first propose a shift from
   the term ``public-private partnership{''} (PPP) to ``public-private
   mix{''}(PPX). I then utilize a unique form of logical inference,
   abduction, at this initial stage of theory building to glean details
   about the two emerging concepts of public value and PPX. To illustrate
   their varying dimensions, a case study of ten PPXs in Taiwan are
   conducted and analysed. In the process, the study demonstrates three
   analyses of the blurring of boundaries.},

Abstract = {Value is the core of heritage conservation; it is what justifies legal
   regulations for conserving built heritage and financial investments for
   its maintenance and suggests usefulness and benefits of the heritage as
   a resource for regional growth and sustainability. Classifying (by means
   of proclamation) immovable property as being a part of monumental
   heritage has been the central instrument of heritage protection law. The
   basis of protection is identifying the (object of) public interest, and
   this identification ex lege commences legal protection, i.e.
   conservation regimes are established on proclaimed immovable monuments.
   Even though values are widely understood to be critical to understanding
   for heritage conservation, there is but little knowledge on how the
   whole range of values may be assessed in the context of decision-making
   and establishing the significance of the built heritage in question.
   This paper seeks to examine the role of built heritage as property
   development and its impact on local identity. A critical review of
   financial management and the attitude of state and local government
   towards built heritage is also undertaken.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a political economy approach to decolonization.
   Focusing on the industrial organization of agriculture, it argues that
   competition between colonial and metropolitan producers creates demands
   for decolonization from within the metropole when colonies have broad
   export profiles and when export industries are controlled by colonial,
   as opposed to metropolitan, interests. The author applies this framework
   to the United States in the early 1900s, showing that different
   structures of the colonial sugar industries in the Philippines, Hawaii,
   and Puerto Rico-diverse exports with dispersed local ownership versus
   monocrop economies dominated by large US firms-explain why protectionist
   continental-agriculture interests agitated so effectively for
   independence for the Philippines, but not for Hawaii or Puerto Rico. A
   comparative historical analysis of the three colonial economies and the
   Philippine independence debates complemented by a statistical analysis
   of roll call votes in the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act supports the argument.
   In providing a new perspective on economic relations in the
   late-colonial era, the argument highlights issues of trade and empire in
   US history that span the subfields of American political development,
   comparative politics, and international political economy.},

Abstract = {The article contributes to the `second wave' norm diffusion literature
   by offering a new theoretical lens through which to explain unexpected
   policy outcomes of international normative interventions. Specifically,
   the article aims to challenge the international norms scholarship by
   questioning what power international norms actually have in domestic
   politics of adopting states. To answer this question I analyse the
   process of diffusion, contestation, and localisation of transitional
   justice norms ways of dealing with legacies of past violence - in the
   Western Balkans. I choose three principal transitional justice concepts
   - truth, justice, and reconciliation and analyse how their local meaning
   in the Western Balkans diverged normatively from that of international
   transitional justice advocates, and to what political effect. I trace
   the processes of normative divergence of international transitional
   justice norms to demonstrate how the domestic understanding of
   international norms produced new meanings and practices and
   fundamentally challenged the principal assumptions behind the global
   governance of post-conflict reconstruction.},

Abstract = {In this article the author examines the political development and
   activities, ideological and political positions, networks and
   relationships of the Social-National Party of Ukraine (SNPU) since 1990
   to 2004. The party's successor, the All-Ukrainian Union ``Svoboda{''}
   (VU Svoboda), joined the Ukrainian parliament since 2012 to 2014. VU
   Svoboda was part of the opposition to the Party of Regions and former
   pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. The SNPU has ethnocentric and
   nationalist positions that are expressed in political statements and
   documents published by the leadership and functionaries of the party.
   Much attention is paid to the party's ideology and the way it positions
   itself. The official and disparate ideological views of SNPU
   functionaries will also be illustrated. These views became consolidated
   due to the changes within the party leadership, and the party finally
   changed its name and image, in order to appeal to the wider masses. (c)

Abstract = {Research demonstrates that the Big-Five's Openness to Experience is
   inversely associated with political conservatism. This literature,
   however, implicitly assumes that the strength of this relationship is
   invariant across the electorate. We challenge this assumption by arguing
   that educationan institution designed to increase civic
   competenceaffects the degree to which personality predicts various
   political attitudes. Specifically, we posit that education facilitates
   people's ability to identify issue positions that (theoretically)
   resonate with their personality. Using a national probability sample of
   New Zealand voters (n=6,518), we show that education consistently
   moderates the relationship between personality and a host of political
   attitudes. Whereas Openness to Experience is inversely associated with
   politically conservative issue positions among the highly educated, it
   is often uncorrelated with the same attitudes among those with low
   levels of educational attainment. These results identify an
   importantthough often neglectedmoderator of the relationship between
   personality and political attitudes.},

Abstract = {In response to Terrence Casey's argument that the emergence of
   macroprudential regulation since the financial crash can and should save
   neoliberalism we raise five objections. 1). The Debt-Driven Growth
   Hypothesis (DDG) and the Financial Instability Hypothesis (FIH), as
   Casey terms them, are just as likely to be complementary as they are
   oppositional and they are by no means incompatible. 2) Casey's empirics
   are too thin and static, drawn from the 1980s and 1990s, while Anglo
   Liberal Financialised Capitalism (ALFC) is a complex adaptive system
   that has continued to evolve throughout the 2000s. 3) Casey overlooks
   the dynamic relationship between potentially excessive financialisation
   and the performance of the wider economy, which is becoming a growing
   concern for many policy makers using the macroprudential frame. 4)
   Macroprudential as a series of ideas about the economy are often
   incompatible with neoliberal premises and their ontological foundations.
   5) Many of the policy makers who have acted as the biggest champions of
   macroprudential regulation have also been highly critical of ALFC and
   view the macroprudential turn as making a contribution to a much needed
   deeper financial reformation that would over time transform some of the
   constituent economic and social relations of the existing political
   economy. We conclude that what we call the social purpose of
   macroprudential regulation (the question of whether it is intended to
   patch up or transform the existing system) is contested, and that
   macroprudential regulation has much potential beyond saving
   neoliberalism'.},

Abstract = {In light of the impassioned debate regarding various aspects of global
   climate change, as well as the demand for reliable energy supply for
   swift economic recovery and stable economic growth in recent years,
   contemporary policy research on issues concerning energy and natural
   resources has gained more traction than at any other time in recent
   history. In this article, we attempt to characterize the recent trends
   of such research endeavors while reviewing related articles published in
   major scholarly journals in public policy and related fields of study
   between 2010 and early 2014. We found that the subtleties of recent
   energy policy studies revolve around issues pertaining to nuclear
   energy, energy efficiency, renewable energy, and hydraulic fracturing
   operations, while such studies use diverse theoretical and
   methodological approaches in analyzing various facets of energy policy
   process ranging from issue framing and agenda setting, to policy
   formulation and diffusion, to policy evaluation and feasibility
   assessment. We conclude this article by discussing future research
   directions of energy policy issues.},

Abstract = {Scholars agree that ideology affects judicial decision-making. We
   demonstrate that this proposition holds true even when the judiciary is
   independent of political control. Focusing on Italy (1983-2013), where
   the politicisation of the judiciary was an issue well before the entry
   of Berlusconi into politics, we estimate judicial orientations according
   to the support for factions within the National Judiciary Association.
   The results show that ideology affects trial court activity against
   deputies. As the support for left-wing factions increases, prosecutors
   are more likely to investigate right-wing parties. Conversely, as the
   share of right-leaning factions grows, investigations of moderate or
   rightist parties decrease.},

Abstract = {The intersection of terrorism and organized crime is a central global
   security concern. However, the conditions that contribute to this
   intersection or hinder its development are widely debated. Drawing on
   prominent cases of ideologically driven violent nonstate actors engaged
   in illicit economies, some scholars argue that this intersection is a
   logical evolution. Other scholars, focusing on the fact that relatively
   few groups engage in both organized crime and terrorism, argue that
   ideological differences hinder this intersection. We use data on 395
   terrorist organizations to analyze how organizational and environmental
   factors affect the likelihood of terrorist involvement in illicit drug
   trafficking. Our analysis shows that the degree of connectivity within
   networks of terrorist groups is the most significant predictor of a
   group engaging in drug trafficking. Further, contrary to the theorized
   effects of ideology, an explicit religious ideology has no significant
   effect while an ethnopolitical ideology actually increases the
   likelihood of drug trafficking.},

Abstract = {We develop and test a theory, based on the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem, of
   the effectiveness of sanctions. We treat sanctions as exogenously
   imposed changes in a country's exposure to international markets. In a
   country with an open-trade regime, owners and intensive users of the
   abundant factor of production hold economic and political power. In a
   country closed to trade, however, economic and political power rests
   with owners and intensive users of scarce factors. Thus, if real rates
   of return to the abundant factor decline during sanctions against a
   trade-open country, or real rates of return to the scarce factor decline
   during sanctions against a trade-closed country, we expect these
   economically and politically powerful segments of the targeted country
   to push hard for policy changes that would bring about an end to
   sanctions. Statistical analysis of sanctions episodes initiated between
   1971 and 2000 provides support for the paper's expectations.},

Abstract = {Is there a relationship between leadership change and the probability of
   conflict termination in civil war? This article uses an original data
   set on the leaders of rebel groups combined with existing data on state
   leaders to determine whether leadership change in states or rebel groups
   affects the probability that a civil war will end. Three results emerge:
   (1) when the leader of a rebel group is captured or killed, wars are 398
   percent more likely to end, (2) conflicts are less likely to end while
   rebel groups are being led by their founder, and (3) the leader of a
   state that presided over the beginning of the conflict is significantly
   more likely to bring the conflict to an end than a replacement leader.
   The results are robust to the use of matching techniques and other tests
   of endogeneity.},

Abstract = {demonstrates that the tools of Historical Institutionalism are valuable
   for interest group scholars in assessing change offers a way to
   conceptualize and empirically differentiate between radical and routine
   change within interest group organisations shows that a group's founding
   mission is both a constraint and a resource for radical group change.
   While group scholars have long noted instances of change in overall
   organisational formsay from amateur scientific group to environmental
   campaign groupthe literature is short on persuasive accounts of the
   mechanism(s) that drive or constrain such radical types of change. How
   can we explain groups getting from form A to form B? In this article we
   explore how tools from the historical institutionalism literature might
   aid in the analytical process. Specifically we focus on the combination
   of focussing events, internal challengers to the status quo, and the
   capability of challengers to demonstrate to key audiences that the
   radical' change is in some way consistent with the founding identity of
   the group. We demonstrate the application of this approach by examining
   a case of radical changea shift in overall formin a well-known UK
   interest group, the Soil Association.},

Abstract = {This article deals with the migration of ethnic Germans from socialist
   Eastern Europe to the GDR in the decades after the Second World War.
   Post-expulsion resettlement from that region is commonly associated with
   Aussiedler migration to West Germany. Contesting the idea that East
   Germany displayed no interest in Eastern European Germans, this article
   shows that the GDR, which challenged the West German claim to be the
   sole representative of the German nation, also received ethnic German
   immigrants, mostly from Poland and the USSR. It argues that the
   distribution of roles between the two German states, with West Germany
   being the prime destination for resettlers, was not clear from the
   outset. It was only after Polish-West German normalization in 1970 that
   the FRG became the almost uncontested fatherland for Eastern European
   Germans. West and East German approaches resembled each other as long as
   they were predicated on humanitarian family reunification. They diverged
   as the GDR attempted co-ethnic labor recruitment in Poland in the 1960s.
   These efforts met with limited success, as East Germany was the weakest
   link in a cross-bloc tetradic nexus with the German minority in Poland,
   the Polish state, and West Germany. Meanwhile, the GDR authorities eyed
   grass-roots migration initiatives by Soviet Germans with suspicion, as
   they undermined the government aspiration to control the movement of
   people. The article finally argues that movement of labor had no
   priority in the project of socialist economic integration, which gives
   reason to suspect a link between limited migration and failed COMECON
   integration.},

Volume = {6},

Abstract = {Financial crises have underscored two important points for East Asia's
   economic and financial stability and resilience: regional economies must
   become more self-reliant while acknowledging that the growing
   interdependence has intensified the need for cooperation. Reconciling
   the need for self-reliance with the reality of increasing
   interdependence has critical implications for East Asian financial
   regionalism as it drives how regional and multilateral processes link
   and interact with each other. This article explores how normative
   tensions can limit coordination of regional and multilateral
   surveillance mechanisms and investigates whether the 2008 global
   financial crisis has changed the normative dynamics in surveillance.
   Studies on the interaction of ideas and interests and its impact on
   financial governance have made important contributions to discussions on
   postcrisis reform. However, current analyses tend to overlook how
   normative tensions drive collective action between regional and
   multilateral levels. Furthermore, existing research in this field tends
   to focus on processes of change and devote little attention to cases
   wherein it might result in stasis instead. This article focuses on how
   two trends - the growing divergence in conceptions of financial risk and
   stability and the loss of an intellectual compass to guide the
   surveillance agenda - may hinder deeper cooperation between regional and
   multilateral surveillance mechanisms in East Asia.},

   examining the designated terrorist organizations lists of six countries;
   the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Russia, and
   China. It is argued that these countries should be placed into one of
   three distinct categories: Trendsetters, Trend Followers, and Individual
   Players. Being able to classify countries according to these categories
   is important for global policymakers. It raises awareness of the
   differences between countries, and emphasizes that ``one-fits-all{''}
   policies are inappropriate and have little chance of achieving global
   endorsement.},

Abstract = {Existing research on the European Union's (EU) multilevel parliamentary
   system builds on the hypothesis of parallel evolution, situating
   explanations for European Parliament (EP) empowerment at the EU level
   and explanations for national parliamentary powers in EU affairs at the
   national level. We propose the hypothesis of co-evolution, which
   specifies a connection between national and European arenas of
   parliamentarization. We study whether the EP's empowerment enhances or
   reduces pressure on national parliaments to strengthen their own
   EU-related competences. First, we argue that national parliamentary
   parties take conscious positions on the powers of the EP. Second,
   support for the EP among the party composition of national parliaments
   tells us whether parliaments regard the EP as a competitor or ally,
   feeling pressed, or relieved of the pressure, to strengthen their
   EU-related competences.},

Abstract = {For its most prominent proponents, interpretive research is emphatically
   a `systematic' craft; though iterative and creative, if practiced
   expertly it enables the researcher to progress towards a more coherent,
   comprehensive and convincing interpretation of both the political
   phenomenon under investigation and its scholarly significance. We argue
   that this process is neither as systematic in nature nor as satisfying
   in execution as such a characterization implies. Instead, drawing on our
   own experiences of conducting this sort of research, we argue that the
   craft is inherently an `impressionistic' one; it entails the deliberate
   and at times painful creation of a stylized and simplified account. By
   necessity, doing interpretation means glossing over complexity or
   presenting a partial representation in order to say something meaningful
   to academic and practitioner audiences. We argue that instead of shying
   away from the impressionistic nature of their work, interpretive
   researchers like us should embrace it, and that doing so will buttress
   this type of research from criticism, enhance its connection to the
   policy world, and strengthen its appeal from within.},

Abstract = {This article examines key setting events and personal factors that are
   associated with support for either non-violent activism or violent
   activism among Somali refugee young adults in the United States.
   Specifically, this article examines the associations of trauma, stress,
   symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), posttraumatic growth
   (PTG), strength of social bonds, and attitudes towards legal and
   non-violent vs. illegal and violent activism. Structured interviews were
   conducted with a sample of Somali refugee males ages 18-25 living in the
   northeastern United States (N=79). Data were analyzed using multiple
   linear regressions and path analysis. Greater exposure to personal
   trauma was associated with greater openness to illegal and violent
   activism. PTSD symptoms mediated this association. Strong social bonds
   to both community and society moderated this association, with trauma
   being more strongly associated with openness to illegal and violent
   activism among those who reported weaker social bonds. Greater exposure
   to trauma, PTG, and stronger social bonds were all associated with
   greater openness to legal non-violent activism.},

Title = {Liberal intervention, anthropology and the ethnicity machine},
Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},

Pages = {224-237},
Abstract = {This article explores the turn towards anthropology and sociology among
   `critical interventionists', i. e. those who are not opposed to liberal
   intervention as such, but merely worry that actually existing
   intervention tends to fail because it is top-heavy with `Western' ideas
   of `good governance' and lacks an `anthropological sensitivity' to the
   communal nature of the local, indigenous identities and practices
   implicated in conflict. The article problematises the critical
   interventionists' conception of indigenous practice (culture) and
   communal conflict and questions the role assigned by them to the
   anthropologist/sociologist, i. e. as expert in the `communal' and
   translator of indigenous culture to the international purveyors of `good
   governance'. What this division of labour rules out is an
   anthropology/sociology of governance. Using as an illustrative example
   the phenomena of `telling' - a supposedly irenic form of group
   designation indigenous to Northern Ireland that has become foundational
   to the peace process - this article argues that anthropology can help us
   understand communalism not as the antithesis of liberal `good
   governance' but as one of its foremost techniques.},

Abstract = {The UAE has significant relations with Iran that are precipitated by
   their vast commercial ties. However, these relations are complicated by
   a long-standing territorial dispute between the two countries. Since the
   intensifying of sanctions on Iran, the UAE has been compelled to lessen
   its cooperation with the Islamic Republic. The Emirate of Dubai has been
   one of the main points of Iranian commercial activity prohibited by
   sanctions. In the wake of Dubais economic bail out, though, the Emirate
   was leveraged into fuller compliance with the international sanctions on
   Iran. While this has diminished ties between the UAE and Iran, the
   Iranian business community continues to use its neighbor to evade
   sanctions.},

Abstract = {The impact of the Abe Doctrine' can best be comprehended through its
   underpinning revisionist ideology. Abe's ideology derives from a
   tradition of pre-war colonial and wartime attempts to assert for Japan a
   position as a first-rank nation and leader within Asia and a post-war
   ambition to be regarded as an autonomous state, US equal partner and
   liberal-capitalist power facing down authoritarianism. Abe's pursuit of
   this role demands the casting off of international and domestic
   constraints imposed by defeat and the negative burden of history. In
   order to end the `post-war regime' and return Japan to great power
   status, the Doctrine must overturn taboos on constitutional revision,
   patriotic education, the historical legacies of the `comfort women', the
   Tokyo Tribunals and prime ministerial visits to Yasukuni Shrine.},

Abstract = {The essay examines the recent rehabilitation of counter-insurgency
   doctrine, especially as conducted by third party interveners. The advent
   of the refurbished US (United States) Army/Marine Corps
   Counterinsurgency field manual, a volume with scholarly
   self-presentation, is the focal point. This essay is concerned with the
   dubious bases of the doctrinal justifications driving recent US
   interventions. The Vietnam War turns out to be the crucial case for
   American scholars and policy-makers who have construed the history of
   counter-insurgency there as an unacknowledged success, which today has
   become the standard account in American International relations
   scholarship. The essay is a critical examination of this development and
   of its implications.},

Abstract = {The article provides a historical-sociological perspective on
   contemporary, globalized `corporate responsibility' (CR) by exploring a
   critical moment in the evolution of this institution, in
   mid-20th-century USA. CR was devised by the corporate capitalist elite,
   broadly defined, as an instrument for pre-empting governmental
   intervention. Corporations responded to surging public expectations for
   governmental-not corporate-assumption of social responsibility. In
   deploying CR practices, they would strategically enable the creation of
   the latter at the expense of the former, thus redefining the parameters
   of business's role in society and, along with it, the societal division
   of regulatory labour in the direction of increasing privatization. It is
   hypothesized that present-day attempts at `civil regulation' of
   corporations embody a script of interaction among companies, publics and
   states that was designed to secure corporate power rather than limit it.
   Synthesizing organizational neoinstitutionalism and elite theory, the
   article shows how elites can defend their position of power through
   engagement in a `defensive institutionalization project', that is, a
   sophisticated modification of the system aimed at redefining the very
   perceptions and strategies of everyone involved.},

Abstract = {`Tribalism' and `clanism' remain poorly understood and poorly defined
   terms in the study of international development. They tend to be
   conflated and associated with hierarchical patronage networks that help
   to entrench conflict and to undermine positive progress towards
   achieving modernising development agendas. However, in the Gulf of Aden
   region, they have also been instrumental in maintaining social order
   across a number of contexts. In Yemen and Somalia, they actually play
   both a stabilising and a destabilising role.
   Taking these considerations into account, this chapter helps to update
   and realign existing definitions of clans and tribes within the specific
   context of Yemen and Somalia. It argues that two separate terms are
   needed to distinguish Yemeni `tribalism' from Somali `clanism', so as to
   better acknowledge the uniqueness of each phenomenon within its own
   particular cultural setting.},

Abstract = {Who now doubts that we live in a capitalist society? When I wrote this
   essay and the others in Part 1, most of the supporters of capitalism
   were reluctant to identify themselves as such. Instead, they claimed
   that they were in favour of the free market or a free society, unlike
   the communists and socialists, who wanted to impose something more
   restrictive on people. Since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the
   word ``capitalism{''} has been re-embraced by its supporters, who are
   confident that there is now no alternative to it. I am one of those who
   thinks that there is an alternative - or, rather, an array of
   alternatives - but it is far from obvious how we would get to any of
   those alternatives, given the way that the capitalist system has been
   consolidated in the wake of the defeat of communism and the rollback of
   the Keynesian welfare state. Who, following the events of 2008, could
   doubt that the modern state - or, rather, the consortium of states that
   is the modern state system works as ``the executive committee of the
   bourgeoisie?{''} 1 Years later, everyone is still paying for the
   bail-outs the big banks and other private companies received after they
   messed everything up in their pursuit of short-term profits. In the
   1970s, the evident connection between capitalism and the state was
   widely disputed on the grounds that the state - at least in the most
   advanced capitalist societies - was actually independent of the
   capitalist class and more responsive to the needs and demands of
   ordinary people than to business. Keynesian welfarism, which involved
   huge state expenditures as well as a measure of state control over the
   economy, was taken to be indicative of this independence, since it was
   clearly not very popular within ``the business community{''} (as it is
   now euphemistically described). Marxists and others responded by
   pointing out that Keynesian measures had the effect of stabilizing the
   economy for the benefit of capitalist investors, and that welfare
   measures quieted the working class politically at a time when it might
   have thrown its support to the socialists or communists. In the Marxist
   jargon of the time, the state had ``relative autonomy{''} from the
   dominant capitalist class, an autonomy necessary to fulfill its
   functions: continued capital accumulation on the part of capitalists,
   and legitimation of the whole system in the eyes of the people at large.
   If this was how things were best understood, how did the city or local
   government fit into the analysis?
   In this essay, I addressed the idea that ``metropolitan reform{''} the
   American term for consolidating local government in metropolitan areas -
   was a consequence of the demands of the capitalist class, or of the
   functional requirements of advanced capitalism. Toronto, where a
   metropolitan government was established in 1953, is a particular focus
   of my attention. What happened there was a model for what happened in
   other parts of Canada and, unusually, it attracted much attention in the
   US. The basic logic of reform in Toronto was similar to that applied in
   Britain and many other countries. What I try to show is that this logic
   is not simply an effect of capitalist demands or capitalist
   requirements. Instead, it reflects a more generally shared bourgeois
   sensibility. Moreover, there is reason to believe that a different model
   of metropolitan reform, which then went under the label of ``public
   choice,{''} could be more congenial for capitalists, both in terms of
   the opportunities it provided for private capital accumulation and the
   way it secured popular legitimacy. Subsequent events seem to have
   confirmed this intuition, as neo-liberalism, which is essentially the
   philosophy of public choice, has since become the dominant strategy of
   government globally.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the political coalitions giving rise to diverse
   types of interactions between revenue systems and welfare states. It has
   been widely acknowledged that coordinated economies with larger public
   sectors have somewhat regressive tax systems, with a heavy reliance on
   the taxation of consumption and wages over capital and property. Liberal
   economies, alternatively, have had more progressive tax systems but
   smaller welfare states. I suggest that the divergence in the mechanisms
   for representing employers-through industrial relations and party
   systems-helps to explain how different models of taxing and spending
   develop over the course of the twentieth century. Industrial
   coordination encourages higher levels of tax consent among employers, by
   simultaneously expanding employers' support for social programmes and
   giving employers the leverage to restrict taxation of capital and to
   push consumption taxes. The paper evaluates the role of employers and
   industrial coordination in the architecture of tax regimes in Denmark
   and the USA in the early 1900s and 1960s.},

Abstract = {The role of legislatures in scrutinising executive patronage has
   received scant attention in the context of parliamentary democracy. This
   article addresses this lacuna by focusing on the parliamentary scrutiny
   of public appointments in the UK. Presenting the results of an extensive
   programme of research, it reveals how select committees have accrued
   increasing powers to challenge ministerial appointments, and how this
   has resulted in a series of unintended consequences that raise critical
   concerns regarding the overall added-value of pre-appointment scrutiny.
   The article is therefore of comparative significance for theories of
   legislative scrutiny in particular and executive-legislature dynamics
   more broadly.},

Pages = {145-161},
Abstract = {The linkages between internal political structures and international
   behaviour, as in the case of the GDR, demonstrate strong evidence of
   patterns of diffusion and dependence. The structural process between the
   two superpowers can be observed in the variation of the diffuse
   dependence of the GDR on the USSR. The Soviet position is examined
   vis-a- vis the position of others because material power and
   capabilities determine not only Soviet behaviour but also the
   international position of the GDR.
   The Soviet-German policy had developed in tandem with the qualitative
   and quantitative changes in Soviet GDR policy that were conditioned upon
   the achievements of the leadership in which the GDR was the sine qua non
   condition justifying the objective of Soviet-German policy on the German
   question. The leadership ability needs to be adapted to external
   idealist parameters where the new ideas were looking his legitimation as
   power shifts to alter leadership. The political analysis can be
   determined by the application of a `symbolic understanding' that
   investigates and analyses links between various political actors that
   will deepen and widen understanding of policy decisions that have been
   taken.
   The argument of this chapter is that the international system
   constrained Soviet policy on German question, while the leadership acted
   to satisfy internal needs and minimise adverse consequences. The
   national policy, demonstrating domestic preferences, accounts for the
   timing of the shift in the Soviet leaders' strategy, a shift that
   created disagreement with the GDR's leaders, whilst the international
   system informs us about actors' abilities to satisfy their domestic
   counterparts about the outcome of an ultimate international cooperation.},

   intact the socialist GDR and maintaining it in the orbit of socialist
   interests of the Soviet Union. If the Cold War strategy of the Soviet
   Union was still valid, the socialist GDR would be defended as its
   internal structures were threatened. The fact that GDR was a Cold War
   country reflected the confrontation of the two superpowers. In such a
   perspective, pre-planned German unification was unlikely.
   Moscow did just about everything possible to transform the inner and the
   outer environment on which the GDR depended. Gorbachev's Soviet Union
   did nothing to prevent the departure of East German citizens in
   September 1989 from the territory of the GDR nor did it favour the
   Soviet military's involvement in the internal situation of the GDR. It
   was made clear in 1989 that Gorbachev demoted the significance of the
   GDR believing that conciliation and cooperation with Western countries
   could fix the inefficiencies of the Soviet system. More significant was
   Moscow's willingness in 1989 to give up its control in Eastern Europe
   through some deals with West Germany and the USA. This willingness
   ultimately resulted in the talks for unification of the two Germanies
   without the SED's leaders having been consulted. From the Soviet
   perspective in June 1989, a neutral Germany was preferable. The Soviets
   retreated from this position in early 1990 and with German unification
   the integrity of the Soviet-German policy had been undermined.},

Abstract = {How could the variations in the level of peace, order,
   institutionalization and cooperation in the various regions in the
   twenty-first century be explained? The author argues that the combined
   effect of two factors-state capacity and national congruence-is the most
   important, although an additional factor can mitigate or aggravate their
   effects-great power intervention. The two key factors are state
   capacity-the effectiveness of the functioning of state institutions; and
   national congruence-the extent of congruence between geo-political
   boundaries and national aspirations and identities in the region
   (including notably issues of national selfdetermination). Regions in
   which the states are strong and nationally coherent will tend to produce
   warm peace (Europe and South America). Regions in which at least some of
   the states are failed states-both weak and incongruent-will generate hot
   civil wars and trans-border violence (Africa, South Asia and the Middle
   East); while regions with strong states but incongruent will tend to
   produce a revisionist model and cold wars among strong states (East Asia
   and the post-Soviet). Finally, the instability prevalent in regions
   populated by failed states can sometimes be mitigated by the
   intervention of a benign hegemon and produce cold peace (the Balkans in
   the 1990s), but in highly fragmented regions such interventions might
   face a lot of problems and have some de-stabilizing effects, producing
   domestic and regional violence (South Asia and the Middle East).},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {244-266},
Abstract = {In December 2014, the European Union (EU) launched its civilian mission
   in Ukraine, EU Advisory Mission (EUAM). Although the mission's main
   purpose is to mentor and advice Ukrainian officials on civilian Security
   Sector Reform, this article argues that EUAM's deployment was driven by
   a broader geopolitical logic, that is, to soft balance Russia. Following
   Russia's annexation of Crimea in March 2014, international perceptions
   of Moscow's intentions turned increasingly ambivalent. Due to EU member
   states' divergent interests vis-a-vis Russia and the union's lack of
   hard balancing capabilities, the only feasible means available to the EU
   to deal with the situation in Ukraine were diplomatic and economic
   pressure, that is, sanctions. However, whereas sanctions are designed to
   compel Russia to solve her ongoing conflict with Ukraine diplomatically,
   the EU is also undertaking soft balancing measures that allow it to
   undermine Russia's interests in Ukraine without confronting her
   directly. Two attributes make EUAM a soft balancing act: firstly, it
   improves the resilience of the Ukrainian state against Russian influence
   and pressure; and secondly, it shows political support to the Ukrainian
   government and people. There currently is a broad consensus among EU
   member states for supporting Ukraine in almost every way, short of
   military assistance. Whether or not this support is sustainable in the
   long run is an open question.},

Abstract = {This study examines whether Criminology's Routine Activities Theory
   (RAT) and related Lifestyle Theory (LST) can account for variation
   between the attributes of victims of fatal ideologically motivated
   attacks (akin to terrorism) and the victims of non-ideologically
   motivated homicide incidents committed by far-Right extremists in the
   United States. This article makes four contributions. First, we
   empirically test Criminology theory in the context of terrorism by using
   routine activities to devise four core hypotheses to explain differences
   between the two types of victims. Second, our investigation uniquely
   includes a non-terrorist comparison group (i.e., victims of homicides
   committed by extremists for personal reasons like greed). Third, our
   study focuses on ideological victimization. Terrorism researchers have
   usually ignored victims because of the difficulty in accessing the
   necessary data. Finally, we also make a methodological contribution by
   showing that criminology can build upon the terrorism literature by
   utilizing open-sources. Using data from the Extremist Crime Database
   (ECDB), the results of a multivariate analysis partially supported the
   hypotheses, showing that RAT and LST offer empirically supported
   theoretical constructs that have the ability to differentiate between
   ideological and non-ideological homicides.},

Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Pages = {480-497},
Abstract = {Why do states persist in enduring, expensive conflicts when the costs
   seem so high, the potential benefits, at best, somewhat ambiguous? This
   article suggests that emotional psychology can provide some insights
   into this problem. Decision-makers construct a vision of the future that
   is greatly informed by affect. How they feel in the present has a big
   impact on their conception of events and their decisions about them. The
   risks they are prepared to take, the desires they anticipate having in
   future, the lessons of the past they draw on-all are constructed under

Abstract = {Joining the European Union (EU) has had a transformative effect for the
   foreign policies of the new member states and the Ministries of Foreign
   Affairs (MFAs). There is a growing body of literature that analyses
   Europeanisation of foreign policies of EU member states as a result of
   their participation in Common Foreign and Security Policy. At the same
   time, the significance of learning in bringing change in foreign policy
   remains underexplored avenue of international relations (IR) and foreign
   policy analysis (FPA). This article demonstrates how learning processes
   can contribute to the processes of Europeanisation and shows what are
   the possible inhibitors to institutionalisation of the lessons learnt at
   individual level.},

Abstract = {Prominent authors have claimed that government organizations have high
   levels of goal ambiguity, but these claims have needed clarification and
   verification. We discuss the complexities of organizational goals and
   their analysis, and review many authors' observations about public
   agencies' goal ambiguity and its good and bad effects. Then, we propose
   a conceptual framework to organize and make explicit the observations,
   as a set of interrelated propositions about relations among concepts
   that influence organizational goal ambiguity and that are influenced by
   it. Then, to verify or falsify these propositions, one needs to define
   and measure organizational goal ambiguity and other concepts in the
   framework. We describe research that has done so and that supports
   propositions in the framework, with emphasis on research that has
   analyzed organizational goal ambiguity using measures of three
   dimensions of goal ambiguity. We describe research using these
   dimensions, as well as other studies and translate these findings into
   additional propositions that extend the conceptual framework.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the position of Romani minorities in the light of
   the state dissolution and further citizenship regime transformations
   after the disintegration of the former Socialist Yugoslavia. While
   observing closely the repositioning of the Romani minorities in the
   post-Yugoslav space, it explicates that in the case of state
   dissolution, the unevenness of citizenship does not only manifest in the
   rights dimension, but also in uneven access to citizenship with regard
   to new polities.},

Abstract = {Gongsun's debating was aimed at trivializing all names each after their
   proper and unrepeatable contextualization. Echoed by the postmodern
   deconstructionists of two millennia later, Gongsun Long offered to his
   contemporary the less popular alternative that emphasized the use of
   language only for the reality of the occasion in his attempt to resist
   almost all values, be they restoration, universal love, or war. This is
   in sharp contrast with the Confucian use of kinship to breed moral
   consciousness in support of naming. For Confucians, the task of rational
   thinkers is to distinguish the right names from the wrong ones. From
   Gongsun's perspective, naming sites would lead to constant battles
   between kingdoms and within them each and eventually invite conquest.},

   citizen participation in health policy},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {198-215},
Abstract = {Policy researchers face a range of pressures to incorporate the
   perspectives of `hard-to-reach' groups in their research. In the
   specific case of public involvement policy in health (one example of the
   growing field of citizen participation initiatives in administrative
   contexts), researchers have struggled to accomplish this without
   compelling research participants to enter into a policy discourse that
   is unfamiliar and may be at odds with their self-understood roles as
   patients and citizens. This paper presents findings from an interpretive
   project which sought to understand the perspectives of young adults on
   local practices of public involvement in a socio-economically deprived
   area of Scotland. It recounts the researcher's shifting standpoint in
   response to silences and absences within young adults' reaction to the
   project, and argues that the everyday `tactics' young adults described
   using in their interactions with health services be reimagined as
   relevant, albeit challenging forms of citizen participation.},

Year = {2015},
Pages = {166-188},
Abstract = {The most broadly shared conclusion in scholarship on dispute settlement,
   legalization and compliance over the past two decades is probably the
   virtue of granting private actors access to international courts and
   tribunals. Yet for all its benefits, private access is not a universally
   available and effective institutional design option. This chapter shows
   that IGOs sometimes compensate for these limits by turning to a strategy
   of orchestration, and identifies the conditions under which this takes
   place. Where procedures for private enforcement are lacking,
   orchestration can offer a substitute, as when IGOs independently create
   mechanisms for compliance complaints. Where such procedures exist but
   private actors face resource barriers, orchestration can offer a
   complement, as when IGOs provide funding and training to potential
   litigants. This chapter argues that orchestration of enforcement in both
   its variants will only happen when three necessary conditions are
   fulfilled: a) IGOs lack sufficient capabilities to effectively enforce
   compliance through other governance means; b) private actors hold
   privileged information about state compliance; and c) IGOs enjoy a
   capacity for independent action, as shaped by entrepreneurial resources
   and state oversight.},

Abstract = {This article draws on three pieces of qualitative research conducted
   with women in provincial Russia over the last 10 years. The first
   section analyses women's discussions of their everyday rights claims and
   their engagement in ``consentful{''} forms of contention. The second
   section uses the Pussy Riot case as an example of women's human rights
   activism coded as ``contentious{''}. Finally, the article highlights the
   blurred boundaries between contentious and consentful contention that
   can occur when women engage in online spaces. The article suggests a
   spectrum of contentious politics for women's rights claims that vary
   depending on the political opportunity structures available.},

   International Affairs and International Studies ? A rupture, a renewal
   or a enlargement ? This paper discusses how these two new academic
   programs, defining themselves as interdisciplinary and working on
   international, transnational and global issues, offer a double
   alternative to International Studies. If professionalization is the best
   way to define the added value of International affairs, new analytical
   and theoretical perspectives define the contribution of Global Studies.
   Through a study of twenty master programs, we will explore how their
   conditions of emergence, their organisation and their evolution help
   them to create their own identity, setting themselves apart from
   International Studies.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I build upon the conflict management, civil war, and
   bargaining literatures to develop and test a theoretical model that
   links openings for diplomacy to where civil war battles occur and how
   these locations change over time. I argue that the locations and
   movements of civil war battles provide information to both governments
   and rebels that influences their willingness to engage in mediation and
   negotiation. By identifying how civil war battles influence the
   willingness of warring sides to participate in diplomacy, I suggest that
   it is possible to identify other windows of opportunity for effective
   conflict management beyond waiting for a conflict to evolve into a
   hurting stalemate. The results of my analysis of 46 African civil
   conflicts shows that battle locations, battle velocity, and battle
   dispersion each influence the occurrence and outcomes of peace talks.},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates that the European Union (EU) can curtail the
   autonomy of the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA)
   and the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) by building upon
   insights from the principal-agent model. It explores and explains the
   EU's control over these organizations by mapping the actors and
   instruments that define EU control of FIFA and UEFA and discussing their
   activation and mitigation. In this light, it introduces a new
   perspective (exogenous control) and instrument (steering). Whether or
   not the EU deploys the control instruments at its disposal is defined by
   a constant interplay between FIFA and UEFA, their political and football
   principals and their EU supervisors. Activating and mitigating control
   within this triangular set-up will dictate whether or not FIFA and UEFA
   can expect their autonomy to be curtailed if and when they break from
   good governance practices.},

Abstract = {This article presents the findings of a mixed methods study that
   explores the individual, social, and infrastructure factors that
   influence educational participation of 403 ``Champions{''} in
   Maharashtra, India. Champions are defined as second year female college
   students whose parents completed a primary school education or less. The
   results of the study, as framed by Kenneth McLeroy et al's social
   ecology model, suggest ``Champions{''} owe their success primarily to
   exceptional levels of familial support, mentorship from teachers, and
   personal resilience in the face of considerable obstacles including
   inadequate facilities and rampant sexual harassment. These findings
   mount a critique of the efficacy of public educational measures targeted
   at improving gender equality in education.},

Abstract = {Using the cover of state secrets in order to suppress and conceal the
   conclusions of the Katy investigation is a violation of current Russian
   law. And yet Russian prosecutors have engaged in a cover-up of the
   documentation involved in the long-standing international investigation
   into the Katy Massacres of 1940. The outcome of the investigation is a
   far cry from a truthful accounting, instead attesting to the
   prosecutors' eagerness to avoid any indictment of the USSR's former top
   leadership, and more generally to their attempts to sweep the entire
   affair under the carpet. First, the Katy Massacres are characterized not
   as a war crime but merely as an abuse of power by authorities. Second,
   the scope of culpability has been deliberately circumscribed: both
   Stalin and the Politburo members who approved the massacres have been
   absolved of blame. Third, the inquest shows serious lapses, as no
   complete list of victims has been made publican essential step for both
   completeness of the investigation and for the possibility of the
   victims' subsequent rehabilitation. This article explains in detail the
   political and legal logic behind this treatment of Katy-related
   documentation by the Russian political establishment since the dawn of
   the twenty-first century.},

Title = {The European Union as a global regulator? Context and comparison},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {22},
Number = {9, SI},
Pages = {1233-1252},
Month = {OCT 21},
Abstract = {The European Union's (EU's) regulations affect how business is conducted
   and consumers and the environment protected in parts of the world far
   beyond its borders. Moreover, the external impact of its regulations
   informs understandings of the EU as a global actor. This contribution
   makes three main arguments. First, the EU's regulatory influence varies
   systematically across different forms of regulatory interaction:
   regulatory competition and different forms of regulatory co-operation.
   The form of regulatory interaction, therefore, is a critical intervening
   variable between the EU's regulatory power resources and its influence.
   Second, within the different forms of regulatory co-operation the EU's
   influence varies in line with expectations derived from the literature.
   But, third, the magnitude of the EU's influence seems to be considerably
   less in regulatory co-operation than suggested by the literature on
   regulatory competition; a finding that reinforces the first argument.
   The contribution also introduces the rest of the special issue,
   identifying three overarching conclusions: the utility of the EU's
   regulatory power resources is context specific; debates about what kind
   of power the EU is, at least as previously conceived, are unproductive;
   and that the EU's engagement in the world is better explained through
   general theories of international political economy.},

Abstract = {In the official declarations of the India-Brazil-South Africa Dialogue
   Forum (IBSA), the three states claim a shared understanding of human
   rights and a deep commitment to the international promotion and
   protection of these rights. This article considers these two
   propositions in light of the actions of the IBSA states on the United
   Nations Human Rights Council. After examining the positions of the IBSA
   states on seven controversial country-specific cases (Belarus, Darfur
   and Sudan, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Sri Lanka, and Syria) and four
   controversial thematic domains (economic rights, racism, freedom of
   expression, and sexual orientation), I conclude that the three states do
   not have the same views about human rights. Furthermore, I find that the
   IBSA states often do not support pro-human rights initiatives in the
   Council, although Brazil stands apart from India and South Africa for
   its greater willingness to support stronger human rights positions.},

Abstract = {Understanding how different groups of users make choices is central to
   explaining the outcomes of choice-based mechanisms such as those
   observed in education systems across different national contexts. We
   discuss two established perspectives employed to explain decision-making
   in relation to class and education, and develop an argument for the
   superior explanatory potential of an elaborated, interactive,
   sociological rational choice perspective. We illustrate how this
   framework may be operationalised to inform policy aimed at reducing
   class differentials in school choice and subsequent educational outcomes
   in the context of New Public Management ideas.},

Abstract = {It is by now well known that political attitudes can be affected by
   emotions. Most earlier studies have focused on emotions generated by
   some political event (e.g., terrorism or increased immigration).
   However, the methods used in previous efforts have made it difficult to
   untangle the various causal pathways that might link emotions to
   political beliefs. In contrast, we focus on emotions incidental (i.e.,
   irrelevant) to the decision process, allowing us to cleanly trace and
   estimate the effect of experimentally induced anxiety on political
   beliefs. Further, we build upon innovative new work that links
   physiological reactivity (Hatemi, McDermott, Eaves, Kendler, \& Neale,
   2013; Oxley etal., 2008a) to attitudes by using skin conductance
   reactivity as a measure of emotional arousal. We found that
   anxietygenerated by a video stimulussignificantly affected physiological
   arousal as measured by tonic skin-conductance levels, and that higher
   physiological reactivity predicted more anti-immigration attitudes. We
   show that physiological reactivity mediated the relationship between
   anxiety and political attitudes.},

Abstract = {The impacts that governments and institutions have on environmental
   policy-making constitute a core concern in environmental politics.
   Authoritarian environmentalism (AE) presents a model of top-down,
   non-participatory environmental policy-making. The model, however,
   remains underspecified with its premises untested and its application
   confined to non-democratic countries. This study addresses these gaps
   through a case study of South Korea's Four Major Rivers Restoration
   Project. The study illustrates how various path-dependent legacies from
   the era of the authoritarian developmental state shaped the policy
   context in which policymakers in democratic Korea adopted AE as its
   approach to environmental governance. More broadly, this case
   demonstrates how the relationship between a type of regime and its mode
   of policy-making and policy outcomes is tenuous, suggesting that
   environmental politics should move beyond the examination of formal
   institutional features to incorporate various state development
   trajectories to unravel the nature of their environmental politics and
   policy-making.},

Abstract = {Scholars' criticism of transparency in public-private partnerships
   (PPPs) often focuses on `external' transparency, that is, the extent to
   which internal information is visible to the outside world. However, to
   achieve external transparency, internal transparency - the availability
   and inferability of information for the public procurer and the private
   party - is crucial. In this article we analyse input, process, and
   output transparency from three different perspectives (institutional,
   cognitive, and strategic) in four PPPs in the Netherlands. We conclude
   that input transparency is high, but process and output transparency
   less so. Moreover, output transparency has gained importance in PPPs.
   Whether this is problematic depends on the PPPs' institutional
   environment. In some partnerships the desired output is uncontested and
   predetermined by clear standards in the institutional environment,
   whereas other PPPs deal with contested output norms, decreasing the
   partnerships' transparency. These results nuance the current debate on
   the lack of transparency in PPPs.},

Abstract = {What threat do foreign Arab jihadists returning from the war in Syria
   and Iraq pose to their home states and the broader Arab world? Foreign
   fighters come back as hardened veterans, steady in the face of danger
   and skilled in the use of weapons and explosives. While in the conflict
   zone, they will form networks with other radicals, embrace techniques
   like suicide bombings and beheadings, and establish ties to jihadists
   around the world. Different countries have different mitigating factors
   that limit the danger. The presence or absence of strong and focused
   security services is particularly important. Returnees' ambition,
   regional focus, lack of discipline, and brutality often mean they create
   more enemies than they vanquish and anger local populations. Most
   terrorism will be locally and regionally focused, with international
   terrorism probably less of a priority. Area regimes can reduce the risk
   of bleedout by hindering the travel of volunteers and constraining their
   ability to organize, stressing the internecine nature of the violence in
   the Sunni Muslim community, and developing effective de-radicalization
   programs. Regional and international cooperation to monitor and disrupt
   travel is also valuable. Many regimes, however, are also likely to take
   advantage of the jihadists' presence to gain more support from the
   United States, delay democratic reforms, and crackdown on non-jihadist
   opposition. Improving intelligence sharing and offensive
   counterintelligence is important, and the United States can play an
   important facilitating role.},

Abstract = {The debate about socio-economic inequalities and class has become
   increasingly important in mainstream academic and political debates.
   This article shows that during the late 2000s class analysis was
   rediscovered in Romania both as an analytical category and as a category
   of practice. The evidence suggests that this was the result of two
   converging processes: the deepening crisis of Western capitalism after
   2008 and the country's increasingly transnational networks of young
   scholars, journalists, and civil society actors. Although a steady and
   focused interest in class analysis is a novelty in Romania's academia,
   media, and political life and has the potential to change the political
   conversation in the future, so far the social fields where this analysis
   is practiced have remained relatively marginal.},

Abstract = {Human rights are not primarily technical-legal issues. While much
   research and debate has revolved around the legal nature of human
   rights, comparatively little attention has been offered to their
   political character. Human rights define basic norms, values and
   interests in human and social life, but they are, at the same time,
   always secured or denied in political and social contexts of power, and
   situations of competition over resources. This article reports on a
   research project that made detailed empirical analyses of how different
   forms of power constrain human rights activism in six different
   countries, and examines the construction of countervailing empowerment
   to challenge such power structures. It argues that more systematic
   analytical attention should be paid to power and political analysis of
   human rights in development contexts.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the constitutional and legal foundations of local
   public administration in Romania. It appears, therefore, that the local
   public administration built on the principle of local autonomy benefits
   from a general regulation starting from its explicit recognition by the
   constitutional text and continuing with the development of its legal
   status in different regulations of organic or ordinary character. The
   Constitution of Romania, adopted in 1991 and revised in 2003,
   established the constitutional foundation of local public
   administration, establishing the principles under which the
   administration of local communities is organized and functions, how the
   territory of the state is divided, the authorities exercising local
   autonomy, as well as the body exercising the control of administrative
   tutelage over the acts of local public administration authorities. The
   constitutional norms valued as principles allowed the subsequent
   adoption of regulations that develop and strengthen the status of
   existing local communities within the administrative-territorial units
   in Romania.},

Abstract = {The preferences of the Mexican people with regard to international
   issues are stable and consistent over time. Even given the poor level of
   knowledge of international affairs, the difference in opinion between
   the best and least well-informed Mexicans in minimum. There is a robust
   system of political beliefs that provides Mexicans with the conceptual
   tools to understand the complexity of global issues. Thus, Mexican
   foreign policy is attuned to the preferences of national opinion in
   conceptual terms; in addition, this may be seen as a valuable input when
   defining and implementing the country's foreign policy.},

Abstract = {In science the usual research and thinking are based on the cause-effect
   relations while in the law this approach is mainly used in adjudication
   and not in rule making. Within the latter causality cannot reach a
   scientific level, so there are substitutes of causation at work that are
   a base also for the canons of interpretation. Draft rules are in the
   majority of cases prepared by the public administration, but
   surprisingly there is a little emphasis of the public administration's
   role at interpretation of the (draft and enacted) rules. The paper deals
   with reasons for the absence of causation in rule making, states the
   non-scientific substitutes of causation in rule making and points at the
   modus operandi of rule making in the absence of causality for which
   administrative deference is of crucial importance. The paper gives
   reasons for the absence of canons of interpretation in Europe and gives
   the most important canons of interpretation for the rulemaking in the
   public administration. This work can be more complex than judicial,
   because the element of institution's impact is more present in the
   first.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},

Volume = {52},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {It is argued that threat related to territorial civil wars generates
   negative interpersonal attitudes that are both more intense and more
   broadly oriented than previously thought. That is, civil wars fought
   over issues of autonomy or secession foment social intolerance, a broad
   orientation that extends well beyond members of former enemy groups to
   an aversion to interpersonal differences in general. The expectation
   that the issue the civil war is fought over is consequential is tested
   with data from the World Values Survey and the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict
   Dataset. The empirical domain consists of over 130,000 individuals
   across 123 surveys in 69 countries over the 1989-2008 period. Results
   from multilevel models indicate a positive and statistically significant
   relationship between domestic territorial conflicts and subsequent
   social intolerance. Substantively, territorial civil wars have a far
   greater impact on individuals' attitudes than do standard' correlates of
   social intolerance that are well established in the literature. Further,
   non-territorial civil war is unrelated to attitudes of social
   intolerance. Empirical results are robust to several model
   specifications and are not a mere artifact of the potential reverse
   relationship, whereby intolerant societies are (erroneously) presumed to
   be at a higher risk of civil wars in the first place. The findings have
   implications for the understanding of civil war resolution, civil war
   reoccurrence, and the contextual correlates of interpersonal
   intolerance.},

Abstract = {This article explores British citizens' evaluations of political
   processes against the backdrop of wider political disengagement. It
   adapts Hibbing and Theiss-Morse's framework for measuring attitudes in
   both process space' and policy space' and, drawing on data from a survey
   fielded in March 2011, analyses the factors that shape Britons'
   preferences concerning political decision making. It also analyses the
   relative importance of policy and process evaluations as predictors of
   government approval and support for two key civic norms, that people
   should comply with the law and that they have a duty to vote. It finds
   that most respondents think that decision making should involve both
   elected politicians and ordinary people, but respondents who are more
   critical of politicians' conduct tend to express support for greater
   levels of popular involvement. It also finds that the significance of
   process evaluations is overshadowed by other attitudes, especially
   respondents' perceptions of politicians' integrity and responsiveness.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the perceived inadequacy of political liberalism
   to account for the normative priority of political values over
   non-political ones in cases of conflict between the two. I address this
   challenge by developing a revised account of congruence built on a
   public and shared rationale for endorsing the deliberative priority of
   political values. Such an account can be developed on the basis of the
   idea of civic friendship as a shared motivation among citizens in a
   society marked by reasonable pluralism. I show how the assumption of
   such a motivation across contractors in the Original Position can be
   warranted and what its implications are for the congruence between the
   political values expressed in a conception of justice and the
   non-political values forming part of citizens' conceptions of the good.},

Abstract = {Countries increasingly bring in facilitators for managing high-tech
   networks. Facilitators are broadly defined as experts who take on a
   central position in the network with the goal of connecting various
   stakeholder groups. They also receive public funding and pose as a
   communication link between stakeholders and government. However, the use
   of facilitators challenges government to identify their benefits. Based
   on three case studies and interviews in biotechnology networks, the
   article opens up the black box of facilitation. It addresses the
   evaluation challenges by establishing a conceptual framework based on
   collaborative and absorptive capacity-building theory to identify the
   elements relevant to facilitation. The analysis of Chicago (USA),
   Medicon Valley (Denmark/Sweden), and Singapore shows that facilitators
   not only create capacity-enhancing elements within networks, they also
   occur in varying forms, including a government-and stakeholder-funded
   model in European countries, an independent model in North America, and
   a government-financed model in Asia.},

Abstract = {Status has long been implicated as a critical value of states and
   leaders in international politics. However, decades of research on the
   link between status and conflict have yielded divergent findings, and
   little evidence of a causal relationship. I attempt to resolve this
   impasse by shifting the focus from status to relative status concerns in
   building a theory of status from the ground up, beginning with its
   behavioral microfoundations. I build on and extend previous work through
   an experimental study of status threats and the escalation of
   commitment, operationalized here as a new behavioral escalation task
   using real financial incentives and framed around a narrative of war and
   peace. I utilize a unique sample of high-profile political and military
   leaders from the Senior Executive Fellow (SEF) program at the Harvard
   Kennedy School, as well as a group of demographically matched control
   subjects, allowing me to evaluate the moderating effect of power on
   status concerns while also addressing typical concerns about external
   validity in IR experiments. I find strong evidence that the fear of
   losing status impedes decision making and increases the tendency to
   ``throw good money after bad,{''} but that power aids decision making by
   buffering high-power subjects against the worst effects of status loss.},

Abstract = {Should we take for granted strategic reasoning that states that military
   violence is a rational means used to serve political ends ? This article
   addresses this issue through a reading of works in the humanities
   (history, anthropology, and communication studies) other than
   international relations. Using these, it highlights the fact that
   strategic reasoning owes its staying power to the interests of certain
   actors responsible for framing the effects of the use of force in a
   highly selective, if not overtly biased manner. To take the full measure
   of this phenomenon, a non-disciplinary approach is needed.},

Abstract = {On 4 February 2014, Al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan (aka Al Qaeda Central)
   repudiated Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq. Ayman
   al-Zawahiri declared that al-Baghdadi and his newly formed Islamic State
   in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) were no longer part of Al Qaeda's
   organization and Al Qaeda Central could not be held responsible for
   ISIL's behavior. It represents the first time that Al Qaeda Central has
   renounced an affiliate publicly. The announcement was driven by months
   of fighting between ISIL and Jabhat al-Nusra, another Al Qaeda affiliate
   in Syria. In fact, in Syria, Al Qaeda fighters are competing against
   each other for influence, as well as against other opposition groups,
   the Syrian regime, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iraqi
   militiamen, and Lebanese Hezbollah. This chaotic, semi-proxy war is
   unlike any previous problem encountered, made even more challenging by
   the limited U.S. presence on-the-ground. More worrisome, this semi-proxy
   war also has spread beyond Syria. Similar dynamics have emerged in Iraq,
   Yemen, and Lebanon to a certain extent. This article argues that these
   dynamics necessitate a twist in U.S. counterterrorism strategy.},

Abstract = {Modern jihadism has experienced two distinct crises. The present study
   analyzes recent developments in jihadism, which can be seen in
   connection with efforts to solve the latest recruitment crisis of global
   jihad, and is based on comparative interviews with eight Swedish
   jihadists defined as foreign fighters. The study identifies three new
   trends evident in the interviews comparing jihadists active in Syria
   with those who fought in Afghanistan and Bosnia: socialization to global
   jihad, normalization of jihad, and an increasing use of the doctrine of
   takfir (i.e., ex-communication). This can be described as indicating the
   radicalization of local jihad, as the territorially based jihad,
   championed by Abdullah Azzam, and the global jihad of Osama bin Laden
   meet in the territorial realities of Syria and Iraq.},

Abstract = {Research Highlights and Abstract This article Contributes to theoretical
   debates about the significance of group identity and political
   representation; Contributes to academic research into the shift from
   formal and hierarchical to more informal and network-based styles of
   governance; Contributes to research on the integration of Muslims in
   Britain by elucidating the emergence and diversification of Muslim
   representative organisations in Britain since 1970; Demonstrates the
   multifaceted and dynamic nature of Muslim representative claims-making
   in contemporary UK governance by identifying and analysing a range of
   modes of Muslim representation.
   Since the turn of the century Britain has seen a proliferation of Muslim
   civil society organisations and an increase in the number of points of
   contact between Muslim spokespersons and government. Yet, this increased
   participation in UK governance has been a source of fierce controversies
   centring on the role of conservative male leaderships and the influence
   of radical Islamic groups. Drawing on interviews with 42 national elites
   who have engaged in UK Muslim-government relations in the past decade,
   this article charts the emergence of national-level Muslim
   representation and assesses its relationship to democratic participation
   and accountability. Building on the work of Michael Saward, we argue
   that unelected civil society representatives can act as an important
   supplement to elected representatives. We show how four modes of Muslim
   representation have emerged in the last decadedelegation', authority',
   expertise' and standing'creating dynamic competition among
   representative claims.},

Abstract = {With the increasing opportunities for justice ushered in by the repeal
   of the Full Stop and Due Obedience laws in 2005, the struggles for
   memory and justice by Argentina's H.I.J.O.S. (Sons and Daughters for
   Identity and Justice against Forgetting and Silence) have shifted focus.
   Pre-2005, the organization used escraches (public demonstrations in
   which the perpetrators of human rights violations are outed) to respond
   to the problem of top-down impunity in Argentina, condemn the
   atrocities, and expose the legal immunity enjoyed by the perpetrators.
   Post-2005, it has employed escraches to bring to the fore shortcomings
   in the judicial sphere by widening its selection of targets.
   Furthermore, new activities outside and inside the courtroom reflect the
   new landscape of justice, celebrating the advent of justice and
   accompanying victims, survivors, and witnesses in this process while
   continuing to highlight persistent shortcomings and obstacles in the
   judicial sphere. Con las nuevas oportunidades para la justicia que trajo
   la anulacion de las leyes de Punto Final y de Obediencia Debida en 2005,
   la organizacion argentina H.I.J.O.S. (Hijos e Hijas por la Identidad y
   la Justicia contra el Olvido y el Silencio) ha reorientado el enfoque de
   sus luchas por la memoria y la justicia. Antes de 2005, la organizacion
   usaba los escraches (manifestaciones publicas en las cuales los
   responsables de violaciones derechos humanos son sacados del closet o
   puestos al descubierto) para responder al problema de la impunidad en la
   Argentina, condenar las atrocidades y poner de manifiesto la impunidad
   legal de la cual gozaban los autores de las violaciones. Despues de
   2005, los escraches ampliaron la seleccion de sus blancos de ataque y
   sirvieron para llamar la atencion sobre las deficiencias del sistema
   judicial. Ademas, las nuevas actividades fuera y dentro de los
   tribunales reflejan el nuevo panorama de la justicia, al celebrar la
   llegada de la misma y acompanar a las victimas, a los sobrevivientes y a
   los testigos en este proceso mientras continuan denunciando las
   deficiencias y los obstaculos persistentes en la esfera judicial.},

Abstract = {The democratization that followed the last military dictatorship in
   Argentina (1976-1983) has been influenced by human rights organizations'
   relentless work to bring about truth and justice regarding the
   consequences of state terrorism and to keep the memory of that period
   alive. These efforts frame the discursive context in which human rights
   violations, including torture, are interpreted in contemporary
   Argentina. Argentine interviewees from across the political spectrum
   condemn torture, but the language and frames they use and the narratives
   surrounding political events vary. These accounts expose the conflicted
   terrain of memory making and the ambivalences and contradictions that
   permeate the construction of a torture-rejecting culture. La
   democratizacion que vino despues de la ultima dictadura militar en la
   Argentina (1976-1983) ha sido influenciada por el trabajo incesante de
   las organizaciones de derechos humanos para lograr que se establezca la
   verdad y se haga justicia sobre las consecuencias del terrorismo de
   estado y para mantener la memoria sobre ese periodo viva. Estos
   esfuerzos enmarcan el contexto discursivo a traves del cual las
   violaciones de los derechos humanos, entre ellas la tortura, son
   interpretadas en la Argentina contemporanea. Las personas entrevistadas
   en Argentina, quienes atraviesan el espectro politico, condenan la
   tortura. Sin embargo, el lenguaje y los esquemas que usan y las
   narrativas sobre los acontecimientos politicos varian. Estos relatos
   exponen el terreno conflictivo de la construccion de la memoria y las
   ambivalencias y contradicciones que permean la construccion de una
   cultura de rechazo hacia la tortura.},

Abstract = {Though increasingly legitimate, humanitarian intervention by the United

   how the increasing legitimacy of human rights norms is changing the

   about Iraq, Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Darfur, and
   Libya, the article delineates the conditions under which discourse
   creates new opportunities for the Security Council to authorize, engage
   in, and support humanitarian intervention.},

Abstract = {Focusing on the case of multinational enterprises (MNEs), this article
   argues we have reason to reject assigning human rights obligations to
   business enterprises and their managers. The article begins by
   distinguishing business and human rights from the more general topic of
   corporate responsibility. Following Buchanan (2013), the article takes
   the ideal of status egalitarianism to be central to human rights. Status
   egalitarianism holds that all members of society stand as moral equals
   in relation to one another and that the state has a duty to recognize
   and protect that equal standing both in its dealings with citizens and
   in their dealings with one another. To assign human rights obligations
   to MNEs and their managers risks undermining this ideal. The article
   situates this argument in relation to the United Nations ``Protect,
   Respect and Remedy{''} Framework by discussing the way in which MNEs can
   be complicit in state failures to protect citizens.},

Abstract = {In Kenya road building, widely viewed as an `unqualified human good', is
   closely linked to an `Africa Rising' narrative. In this paper the author
   argues that road building is an attempt to assert political authority
   derived from a longstanding developmentalist impulse, one in which
   private accumulation and spectacular public works go hand in hand. In
   light of massive infrastructural transformations, the author develops a
   conceptualisation of the right to the city: what is needed is a radical
   understanding of the city and its potentialities that wrests control of
   the idea away from a bureaucratic vision, and imbues it instead with
   collective meaning.},

Abstract = {This paper attempts a typology of the models of managing local language
   press in sub-Saharan Africa. Two models are identified: the mainstream
   and the subsidiary. In the mainstream model are local language
   newspapers that exist as sole or main products of a media organisation.
   The subsidiary model consists of local language newspapers that exist as
   subsidiary products of a foreign (but dominant) language media
   organisation. The two models are essentially differentiated based on two
   major factors: Focus/Attention/Priority and Resources (Sharing) - Men,
   Materials, Machine and Marketing. Using critical political economy as a
   theoretical framework, the paper draws examples from local language
   press establishments in Africa to discuss this model. Irrespective of
   the model of management adopted, the survival of local language
   newspapers in sub-Saharan Africa remains precarious. Even though the
   general situation with local language press in sub-Saharan Africa is not
   exciting, there are however some success stories that can be situated
   within either of the two management models.},

Abstract = {The recent global financial crisis has generated substantial research
   interest in the relationships among savings, inequality and global
   imbalances. Our study examines the causes of global imbalances by
   analysing the relationship between income inequality and economic
   performance and the relationship between savings imbalances and economic
   instability. We identify a positive link between savings and inequality
   whenever savings are allocated through the financial market to
   investment firms for production. However, this relationship becomes
   negative when non-saving households borrow savers' funds for
   consumption. Our findings suggest that income inequality should be
   reduced in both China and the US to mitigate global imbalances.},

Abstract = {This article considers how US securities disclosures might be used to
   further human rights interests. It focuses on Section 1502 of the
   Dodd-Frank Act. That section was enacted as an express reaction to human
   rights violations occurring in the Democratic Republic of Congo
   ({''}DRC{''}). Section 1502 requires certain companies to disclose their
   use of conflict minerals in their products, in the hope that such
   disclosure requirements would cause companies to stop using the minerals
   and thereby to force change in the DRC. The section thus serves as a
   potential model for future human-rights-based disclosure. This article
   explores that potential.},

Title = {From Glass Ceiling to Glass Cliff: Women in Senior Executive Service},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {399-426},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The dominant paradigm that frames the challenges women face in attaining
   upward mobility has been the glass ceiling metaphor. However, over the
   last decades women have made steady progress and are moving to positions
   of leadership. Women in leadership positions continue to face an uphill
   battle; they often are placed in precarious positions setting them up
   for failure and pushing them over the edge-a phenomenon recently termed
   as ``glass cliff.{''} Using data from the 2010 Federal Employee
   Viewpoint Survey, this research examines the challenges women face in
   Senior Executive Service (SES) in various US federal government agencies
   (distributive, redistributive, regulatory, and constituent policy). The
   study is based on three widely discussed theories in the field of social
   psychology-think-managerthink-male, social role theory, and role
   incongruity theory. The study findings indicate that SES women in
   distributive and constituent policy agencies are most likely to face
   glass cliffs. The odds of women falling off the cliff are less when
   women have influence over policy-making decisions, perceive empowerment,
   and experience organizational equities.},

Title = {Ecological modernisation of a `Cinderella renewable'? The emerging

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},

Volume = {24},

Pages = {249-269},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {Ideologies, instruments and institutions that promote ocean energies
   (OE), a marine renewable including wave and tidal devices technologies,
   are examined within an ecological modernisation (EM) perspective. EM
   type arguments provide ideological justification for OE projects, but
   are vulnerable to environmental and cost critiques. Already, large tidal
   barrage projects have faced opposition from environmentalists, even
   though they offer significant generation capacity. Unlike wind energy,
   where grassroots activists played a vital role, the strongest
   institutional advocates for OE are larger firms, universities, and
   specialist agencies, together with sub-national governments. Regarding
   instruments, the overall amount of subsidies combined with political
   support seems more important than feed-in tariffs. Given a backlash
   against renewables and a competing offshore wind sector, it remains
   unclear whether a `blue growth' ecological modernisation strategy can
   promote what remains a Cinderella renewable.},

Abstract = {Our article analyzes how transitioning political institutions create
   incentives and disincentives for opposition groups to incite different
   forms of political violence. We argue that variation on two specific
   parameters of governancechecks and balances and political
   participationcompels states toward one of the three forms of conflict,
   including civil wars, political militia, and riots. Using disaggregated
   data on different types of political violence across Africa from 1997 to
   2012, we analyzed two parameters of governance in both count and change
   models. We also identified high-risk conflict periods. Typical regime
   types (democracy, autocracy, anocracy) cannot explain manifestations of
   conflict, as violence occurs in regimes with varying levels of political
   openness and competition. Opposition groups actively respond to regime
   transitions, as changes in institutional parameters correlate with
   shifts into alternative forms of violence within states.},

Abstract = {Usually the provision of international environmental public goods cannot
   be secured by a single state. Rather, a group of major powers has to
   pool its resources to provide structural leadership in order to achieve
   an effective regime. Such a group of pushers uses its structural power
   to achieve its goal. However, it faces two challenges. First, it may
   have to overcome the opposition of a group of laggards that desires less
   environmental protection and may try to counter the pushers' efforts. We
   hypothesise that the regime will be more effective to the extent to
   which the pushers predominate over the laggards in terms of structural
   power. Second, both groups may have to overcome a collective action
   problem with regard to dispensing costly side-payments. We argue that
   social capital embedded in inter-state networks may help the groups to
   overcome such collective action problems. Thus we argue that the regime
   will be more effective to the extent to which pushers are predominant
   and also have more social capital than laggards. Empirical results
   support our hypotheses.},

Abstract = {This article examines the strategic positioning of Brazil in South
   America and how South America relates to Brazil's rising status both
   globally and regionally. It does so from the perspective of
   international society known as the English school. This perspective
   emphasizes how Brazil shares a number of values and institutions with
   its neighbors that offer the foundations for a distinct regional
   international society in South America. It thus challenges the
   materialist stance held by realism which envisages that secondary powers
   either balance or bandwagon the dominant pole and affirms instead that
   South America's strategies towards Brazil are more complex and nuanced
   than a simple polarity standpoint suggests.},

Abstract = {The Western hegemony of the past 200 years is ending as power shifts
   towards the East and as Western states lose the authority to uphold a
   rules-based multilateral order. In the wake of the Great Crash of 2008
   the G20 leaders took steps to bolster the multilateral order, including
   reform of the governance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
   the World Bank so as to reflect the increasing economic weight of
   developing countries. The executive boards of both organizations
   affirmed that the primary criterion for allocating voting shares should
   be shares of world GDP. We show that the reforms at the IMF and the
   World Bank have substantially failed to meet their ostensible
   objectives. First, in both organizations the developed countries gained
   voting share relative to GDP share between 2009 and 2014. Second,
   countries continue to vary widely in their share of votes relative to
   share of world GDP; in both organizations some countries have six times
   or more the votes relative to GDP of others. Politicians and analysts
   should give attention to achieving more equitable governance in these
   important multilateral organizations. At the end of this article we show
   how this could be done.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1, SI},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Theories of demoi-cracy have recently gained salience in the continuous
   debate on a legitimate democratic Euro polity. Demoi-crats argue that
   multiple demoi can provide the European Union (EU) with its much
   sought-after democratic legitimacy. This article aims to offer an
   empirical contribution to the literature on the EU as a legitimate
   demoi-cracy. The media debates in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom
   and France were analysed in order to identify resonance of demoi-cratic
   ideas. Comparative analysis of legitimation statements in opinion
   articles in two quality newspapers per country shows that the debates
   often share a similar point of departure as demoi-cratic theories.
   However, the evaluation of this situation and the existing EU
   structures' legitimacy relies on either intergovernmental or
   supranational democratic idea(l)s. In conclusion, the analysis offers
   little evidence of ideas of demoi-cracy resonating in these elite
   debates on the EU's legitimacy except for a few potentially promising
   exceptions.},

Abstract = {This article makes an assessment of the nationwide automation of the
   2010 and 2013 synchronized elections in the Philippines from a viewpoint
   of election administration. It first reviews the traditional manual
   system of pre-automation, identifies its problems regarding fraud and
   inefficiency, and traces the historical process of introducing
   Information and Communication Technology (ICT) into election
   administration in the country. On the basis of both quantitative and
   qualitative data obtained from election and other statistics, various
   published and unpublished materials, interviews and field visits, the
   article then examines the 2010 and 2013 election automation in its four
   phases, namely, (1) voter registration, (2) voting, (3) tallying, and
   (4) data consolidation, and makes an assessment in terms of three frames
   of reference, namely, (1) voting right protection, (2) fraud prevention,
   and (3) administrative rationality which includes accuracy, efficiency,
   and economy. Finally, the article argues that, although it had many
   problems, the automation as implemented in the two sets of elections
   should be considered a success in the sense that it managed elections
   much better than the previous manual system.},

Volume = {36},

Abstract = {This article reconstructs the stories of three women who experienced
   armed conflict in the Philippines. Their narratives were documented
   through the process of individual storytelling, an exercise that
   involved reflexive meaning creation on the part of the storyteller.
   Thus, even as there have been numerous studies reflecting the discourses
   of women's victimization/vulnerability and agency in the context of
   armed conflict, this article stands by the importance of each and every
   story told by each and every woman. In other words, beyond the project
   of narrative documentation and analysis lies that marginal space where
   stories told are not just valuable for the hard data they contain; their
   significance must also be seen from the vantage points of storytellers
   as co-creators of knowledge that can provide alternative perspectives on
   the linearity of the discourses of women's victimization/vulnerability
   and agency.},

Abstract = {Despite significant social movements, such as the trade union movement
   in the 1970s and the Zapatista uprising in the 1990s, civil society had
   little involvement in the democratization process the country underwent
   during the 1990s that led to the PRI losing control of the presidential
   office for the first tune. Moreover traditional stakeholders such as
   trade union movements have lost their central role. This paper analyzes
   two Mexican social movements of great significance. It starts out from
   the consideration that While it is important to analyze the capacity of
   social movements to influence the political system, it is even more
   important to study them on the basis of the meaning they themselves
   ascribe to their actions.},

Abstract = {The established view in political science is that a sound and
   functioning state has to be in place before democracy can be introduced.
   State first, and then democracy. While acknowledging the existence of a
   basic state infrastructure as a necessary starting point, we examine the
   possibility that democratization itself may play an important role in
   the subsequent development and consolidation of the state. We do this by
   addressing the major conceptual and methodological shortcomings of
   existing research on this topic. The results of our panel analysis,
   covering a population of 122 countries, show that both a country's level
   of democracy and the interaction between degree and duration of
   democracy positively and significantly affect the consolidation of the
   state and of its two key individual dimensions, namely, political order
   and administrative capacity.},

   Framework for Analysis},

Abstract = {Following a review of current scholarship on identity and integration
   patterns of Russian speakers in the Baltic states, this article proposes
   an analytical framework to help understand current trends. Rogers
   Brubaker's widely employed triadic nexus is expanded to demonstrate why
   a form of Russian-'speaking identity has been emerging, but has failed
   to become fully consolidated, and why significant integration has
   occurred structurally but not identificationally. By enumerating the
   subfields of political, economic, and cultural stances' and
   `representations' the model helps to understand the complicated
   integration processes of minority groups that possess complex
   relationships with `external homelands', `nationalizing states' and
   `international organizations'. Ultimately, it is argued that
   socio-economic factors largely reduce the capacity for a consolidated
   identity; political factors have a moderate tendency to reduce this
   capacity, whereas cultural factors generally increase the potential for
   a consolidated group identity.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the ability of militarily aligned small states
   to function as norm entrepreneurs to increase their own state interests.
   The scholarship on small state foreign policy is growing. This article
   builds on that scholarship by focusing on the promising, yet
   underdeveloped field of norm building. While small state scholars have
   researched norm-building capabilities in non-aligned states, research
   has not been done on the ability of aligned small states to build norms.
   Since the end of the Cold War, more and more small states are turning
   away from neutrality in favour of security organizations, NATO in
   particular. This has created a significant gap in the literature of
   small states that this article will address. Using Estonia's efforts at
   establishing norms in cybersecurity as a case study, this article
   analyses whether Estonia's membership in NATO helps or hinders its
   efforts in norm building. The research shows that NATO membership has
   helped Estonia's efforts in promoting norms, but also has limitations.
   Despite those limitations, this research shows that for small states
   with big ideas, the promotion of norms can be a powerful means to
   further state interest on the global level.},

Abstract = {Why has Brazil traditionally adopted a defensive position in
   multilateral negotiations on trade in services? Three explanatory
   factors are typically used for understanding the domestic determinants
   of economic diplomacy: interests, institutions, and ideas. In this
   study, I assess the role of these variables in determining the Brazilian
   stance in the negotiations on trade in services in the Uruguay Round. I
   use archival evidence and interviews in a case study designed to recover
   the country's negotiating position throughout the round of negotiations,
   identify the preferences of relevant government and private actors, and
   reveal the mechanisms and loci of government-business interaction.},

Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},

Pages = {243-267},
Abstract = {How does democracy influence terrorism? The regime-responsive school
   argues that lack of representation in autocracies motivates violence;
   the regime-permissive school posits that individual liberty in
   democracies allows it. The schools thus disagree about the democratic
   feature to which violence respondsrepresentation or individual liberty.
   These arguments are problematic in two ways. First, neither accounts for
   the potentially competing effects of different democratic features.
   Second, treating terrorism as a set response to operating context
   ignores the operational processes behind violence, described in
   organizational theories of terrorism. This article develops a bridge
   between the regime-responsive and regime-permissive schools by applying
   organizational theories of terrorism to their key arguments. I argue
   that representation and individual liberty have independent, and
   sometimes competing, effects on armed groups' missions, hierarchies, and
   membershipcollectively organizational capacity, the ability to survive
   and influence the environment. This explains the mixed effects of
   democracy on terrorism: both high-functioning democracy and repressive
   autocracy weaken organizational capacity, but decreased representation
   in a democracy or higher individual liberty in an autocracy removes
   organizational stresses. New research on Chile between 1965 and
   1995representing five government periods, with four armed groups
   operatingacts as an initial test of these relationships.},

Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3},
Pages = {297-313},
Abstract = {While large multilateral peace operations arrive with agendas extending
   into governance, economics and other reforms, unarmed civilian
   peacekeeping (UCP) interventions focus on contributing to sufficiently
   safe space for local efforts at peacebuilding to proceed at the request
   of local partners. They use a variety of nonviolent methods to increase
   the safety for local leaders and everyday people to engage in (re)
   building peace infrastructures and governance, within their own culture
   and contexts. This paper examines the potential for international
   interveners to support local efforts based on local invitations, local
   staff, conflict and context analysis, and living in conflict affected
   communities, followed by a case study of the Non-violent Peaceforce
   South Sudan project. This project helps to revitalise or create
   community peace infrastructures in coordination with local partners,
   other peacekeepers and humanitarian agencies, local government, army and
   other armed actors. This has protected civilians, saved lives,
   contributed to improved policing, improved relations between ethnic
   groups, supported local peace actors and increased the effectiveness of
   multilateral peace operations and humanitarian aid work focused on
   physical safety.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {26-38},
Abstract = {In recent years, Nigeria has been quietly expelling more and more
   immigrants from Niger, Mali, Chad and Cameroon. These foreigners -
   migrant workers or small traders - face the reinforcement of migration
   control and the blind fight of the government against Boko Haram.
   Despite its political instability, Nigeria remains a major immigration
   destination in West Africa. In this article, I analyze the
   ``undocumented{''} expulsion of aliens in 1983, officially three million
   people. I argue that the expulsion was due to the economic crisis but
   also to a nationalist revenge against Ghana and a political calculation
   of President Shagari. This implies the exclusion of foreigners from the

Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {53},
Number = {3},
Pages = {315-340},
Abstract = {The BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) have differed in
   their government response to health epidemics. It is argued that Brazil
   eventually outpaced her emerging counterparts in response to AIDS
   (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) due to the presence of political
   institutional, civil societal, and foreign policy strategies that both
   sustained and encouraged the introduction of innovative policies. The
   concept of historical policy backlash is introduced in order to explain
   how the BRIC' differences in their historic roles as foreign aid donors
   in health shaped their incentive to either focus on domestic AIDS policy
   or foreign aid strategies at the expense of domestic policy. This
   article therefore represents the first attempt to combine comparative
   political-historical, social, and international processes to account for
   differences in the BRIC nations willingness and capacity to respond to
   AIDS.},

Title = {WHO orchestrates? Coping with competitors in global health},
Booktitle = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AS ORCHESTRATORS},
Year = {2015},
Pages = {191-213},
Abstract = {This chapter examines how the WHO's orchestrating role has been reshaped
   by the proliferation of actors in the international health field.
   Lacking the material capabilities to perform its technical functions on
   its own, WHO traditionally draws on its formal authority and convening
   power tomobilize other international organizations and non-governmental
   associations for research, surveillance and technical assistance
   activities. Yet as this chapter demonstrates, the growing density of the
   health field since the 1980s has played out differently on WHO's ability
   to orchestrate. Comparing the domains of epidemiological surveillance
   and technical assistance, I argue that IGO focality is critical for
   recruiting new actors as intermediaries. As WHO's recent empowerment in
   health surveillance demonstrates, new intermediaries can become powerful
   allies that allow a focal IGO to engage in orchestration, and even to
   gain greater autonomy from member-state oversight. By contrast, as WHO
   lacks focality in the developmental domain, its attempts to orchestrate
   health assistance are increasingly frustrated. Additionally, states have
   used new exit options to strengthen their oversight over WHO through
   project-specific contracts. Thus, this within-case comparison not only
   illuminates the inter-organizational dynamics underlying orchestration,
   but also points out how focality, intermediary availability and state
   oversight interact to either reinforce or undermine IGO orchestration.},

Volume = {14},

Pages = {197-217},
Abstract = {This paper looks at the case of citizenship in Kosovo and argues that
   the mismatch between the idea of a `liberal' state and the practice of
   group differentiation, on the one hand, and the socio-political reality
   that emerged in the post-war period, on the other, has resulted in a
   citizenship regime that is hierarchical. It aims to demonstrate how
   despite the legally enshrined promise of equality, differentiated
   citizenship, together with a political context defined by an ethnic
   divide and past structural inequalities, as well as uneven external
   citizenship opportunities, contributed to the emergence of hierarchical
   citizenship, in which some groups (communities), or
   `rights-and-duty-bearing units', are more equal than the others.},

Abstract = {The chapter sets out a framework for analyzing how `Europe', and in
   particular the EU, is contested within and across an enlarged EU
   composed of diverse welfare capitalist models. Understanding European
   integration as an open-ended, contingent, political project, the chapter
   considers two dimensions of EU contestation: (a) left/right ideas on
   state intervention in the economy and (b) market-making versus
   market-shaping ideas on European integration. The chapter offers a
   constructivist political economy approach to EL' political contention
   considering how domestic actors, namely post-socialist intellectual
   technocratic elites, ascribe the EU with different meanings depending on
   particular national, collective understandings about the ideal
   relationship between the state, market, and society.},

   Intelligence Estimate},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {36},
Number = {3},
Pages = {432-452},
Abstract = {Strategic uncertainty remains a significant challenge for defence
   planners and national leaders responsible for developing and acquiring
   future military capabilities. Concerns in the United States over missile
   proliferation during the 1990s were embodied in the 1999 National
   Intelligence Estimate (NIE), which predicted the emergence of a
   long-range ballistic missile threat by 2015. Comparing the NIEs
   predictions with the actual evolution of the threat reveals not only an
   overly pessimistic evaluation but also politicization of the
   intelligence assessment. At the time of its release, the report added to
   a growing sense of vulnerability and further encouraged policy-makers to
   make suboptimal missile defence acquisition decisions. In particular,
   the worst-case scenario thinking exemplified by the 1999 NIE contributed
   to an unnecessarily rushed testing programme, the premature deployment
   of homeland missile defence and an oversized system in Europe. Although
   missile defence may have strategic value, the rush to deploy has
   resulted in a costly and less effective military capability due to
   unfounded fears of strategic surprise and entrenched notions of the
   ballistic missile threat. Strategic uncertainty will always be a
   challenge, but focusing solely on developing capabilities with less
   regard to the actual threat environment is a recipe for costly and
   ineffective weapons systems.},

Abstract = {The Felipe CalderOn government was defined by the form and content of
   the 2006 electoral campaign. It involved a ferocious confrontation
   between left and right, with a very narrow margin, and the refusal by
   the winner to allow a recount, and by the loser to accept the result.
   Calderon set about reaffirming his position by militarizing the fight
   against organized crime, but the lack of coordination, prevailing
   institutional weakness and a striking increase in violence caused the
   project to fail. Poor economic performance and its social effects
   contributed to the defeat of Calderon's party in the intermediate
   elections and in 2012. The term in government ended with the return to
   power of the PRI and with questions concerning die nature of the
   political regime.},

Abstract = {A frequent argument in the literature on the US-led war on terror is
   that the war and its public discourse originated with the George W. Bush
   administration. This article seeks to explore the political discourse of
   terrorism and counterterrorism practices during the Clinton
   administration in order to challenge this perspective. By examining US
   administration discourses of terrorism, this article demonstrates deep
   continuities in counterterrorism approaches from Ronald Reagan to Bill
   Clinton, through to George W. Bush. The research suggests that, based on
   Reagan's initial `war on terrorism' discourse, Clinton articulated the
   notion of `catastrophic terrorism' or `new terrorism', which became a
   formative conception for the United States and its allies in the
   post-Cold War era. Clinton's counterterrorism discourse then provided an
   important rhetorical foundation for President Bush to respond to the
   2001 terrorist attacks. In other words, far from being a radical break,
   Bush's `war on terror' represents a continuation of established
   counter-terrorist understanding and practice.},

Abstract = {Linking International Law (IL) and International Relations (IR) is a
   significant challenge in itself. In addition, the way this linkage was
   constructed and the use of of IL simply as to written norms hamper its
   development. Building on insights from IL and using a definition that
   captures the dynamic aspect of legal phenomena open new analytical
   perspectives, including the one of interpretation of international
   norms. We adopt this interdisciplinary approach to understand the
   inconsistent application of democratic clauses. The analysis of the
   elements of the interpretation process -the norm, the factual situation,
   and the interpreter -allows for distinguishing both the intervening
   factors and the nature of the concerned legal obligations. Different
   normative engagements explain how those elements combine and provide the
   frame for application of democratic clauses.},

Abstract = {In the US, the failure of climate legislation and the implementation of
   EPA rules are the subject of intense scholarly and public debate.
   However, the debate has not investigated - and at times has further
   obfuscated - the preferences and expected tactics of industry
   stakeholders. Scholars of management and regulation argue that firms'
   profit motives can be aligned with socially beneficial outcomes, but
   they assume that firms prefer market-based regulation over the status
   quo. Correspondingly, corporate stakeholders have been portrayed as
   protagonists in campaigns for climate legislation. In a case study of
   the cap and trade fight during 2009 and 2010, I find that industry
   stakeholders primarily mobilized to maintain the status quo, but
   simultaneously joined the cap and trade coalition in order to favorably
   shape potentially inevitable climate legislation. The case underlines
   the importance of deeper investigation of business preferences and
   provides evidence for theories that prioritize power resources and the
   structural power of business.},

Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Existing studies of foreign aid suggest that donor countries' economic
   groups, such as exporters, should be generally opposed to multilateral
   aid because multilateral flows do not allow donor countries to tie their
   aid implicitly or explicitly to the promotion of their domestic economic
   interests. However, economic groups can actually benefit from some types
   of multilateral aid, and this serves as an incentive for donor
   governments to support international organizations generating the
   benefits. I test my argument using data on aid allocated to the
   Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol and
   the Global Environment Facility, and international trade by commodity. I
   find robust empirical support for the argument that when donors'
   domestic economic groups are likely to gain from opportunities created
   by international environmental organizations' programs, donor
   governments increase aid allocations to these organizations.},

Abstract = {Public management studies are increasingly using survey data on
   managers' perceptions of performance to measure organizational
   performance. These perceptual measures are tempting to apply because
   archival performance data or surveys of target group outcomes and
   satisfaction are often lacking, costly to provide, and are highly policy
   specific rendering generalization difficult. But are perceptual
   performance measures valid, and do they generate unbiased findings? We
   examine these questions in a comparative study of middle managers in
   schools in Texas and Denmark. The findings are remarkably similar.
   Managers systematically overestimate the performance of their
   organization, perceptual performance is only weakly associated with
   archival performance, and managers do not provide sophisticated
   assessment of performance by giving their organization credit for the
   constraints it meets or discounting the resources it has. Even worse,
   the use of perceptual performance measures seems to provide biased
   estimates when examining how management affects performance. This is due
   to both random measurement error and common source bias.},

Abstract = {In May 2012 national parliaments of the European Union (EU) issued their
   first yellow card under the Early Warning Mechanism of the Treaty of
   Lisbon. A sufficient number of them raised objections to a legislative
   proposal - the Monti II Regulation regarding the right to strike - that
   the Commission was required to review the proposal, which it
   subsequently withdrew. This outcome was, demonstrably, not a coincidence
   but the product of extensive interparliamentary co-ordination, enabled
   by the initiative of one determined parliament (Denmark's Folketing),
   the opportunity provided by a well-timed interparliamentary meeting, and
   the network of national parliament representatives in Brussels. A
   dynamic political process was set in motion in which a number of
   parliaments joined the effort to obtain a yellow card by, in effect,
   voting against' Monti II before the eight-week deadline. The episode
   shows that, despite claims to the contrary, national parliaments have
   the capacity and willingness to use their new powers to exercise a
   collective influence in EU affairs.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},

Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {International environmental negotiations such as the 10th Conference of
   Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP10) are
   state-dominated, and their outcomes are highly publicized. Less
   transparent is the role of non-state delegates who effect changes during
   negotiation processes through myriad strategies and relations. This
   article focuses on the influence of indigenous peoples and local
   community (IPLC) delegates in official COP10 negotiations using
   collaborative event ethnography to identify and evaluate moments of
   influence' that have gone largely unnoticed in the literature on global
   environmental politics. Findings indicate that IPLC delegates influenced
   negotiations by enrolling, shaming, and reinforcing state actors. Such
   relational maneuvers and interventions may appear inconsequential, but
   their implications are potentially far-reaching. Recognizing moments of
   influence improves understandings of non-state influence, relational
   power, and the multiple ways diverse actors reach across networks to
   overcome the power asymmetries that continue to characterize global
   environmental governance.},

Abstract = {Assuming that human rights advocacy still largely hales from the West,
   Jack Donnelly asserts that it would gain additional legitimacy by
   recognizing the differences between Western cultures and others.
   Advocating ``special caution and sensitivity,{''} he calls for
   ``relative universality.{''} Other scholars advocate similar views. At
   the same time Donnelly agrees with the new anthropological insight about
   the ``deeply contested{''} nature of cultures in the global South, as
   elsewhere, that in my view makes the recognition of the cultural
   differences across North-South axis almost impossible. How could Western
   advocates decide which of the fractions in a given contested culture
   should be nominated for culturally-sensitive considerations to arrive at
   ``relative universality?{''} A significant section of his theory
   explains how universalism can be relativized in ``interpretation{''} and
   ``implementation.{''} I contend that scholars, exploring the notion of
   ``tempered{''} universality, should focus on the violating nation-states
   and posit their theories on the corpus of the available documentations
   and analyses. Hypothetical examples without references to specific human
   rights reports cannot be practically useful for monitoring and advocacy.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},

Volume = {52},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {We study the association between natural resource rents and internal
   political stability, highlighting the importance of the distribution of
   political power as a mediating factor. We present a simple theoretical
   model demonstrating that increased rents are likely to be positively
   associated with the internal stability of a powerful incumbent while
   destabilizing a less powerful incumbent. Our empirical analysis confirms
   this prediction. Employing panel data for more than 120 countries from
   the period 1984-2009, our estimation results demonstrate that resource
   rents can promote political stability but only when political power is
   sufficiently concentrated. Indeed, if the incumbent is sufficiently
   weak, rents fuel instability. Our main results hold when we control for
   the effects of income, quality of institutions (rule of law, democratic
   accountability and corruption), persistence of political stability,
   time-varying common shocks, country fixed effects, possible endogeneity
   of rents and power balance to political stability, and various
   additional covariates. Our analysis departs from the existing literature
   by emphasizing not (only) the type of government, but rather the
   strength of government, as a key determinant of the impact of resource
   rents on political stability. This analysis sheds light on current
   political transformations and reconfigurations in the resource rich
   Middle East and North Africa.},

Abstract = {Violent domestic conflicts spread between countries via spillover
   effects and the desire to emulate events abroad. Herein, we extend this
   emulation logic to the potential for the contagion of nonviolent
   conflicts. The spread of predominantly nonviolent pro-democracy
   mobilizations across the globe in the mid-to-late 1980s, the wave of
   protests in former Soviet states during the Color revolutions in the
   2000s, and the eruption of nonviolent movements across the Middle East
   and North Africa during the Arab Spring in the early 2010s each suggest
   that the observation of collective action abroad encourages a desire to
   emulate among potential challengers to domestic autocrats. However, the
   need to emulate varies. Potential challengers with a recent history of
   protest at home are less dependent (than are those without similar
   experience) upon foreign exemplars to mobilize the participants and
   generate the resources required to make emulation practicable. By
   contrast, where the domestic experience of protest is absent, opposition
   movements are more reliant upon emulation of foreign exemplars. We test
   the implications of this logic using a series of multivariate logistic
   regression analyses. Our tests employ data on nonviolent civil
   resistance mobilizations that occurred across the global population of
   autocratic states between 1946 and 2006. These tests, along with
   post-estimation analysis, provide evidence consistent with our
   conditional logic of emulation.},

Abstract = {What factors drive governments' decisions to intervene in local
   conflicts within their borders? Communal conflict - that is, organized
   violence between non-state groups that are mobilized along a shared
   communal identity - kills thousands each year and severely impacts local
   livelihoods, at times threatening to spread and affect entire regions.
   Given the state's assumed monopoly over the legitimate use of force, we
   should expect the concerned governments to be critical actors of the
   overall effort to restore peace in cases of local communal conflict, but
   empirical evidence indicates that central states tend to only intervene
   in some cases but not in others. This phenomenon has so far been
   understudied and the variations in states' efforts to manage these
   conflicts remain unexplained. This article presents the first
   quantitative study of state intervention in communal conflicts. Building
   on existing scholarly work, I argue that state intervention is explained
   by a combination of strategic interests and state capacity, and that
   interests related to ethnic constituencies and land control play an
   important part in explaining governments' strategies. These propositions
   find support in a statistical analysis covering sub-Saharan Africa from
   1989 to 2010.},

Abstract = {The Western academic literature and media coverage of the increasing
   economic and political relations between the People's Republic of China
   (PRC or China) and the Latin American and Caribbean countries contains
   biases, fears, and misinformation about those relations. Closer
   examination reveals that Chinese trade, investment and loans have
   supported the left-leaning governments in the region that are attempting
   to develop alternative postcapitalist societies. China's leaders seek
   allies among the developing countries to join with them in creating a
   new multipolar and more equitable global order. The PRC has launched a
   new economic strategy that makes consumer demand the main engine of
   China's economic development. It seeks to boost productivity, reduce the
   country's growing income disparities, and pursue an environmentally
   sustainable path of economic development based on advanced high-value
   and clean manufacturing technologies and renewable sources of clean
   energy. The PRC's goal of developing a new ecological civilization will
   provide opportunities for the Latin American and Caribbean economies to
   export a more diversified basket of goods to China and attract Chinese
   investments and loans into new areas such as renewable energy. La
   literatura academica occidental y la cobertura mediatica de las
   crecientes relaciones economicas y politicas entre la Republica Popular
   China (RPC o China) y los paises de America Latina y el Caribe incluyen
   prejuicios, miedos, y desinformacion respecto a esas relaciones. Un
   examen mas detenido revela que el comercio, la inversion, y los
   prestamos chinos han apoyado los gobiernos de izquierda en la region que
   intentan establecer sociedades alternativas post-capitalistas. Los
   lideres chinos buscan aliados entre los paises en vias de desarrollo
   para aunar esfuerzos en la creacion de un nuevo orden global multipolar
   y mas equitativo. La RPC ha lanzado una nueva estrategia economica
   colocando la demanda consumidora como motor principal del desarrollo
   economico chino. Busca impulsar la productividad, reducir las crecientes
   disparidades de ingresos en el pais, y emprender un camino sostenible de
   desarrollo economico en base a tecnologias avanzadas de alto valor y de
   manufactura limpia junto con fuentes renovables de energia limpia. El
   objetivo de la RPC de promover una nueva civilizacion ecologica brindara
   oportunidades para la exportacion de parte de las economias
   latinoamericanas y caribenas de una canasta mas diversificada de bienes
   a la China y de atraer inversiones y prestamos chinos en nuevas areas
   como la energia renovable.},

Abstract = {Since independence, nationalism has been at the front of politics in the
   Republic of Moldova in the context of a persisting political struggle
   about the very definition of the Moldovan nation. Looking at campaign
   video clips produced in 2009 by Moldovan political parties and using a
   methodology inspired by Critical Discourse Analysis, the article gives a
   better understanding of nationalism in Moldova nowadays. The article
   demonstrates that the focus of political parties on the nation is purely
   symbolic. They adapt their discourse to the context in which they evolve
   (audience of the videos and targeted voters). Pursuing the objective of
   gaining or holding on to power, parties construct an ad hoc nation whose
   content they fill with the needs of the moment, using mirroring
   arguments to win the elections over competing parties seen as enemies of
   an endangered country.},

   international implications},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {52},
Number = {6},
Pages = {666-683},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article analyzes Chinese foreign direct investment. First, recent
   empirical trends are explicated, showing that Chinese firms `going
   global' has taken off, with significantly rising investment even in
   developed economies. Analyzing the specifics of Chinese outward foreign
   direct investment (OFDI) also shows that the motives of Chinese firms
   going abroad are mostly economic. Second, the role of policy support in
   Chinese OFDI is elucidated, showing that Chinese style
   internationalization differs from liberal role models. This is explained
   by the domestic structure of China's political economy. However, the
   prevalent image in the West that the internationalization of Chinese
   firms is mostly policy-driven is erroneous. Thus, third, the role of
   fragmentation and competition in China's `going global' strategy is
   elucidated. In the outlook, it is exemplified that the growing
   significance of Chinese firms results in a restructuring of global
   competitive relations, which some Western governments and firms regard
   with suspicion.},

Abstract = {The conceptualization of the European Union (EU) as market power Europe
   reflects an understanding that the EU most consequentially affects the
   international system by externalizing its internal market-related
   policies and regulatory measures. While considerable evidence exists to
   support such an exercise of power, further elaboration of the
   conceptualization reveals a number of ways in which it may contribute to
   the EU-as-a-power debates. This contribution undertakes a crucial
   stock-taking exercise for employing market power Europe as a dynamic
   conceptual framework for understanding and researching the EU as a
   power. The findings suggest that the conceptualization may improve
   analytical clarity and advance our empirical and theoretical
   understanding of the EU's external relations across various policy
   areas. These insights on the dynamic nature of the conceptualization as
   an analytical tool reveal important considerations for future scholarly
   work on the EU as a global regulator and beyond.},

Abstract = {This article sketches the struggles over and the shifting role of
   Catholicism in the Spanish body politic. It begins by providing a brief
   overview of the deep historical ties between Catholicism and Spanish
   identity. It continues by recounting the dialectical process through
   which a serious social cleavage on the role of religion in politics
   emerged and percolated over the course of the nineteenth and early
   twentieth centuries. This cleavage ultimately pit a militant and
   reactionary brand of authoritarian Catholicism on the right against an
   equally militant group of secularist ideologues associated with both
   bourgeois-republican and revolutionary working class (mainly anarchist)
   political forces. Following Juan Linz, the article emphasizes the
   nefarious role played by constitution-makers who pursued a partisan
   secularizing agenda on questions of Church and state in the breakdown of
   democracy and tragic onset of Civil War. It then delineates the ideology
   and institutionalization of `national-Catholicism' under Franco, before
   turning to contrast republican-era constitution-making dynamics with
   those of the transition to democracy following Franco's death. It
   concludes with a discussion of the content of post-transition conflicts
   over religion and politics, highlighting the constitutional resources
   for coping with the somehow new yet very old challenge posed by the
   presence of Islam.},

Abstract = {Casualty counts are often controversial, and thorough research can only
   go so far in resolving such debatesthere will almost always be missing
   data, and thus, a need to draw inferences about how comprehensively
   violence has been recorded. This article addresses that challenge by
   developing an estimation strategy based on the observation that violent
   events are generally distributed according to power laws, a pattern that
   structures expectations about what event data on armed conflict would
   look like if those data were complete. This technique is applied to
   estimate the number of Native American and US casualties in the American
   Indian Wars between 1776 and 1890, demonstrating how scholars can use
   power laws to estimate conflict size, even (and perhaps especially)
   where previous literature has been unable to do so.},

   formal priority of Brazilian foreign policy. It provides evidence to
   understand the goal of the Brazilian government, and sets out three
   criteria to assess the Brazilian priority of South American integration:
   cohesiveness of public policy, regional perception, and corporate

Abstract = {In this paper we argue that effective climate adaptation depends on the
   ability of actors on various levels to achieve a multilevel governance
   process in which their distinct activities result in a coherent
   adaptation strategy. The classic government's capacity to coordinate
   such complex processes has proved limited. Therefore we explore the
   notion of synchronisation - the ability of actors to connect governance
   processes that all have their own development, logic and self-organising
   dynamics. With a theoretical conceptualisation and a case study, we
   analyse whether and how the concept of synchronisation helps to
   understand the self-organising coordinative capacity within multilevel
   governance processes.},

   naming and labeling in terms of how it shapes terrorism discourse. Then,
   the author will discuss the importance of recognizing the implications
   of how the events of 11 September 2001 were framed by then president

Title = {The Compellence Dilemma: International Disputes with Violent Groups},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {59},
Number = {3},
Pages = {461-476},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article introduces the idea of a compellence dilemma. This dilemma
   arises when the domestic policies of adversariessuch as hosting violent
   groupsthreaten states' security. Such states often consider coercive
   instruments to compel their adversary to change those policies. The
   problem? The prospect of costly punishment makes cooperation more
   attractive for the adversary. However, if they fail to coerce policy
   change, harsh punishments can reduce the adversary's capacity to enact
   policy change and induce harmful domestic instability. These problems
   are compounded by the fact that both the threatened states' incentive to
   use costly punishments and the costs of failed compellence increase with
   the severity of the security threat. The logic of the compellence
   dilemma applies whenever a state uses damaging coercive instruments but
   risks failing to achieve its immediate objectives. I analyze the
   compellence dilemma with a dynamic game-theoretic model of interaction
   among a target state, host state, and violent group, and show that it is
   pervasive in equilibrium. I show that the compellence dilemma causes
   states to refrain from using harsh punishments even when they would
   compel the host state to cooperate. Concerns about decreasing future
   host-state capacity and increasing group power drive this result.},

Abstract = {What will be the future impact of the Asian Infrastructure Investment
   Bank (AIIB) and the New Development Bank (NDB), two multilateral banks
   created in 2014 outside the established Bretton Woods system, on
   multilateral lending shares? So far, the bulk of multilateral lending
   has been provided by institutions created and ruled by the west. Will
   the new institutions led by China and Brazil, Russia, India, China and
   South Africa (BRICS) help rebalance multilateral development finance
   away from western dominance? The answer comes in three steps: first, the
   pressure for the BRICS to `exit' rises with past, present and expected
   failure for `voice' reform in the established international financial
   institutions (IFIs). Second, excess demand for multilateral soft loans
   and, third, the potential lending capacity by the AIIB and the NDB are
   quantified to assess how much relative business - hence political
   influence - the existing IFIs might lose in favour of the new
   competitors. Based on current evidence for loan-equity leverage ratios
   in established multilateral development banks (MDBs), it is estimated
   that the NDB and AIIB combined will attract sufficient cofinancing to
   rival the established MDBs in terms of annual lending. The combined loan
   portfolios (c. US\$230 billion) of AIIB and NDB would equal the combined
   loan portfolios of ADB and International Bank for Reconstruction and
   Development (IBRD), according to a simple scenario presented in this
   survey article.},

Abstract = {This study introduces a theoretical model of how insurgency develops as
   a function of reactive mobilization. The theory extends a classic
   distance-decay model by incorporating Kalyvas' typology of violence. It
   implies that geographic conditions crucially determine the accuracy of
   applied violence and thereby its public perception, which in turn
   determines the actors' ability to mobilize. As a first test of these
   effects, I propose a new geographic indicator that expresses the spatial
   accessibility of a country's population for both central governments and
   peripheral insurgent movements. Two empirical implications of the theory
   are tested with a large-N data set on outcomes and casualties in
   insurgencies. The new indicator is significantly associated with both
   military outcomes and the number of casualties in insurgencies since
   1970 and strengthens statistical predictions.},

Abstract = {This article builds a framework drawn from historical institutionalism
   to analyse changes to the territorial composition of federal systems
   arising from the creation or admission of new sub-units. Despite the
   sustained interest among political scientists in the effects of federal
   design on ethnic conflict, economic development and prospects for
   democratic stability, there has been little sustained attempt to explain
   when and why territorial maps change over time. A historical
   institutionalist framework draws attention to the ways in which
   constellations of internal borders are underpinned by - and reproduce -
   patterns of power. The framework explains territorial change by studying
   the multiple layers that structure political life in federal settings
   and which through their interactions produce change. The article
   proceeds to explain territorial change in two countries with contrasting
   federal origins: India and the United States. In so doing, it questions
   the tendency within comparative politics to treat both countries as
   places of exception.},

Abstract = {This contribution conceptualizes the European Union (EU) as a system of
   differentiated integration characterized by both variation in levels of
   centralization (vertical differentiation) and variation in territorial
   extension (horizontal differentiation) across policy areas.
   Differentiation has been a concomitant of deepening and widening and has
   increased and consolidated as the EU's powers, policy scope and
   membership have grown. Turning to explanation, the contribution
   attributes the pattern of differentiated integration in the EU to the
   interaction of interdependence and politicization. Differentiation among
   the member states (internal differentiation) results from supranational
   integration under conditions of high interdependence and politicization.
   By contrast, external differentiation (the selective policy integration
   of non-member states) occurs in highly interdependent but weakly
   politicized policy areas. These constellations are illustrated in case
   studies of differentiation in the internal market, monetary union and
   defence.},

Abstract = {This article examines the influence of Europeanization on the
   relationship between ministries and agencies at the national level. The
   core argument is that the differentiated nature of the international
   environment (with policy development often transferred to the
   international level and policy implementation left at the national
   level) transforms national agencies into policy-developing actors that
   shape policies without being directly influenced by their national
   political principals. The increasingly common involvement of national
   agencies in European policymaking processes thereby increases these
   agencies' policy-development autonomy but does not change their role in
   policy implementation. We examine this argument by testing an innovative
   hypothesisthe differentiation hypothesison a combined data set of German
   and Dutch national agencies. Our empirical findings support the
   hypothesis in both countries, suggesting that similar effects can be
   expected in other contexts in which semiautonomous agencies are involved
   in transnational policymaking.},

Abstract = {This article explores how the `liberal democratic peace package' is
   received in post-conflict spaces. As such, it is part of a critical
   peace research agenda that raises critical questions concerning the
   quality of peace in many post-conflict societies. A close reading of the
   peace-building process in post-conflict Kosovo provides the backdrop for
   the theoretical discussion that identifies friction in norm diffusion
   processes and the different agencies that are generated through
   encounters between global norms and local practices. We unpack the
   interplay between the `global' and the `local' in peacebuilding and,
   through the lens of friction, we reveal the diverse and unequal
   encounters that produce new power relations. By foregrounding agency, we
   theorise different agentive subjects in the post-conflict setting, and
   map local agency from various segments of society that may localise,
   co-opt or reject global norms pertaining to the liberal democratic
   peace.},

Abstract = {Fiscal decentralisation aims to provide own financial resources or
   transfers from the central government for an efficient use of the
   original competences by local governments. This paper deals with the
   role of fiscal decentralisation and its impact on local public services.
   Rational indicators of revenue and expenditure fiscal decentralisation
   and selected local government expenditure are compared by public
   services, including the extent of decentralisation in selected EU
   countries. Modelling and comparison of selected EU countries is carried
   out through the method of multidimensional scaling according to the
   similarity of local government expenditure on services of social
   protection, healthcare, education, and recreation and culture (as \%
   GDP) in years 2006, 2009 and 2012.},

Abstract = {This article utilizes agency theory to explain maverick buying in
   governmental agencies, that is, noncompliance to centrally negotiated
   frame agreements. Traditional agency theory assumes the agent to be an
   opportunistic self-interest seeker. A complementary view of agency
   problems portrays man as an honest, yet not fully competent, actor; both
   agents and principals may be burdened by ``honest incompetence.{''} We
   apply both perspectives on principal-agent relationships to study
   maverick buying in government procurement and link agency problems to
   three governance mechanisms: monitoring, training, and guidance. We find
   that guidance and training help to reduce governmental employees'
   noncompliance, but output monitoring does not. Our findings further
   indicate that maverick buying is related to goal incongruence and two
   different types of information asymmetry: Agency problems may arise not
   only because the agent has information the principal is not aware of but
   also because the principal may have information the agent is not aware
   of. Future research in public management using agency theory to study
   instances of hidden action could benefit from applying a similar dual
   lens to behaviors previously examined as purely opportunistic.},

Abstract = {Within the bureaucratic performance literature, a growing body of work
   focuses on the relationship between the character of an administrator's
   selection-career administrators versus different types of appointees-and
   bureaucratic performance, finding that programs managed by political
   appointees are associated with lower performance scores than programs
   managed by career professionals. One aspect of administrators' selection
   that has not been considered in connection with bureaucratic performance
   is whether the appointee was installed via recess appointment. Because
   their limited and uncertain tenures may cause administrative problems
   and because the unilateral nature of their selection may lead executives
   to prioritize other characteristics over competency, I theorize that
   recess appointees will be associated with lower program performance than
   non-recess appointees and careerists. Using Program Assessment Rating
   Tool scores from the George W. Bush administration, I find support for
   this expectation. This article contributes to our understanding of the
   ways in which staffing through recess appointments may shape government
   administration.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on transnational intermediary organizations in
   higher education and research. We conceive of intermediaries as
   organizations that are actively involved in transnational university
   governance without having formal access to or control over policy or
   governmental funding. Such intermediary organizations have in previous
   research been shown to play central roles in the development and
   circulation of new themes and ideas for how to manage universities and
   measure university performance. Intermediaries link different types of
   actors and act as translators of global themes. In this respect, they
   are decisive in policy formulation.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, financialization has significantly restructured
   American capitalism. Social scientists have offered several accounts to
   explain financial markets' ascendance, but this work often portrays
   financialization as a totalizing force and is conducted within divergent
   theoretical paradigms-political economy and neo-institutionalism-with
   few attempts to bridge these differences. Accordingly, we risk talking
   past each other while failing to identify where financialization occurs.
   I address these issues with a unique panel data set, panel analysis and
   with a focus on identifying the meso-level determinants of
   financialization. I do so with a substantively important industry that
   exemplifies the global, flexible and competitive characteristics of
   neo-liberal capitalism. I argue that the propensity to financialize
   rests significantly upon firms' productive roles, meaning we cannot
   understand financialization without understanding production-global
   production networks in particular. This is also a call for researchers
   to explore financialization's multifaceted character and to develop a
   more analytically rigorous research agenda.},

   cooperation between those who implement development in public
   administration at state, local and regional levels is increasingly
   highlighted. Surprisingly, the role of cooperation in developing
   projects and the maturity of public administrations' project management
   organizations for accelerating the development of municipalities have
   not been researched until now. This study confirms that project
   cooperation between Slovenian municipalities promotes the
   municipalities' orientation for achieving development through projects,
   and their management awareness of the importance of fundamental
   managerial functions and other project management concepts and
   techniques for the successful achievement of development goals.},

Abstract = {International territorial conflicts are frequently characterized by
   political recourse to narratives of nationalist entitlement, stifling
   conflict resolution by raising domestic audience costs and discursively
   limiting bargaining flexibility. Conflict incentivizes elite employment
   of such claims precisely because security threats and fear of violence
   heighten popular resonance of adversarial collective identity frames.
   This article argues, however, that consensus mobilization behind
   nationalist territorial claims is highly dependent upon the particular
   narratives elites select to justify them. Employing controlled
   individual-level experiments administered to diverse populations in
   Israel, it demonstrates how exposure to competing narratives of
   homeland, security, economic prosperity, and settlement impacts support
   for control of East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, and the West Bank.
   Although indivisible claims to United Jerusalem', the Golan, and West
   Bank settlement blocs and strategic highlands are generally considered
   popular consensus issues in Israel, only particular narratives trigger
   consensus mobilization behind each. Some narratives even encourage
   conciliatory policy attitudes against such appeals. As a democracy
   embroiled in multiple enduring territorial disputes, analysis of the
   Israeli case contributes to understanding of the limits and political
   consequences of elite rhetoric. Demonstrating the affinity between
   narrative frames and popular policy preferences, this article also lends
   insight into the intersubjective beliefs that drive mass support for
   nationalist territorial claims.},

   IN UK ASYLUM POLICY},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {93},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {490-505},

Abstract = {Performance targets tend to be depicted as management tools, designed to
   improve public policy outcomes. Yet targets also have a symbolic
   function, signalling commitment to and underscoring achievement of
   political goals. This article explores the tension between these
   `disciplining' and `signalling' functions, looking at UK targets on
   asylum, 2000-10. Attempts to combine the two functions led to three
   types of problem: (1) technical targets designed to steer organizational
   performance lacked political resonance, prompting politicians to resort
   to top-down, political targets; (2) the imposition of unfeasible
   political targets created distortions in the organization, encouraging
   forms of gaming; and (3) the political risks of adopting stretch targets
   were not offset by the dividends of positive attention when targets were
   met: the government was unable to establish targets as the predominant
   mode of assessing its performance. The failed attempt to marry these
   functions suggests the need to decouple political and management targets
   in public administration.},

Abstract = {In this article, we shed critical light on the theory of securitization
   as developed by the ``Copenhagen School{''} in security studies by
   interrogating its tendency to avoid questions pertaining to reciprocal -
   violence, physical coercion and war. More specifically, we try to assess
   under what conditions a fruitful debate could be engaged between the
   ``Copenhagen School{''} and an international political sociology of
   violence and war. One of the main problems, we argue, is that research
   inspired by the Copenhagen theory of securitization has avoided
   empirical subjects displaying interactions between securitizing moves
   and strategies of coercion, both involving performative utterances, in
   the social construction of security problems. These interactions are
   however crucial from the point of view of the sociology of conflicts as
   well as for the historical sociology of the state.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to take stock of the critique of the liberal peace
   and identify what it has and has not achieved. It also asks where do we
   go from here?' The article surveys an agenda for future research and can
   also be read as a rebuttal of some recent literature that has attempted
   to shut down the liberal peace debate. The article opens with a quick
   recap of the bases of the critique of the liberal peace. It then
   outlines the achievements' of the debate and examines the failings and
   oversights of the original critique. Questions are raised about the
   epistemology and terms of the debate, and of the ability of critical
   intellectual projects to break through the material power held by
   mainstream intellectual and policy actors. In its final substantive
   section, the article asks where next for the critique of the liberal
   peace?' We conclude by highlighting avenues of research that might be
   fruitfully explored.},

Abstract = {Public service reforms increasingly blur the boundaries between public
   and private sectors, involving hybrid modes of service organization.
   With growing numbers of public services being transferred to private or
   mutual ownership, the article interprets reform as a public sector
   diaspora. Drawing upon the diaspora studies literature, the article
   proposes a model of hybridization that centres on the possibilities for
   cultural dislocation, adaptation, and hybridity. Focusing on reforms
   within the English National Health Service, the article presents an
   ethnographic study of the transfer or diaspora of doctors, nurses,
   clinical practitioners, and healthcare assistants from a public hospital
   to a private healthcare provider, exploring their experiences of
   migration, resettlement, and cultural hybridity. The model addresses a
   conceptual gap within the public policy and management literature by
   elaborating the antecedents, processes, and forms of cultural
   hybridization.},

Abstract = {While recent democratic theory has insisted upon the contestability of
   public policies as a key source of democratic legitimacy, the role mass
   media should play in fostering public contestation has yet to be
   specified. The role of deliberative theory in particular should be to
   try to identify which standards mass communication needs to meet in
   order to provide a general forum for democratic contestation. This
   article focuses on the theoretical foundations of such a project. It
   puts forward three claims. First, the contestability of public policy
   can only be a source of democratic legitimacy if citizens have the
   opportunity to participate in public contestation through - among other
   forums - a general public forum that is endowed with a deliberative
   dimension. Second, media pluralism alone is insufficient in providing
   such a public forum: both external standards (related to the
   independence of mass media) and internal standards (related to the norms
   guiding media practices) need to be satisfied. Third, and as a
   consequence of the preceding two, the democratic contestability of
   public policies presupposes effective mass media regulation that goes
   beyond the promotion of media pluralism. Democratic contestation
   requires more than a `marketplace of ideas'.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},

Abstract = {Links between national news outlets (Globe and Mail and National Post)
   and climate-change discourse are examined in order better to understand
   the cultural politics of Canadian involvement in climate governance.
   National news media use a narrow range of issue categories to interpret
   climate change to the public. Both news outlets also privilege national
   and international political spheres, with less attention to climate
   governance at the sub-national level. However, there are important
   differences between them. The Globe and Mail tends to focus on
   government responsibility, while the National Post tends to focus on
   climate science and the economic costs of addressing climate change.
   Four key periods (1999, 2002, 2006, and 2010) are examined in order to
   trace shifts in climate-change discourse. There has been a shift towards
   greater issue complexity over time, coupled with a growing polarisation
   of climate discourse across the two national news outlets.},

Abstract = {Research Highlights and Abstract This article Gives clearer
   conceptualisation of what an idea is. Provides clearer conceptualisation
   of how ideas may change over time. Uses central arguments from
   relational sociology and conceptual analysis in discursive
   institutionalism. Provides new theoretical perspectives on ideational
   change in wake of the recent financial- and economic crisis.
   How can we conceptualise the emergence of new political ideas?
   Demonstrating that the discursive institutionalist literature is silent
   on this question, the article links this theoretical lacuna to the
   problem of ideational infinite regress, i.e. that if we try to identify
   the absolute origin of an idea, we find that the relations to other
   ideational elements develop ad infinitum and the end or beginning of the
   idea never appears. Ideas do not emerge from an absolute origin but
   instead are created when a set of ideational elements are yoked together
   by political actors. Three ways that ideational change occurs is
   suggested: a change in the relations in the idea (recasting the idea),
   the replacement of at least one of the existing ideational elements with
   ideational elements hitherto not part of the idea (renewing the idea)
   and finally a wholesale change of ideational elements in the idea
   (revolutionising the idea).},

Abstract = {A common criticism of international human rights declarations is that
   they lack an adequate account of the corresponding obligations. This
   criticism is often thought to be particularly apt when applied to
   economic and social rights. International human rights law imposes these
   obligations on states, but critics object that this treats the problem
   (state behavior) as the solution. This article examines the question of
   the obligations corresponding to economic and social rights in the
   context of debates about world poverty. It argues that the legal and
   philosophical emphasis on obligations must be supplemented by an
   understanding of both institutions and motivations if practical progress
   to eradicate world poverty is to be made.},

Abstract = {The analyses of smart and soft power have developed little beyond what
   their critics would refer to as `soft theory', and in both cases the
   theoretical development is less than `smart'. This article attempts to
   address these deficiencies in the theoretical development of smart power
   by: (1) articulating a more rigorous and systematic understanding of the
   processes of smart power; (2) explaining how changes in world politics
   have raised the value of smart power relative to hard power; (3)
   analyzing smart power in the context of recent US foreign policy, and
   (4) proposing several prescriptions that will encourage decision-makers
   to value and effectively use smart power strategies in their foreign
   policies.},

Abstract = {The concept of traditional values' occupies the place of honor in public
   discourse in Russia today being one of the components of the new
   ideological narrative. The article is focused on the strategy of the
   promotion of traditional values by its secular and religious
   protagonists. It includes three thematic sections: (1) the analysis of
   the interpretation of the historical past and its place in the concept
   of traditional values; (2) the investigation of the role of the West' as
   enemy' in constructing national identity and defending traditional
   values; and (3) the examination of the opposition of universality and
   particularism with regard to traditional values. The author concludes
   that the concept of traditional values as a response to social and
   political challenges is promoted by secular powers and religious
   authorities for the ideological consolidation of Russian society, as
   well as for the recruiting potential allies on the international arena.
   At the same time, the noticeable presence of traditional values in
   public discourse indicates the thirst for reliable meanings in the
   process of the search for national identity.},

Abstract = {The importance granted to information transparency in improving the
   accountability of public administrations has become increasingly greater
   in recent years under a scenario of economic and financial crisis as a
   tool of control. Although academic studies are aimed at identifying the
   key factors underlying a higher level of economic-fmancial information
   disclosure by local governments, there exists considerable heterogeneity
   in the results obtained. In this sense, we have carried out a
   meta-analysis to validate previous empirical results, and highlight
   causes of the variations and contradictions identified. Our study shows
   the variables analysed to be positively associated with the disclosure
   of public financial information, but also that this depends on the
   context in which the research is carried out.},

Abstract = {Financialization requires a regulatory framework that allows markets to
   emerge and expand. What explains growing political acquiescence to
   relevant market-enabling rules? The present article identifies feedback
   processes whereby such rules lock in over time. First, as markets
   expand, market proponents grow more numerous and develop increasing
   stakes. Second, potential challengers find it increasingly difficult to
   mobilize protest, because routinization reduces salience and because
   market exposure renders protesters more vulnerable. Third, potential
   challengers lose incentives to protest, because market exposure
   eliminates some non-market structures that inspire defensive action, and
   because `constrain-thy-neighbor' dynamics encourage the further spread
   of market-enabling rules as a means of self-defense. The case of
   market-enabling takeover regulation in Britain since the 1950s
   illustrates how these processes gradually changed the preferences and
   resources of bankers, institutional investors, corporate managers and
   employees and thereby help explain why parliamentary interest in
   market-restraining counter-measures grew weaker over time.},

Abstract = {This article is based on a transcript of a speech by Anthony Giddens
   that was presented as the twentieth Policy \& Politics Annual Lecture on
   17 March 2015 at the University of Bristol, UK. Hence it is not as
   polished as an orthodox article might be. The speech is available online
   at www.bris.ac.uk/sps/policypolitcs/annuallecture2015/. It drew in some
   part upon the successive editions of his book, The politics of climate
   change (2009; 2011). Giddens looks at the political issues posed by
   climate change and stresses the fundamental importance and urgency of
   the problem for global civilization. Four key propositions are
   presented. First, that climate change needs to be seen as an immediate
   issue requiring urgent attention, not as a remote problem down the tine.
   Second, rather than formal targets to limit carbon emissions reached
   under the auspices of the UN, bilateral and regional accords are likely
   to be much more important. Third, the power of fossil fuel companies
   needs to be challenged on a global level. Finally, digitally enhanced
   global activism can have a powerful impact on the climate change debate
   and the pressure for change.},

Abstract = {How does the content of public allegations impact regulatory
   communication strategies? Employing a multinomial logistic regression
   analysis and an original data set, this article analyzes the Israeli
   banking regulator's nuanced responses to public expressions of opinion
   between 1996 and 2012. We demonstrate this agency's greater propensity
   to acknowledge problems, yet mostly shift blame to others when faced
   with claims that regulation is overly lenient, and to deny allegations
   that regulation is excessive. These findings, although based on one
   institution, are important because they demonstrate an agency's
   differential response to external allegations, given their content and
   its assessment of the relative threat to its reputation. They also
   suggest that external audiences may be able to shape agency attention
   and response by carefully framing their claims in light of their
   understandings of agencies' distinct reputational vulnerabilities.},

Abstract = {A pillar of American foreign policy in the Middle East since September
   11, 2001, has been promoting democracy, with particular emphasis on
   support for women's representation. Given high levels of
   anti-Americanism in the region, does foreign pressure for policy reform
   undermine this project? Evidence from a nationally representative survey
   experiment in Jordan shows that an American endorsement of women in
   politics has no average effect on popular support for women's
   representation. Instead, domestic patterns of support and opposition to
   autocrats determine citizens' receptivity to policy endorsements, with
   policy endorsements of foreign-supported reforms polarizing public
   opinion. Both foreign and domestic endorsements of women in politics
   depress support among Jordanians who oppose their regime significantly
   more than among Jordanians who support it.},

Abstract = {A growing literature on `agencification', `quangocratization', and the
   `autonomization' of the state has highlighted a coordination dilemma in
   contemporary public governance whereby governments rely on delegated
   governance but are frustrated by the lack of control that arises from
   such structures. In the run-up to the 2010 General Election in the
   United Kingdom this coordination dilemma was prominent as the capacity
   of the Cabinet Office to exert control over arm's-length bodies, either
   directly or indirectly, received intense criticism. This article
   presents the findings of the first detailed research project to examine
   the subsequent Coalition Government's approach to this dilemma. It
   argues that in relation to the governance of public bodies, the role and
   capacity of the Cabinet Office has been transformed. In mapping this
   development the article explores the implications of the centre striking
   back in the context of `post-New Public Management' reforms.},

Abstract = {A widely held belief within policy and practice contends that rough
   terrain and other physical obstacles to power projection hinder public
   surveillance, lower counterinsurgency capability, and generally
   constitute an important facilitator of rebellion. Likewise,
   sociocultural exclusion and alienation from the core are widely assumed
   to increase latent conflict risk through their influence on identity
   formation and perception of collective grievances. However, there is no
   scientific consensus on the empirical strength or significance of such a
   relationship, and many quantitative studies fail to find a robust link
   between a country's geographical or ethno-demographic characteristics
   and its estimated conflict risk. This paper represents a first
   comprehensive evaluation of how physical and sociocultural
   inaccessibility relate to contemporary civil wars. Drawing on recent
   advances in geographic information systems and georeferenced indicators
   of terrain, settlement patterns, ethno-political status, and armed
   conflict, we put the purported causal relationship to empirical test. A
   statistical analysis of civil-conflict events across post-Cold War
   Africa gives considerable support to the proposed theoretical framework,
   revealing that the various dimensions of inaccessibility all exert
   significant and substantive effects on local conflict risk. We find
   weaker evidence for the notion of substitutability; the inaccessibility
   indicators largely retain their individual effects when included in the
   same regression model.},

Abstract = {The efficiency-oriented part of the literature on informal governance
   points to institutional costs as a reason for governments to prefer to
   cooperate with each other through commitments that are not binding. Left
   unexplained is what I call the dilemma of informal governance: how
   informal governance copes with the problem of cheating, to which formal
   governance has traditionally provided the solution. I show that
   like-mindedness, the current solution to the dilemma, is convincing but
   underspecified. Working from a model of governance encompassing the
   three time-honored dimensions of obligation, precision, and delegation,
   I analytically explore two other solutions, one that fails, information
   transmission, another that works, outside option, which I borrow from
   the power-oriented part of the literature on informal governance. A key
   finding is that informal governance, despite being neither
   self-enforceable nor informative, is sustainable for mild Prisoner's
   Dilemma (PD) types in the presence of outside options. I illustrate the
   model findings by tracing an historical correlation between power
   polarization and formalism in the design of security regimes.},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen researchers making initial steps towards drawing
   on insights from emotion research in the study of intractable intergroup
   conflicts, but the knowledge on emotion and emotion regulation cannot
   simply be implanted as is into the study of these unique contexts. The
   present article begins with a discussion of the unique context of
   intractable conflicts and continues with an examination of the existing
   knowledge on emotion and emotion regulation in these conflicts. From
   there it proceeds to detail the contextual factors unique to intractable
   conflict that must be taken into account when studying these constructs,
   focusing on three such factors: long-term emotional sentiments,
   entrenched conflict-supporting ideology, and clinical factors related to
   the repeated exposure to violence associated with life in conflict. For
   each factor, the article examines existing theories and empirical
   knowledge on its influence over the type and magnitude of emotion
   experienced, the behavioral and political outcome of emotional
   experiences, and on emotion regulation processes. When existing theory
   and knowledge are limited, we present theory and propose directions for
   future research. Finally, the article discusses the challenges facing
   those wishing to integrate conflict studies and emotion research and
   benefit fully, theoretically, empirically, and on the applied level from
   such an interdisciplinary integration.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the results of a small-N survey of established
   academic staff within the discipline of politics and international
   relations and how they view research-teaching links. It reveals that
   even among this small group there are very different views as to the
   relationship between teaching and research. The article argues that more
   work is needed to produce a fuller understanding of the nexus across the
   discipline and that research needs to be integrated at all levels of
   undergraduate study. Fundamentally, we need to make the link explicit to
   both students and other stakeholders to ensure that the nexus remains
   viable in the future.},

Abstract = {Voegelin often cites Bergson's Two Sources of Morality and Religion. For
   both thinkers, the openness of society to mankind cannot be achieved
   without a spiritual mediation. But this apparent agreement hides
   substantial differences, due to the fact that, in the 1930s, Voegelin
   had already developed from other sources his own open-closed' conceptual
   pair. One of the major differences is that, for Voegelin, the primitive
   society, far from being a closed' society, is a very opened society'.
   The shift does not operate at the level of the fundamental experience of
   the soul, but at the level of the articulation of symbols. The open
   society' designates a perennial anthropological structure: thus, the
   closed society' does not precede it, but rather designates a corruption
   of it, which is a characteristic feature of modern societies. This
   difference has another consequence concerning the status of democracy,
   allowing Voegelin to overcome the hidden aristocratic ground of the
   Bergsonian distinction between the minority of spiritual heroes and the
   majority of dormant mystics. Yet, the concept of open society' functions
   for the two thinkers as a critical instrument of evaluation of our
   contemporary industrial age, both refusing, albeit with different tones,
   pessimistic fatalism as well as optimistic progressivism.},

Abstract = {The paper deals with the historical development of local self-government
   in the context of the development of the public administration as a
   whole during the First Czechoslovak Republic. It presents historical
   roots of the public administration in the former imperial
   Austria-Hungary, which was different from other European countries with
   its complex bureaucratic structures. Certain elements of the complex
   political and administrative developments during the early 20th century
   can be seen even one hundred years later. It is becoming apparent that
   history repeats itself in a number of issues and that it is unforgivable
   not to learn lessons both from the mistakes and the successful solutions
   of the past.},

Pages = {479-487},
Abstract = {Self-determination is widely understood as an anti-imperial norm
   responsible in significant part for the global break-up of empires. But
   self-determination norms have been utilized as well to justify Great
   Power territorial expansion. This essay examines the ways in which
   self-determination norms have been wielded by the Soviet Union and
   Russia to justify overriding sovereignty norms, challenge the
   territorial integrity of weaker states, and rationalize an expansion of
   power and influence-despite opposition by a majority of inhabitants of
   the affected areas, the conflicting self-determination claims of
   indigenous populations, massive Russian settler colonization, and the
   opinions of the international community.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {135-153},
Abstract = {This article summarizes the findings from the special issue. The EU, the
   US, and to some extent Turkey are the only actors considered in this
   special issue who not only explicitly try to promote human rights and
   democracy, but also employ specific instruments and resources for this
   purpose. But all external actors prioritized stability and security over
   democracy as the events unfolded. Despite all the discussions about EU
   actorness, we did not find any difference between the EU, on the one
   hand, and the four states we looked at in this special issue (the US,
   Russia, Turkey, and Israel), on the other. In fact, the US arguably
   pursued the most incoherent and inconsistent foreign policy toward the
   MENA region in response to the Arabellions. Among the three explanations
   considered in the introduction to this special issue, realism scores
   worst. `Objective' geostrategic interests cannot account for the
   variation in policy responses by the external actors. The authors in
   this special issue point to domestic politics in the various countries
   and inside the regional organization (the EU) considered here.
   Self-understandings and collective identities provide a complementary
   explanation for why external actors have acted against their economic
   and security goals. As to the effects of the external actors' policies
   in the target countries, the main drivers of events during the
   Arabellions have been domestic so that external actors could only assume
   subsidiary roles. Tunisia might be the only case in which external
   democracy promotion-in this case by the EU-played an auxiliary role.},

Volume = {3},

Pages = {261-278},
Abstract = {This article proceeds from the claim that memory and emotion are
   indivisible from practice, experience and history. It argues that an
   enhanced understanding of the impact of war and the subsequent logics of
   peacebuilding require narrative techniques and strategies that re-focus
   our attention on lived experiences. These experiences, however, should
   not be understood as a supplement to academic forms of knowledge, but
   must instead register as legitimate knowledge in their own right. This
   does not mean that they enjoy any fuller veracity than academic
   accounts. Instead, it shows how access to a plurality of knowledge
   provides valuable insights into the limitations of scholarship on
   conflict and its aftermath.},
