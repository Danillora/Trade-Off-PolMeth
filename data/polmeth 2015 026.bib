Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {37},
Number = {7, SI},
Pages = {833-846},
Abstract = {The governance of EMU was premised on the idea that market discipline,
   informed by fiscal surveillance, supports the building of a hard
   currency union. Theory would lead us to expect that the
   international-commercial and the supranational-technocratic assessments
   of sovereign debt are fairly aligned. But they were not. We show that
   credit rating agencies and Eurostat have rather different assessments of
   what certain policies mean for sovereign debt. These assessments reveal
   divergent institutional logics of market actors and regulators. Private
   agencies are prone to conformism and herding behavior, allowing for
   little consistent discipline, while the public agency follows a
   bureaucratic imperative of accountability and transparency, which gets
   in the way of evolving policy priorities. Our findings thus shed light
   on the difficulties of fiscal governance by regulation only but they
   also suggest that reforms at the EMU level do not provide quick fixes.},

Title = {Defense Industries in Asia and the Technonationalist Impulse},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {36},
Number = {3},
Pages = {453-472},
Abstract = {Asia is a region of growing militarization and insecurity. It is
   increasingly characterized by rising defense expenditures and rapidly
   modernizing militaries, and subsequently it is increasingly becoming a
   zone of potential conflict. These security concerns are exacerbated by
   Asian countries' expanding capacities for indigenous armaments
   production. Asian arms production is heavily influenced by concepts of
   techno-nationalism, which views autarky (self-sufficiency in armaments)
   as serving not only national defense needs, but also as maximizing
   national political, strategic, and economic autonomy. The
   technonationalist model is more than a set of goals; it also embodies a
   strategy for achieving autarky in armaments production, including the
   short-term exploitation of foreign-sourced technologies. What is the
   most interesting about Asian arms industries is how enduring they have
   been despite the fact that they produce few economic benefits and
   contribute so little to guaranteeing security of supply or expanding
   military-technological capacities for national defense. Asian armaments
   production has rarely been cost-effective or militarily significant in
   terms of turning out state-of-the-art military equipment. And yet, most
   large powers in Asia have not abandoned the idea of autarky in armaments
   production, often with explicit technonationalist industrial strategies.
   Despite problems with this technological-industrial approach, it is
   unlikely that these countries will abandon techno-nationalism anytime
   soon.},

Abstract = {This paper brings a comprehensive analysis of the peacebuilding process
   conducted by the UN in Timor-Leste. Drawing on fieldwork, interviews,
   and secondary sources, the paper brings light to the main fragilities of
   this process. Firstly, the paper briefly outlines the scholarly debate
   around UN peacebuilding process. Then, the paper brings an overview of
   the UN missions deployed to Timor-Leste. Finally, the paper identifies
   the major limitations of such engagement. By highlighting the main flaws
   of this peacebuilding process, the paper opens the space for (re)
   thinking alternative ways of building peace in post-conflict scenarios.},

Title = {Third party conflict management of transboundary river disputes},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {402-426},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to fill the gaps by conducting the first large
   n study examining the role of third parties in the emergence of river
   agreements in Asia and Africa during the time period 1948-2007. There is
   a growing literature on what explains agreements in river disputes.
   However, beyond individual case analysis, little systematic study has
   been done on the role of third parties in settling river disputes
   through agreement, in particular on the regions that are mostly affected
   by the global climate change.
   Design/methodology/approach - Through utilising new data on the role of
   third parties in river disputes, this study shows that third party
   involvement in the conflict management of river disputes increases the
   likelihood of reaching river agreements.
   Findings - The findings suggest that third parties use both diplomatic
   and economic means to increase the likelihood of emergence of river
   agreements, and both strategies are equally important to induce
   formalised cooperation.
   Research limitations/implications - Yet the present study covers only
   two regions, and it does not delve into a discussion of the conditions
   under which third party interventions are successful. Rather, these are
   aspects that need to be explored in the future.
   Practical implications - Given the current uncertainty around security
   challenges resulting from climate change, and with predictions of future
   water wars, this research contributes to the understanding how to
   peacefully manage current and potential conflicts around transboundary
   waters.
   Originality/value - This study is the first large n study examining the
   role of third parties in the emergence of river agreements in Asia and
   Africa.},

Series = {Routledge Advances in European Politics},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {110},

Abstract = {Lacking a European multilateral framework, Italy has constantly sought
   to build stable relations with Libya through bilateral agreements and
   contacts. For security and migration issues, economic and energetic
   interests, Libya is a key strategic partner for Italian policy-makers.
   However, in spite of Italian diplomatic efforts and the different
   upgraded bilateral accords since the early 1990s, a number of incidents
   testify to that Rome's much vaunted stability in its Libya relations
   continues to be quite elusive. The chapter employs a neoliberal
   institutional perspective and concepts such as free-riding, asymmetry
   and game of chicken to analyse the Italian-Libyan relations and to show
   how incentives to reassess, defer and delay agreements, and engage in
   verbal stand-offs exist for Libyan authorities. As a result, there is an
   underlying pattern of unpredictability about relations between the two
   countries which has characterised the Qaddafi rule and to some extent
   appears to rear its head even in the Arab Spring and post-Qaddafi
   scenario.},

Abstract = {Bahrain, the smallest Arab country, is perhaps the most vocal Gulf state
   opposing Iran. The governing monarchy, which is Sunni, is actually a
   minority in its own country, which is majority Shiite. This has led to
   intense mistrust of Iran on the part of the Bahraini authorities, who
   prefer to maintain strong bonds with the other GCC states as a means of
   bolstering its security. They fear Iranian meddling in their internal
   affairs, which have been marked with violence and oppression since
   outbreaks of unrest during the Arab Spring. In order to further bolster
   the states security, the government consents to hosting the USs Fifth
   Fleet and continuously strives to draw closer to Saudi Arabia.},

Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {311-327},
Abstract = {The uncertainty of democratic transition poses a threat to the survival
   of ethnically plural societies, culminating in the first open elections.
   The design of the electoral system for the founding elections is
   therefore of crucial importance. This paper focuses on the democratic
   transition of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its founding elections in 1990.
   A variety of electoral systems, both proportional and majoritarian, were
   employed during these elections. With different incentives they
   attempted to reconcile inclusion and group representation, while
   fostering interethnic politics. Utilizing newly available election data
   and a within-case comparison, the paper analyses incentives and outcome
   of different electoral systems under least-likely conditions of success.
   As no single electoral system was able to overcome the predominance of
   particularistic ethnic politics during these elections, the paper
   concludes that under high levels of transitional uncertainty and low
   levels of ethnic inter-group relations, the choice of electoral system
   alone is often not enough to make a decisive difference in electoral
   outcome.},

Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},

Volume = {27},
Number = {5},
Pages = {926-969},
Abstract = {This article focuses on the apocalyptic zeitgeist of the Islamic State
   through the lens of what we call the New Tribalism. It finds that IS
   emerged from the Al Qaeda (AQ) milieu, but soon split with AQ as the
   messianic excitement surrounding Al-Baghdadi and his teachings grew. In
   common with previous millennial/messianic movements in all three Peoples
   of the BookJudaism, Christianity, and IslamIS soon evolved beyond the
   laws of the normative faith (antinomianism). We hold that for this
   reason, despite its claims of faith and fealty, IS has left the Islamic
   Umah behind, becoming a malign sectarian group of its own whose dynamism
   and successes are attracting a global audience and support from Muslims
   in almost every country. This helps to explain such abhorrent practices
   as forced conversion, sexual servitude, the destruction of historic
   artifacts, and mass executions. We find that the American invasion of
   Iraq was the vital first step in a series of events, which gave birth to
   IS. A thorough review of IS history and political culture traces these
   historic moments in time.},

Abstract = {Yemen is one of the poorest and least-developed countries in the world.
   Though its formation can be linked to the rise of pan-Arabism and
   associated Yemeni calls for national self-determination in the 19705 and
   1980s, the country today is deeply fragmented. Culturally, politically
   and economically, there is a huge divide between tribal and non-tribal
   Yemeni communities, between Northerners and Southerners and between
   urban and rural areas. These differences have fragmented Yemeni society
   along competing allegiances, in which nationalism takes a back seat to
   tribal identity or political affiliation. In order to reconcile these
   differences under a single, unified state, Yemen has, as of 2014,
   adopted a new federal governance model. However, this new model has been
   insufficiently adapted to local and national socio-political dynamics
   and interactions. As such, it is unlikely to bring about lasting and
   sustainable peace.},

Pages = {299-318},
Abstract = {The article focuses on the entanglement between the EU's attempts to
   construct its external actions in global politics and research on the EU
   as a global actor. The article argues that both the development of EU
   external actions and the sociology of knowledge production surrounding
   the analysis of these actions suffer from unnecessary dichotomisation.
   Advocates and analysts of the EU's normative power have argued that the
   separation of norms and interests, both in terms of policy-making and
   policy analysis, is impossible. In contrast, advocates and analysts of
   the EU as a `normal power', a great power pole in the coming multipolar
   world, have dichotomised the advocacy of policy-making and the analysis
   of knowledge production of EU external actions. The article sets out,
   through an examination of the interlinking of policy-making and policy
   analysis, how such false dichotomies weaken the sociology of knowledge
   about the EU and the production of the EU's external actions. The
   article uses an analytical means of illustrating the deep
   interdependencies between the sociology of knowledge and production of
   the EU's external actions. This application illustrates how ideas about
   external actions are spread from the study of normative power to other
   normative frameworks, and from analysts to policy-makers in the field of
   EU external actions. The article concludes that strategic
   dichotomisation and social diffusion are integral to the social sciences
   and the production of European integration in making Europe `normal'.},

Abstract = {Direct mobilization of indigenous peoples, involving protests, blockades
   and occupations, plays a prominent role in Canadian political life, but
   has to date been subject to limited explanatory social science. This
   article examines two high-profile flashpoint events, both involving
   sustained physical occupations of disputed territory by indigenous
   peoples, in light of the theoretical debate between instrumental and
   normative explanations for ethnonational group mobilization. The
   behaviour of indigenous protesters does not suggest a material or
   political cost-benefit calculus-as instrumentalism predicts-but rather
   an ongoing, dynamic evaluation of the legitimacy and righteousness of
   contentious action. This `calculus of right' reflects the Weberian
   notion of value rationality-political action that is selected for its
   intrinsic rather than instrumental value to participants. The concept of
   `calculus of right' is proposed for future scrutiny in studies of
   nationalist mobilization.},

Abstract = {Analogical reasoning has held a perpetual appeal to policymakers who
   have often drafted in historical metaphor as a mode of informing
   decision making. However, this article contends that since the beginning
   of the War on Terror', we have arguably seen the rise of a more potent
   form of analogy, namely ones that are selected because they fulfil an
   ideological function. Analogical reasoning as a tool of rational
   decision making has increasingly become replaced by analogical reasoning
   as a tool of trenchant ideologically informed policy justification. This
   article addresses three key areas that map out the importance of
   analogical reasoning to an understanding of developments in contemporary
   international politics: the relationship between history and politics,
   in intellectual and policy terms; a critical assessment of the appeal
   that analogical reasoning holds for policymakers; and the development of
   a rationale for a more effective use of history in international public
   policy making.},

Abstract = {Even before the Arab uprisings of 2011, European policy towards the
   southern Mediterranean was painfully fragmented. Underpinning these
   tensions is an ongoing `securitisation' of the Mediterranean debate
   which centres on threats emanating from the South, including Islamic
   fundamentalism, terrorism and immigration - or on challenges such as
   energy. On the other hand, the stated European goal in the region has
   long sought the advancement of EU norms and values - to be attained
   primarily through governance reforms aimed at improving the rule of law.
   This article will exemplify these discourses by focusing on the case of
   Italy's Mediterranean policy. The contradictions contained in the
   competing European and Italian discourses came to a head during the Arab
   uprisings of 2011. The paper concludes by laying out two possible
   scenarios for the future development of Euro-Mediterranean discourse:
   one based in the normative logic termed `making democracy work'; the
   other rooted in security logic and termed `good enough governance'.},

Abstract = {Europe now faces a new impossible macroeconomic trinity: it is no longer
   possible to combine monetary union, German political requirements and
   coherent economic analysis. Economic analysis shows that there must be
   more inflation in Germany, a significant fiscal expansion in Germany, a
   significant easing of austerity in the GIIPS countries and a write-down
   of much of the debt of southern European sovereigns. These changes will
   be resisted by Germany. But they are necessary if the monetary union is
   to survive.},

Abstract = {When coding events from media sources - as the majority of data projects
   do - different reports may oftentimes contain contradictory information.
   What do coders make of this? It is up to them to aggregate different
   reports into one coded event, and to supplement missing information
   based on other sources or their own background information. If not
   addressed properly, this may lead to a lack of replicability and to low
   reliability of the final data product. In this short article, we present
   an approach for separating (i) event reports and the information
   contained in them, and (ii) events, which are based on aggregate
   information from the reports and constitute the final data product. Our
   procedure preserves uncertainty arising from multiple reports and gives
   the user control over how missing and conflicting information should be
   dealt with. We illustrate our procedure with data from a current coding
   project, the Mass Mobilization in Autocracies Database (MMAD).},

Abstract = {The 2015 Charlie Hebdo attacks warrant a detailed profile of the French
   approach to countering Jihadi terrorism. Much has been written about the
   tough French counterterrorism regime, which originated in 1986 and
   remains unique among Western democracies. There has been less analysis
   of France's lengthy list of post-9/11 reforms, and even less discussion
   of the French approach to counterradicalization. In fact, France was
   among only few European countries that did not engage in any soft
   counterradicalization programs after the 2004 Madrid and the 2005 London
   bombings. The mass exodus of foreign fighters to Syria led to a first
   national counterradicalization plan in 2014. In response to the Paris
   attacks, much in line with its security-oriented methods and outlook,
   the French government increased counterterrorism spending and
   surveillance powers. Various other measures are noteworthy, however, as
   they focus on prison radicalization and represent an effort to
   strengthen the counterradicalization campaign.},

Abstract = {During the past two decades, scholars have critically examined the
   political role of space and territory and advanced our understanding of
   borders with dynamic concepts based on identities and narratives. The
   literature, though, is divided between works that emphasize domestic
   politics and those that concentrate on international norms. We seek to
   bridge this gap by developing a general theoretical framework to
   understand domestic recognition, or lack thereof, of new borders that
   result from war losses. We use the case of West Germany post-World War
   IIwhich went from non-recognition of its new eastern border along the
   Oder-Neisse line to full recognitionto develop a theoretical model
   explaining changing border policies. We conceptualize the interaction
   between foreign policy priorities, domestic constituency considerations,
   and international norms and find that when domestic border narratives
   and primary foreign policy goals of the political coalition in power
   both point to the same policy direction (acceptance or non-acceptance of
   the border) then such a policy is likely to be adopted by the
   leadership. If, on the other hand, foreign policy goals and dominant
   domestic border narratives differ, we are likely to see a continuation
   of the border policy. In those periods of silence, however, change still
   takes place through a stronger influence and gradual internalization of
   international norms. Over time, then, we may observe a change in the
   dominant narrative, which could be followed by a policy change.},

Abstract = {On average, higher per capita income comes with lower corruption levels.
   Yet, countries like Mexico, Libya and Saudi Arabia are relatively
   wealthy but experience comparatively high corruption levels.
   Simultaneously, countries like Madagascar or Mozambique (in the 1990s)
   combine poor economic development with a low level of corruption. I
   propose that the two most common variables in corruption research -
   wealth and democracy - are mutually conditional: economic development
   brings about a larger (and stronger) middle class that demands public
   goods from the government. However, citizens' ability to influence
   governmental decision-making varies by political regime type. In
   democracies, citizens are, on average, more successful in demanding
   goods from the government than in autocracies. Using a large-N approach
   (up to 139 countries, 1984-2006), the analysis finds robust empirical
   support for the proposed conditional effect.},

Abstract = {Penal populism, advocating severe punishment of criminals, has greatly
   influenced justice policy measures in Eastern Europe over the last
   decade. This article takes Hungary as a typical case in the region and
   based on a recent criminal policy reform it investigates the roots of
   the penal populist discourse, which legitimizes and supports punitive
   measures. The research assumes that policy discourses need specific
   social actors that construct and promote them. Accordingly, the article
   explores whether the right-wing political parties and the tabloid media
   have taken a leading role in constructing the discourse of penal
   populism as a response to public concerns about crime. Content analysis
   and frame analysis of political communication and media was conducted to
   identify the discursive positions of major political parties and
   selected national media sources. The research found that penal populism
   was dominant in Hungarian political discourse while most of the media,
   including the tabloid press, have been rather reluctant to adopt
   punitive tones. The results thus contradict previous findings and offer
   a more nuanced view on how penal populism is being constructed and
   promoted in Eastern Europe.},

Abstract = {Sino-Brazilian trade reached record levels in 2010. At the core of this
   phenomenon was the return to a primary production structure reinforced
   by the difficulty of diversifying exports of Brazilian manufactures of
   higher value added and technological content. Brazilian imports have
   revolved around the acquisition of manufactures similar to the ones
   produced in Brazil and with a sophisticated technological profile. The
   results of this trade tie are related to differences in the development
   agendas of the two countries, especially their industrial policies. Em
   2010, o volume do comercio sino-brasileiro ultrapassou niveis
   anteriormente re-gistrados. O cerne desse fenomeno foi um retorno a
   estrutura de producAo calcada no setor primario. Ademais, esse retorno
   foi reforcado pela dificuldade em diversificar as exportacAoes dos
   manufaturados brasileiros de alto valor agregado e conteudo tecnologico.
   As importacoes brasileiras estAo centradas na aquisicAo de manufaturas
   similares as produzidas no Brasil e que apresentam um perfil tecnologico
   sofisticado. Os resultados desses lacos comerciais correspondem as
   diferencas nas agendas de desenvolvimento dos dois paises, especialmente
   suas respectivas politicas industriais.},

Abstract = {This article examines the foundations and evolution of China's capital
   controls. It is argued that the continuation of stringent controls in
   the reality of worldwide liberalisation is the result of the hegemony of
   a historic bloc, comprising foreign industrial capital, Chinese
   state-owned industrial and banking capital, and a fraction of the state
   class that wants to keep control over China's economy. However, despite
   the still extensive controls, significant capital account liberalisation
   has been carried out. The origins can be found in the strategy of a
   fraction of the state class which wants to transform China's
   accumulation regime in order to form a challenge to US power. Support
   for this strategy is provided by Chinese technocrats, Chinese wealthy
   individuals and foreign financial capital. At the moment, it seems that
   these pro-liberalisation social forces are gaining the upper hand. This
   could ultimately lead to China's full integration into the Western
   heartland.},

Abstract = {Held in an environment of growing social polarisation, fears of emergent
   authoritarianism, and economic challenges, Turkey's June 2015 election
   ended the Adalet ve Kalknma Partisi's (AKP's) parliamentary majority,
   challenging its single-party rule for the first time in 13years. This
   article first provides information on the background to the election,
   focusing on debates about the authoritarian tendencies of AKP, economic
   conditions, and the competition for the Kurdish vote. Then, a brief
   overview of the campaign period is presented, followed by an analysis of
   election results at the sub-national level. The article concludes with
   some preliminary discussion of the causes of the loss of AKP's majority.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to determine the substance of
   equalization systems and the causes and effects of their use in local
   finances, as well as the analysis of the differences of existing
   equalization mechanisms in selected countries. However, the specific
   objective is the identification of the key drawbacks and dysfunctions of
   the equalization system in Poland and to propose specific
   recommendations in the context of introducing necessary reforms. The
   authors of the paper present the view that firstly, actions should be
   undertaken to strengthen the financial autonomy of Polish local
   government entities, and only later, as a result, build a new
   equalization system adapted to the level of revenue and expenditure
   independence and different expenditure needs of local government in
   Poland.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to attempt to identify the reasons for the
   lack of relationship between general grant revenue and investment
   expenditure of local government units. The author formulated the
   hypothesis that there is no link between general grants and investment
   expenditure and that the reason for this are the current spending on
   education, absorbing the entire amount of general grants received by
   local government units. The hypothesis was verified in a procedure
   consisting of several steps. The theoretical part contains a description
   of the revenue system of local government units in Poland with
   particular emphasis on transfers, including general grants. Although the
   local government in Poland is a three-tier system (communes, counties,
   provinces), the investigation presented in the analytical part was
   carried out for four groups of units, also identifying cities with
   county rights. On the basis of the results of statistical analysis and a
   comparison of revenues from the education component of the general
   grants and the overall amount of general grants with expenditure on
   education, the most likely explanation is the size of expenditure on
   education, which often exceeds the total revenue from the general
   grants.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the new Family of Ethnic Power Relations (EPR)
   data sets, version 2014, which is the latest in a series of data sets on
   ethnicity that have stimulated civil war research in the past decade.
   The EPR Family provides data on ethnic groups' access to state power,
   their settlement patterns, links to rebel organizations, transborder
   ethnic kin relations, and intraethnic cleavages. The new 2014 version
   does not only extend the data set's temporal coverage from 2009 to 2013,
   but it also offers several new features, such as a new measure of
   regional autonomy that is independent of national-level executive power
   and a new data set component coding intraethnic identities and
   cleavages. Moreover, for the first time, detailed documentation of the
   EPR data is provided through the EPR Atlas. This article presents these
   novelties in detail and compares the EPR Family 2014 to the most
   relevant alternative data sets on ethnicity.},

Abstract = {The Council of Ministers is an important part of EU decision-making.
   However, contrary to what is formally expected member, states are not
   always represented by ministers at Council meetings. Unfortunately, our
   knowledge of who is actually participating is limited. First, the
   article investigates the extent to which ministers actually participate
   in Council meetings. We conclude that a substantial number of the
   participants are not ministers. Second, based on an institutional
   approach, the article tests six hypotheses as to when ministers
   participate. Here, we find the salience of meetings, the importance of
   the policy area, the length of EU membership and a high share of
   EU-positive parties enhance the likelihood of ministerial participation.
   Finally, we test whether the existence of junior ministers affects the
   likelihood of politicians participating. Here, our findings are
   inconclusive. The article builds on a database including all
   participants in Council meetings between 2005 and 2009.},

Abstract = {The ideas originating in Antonio Gramsci's politico-theoretical work, in
   a multifaceted itinerary departing from a purely ethical matrix, have
   developed in Latin America into a sophisticated theoretical formulation
   focused on the theory of hegemony. The emergence of this formulation
   marks the beginning of a complex process of reformulation of the classic
   paradigms of the left, producing a drastic change in thinking about the
   logic of social transformation in Latin America. With this shift the
   issues of strategic design and the transformational process began to
   undergo thorough debate. The theoretical tasks presented by the current
   development of Gramscian thought toward the construction of a
   comprehensive theory of hegemony include the classical political and
   cultural dimension and the productive dimension of hegemonic actions.
   Las ideas oriundas en la elaboracion teorico-politica de Antonio
   Gramsci, en un itinerario multifacetico a partir de una matriz puramente
   etica, desenvuelven su contenido hasta ser expuestas en la forma de una
   formulacion teorica sofisticada centrada en la teoria de la hegemonia.
   La emergencia de este momento marca el inicio de un complejo proceso de
   reelaboracion de los paradigmas clasicos de la izquierda, constituyendo
   un cambio severo en el modo de pensar la logica de la transformacion
   social en America Latina. En este viraje las cuestiones del diseno
   estrategico y del sujeto del proceso transformador seran puestos en
   discusion radical. Las tareas teoricas planteadas por el desarrollo
   actual del pensamiento gramsciano hacia la construccion de una teoria
   integral incluyen las clasicas dimensiones politica y cultural y la
   dimension productiva de acciones hegemonicas.},

Abstract = {Modern economies and militaries are fundamentally dependent on oil, but
   the study of energy security has fallen out of favor in the field of
   international relations. We develop and test a theory of when and how
   states invest in energy security. We argue that states implement
   policies to improve their energy security when they perceive a risk of a
   militarized dispute and international oil markets are dominated by a
   small number of Middle Eastern producers. Empirically, we show that
   industrialized countries with reasons to worry about their security have
   significantly increased their public investment in energy research and
   development in response to an increase in the Middle East's share of the
   world oil supply.},

Abstract = {Recent research on contentious politics in the Middle East emphasizes
   the importance of repression and its effect on social movements, often
   manifested in demobilization and so-called nonmovements'. This case
   study of West Bank Palestinian activism seeks to go beyond such
   outcomes. The current, youthful nonviolent Palestinian grassroots
   activism in the West Bank is persistent, despite repeated violent
   repression. Focusing on the interplay between context, practices, and
   networks, this article shows how an increasingly vocal and visible
   popular resistance movement has asserted itself despite facing double
   repression - from the occupying Israeli state and the Palestinian
   National Authority. In a highly repressive context characterized by
   widespread demobilization, especially among young people, the impetus
   for mobilization is not perceived opportunity, but rather existential
   threats. The analysis focuses on how long-term repression from the
   external occupier and the internal elite contributes to forming specific
   kinds of contentious practices and networks among young Palestinian
   grassroots activists. By deploying new and creative contentious tactics
   they partly succeed in challenging the Israeli occupation without
   risking sanctions from the internal Palestinian elite. They are also
   able to criticize this elite implicitly, bringing popular pressure to
   bear on it. However, while the strategic use of nonviolence has provided
   these activist environments with a degree of resilience in the face of
   repression, they are unable to mobilize on a wide scale as long as the
   Palestinian political elite does not support them.},

Title = {On the Conditional Success of International Conditionality Policies
   (With Evidence from Greece and Spain During the Eurozone Crisis)},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {212-221},

Abstract = {Does conditionality always work? If, as it appears, the answer is
   negative, why do certain externally incentivized countries comply while
   others do not? To answer these questions we rely on cognitive psychology
   and dynamic Bayesian principal-agent games to develop a theory of
   downwards-sloping long-run supply curves. More specifically, we explain
   how, when applied to an intrinsically motivated agent, external
   incentives imposed by an informed principal carry an informative signal
   which in the long run crowds out the agent's intrinsic motivation. To
   probe the plausibility of the ensuing hypotheses we compare the
   reformist pace of two centre-left governments of financially distressed
   Southern European countries during the eurozone crisis, namely Greece's
   Papandreou administration and Spain's Rodriguez Zapatero administration.
   Based on the analysis of more than 400 newspaper reports and 12 expert
   interviews we find positive support for our theory: while Papandreou
   quickly admitted the need for far-reaching and politically costly
   reforms, Zapatero initially delayed all kinds of measures. But as
   European incentives kicked in, the strongly incentivized Papandreou went
   into irreversible reform fatigue, while the softly incentivized Zapatero
   dedicated his last months in office to bring about unprecedented
   reforms. We conclude with some indications about future research in this
   direction.},

Title = {Ideas beyond paradigms: relative commensurability and the case of
   Canadian trade-industrial policy, 1975-95},

Abstract = {In light of recent interest in the theoretical foundations of policy
   paradigms, this paper aims to specify the qualities that differentiate
   paradigmatic from non-paradigmatic policy ideas. While the
   incommensurability thesis that underlies the concept of paradigms has
   been the target of much criticism, there is something intuitively
   appealing about the incommensurability of policy alternatives that is
   not yet fully understood. Hesitant to abandon completely the notion of
   incommensurability, this paper emphasizes the relative nature of
   ideational commensurability and provides an account of how the
   exclusivity of a paradigm may wither in relation to competing
   perspectives. The empirical section demonstrates this pattern of
   paradigmatic policy-making by examining solutions advanced to alleviate
   problems in Canadian trade-industrial policy between 1975 and 1995.
   Contrary to the popular perception that paradigmatic ideas yield policy
   stability, the findings suggest that even in areas where clearly
   articulated paradigms initially exist, strictly paradigmatic thinking is
   often fleeting.},

Abstract = {The paper analyzes the variety of discourses on social inequalities in
   postcommunist Bulgaria. The focus is on academic discourse, but
   political and everyday interpretations are presented as well.
   Politicians generally avoid talking about social differences and prefer
   instead the dichotomy of elite versus the people, whose interests the
   politicians vow to protect. In popular consciousness, the main division
   is between the rich (mafia, politicians, ex-nomenklatura) and the honest
   poor. In sociology, three main research trajectories have emerged: from
   class-based to status-based stratification; from one-dimensional to
   multidimensional stratification; and from a Marxist class model to a
   social network model. Perhaps the most important characteristic of
   Bulgarian society is its high level of poverty, according both to income
   indicators and self-perception. In this context of a pervasive sense of
   poverty, status differences lose their significance. This in turn
   prevents the establishment of group or class solidarity, as everyone
   feels she or he is competing with all others. Starting in 2013, a new
   trend can be observed: of social protests organized by those who say
   they feel powerless and manipulated by corrupt elites. As they try to
   initiate new types of economic negotiations with the government,
   sociologists have a responsibility both to study this new movement and
   to push the problems it raises into public debate.},

Abstract = {By altering the turnout decision calculus, compulsory voting should
   alter the character of the voting population. Employing survey data
   across countries and Swiss cantons, I examine how the turnout decision
   calculus varies across voluntary and compulsory voting systems. Results
   indicate that many of the demographic, socio-economic and political
   factors known to correlate with turnout play a relatively weak role in
   motivating electoral participation where voting is mandatory. Thus,
   voting populations should be more reflective of the entire electorate in
   countries with compulsory voting. I conclude with a discussion of the
   potential implications of my findings.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the antecedents and outcomes of the expatriate
   labor force that comprises about 60\% of the Gulf Cooperation Council
   (GCC) workforce. It shows that the GCC governments' policies have been
   manipulated to create unsustainable (unskilled) labor-intensive
   economies marginalizing the citizens. The discussion concludes that the
   GCC workforce localization programs should aim not for full native
   employment through complementarity or substitutability of jobs, but
   rather to correct the unsustainable demographic imbalance, to reclaim
   the economy, culture, entitlement, tradition, and values through
   complementary economic programming, and to rationalize the work and
   regionalize the workforce. The article ends with some strategic actions
   for the labor-exporting countries in Asia, such as the export of
   value-added human capital instead of raw human resources. These actions
   are likely to serve the twin purposes of increasing the bargaining power
   of the labor-exporting countries and protecting the migrant workers'
   rights in order to stabilize the international labor market for both
   parties. Using a political economy approach, the article uses
   information and data from the World Bank, other recent studies, direct
   observation, and discussions in the region.},

Abstract = {Politics in Kenya remains vulnerable to ethnic tensions despite its
   openness and vibrancy, but it can also be argued that Kenyan politics is
   becoming increasingly mature. This article explains the political
   economy dynamics behind the first two orderly presidential successions
   in post-colonial Kenya. It proposes a conceptual framework that shows
   how instrumental ethnicity plays out in a quasi-differentiated society
   in which ethnic organizations are the key conduits for the flow of rents
   between political and economic elites. More specifically, it shows how
   the internal fragmentation of ethnic groups intensifies the structural
   uncertainties that are commonly associated with intra-elite pacts in
   weakly institutionalized polities. It is argued that the 1978 and 2002
   presidential successions in Kenya were orderly, paradoxically, because
   some of the crucial political and ethnic organizations were fragmented
   to the extent that they created conditions of great uncertainty for the
   elite. In this context, the rule of law was upheld as a last-ditch
   strategy to mitigate uncertainties in the face of rampant fragmentation.
   This shows that ultimately elite fragmentation can generate political
   stability provided that there is enough at stake for the elites.},

Abstract = {Organizational rules are the backdrop of public employee life, with
   research suggesting both beneficial and harmful effects to employee
   morale. In contrast to the traditional approach of comparing employee
   morale in workplaces with higher versus lower levels of rules, this
   study examines the relationship between specific attributes of
   organizational rules and job satisfaction. A combination of three
   organizational rule attributes is expected to increase job satisfaction:
   consistent rule application (which conveys procedural fairness), optimal
   rule control (which suggests elements of self-determination), and rule
   formalization (pertaining to the written quality of organizational
   rules). Applying structural equation modeling to survey data collected
   from the employees of two local government organizations (n = 1,655), we
   observe a significant and positive relationship between consistent rule
   application, optimal control, and job satisfaction, but no direct
   relationship between rule formalization and job satisfaction. These
   results suggest that job satisfaction depends more on how rules are
   designed and implemented rather than the extent of rules in
   organizational structure. Future studies will need to account for
   specific attributes of organizational rules to fully understand the
   effects on public employee morale.},

Title = {Taxing Fracking: The Politics of State Severance Taxes in the Shale Era},

Abstract = {States producing gas and oil have long levied severance taxes at the
   point of extraction, commonly placing most revenues into general funds.
   These taxes have assumed new meaning in many states amid the expansion
   of gas and oil production accompanying the advent of hydraulic
   fracturing. We reviewed all major statutes and constitutional amendments
   related to severance taxes that were enacted at the state level during
   the first decade of the shale era (2005-14). There have been only modest
   adjustments in statutory tax rates and some evidence that states have
   attempted to reduce these rates, possibly in response to growing
   national production. In turn, there is also evidence that states have
   begun to pursue more targeted strategies for revenue use, including some
   expanded focus on responding to the negative externalities linked to
   drilling, expanded revenue sharing with localities, and increased
   long-term protection of resources through state trust funds.},

Abstract = {The US faces a crisis of governance that lies in the deep, long-term
   polarization of its party system. While exacerbated by the recent
   financial crisis and recession, polarizing trends can be detected as
   early as in the late 1970s. Over the course of four decades, a
   combination of ideological division and intense electoral competition
   has eroded the bipartisan glue that our fragmented policymaking
   institutions require to function. As a result, the US has generally been
   unable to address pressing long-term policy problems within the normal'
   constitutional framework, if at all. First, the branch of government
   closest and most representative of the people, the Congress, has
   declined precipitously in terms of power and public standing. Second,
   our extremely divisive politics and unmet policy challenges have eroded
   citizens' faith in the American government. Finally, polarization has
   created and reinforced widening economic disparities that have generated
   substantial political inequalities.},

Abstract = {New media outlets have been deemed a vital instrument for protesters and
   opposition groups to coordinate activities in the recent civilian
   uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa. But what happens when
   regimes respond by shutting down the internet? I argue that governments
   have a strategic incentive to implement internet blackouts in
   conjunction with larger repressive operations against violent opposition
   forces. Short-term intermissions in communication channels are expected
   to decrease opposition groups' capabilities to successfully coordinate
   and implement attacks against the state, allowing regime forces to
   strengthen their position. Network blackouts should consequently be
   accompanied by significant increases in military activity. Analyzing
   daily documented killings by the government in the Syrian civil war, I
   find that blackouts occur in conjunction with significantly higher
   levels of state repression, most notably in areas where government
   forces are actively fighting violent opposition groups. In addition, I
   estimate the number of undocumented conflict fatalities prior to and
   during network blackouts to test whether they are implemented to hide
   atrocities from outside observers, and find no support for this
   hypothesis. The results indicate that such network blackouts constitute
   a part of the military's strategy to target and weaken opposition
   groups, where the underreporting of violence is not systematically
   linked to outages.},

   women through the lens of intersectional discrimination. It begins by
   examining the international human right to be free from discrimination
   before considering involuntary sterilization as a form of discrimination
   against women. The article then draws on the example of the involuntary
   sterilization of HIV-positive women to make the point that, in order to
   understand the insidious nature of involuntary sterilization, it must be
   viewed through the prism of intersectional discrimination.},

Abstract = {This article critically assesses the work of the UN Special
   Representative for Business and Human Rights (SRSG) John Ruggie. The
   article adopts a normative perspective on the issue. Thus, its critique
   is derived from the standpoint of ethics. The SRSG was instrumental in
   shifting the burden of proof to those who deny corporate human rights
   responsibilities. This achievement, however, is relativized by the very
   restrictive interpretation of such responsibilities, both in terms of
   their scope as well as the normative force assigned to them. Finally,
   the article explores and analyzes the SRSG's relative reluctance to
   address and engage with ethical categories more explicitly. It outlines
   the dangers and blind spots that may result from this reluctance and
   reflects on the role that ethics can, and perhaps should, play in the
   broader debate on business and human rights.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of the Provisional Irish Republican
   Army's (PIRA) brigade level behavior during the Northern Ireland
   Conflict (1970-1998) and identifies the organizational factors that
   impact a brigade's lethality as measured via terrorist attacks. Key
   independent variables include levels of technical expertise, cadre age,
   counter-terrorism policies experienced, brigade size, and IED components
   and delivery methods. We find that technical expertise within a brigade
   allows for careful IED usage, which significantly minimizes civilian
   casualties (a specific strategic goal of PIRA) while increasing the
   ability to kill more high value targets with IEDs. Lethal
   counter-terrorism events also significantly affect a brigade's
   likelihood of killing both civilians and high-value targets but in
   different ways. Killing PIRA members significantly decreases IED
   fatalities but also significantly decreases the possibility of zero
   civilian IED-related deaths in a given year. Killing innocent Catholics
   in a Brigade's county significantly increases total and civilian IED
   fatalities. Together the results suggest the necessity to analyze
   dynamic situational variables that impact terrorist group behavior at
   the sub-unit level.},

Abstract = {How can we explain differences in nonstandard employment across
   countries? This article provides an overview of the multifaceted
   relationships between national-level institutions and the three dominant
   forms of nonstandard employment, that is, temporary, part-time and solo
   self-employment. The article highlights the great heterogeneity that
   exists among the different forms of nonstandard work, both within and
   between countries. Neither welfare regime approaches nor dualization and
   precarization theories sufficiently capture the ongoing diversification
   of employment relationships across countries. However, the
   institution-specific analyses reviewed here are also not without
   challenges: high-quality macro-and microlevel data are scarce;
   institutions interact in complex ways with their environment and exert
   distinct effects on different groups of workers; moreover, the
   demographic composition of the work-force and the role of cultural
   characteristics make it difficult for researchers to correctly specify
   such macro-to-micro links in their empirical work. In addition to
   outlining several avenues for future research, the article informs
   ongoing debates on the relevance of nonstandard work for the study of
   social inequality and research in comparative political analysis.},

Abstract = {Theories of deliberative democracy are popular for their promise that in
   a deliberative polity, democracy can realise both participatory politics
   and rational policies. However, they are also confronted with the
   allegation that by qualifying essentially non-democratic practices as
   deliberative, they inadvertently (or not) become accomplices in the
   trend towards post-democratic governance. A central example of such a
   development is the rise of non-majoritarian bodies to which governments
   delegate decision making, thereby de-politicising conflicts and turning
   democratic discourses into technocratic ones. This article adopts a
   systemic perspective on deliberative democracy, asking whether
   non-majoritarian forums can be legitimated in a democratic system and
   whether they can contribute to their deliberative quality. It is argued
   that the legitimation of delegated decision-making is not possible
   without a culture and practice of democratic meta-deliberation which
   enables reflective institutional design.},

Abstract = {The idea of redrawing the borders between the republics of the region
   remains a topic of discussion beyond its borders. While the Kremlin de
   facto makes the subject of territorial changes in the North Caucasus
   taboo, the processes related to the rise of ethnic self-consciousness in
   ethnic republics hardly stopped. The Syrian crisis, which gave Russia a
   much-celebrated diplomatic victory, threatens its territorial integrity
   because Moscow's mishandling of the Circassian issue is radicalizing the
   Circassian communities of the North Caucasus. Drawing on the dynamics of
   ethnic mobilization among Circassians, the paper argues that this
   process may result in the most dangerous consequences of the Kremlin's
   policies based on the ancient imperial principle of ``divide and
   rule{''} - redrawing the administrative map of the entire region. The
   paper concludes that even though Moscow pretends that the situation is
   under control, a shift which consequences are hard to predict is already
   happening. One of them is that the demand for an increased congruency
   between Russia's ethnic and administrative borders becomes politically
   salient; and a protrusion in the battle line becomes more prominent with
   each passing day. (c) 2015 The Regents of the University of California.

Abstract = {This paper is the first study dedicated to the extensive examination of
   the dynamics of key sectors in CEE transition economies based on an
   application of the WIOD - an extensive database recently launched under
   the patronage of European Commission, Research Directorate General. We
   propose a modified approach to key sector analysis which extends
   applicability of the traditional methodology to the case of examining
   groups of countries over a period of time. More formally, the research
   was based on the maximum entropy decomposition of the Leontief inverse
   applied to the input output tables covering the period 1995-2011. The
   results allow formulating the list of sectors, which, more or less, have
   preserved the status of the key sectors in CEE transition economies. In
   turn some sectors, especially the manufacturing ones, have significantly
   derailed while the sector of construction as well as the financial
   sphere and travel and tourism related sectors, have clearly gained in
   importance. (c) 2015 The Regents of the University of California.

Abstract = {There is a strong ongoing debate about the impact of higher education
   experiences on political attitudes and behaviours. While some authors
   assume a direct socialisation effect of educational experience, others
   have argued that education should be seen as a mere proxy variable for
   socio-economic status and pre-adult socialisation experiences. In this
   article we use a 5-year Belgian panel study that tracked respondents
   between the ages of 16 and 21. Using a hierarchical linear model of
   repeated measurements, we are able to demonstrate that differences with
   regard to political trust between future students and non-students are
   already present and stable at the age of sixteen. Significant
   determinants were school track and educational goal. The inclusion of
   actual educational status in the model (at age 21), however, rendered
   the relation with educational goal not significant. The results suggest
   that during secondary education students already anticipate and acquire
   a value pattern that is congruent with their future status. Ultimately,
   however, this effect is dependent on whether they actually enrol in
   higher education or not.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship in just war theory has challenged the principle of
   symmetrical application of International Humanitarian Law (IHL). This
   revisionist work, which is increasingly dominating the field of
   contemporary war ethics, rejects the idea that the rules of conduct of
   war (jus in bello) should be agnostic about the justice of the decision
   to go to war (jus ad bellum). Just wars are perceived to be inherently
   at odds with the principle of symmetrical application of IHL, which
   appears to create a hard choice between justice and legality. I show
   that this challenge to IHL is misplaced. It derives from a widespread
   view among just war theorists according to which only one side in a just
   war can be justified in using force. By looking closely at the nature of
   adjudication of just causes of war, I show that there can be cases of
   war in which both sides are justified in using force, and cases in
   which, though not objectively justified, both sides may be excused for
   fighting. On the basis of this understanding of jus ad bellum, I argue
   that the principle of symmetrical application of IHL in fact best
   reflects the uncertainty and complexity that should characterize the
   practical doctrine of jus ad bellum.},

Abstract = {Ideas are increasingly acknowledged as factors in explaining political
   behaviour. But often they are treated as inert resources rather than
   dynamic instances of action in themselves. The latter, I propose,
   requires reflection on the character of speech - as the medium of ideas
   - in responding to and refiguring a prevailing situation. I undertake
   such reflection by setting out a rhetorical approach to political
   strategy. Building upon interpretive' advances in political science I
   shift the focus from stable cognitive frames to the dynamics of
   argumentation where ideas work expressively. I then explore the
   rhetorical aspect of strategising with attention to the way speech
   serves to orient audiences by creatively re-appropriating a situation.
   That approach is shown to be consistent with a dialectical' political
   sociology that emphasises the interaction of structure and agency.
   Finally, I sketch a method for undertaking rhetorical analysis and
   indicate how it might be applied to a concrete example.},

   the mining sector is obviously not the only tool to ensure the economic

   stands out more and more as a strategic asset for the area's countries.
   Because of the extra attractiveness and the wealth they bring about, the
   mining resources to be found underground in the area are dealt with as a
   central element in the national development policies and in the
   geostrategic thinking developed by Southeast Asian states.},

Title = {Anticipating mediated talks: Predicting the timing of mediation with
   disaggregated conflict dynamics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {52},
Number = {2},
Pages = {243-257},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Research on mediation has shown that mediation can be an effective
   conflict management tool to contain intrastate conflicts, prevent
   escalation of low intensity conflicts, and foster de-escalation. But can
   ripe moments for conflict prevention effectively be anticipated? This
   article argues that the short-term conflict history provides a good
   predictor of the probability of mediation onset in low-intensity
   conflicts. It builds on an expected utility theory of mediation and
   states that conflict intensity is a primary indicator of whether a
   window of opportunity for mediation exists. Thereby, the article asserts
   that the direction of the effect is conditional on the respective
   probability of victory of each conflict party. The theory postulates
   that high conflict intensity only increases the probability of mediation
   onset when neither side is likely to prevail militarily. If one of the
   conflict parties has a high chance of a military success, then it will
   not regard conflict intensity as costly, since it can expect to impose
   these costs on its opponent. Under these circumstances the conflict
   parties will not be willing to engage in mediation. The article presents
   empirical support for this proposition. It uses temporally disaggregated
   data of low-intensity African conflicts from 1993 to 2004 and
   demonstrates that the theoretically motivated model predicts mediation
   onset with high accuracy. The results show that conflict dynamics are
   highly relevant covariates in predicting mediation. This selection
   process should be considered when the impact of mediation is evaluated.},

Abstract = {This contribution analyses the relevance of neofunctionalist theory and
   the various spillover mechanisms for explaining the management of the
   crisis and the drive towards a more complete Economic and Monetary Union
   (EMU). The management of the crisis resulted in integrative outcomes
   owing to significant functional dissonances that arose from the
   incomplete EMU architecture created at Maastricht. These functional
   rationales were reinforced by integrative pressures exercised by
   supranational institutions, transnational organized interests and
   markets. The contribution concludes that, despite shortcomings,
   neofunctionalism provides important insights for understanding the
   integrative steps taken during the crisis.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to analyze the establishment of
   anti-corruption agencies (ACA) as an organizational strategy to address
   the problem of systemic corruption. With this objective, we present a
   longitudinal analysis of the case of Argentina, which allows us to
   discern lessons and recommendations to confront this problem. Systemic
   corruption is a public problem that occurs when different sectors of
   society and the government have built networks of organized corruption.
   Corruption, in this logic, is a ``systemic{''} phenomenon because
   different social actors establish as one of its objectives to create and
   preserve the conditions of profitability, enabling to keep the
   ``machinery{''} of corruption running in a balanced and consistent form.
   This document states that the creation of an ACA requires to be thought
   of as a long-term strategy, to facing step by step and with
   ``answers{''} ad hoc to the specific relational conditions of every
   society. Particularly, because the corruption networks usually use their
   resources and influence to derail to the agency itself. For this reason,
   we propose the following research questions: what are the main
   challenges that a situation of systemic corruption imposes to an ACA as
   organization?: and what are determined strategies by an ACA in order to
   survive and be able to face the conditions of systemic corruption in a
   country? One contribution of this study is to affirm that an ACA is not
   simply an organizational tool dedicated mainly to punish and control
   through reports and information flows. In fact, an ACA is a social
   creature, which over time requires legitimacy and a strategy.},

Abstract = {Why do ordinary people engage in collective violence, harming others on
   behalf of their group? In this article, we argue that the violent group
   itself, and the identity it bestows on participating members, is an
   often overlooked and yet fundamental source of motivation for an
   individual's participation in collective violence. Reviewing insights
   from social and moral psychology, military history, and public health,
   we outline how the psychology of individual violent behavior presents a
   puzzle. For an ordinary person, participation in violence is often an
   aversive and distressing experience, and yet violent behavior leads to
   more violence in the future. A better understanding of the dynamics of
   collective violence allows us to make sense of this paradox. Violent
   groups can promote violent behavior among members by increasing members'
   motivation to engage in violence, particularly through group
   identification and deliberate strategies, and by removing psychological
   obstacles to violence (i.e., by making violence less aversive). Our
   synthesis of the literature points to a cycle of individuals'
   participation in collective violence, in which group identification
   motivates violent behavior and violent behavior increases identification
   with violent groups.},

Abstract = {Jihadist foreign fighters have become common in civil conflicts in
   Muslim countries. While research exists on the impact they have upon
   returning home, less attention has been given to their influence on the
   opposition cause that they mobilize in support of. This article looks at
   the impact that jihadist foreign fighters on the Chechen and Syrian
   resistance causes, evaluating their influence on oppositional cohesion
   and ideology, domestic and international perceptions of the movements,
   and on governmental narratives regarding the conflicts the foreign
   fighters engage in. It is concluded that foreign fighters have
   overwhelmingly damaged the Chechen and Syrian opposition movements,
   making the likelihood of opposition success more remote.},

Abstract = {From the perspective of Kosovo, this article contributes to a growing
   literature focusing on the substance of donor-driven democracy
   promotion. Drawing on extensive empirical research between 2010 and
   2012, the research provides greater insights into which donors are
   providing what sort of assistance; how the content and focus of aid are
   decided and formulated; and the behaviour of the European Union (EU) and
   other large donors compared with small bilaterals and private
   foundations. By including the category of `governance-oriented'
   assistance to classify donor initiatives, a more nuanced mapping of
   priorities and strategies is offered, which distinguishes between those
   measures designed to engage civil society (developmental), those
   focusing on institutions and elite level change (political), and
   interventions specifically designed to promote closer interaction
   between government and nongovernmental actors. The conclusion reached is
   that, although overall levels of aid to Kosovo have remained relatively
   stable since 2008, donor behaviour is in flux, with evidence of an
   emergent distinction between what larger donors offer and the provision
   of smaller bilaterals and private foundations. This, it is argued, has
   serious implications for the capacity of the EU to continue providing
   extensive aid across a wide range of issues and policy areas as part of
   its pre-accession assistance.},

Abstract = {This study examines alternative understandings of democracy and
   democracy promotion advanced by the US, EU, Russia and China in Central
   Asia using frame analysis. In the context of this study, `frames' refer
   to the relatively cohesive sets of beliefs, categories and value
   judgements as well as specific ways in which these ideas are packaged
   for the targets of international democratization. The study assesses the
   implications of alternative representations of democracy promotion and
   competing models of governance for the prospects of democratization in
   Central Asia. It concludes that the substance of US and EU democracy
   promotion in Central Asia has neglected the cultural and political
   contexts of these states, while the Russian and Chinese models of
   governance and development have provided a better match to the interests
   of the ruling elites.},

Abstract = {This contribution analyses the experience of the European Union (EU)
   with mutual recognition in the single market for goods and the European
   Arrest Warrant (EAW) as examples of multi-centred governance. In how far
   is it possible to respond to the functional needs for transborder
   mobility while protecting the choices of demoi and individual rights?
   Does the experience in the EU show that recognition of diversity is an
   alternative to harmonization and unity? The single goods market has
   developed far-reaching vertical elements falling short of a
   multi-centred regime. With a duty to recognize all rules, it may become
   meaningless to determine own rules. The EAW, in contrast, operates as a
   horizontal system but violates the rights of individuals, while
   honouring those of demoi.},

Abstract = {Aiming for regime transformation, post-transition Angolan civil society
   activism moved from reformism and confrontationism to
   ultra-confrontationism. Reformism and confrontationism evolved until the
   2008 elections, influenced by development thinking
   (neoliberalism/institutionalism vs neo-Marxism/world-system thinking),
   in two opposing strategies: `constructive engagement' vs political
   defiance. The dispute ended with ultra-confrontationism gaining impetus
   with the Arab spring, with a younger generation resorting to new methods
   (information and communications technology and demonstrations). Despite
   the lack of funding or international links, the newer methods caused
   more concern to the regime. Nevertheless, they suffer from the same
   shortfalls as their predecessors: they are confined to an urban/suburban
   social segment, and unable to attract the majority of the population.},

Title = {The Role of Policy Networks in the Coordination of the European Union's
   Economic and Environmental Interests: The Case of EU Mercury Policy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},
Pages = {471-489},
Abstract = {Policy networks can help to coordinate different objectives. The vast
   literature on network governance often implies that the mere existence
   of networks will automatically lead to improved coordination. However,
   much empirical analysis so far has focused on networks within particular
   policy sectors, which may actually inhibit horizontal coordination
   across policy sectors. This focus has led to ambiguities regarding the
   use of networks in practice - which this article seeks to help address.
   By analysing the role of networks in the coordination of the EU's
   economic and environmental objectives in the development of its mercury
   policy, the article demonstrates that policy networks need to span
   several policy sectors if they are to help reconcile competing policy
   objectives. Furthermore, certain characteristics of the policy area
   which contributed to the formation of an inter-sector network in this
   case are discussed.},

Abstract = {`Javanese culture' often is associated with `patrimonialism' at its
   worst, that is, as a prelude to predation. Yet a closer look at some of
   the well-known court-centred serat (mystical songs) and babad
   (chronicles) written in Central Java during the late 18th and the 19th
   centuries provide us with a very different picture. Pujangga
   (court-poets) crafted sophisticated imaginings of the negara: the State,
   or rather the domain of both moral and political authority. In
   territorial terms, they made a distinction between what the ruler could
   freely dispose of and what he could not alienate. Moreover, the very
   process of the imperial expansion of the negara under the reign of
   Sultan Agung (r. 1613-1646) led to the birth of a group of `government
   specialists': the service nobility of the priyayi. This group held a
   view of legitimate authority running contrary to any despotic
   temptation: for the priyayi, exercising power was an art, a craft
   involving skills that had to be learnt, whereas for the para bangsawan
   (members of the blood nobility), power was something to be possessed by
   virtue of the fame of a family name. Yet, during the colonial period,
   Dutch Orientalists, colonial administrators and high-ranking Javanese
   Regents came to give a wholly distorted view of this old priyayi
   conception of power, turning it into the cultural alibi of imperial
   authoritarianism.},

Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},

Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {329-353},
Abstract = {Building on ideas of networked governance and non-territorial autonomy,
   this article uses aspects of Lebanese public policy to show that
   significant functional communal autonomy can be achieved in the absence
   of coherent institutions designed to support it. In this way, the
   article argues that norms, notions of legitimacy, and behavioral
   practices are as important as institutional design in understanding
   communal autonomy. An overview of the Lebanese education, health, and
   welfare systems provides an understanding of how communal governance
   operates and interacts with the state across several policy areas. These
   policy areas are also used to explore issues of individual autonomy and
   state strength.},

Abstract = {Citizens are made, not born. In other words, we learn to be citizens. To
   be sure, most people obtain the legal status of citizens at birth, but
   that says little about what kind of citizen we will become (e.g. active,
   passive, green, etc.). Citizens need some degree of knowledge, skills
   and dispositions, as well as capabilities, for their rights and duties
   to be meaningful. In fact, who is a citizen and what kind of a citizen
   one becomes are a highly manufactured process. The making of citizens,
   green or otherwise, is a long and complex process that needs to be
   understood in the context of socialization, that is, the learning of
   norms and behaviours that allow individuals to become functioning
   members of a given society. This chapter explores the main spaces of
   political socialization (i.e. schools and the media) and outlines the
   dominant articulations of green citizenship that emerge from formal
   education, news media and popular culture. The chapter cannot do justice
   to the diversity and complexity of green pedagogies so, once again, the
   focus will be on its salient aspects and trends. The chapter includes a
   whole section dedicated to exploring the most popular and widespread
   pedagogical device through which we are being taught to be (and
   disciplined into being) green(er) citizens: the ecological footprint.},

Year = {2015},
Pages = {29-50},
Abstract = {This chapter teases out the evolution of Ukraine's integration behaviour
   towards the EU as well as the shifts in EU's policy towards Ukraine.
   Firstly, we examine Ukraine's motives behind making EU membership a
   formal foreign policy objective. We then draw attention to the gap
   between Ukraine's European declarations and domestic deeds by reference
   to the key features of the domestic political regime in Ukraine.
   Finally, we analyse Ukraine's demand for integration and the EU's

Abstract = {Group-based emotions can be experienced by group members for the past
   misdeeds of their ingroup towards an outgroup.. The present study
   examines distinct antecedents and consequences of group-based
   compunction and anger in two countries with a history of colonization
   (Portugal, N = 280 and the Netherlands, N = 184). While previous
   research has focused mainly on ingroup-focused antecedents of
   group-based emotions, such as ingroup identification and perceptions of
   responsibility, our research also analyzed outgroup-focused variables,
   such as outgroup identification and meta-perceptions. Multiple group
   structural equation modeling showed that group-based compunction and
   group-based anger have similar antecedents (exonerating cognitions,
   collectivism, outgroup identification and meta-perceptions).
   Furthermore, the results showed that the two emotions have distinct but
   related consequences for the improvement of intergroup relations
   (compensation, subjective importance of discussing the past and
   forgiveness assignment).},

Abstract = {One of the features of the African HIV/AIDS pandemic has been the
   re-emphasis of Africa's place in the global imagination as the `sick
   continent', the `diseased continent' and the `dark continent'. Much of
   the early discourse on HIV/AIDS in Africa - intentionally or not helped
   to cement a longstanding outsider idea of Africa as a place where health
   and general well-being are determined by culturally (and to a degree
   racially) dictated modes of sexual behaviour that fall well outside of
   the `ordinary'. Early HIV/AIDS discourse have much in common with
   colonial-era narratives on African `venereal disease' pandemics like
   syphilis in the late nineteenth/early twentieth century noteworthy, in
   both instances, was the view that African people needed saving from
   themselves. By analysing historical responses to these two pandemics, we
   demonstrate an arguably unbroken outsider perception of African
   sexuality, based largely on colonial-era tropes, that portrays African
   people as over-sexed, uncontrolled in their appetites, promiscuous,
   impervious to risk and thus agents of their own misfortune.},

Abstract = {Alexander Hamilton was the first US Treasury Secretary from 1789 to
   1795. When he started, the federal government was in default. During his
   tenure, US Treasuries became the ultimate safe asset. He successfully
   managed expectations, achieved debt service reduction, and stabilized
   financial panics. He delivered sound public finances and financial
   stability. In the end, the US possessed a modern financial system able
   to finance innovation and growth. At a time when Europe is working its
   way out of the sovereign debt crisis and implementing banking union and
   financial union, it is worthwhile to search for lessons from early US
   history.},

   UN SANCTIONS},
Journal = {AFRICAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {114},
Number = {454},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of UN-imposed sanctions on the
   stability of the Eritrean regime, with a focus on the reaction of the
   diaspora. It explores the transnational nature of Eritrean society and
   examines the history and structure of the Eritrean diaspora as well as
   its transformation since the political crisis of 2001. The article
   demonstrates that the government, as well as both its supporters and its
   opponents in the diaspora, have all instrumentalized sanctions for their
   own purposes. The government has used sanctions to rally supporters
   ``around the flag{''}, calling on the diaspora to raise funds to negate
   their effect. By contrast, opposition activists have campaigned against
   the 2 percent ``diaspora tax{''} levied by the government, arguing that
   it may be used for illicit military purposes in breach of the sanctions
   regime. In this sense, the sanctions have destabilized a core component
   of the regime's resource base. However, the failure of the diasporic
   opposition to organize a joint campaign to persuade host governments to
   outlaw the collection of the tax has undermined its efforts. Funds
   raised through the diaspora tax thus continue to flow into government
   coffers, playing a stabilizing role in spite of the UN sanctions regime.},

Abstract = {The Istrian Perambulation is one of the most important sources of
   knowledge about the autonomous rural communes of Istria in 14th (or
   perhaps even 13th) century. Even thought the document mostly describes
   proceedings of perambulation in the interior of Istria, a part that is
   now in Croatia, it touches the borders of three Istrian communes now
   located in Slovenia: Piran, Kostabona and Topolovec. The latter two of
   them were autonomous rural communes represented by two perfects (zupan)
   and inhabited by apparently Slavic population. The Istrian Perambulation
   paints a picture of Istria as an uniform cultural place as there are no
   notable differences visible between what is now Slovenia or Croatia. The
   rural communes have similar economic problems, and the perambulation is
   one of the ways how to deal with disputes and quarrels emerging among
   them due to the transformation to more intensive animal husbandry. The
   Istrian Perambulation also shows us what were the usual legal practices
   employed in the process of delimitation among rural (as well as urban)
   communes.},

Abstract = {The article examines the historically rooted conflicts between the
   Myanmar government and ethnic minorities with reference to the case of
   Kachin and Karen ethnic groups. Since the country's independence in
   1948, the central government in Rangoon (now Yangon) has attempted
   unsuccessfully to suppress the minorities' political movement. The Karen
   began armed movement against the central government as early as 1949,
   while the Kachin took up arms in 1961. The armed groups initially
   demanded independence from the Union of Burma but later opted for
   autonomy. The 17-year-old ceasefire between the Kachin armed group and
   the Myanmar military ended in June 2011, while the Karen armed group
   signed a ceasefire agreement with the government in January 2012. The
   article argues that accommodating the interests of minorities by the
   majority group and cooperation among the different ethnic groups are
   essential for national reconciliation and for the success of democracy
   in the Union of Myanmar.},

Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},

Volume = {27},

Pages = {268-288},
Abstract = {Scholars tend to attribute the use of suicide protest and suicide
   bombing to purely rational considerations. In contrast, I argue that
   conventional understandings of strategy are too narrow and must be
   expanded to include emotional motivations for political mobilization.
   Complex strategy directly engages both the calculative and emotive
   understandings of political action. I develop this theory through a
   comparison of suicide protests and suicide bombings in South Asia,
   focusing on the emotional content of this extreme tactic. Suicide
   protests illustrate the importance of pride, sympathy, fear, and shame
   in political mobilization. I explore the emotional character of suicide
   in protest through an investigation of two cases: the Liberation Tigers
   of Tamil Eelam in Sri Lanka (LTTE) and the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA)
   in India.},

Abstract = {After a decade of neoliberalism under the social-conservative
   administration of Carlos Menem (1989-1999), with its negative effects on
   women's rights, the 2001-2002 economic crises created new opportunities
   for women. The Menem administration initiated a gender-equality agenda
   with its quota for women candidates for the Congress and its adoption of
   the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
   against Women, but it clashed with women's groups on reproductive
   rights. While the two Kirchner administrations (2003-present)
   established programs for sexual health and responsible procreation, they
   reverted to maternalism in their programs for social assistance for poor
   mothers and family support. The Consejo Nacional de la Mujer (National
   Women's Council), created during the Menem administration, took on more
   responsibility for delivering social assistance but abandoned its
   original gender-equality mandate.},

Abstract = {We outline our non-material solution as part of a tailored approach to
   address the implications of the uncertainty associated with applying
   deterrence to cyber warfare. Specifically, we argue that the United
   States and its allies should seek to cultivate beneficial norms for
   cyber warfare, including norms that, first, constrain strategic cyber
   attacks, second, lower evidentiary standards for attributing cyber
   attacks, and, third, prohibit harboring `independent' cyber attackers.
   We also review norm evolution theory and suggest specific actions that
   can be taken to cultivate these various norms that would bolster cyber
   deterrence.},

Abstract = {Purpose - To identify the Obama administration's policy responsiveness
   to the (African) American LGBT communities. Methodology/approach -
   Theory development and content analysis.
   Findings - Civic universalism, as a theory, can explain President
   Obama's evolution on his support for marriage rights for same-sex
   couples. Obama employed the concept of e pluribus unum in his many
   approaches to LGBT responsive politics.
   Research limitations - To date, theoretical development within the
   social sciences of LGBT policy responsiveness is limited.
   Originality/value - Very little is written on the subject of LGBT
   (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered) politics in the 21st
   century. The study of the LGBT experience generally has been devoid of
   political variables because of a lack of attention toward LGBT issues,
   until recently, in national political party agendas. In this chapter, we
   review some of the contours of the LGBT community's fight for political
   recognition in the United States as a precursor to the election and
   reelection of President Obama. Drawing parallels with presidential
   responsiveness toward Blacks in their quest for rights, we examine the
   Obama administration's LGBT public policy initiatives as administrative
   policy and programs. We conclude by identifying new areas of research to
   explore on LGBT politics.},

Abstract = {The article explores the factors contributing to the decline and
   persistence of the political parties in Estonia, while proposing a more
   systematic framework for tackling the problem. The case study is focused
   on three Estonian parties (Res Publica, People's Union, and the Centre
   Party). The article puts forward an empirical framework in which three
   central dimensions are explored: (1) system-level variables; (2)
   external-dynamic variables; and (3) internal-organisational-level
   variables. The results of the analysis indicate that the quality of
   party leadership and the parties' attachment with the major cleavages in
   a given society are crucial factors in explaining the parties'
   persistence or demise.},

Abstract = {In this chapter, we assess the plausibility of the orchestration
   framework developed by Abbott et al. in relation to the orchestration
   activities of UNEP. Examining the PRI, which the UNEP Finance Initiative
   (UNEP FI) set up jointly with the UN Global Compact, we test the
   explanatory power of the hypotheses suggested in the framework chapter.
   Given that UNEP has been a prominent example in the early literature on
   orchestration, it is not surprising that the reality we observe fits
   well with many elements of orchestration theory. UNEP has limited
   capabilities; its member states have divergent goals on regulating the
   environmental performance of business through legally binding
   agreements; and state oversight of business engagement by the
   Paris-based UNEP Division on Technology, Industry and Economics (UNEP
   DTIE) and its Geneva-based UNEP FI Secretariat is moderate. This leaves
   those offices, both characterized by strong entrepreneurial cultures,
   with much leeway to experiment with innovative governance modes. Yet in
   the PRI case, focality worked very differently from the way Abbott et
   al. propose. UNEP engages in orchestration precisely in those areas
   where its focality is low, branching out into emerging policy areas to
   affirm its relevance as it confronts a more interconnected and crowded
   sustainability policy domain. Orchestration, we conclude, does not
   necessarily require thematic focality, but can also be used to
   compensate for its absence.},

Abstract = {Presidents' balance between liberal values based on imposition and
   restraint have major implications for foreign policy outcomes. In this
   article, I use text analytical tools to show how American presidents
   weigh Liberalism of Imposition and Liberalism of Restraint differently
   in State of the Union speeches. I use content analysis to map the focus
   on foreign policy and, based on a coding scheme, ideational analysis to
   assess which of the liberal traditions are more vocal in six of the
   speeches. Findings indicate that a shift has occurred from a balanced
   approach to more imposition-based ideas. Furthermore, I argue that these
   ideas can be traced back to the collective traditions drawn in the
   Monroe doctrine and Roosevelt corollary.},

Abstract = {Purpose - To highlight some of the tensions and complexities that
   persist in President Obama's widening support of Marriage Equality
   during his second administration.
   Methodology/approach - My primary research design uses autoethnographic
   detail and draws on two methodological frameworks: (1) the ``personal is
   political{''} use of subjective voice in feminist theory (particularly
   in the writings of black feminists), and (2) the postmodern view of
   complex, ``messy{''} and conflictual intersections of race, gender,
   sexuality, in the writings of critical race and queer theorists.
   Findings - My primary finding highlights how macro social structural
   processes related to white privilege and racial domination and how micro
   cultural narratives contributing to homophobia and heteronormativity in
   African American religious circles creates both positive and
   questionable views of President Obama's support of Marriage Equality,
   among African Americans heterosexuals, and within the African American
   LGBTIQ community.
   Originality/value - The primary value of this chapter contributes to the
   discussion on the persistent tensions between religion, race, and
   sexuality, which make fragile allies between supporters of Marriage
   Equality and supporters of Civil Rights and racial justice.},

Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {390-403},
Abstract = {This article seeks to clarify the relationship between reserved seats
   filled through competitive elections, political parties, and substantive
   minority representation. It argues that the party affiliation of the
   minority representative moderates the impact of reserved seats on
   substantive representation since minority and party constituencies can
   cross-pressure a representative or, in the case of overlap, can allow
   her to cater to party and minority interests simultaneously. Drawing on
   empirical examples, the article first classifies party affiliations
   along the criterion of overlap between minority interests and party
   appeal into five categories: `coinciding ethnic' parties, `multi-ethnic'
   parties, `partial ethnic' parties, `other ethnic' parties, and
   `non-ethnic' parties. Hypotheses about how these affiliations affect a
   reserved-seat representative's willingness to act for the minority are
   later developed, expecting a strong positive effect of the coinciding
   ethnic party, a weak positive effect for multi-and partial ethnic
   parties, a negative effect for other ethnic parties, and no effect for
   non-ethnic party affiliation.},

Abstract = {In the last thirty years ideologies have been treated as if they are
   contingent assemblages of concepts. This has complicated the study of
   ideologies so much that some philosophical consideration now seems
   necessary. In this article an original theory is put forward in which
   the three major ideologies of liberalism, socialism and conservatism are
   understood to be three differing views about the nature of the
   fundamental criterion by which politics should be judged. Since this
   theory explains the relation between the three as if they are
   elaborations of the same original criterion, it enables us to see how
   the ideologies relate to and yet differ from each other.},

Abstract = {This research note hypothesizes that international agreements including
   a finite duration provision or with a shorter expected duration should
   take less time to negotiate. Using a random sample of agreements across
   different issue areas, it finds statistical support for this hypothesis.
   Agreements without a finite duration provision experienced a bargaining
   phase that was twice as long as agreements including a finite duration
   provision and otherwise short-term agreements. This result not only
   offers empirical support for the theoretical proposition that a longer
   shadow of the future leads to increased bargaining delayit also has
   important policy implications. International negotiators can include a
   finite duration provision when they prefer a shorter bargaining phase to
   a potentially more durable agreement, and they can avoid this feature
   when they prefer a more durable agreement, although this decision comes
   with the cost of additional bargaining delay. By treating finite
   duration provisions as an independent variable, this result also
   addresses a critique of the research program on the rational design of
   international institutions that it moves backward by considering only
   design features as dependent variables.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the challenges of China's experience in
   multilateralism. The study is based on the Asian Infrastructure
   Investment Bank, a new multilateral financial institution China set up.
   AIIB benefits from broad international participation, draws attention
   and provokes strong reactions worldwide. It demosntrates the political
   power China wishes to assert and it highlights its power of attraction.
   Crucially, it reflects Chinese dissatisfaction with the major
   international financial institutions and Chinese willingness to find a
   cooperative platform that would reflect its economic weight and respond
   to its interests. While promising on paper however, the AIIB reveals a
   number of shortcomings.},

   False Projection},

Volume = {36},

Abstract = {Although widely studied, previous research of projection in the context
   of public opinion did not incorporate the distinction between adequate
   and false projection developed in the cognitive studies: Adequate
   projection contributes to accurate perceptions of public opinion while
   false projection impairs it. The analysis presented in this study
   includes the above distinction, building on two case studies: (1) a
   dataset comprised of 25 surveys conducted over a period of 10 years (N =
   11,313) and (2) a panel study of the 2013 Israeli general election.
   Relying on the assumptions of the Bayesian model, we tested if frequent
   news exposure and factual political knowledge reduce false projection.
   We found that false projection is a highly persistent psychological
   tendency with little variance. Although news exposure and political
   knowledge did contribute to a more accurate perception of public
   opinion, they did not reduce false projection. Conversely, knowledge
   increased false projection among moderates and had no effect in this
   respect among proponents of a more extreme ideology. These findings
   align better with the motivated reasoning model than with the Bayesian
   model.},

Abstract = {Large-scale organized crime occupies a gray zone between ordinary crime
   and political violence. The unprecedented scale of drug-related crime in
   Mexico has led to its description as an insurgency or even a civil war,
   a conceptual move that draws on recent studies that have associated
   civil war with large-scale criminality. By questioning both the crime as
   civil war and civil war as crime models, I argue that instead of folding
   the two phenomena, we should draw primarily from the micro-dynamics of
   civil war research program to identify areas of potentially productive
   cross-fertilization. I point to four such areas, namely, onset and
   termination, organization, combat and violence, and governance and
   territory. I conclude by sketching a theoretical and empirical agenda
   for the study of large-scale organized crime.},

Abstract = {Scholars have engaged in discussions over whether the rise of
   transnational private authority is beneficial or undermines public
   legitimate authority. While the recent focus on civil regulation has
   emphasized the key role of public authorities and civil societies in
   such arrangements, the case of the International Federation of
   Association Football (FIFA) provides strong evidence that global
   policies can be formulated and administered by completely private
   institutions relying on strong enforcement mechanisms and able to
   confront public authorities. FIFA's power results from its control of
   market access to global football, which represents a vital club good'
   for national football industries. Therefore, FIFA is able to force
   European Union member states to deviate from national paths of sport
   regulation. Without orchestrating their efforts, public authorities are
   unlikely to succeed in challenging FIFA's power. Although the recent
   corruption scandals might force FIFA to implement some reforms, FIFA has
   a vital interest in protecting its regulatory powers.},

Abstract = {This article explains the basis for electoral support for political
   parties in the Czech and Slovak Republics in the post-1993 period. The
   database consists of results from Parliamentary elections (in the Czech
   context, elections to the Chamber of Deputies) and of data obtained from
   censuses carried out by statistical agencies. The theory of conflict
   lines developed by Stein Rokkan and Seymour M. Lipset was chosen as the
   theoretical basis. The key analytical tool employed is linear
   regression. The explanation provided evaluates the dependence of
   political party electoral support (as defined by seats won in elections)
   upon socioeconomic variables contained in the theory. Analysis of the
   results shows that the support parties receive in elections depends
   significantly upon social characteristics. An especially clear
   explanation is generated for the support given to Christian and ethnic
   parties. For protest parties, the impact of the constituent social and
   economic structure is only marginal. (C) 2015 The Regents of the

Abstract = {Norwegian energy policy is increasingly made by the European Union (EU),
   but as a European Economic Area (EEA) member only, Norway lacks
   representation in EU institutions. This article studies how key
   Norwegian energy companies and organizations deal with this challenge,
   asking whether Norwegian interest groups lobby directly in Brussels or
   lobby in Oslo to influence EU legislation. It finds that although
   Norwegian interest groups lack access to the European Parliament and the
   Council of Ministers, they have access to the Commission. Still, they
   mainly lobby in Oslo, even to influence EU legislation. When lobbying in
   Brussels, they lobby early in the decision-making process and together
   with good friends', mostly European associations. However, these
   lobbying strategies are insufficient to compensate for lack of
   representation in EU institutions - which therefore represents a great
   democratic problem. A case study of the EU 2030 Framework on climate and
   energy illustrates this democratic challenge.},

Abstract = {As countries negotiate a new climate agreement for the United Nations
   climate conference in December 2015, a groundswell of climate actions is
   emerging as cities, regions, businesses and civil society groups act on
   mitigation and adaptation, independently, with each other and with
   national governments and international organizations. The Paris
   conference provides a historic opportunity to establish a framework to
   catalyse, support, and steer these initiatives. Without such a
   framework, `bottom-up' climate governance runs the risk of failing to
   deliver meaningful results. Social science research highlights the need
   for a comprehensive approach that promotes ambition, experimentation and
   accountability, and avoids unnecessary overlaps. This article specifies
   functions and design principles for a new, comprehensive framework for
   sub- and nonstate climate actions that could provide effective
   coordination.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL THEORY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {572-616},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Building on John Ruggie's pioneering study of multilateralism, this
   paper presents an analogous study of multistakeholder governance, or
   multistakeholderism. Its central argument is that multistakeholderism
   is, as yet, a much less well-defined institutional form. Cases exhibit
   significant variation both in the combinations of actor classes entitled
   to participate and the nature of authority relations among those actors.
   The first section discusses multistakeholderism as an institutional
   form, and proposes a taxonomy of its types. This section also briefly
   addresses the implications of the analysis for International Relations
   theory. The paper then conducts a comparative analysis of
   multistakeholderism, applying the taxonomy to five illustrative cases.
   It demonstrates the degree of inter-case variation, and the range of
   issue-areas across which the institutional form is employed and invoked
   by actors. Three cases are drawn from the increasingly contentious area
   of Internet governance; the paper thus makes a secondary contribution to
   this growing literature. The paper's most striking finding in this
   regard is that Internet governance often fails to live up to its
   multistakeholder rhetoric. Other cases include governance of securities
   regulation and the governance of corporate social responsibility. The
   paper concludes by examining the implications of our argument, and
   identifying areas for further research.},

Abstract = {Current efforts to end contemporary slavery represent a fourth wave of
   an Anglo-American abolitionist movement. Despite this historic
   precedent, there is little agreement on the nature of the problem. A
   review of current academic discourse, movement frames, and policy
   approaches suggests that six perspectives predominate: a prostitution
   approach focused on sexual exploitation of women and girls; a migration
   approach focused on the cross-border flow of migrants; a criminal
   justice approach focused on law and enforcement; a forced-labor approach
   emphasizing unfree labor; a slavery approach focused on trafficking in
   comparative-historical context; and a human rights approach centered on
   individual rights. This article discusses the strengths and weaknesses
   of each approach and advances an expanded version of the human rights
   approach.},

Abstract = {In this article I seek to develop a case for viewing the welfare state
   as a primary institution in international society. This is with
   particular reference to Norden (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and
   Sweden), where in the course of the 1930s, and particularly in the
   post-1945 era, the welfare state was elevated to a core principle of
   legitimacy, largely defining the idea of nationhood for these countries.
   Furthermore, I will attempt to show how the adoption of this principle
   of legitimacy conditioned the Nordic countries' interpretation of a
   number of other primary institutions in international society such as
   diplomacy, war and trade. A key contribution of this approach is that it
   aspires not only to examine the evolution of one institution in
   isolation, as has often been attempted in English School scholarship,
   but to actively explore how institutions interact with each other.},

Abstract = {The paper reconsiders the Weber Thesis of Calvinism and modern
   capitalism assumed in a causal association or affinity and congruence as
   the independent and dependent variable, respectively within his social
   economics. The analysis focuses on the Weber Thesis in its historical
   component by identifying and reexamining its supposed proofs in
   historically Calvinist societies. It thus reconsiders the presumed
   exemplars of the Calvinism-capitalism `rule' in most of these societies.
   Specifically, it identifies and analyzes certain relevant historical
   deviations from the Weber Thesis in the assumed exemplars of its `rule'.
   The first major deviation is that pre-industrial capitalism as an
   economic its spirit and practice arises and exists prior to Calvinism in
   Calvinist and other Western societies. The second deviation is that
   modern industrial capitalism develops and expands long after the rise
   and extension and actually during the decline of Calvinism in these
   societies. Generally, the paper aims to contribute to a better
   understanding and further development of the Weber Thesis and related
   sociological conceptions of the relationship between economy and
   society, including religions, ideology and culture.},

Abstract = {This article examines the experience of employment policy in Denmark as
   a case of how one country deployed an experimental design to shape the
   evolution of its political economy. This article distinguishes social
   learning from interest and authority-based arguments in theories of
   institutional change and development. The argument of this article is
   that learning processes contributed to incremental developments that
   both Liberal and Social Democrat officials have made in employment
   policy since the Great Recession. Institutional structure and
   market-oriented interests are important, but the discovery of new
   knowledge about employment problems through a recursive policy planning
   process contributed to the reconfiguration of the networks of policy
   agents. The experimental accumulation of practical knowledge brought the
   government to a major reassessment of its employment strategy.},

Abstract = {Three fundamental questions about bureaucracy are examined here,ones
   related to the effectiveness of bureaucracy and bureaucratization. The
   questions are: 1) How much public bureaucracy is enough and how do we
   optimize the size of bureaucracy? 2) What are the normative models of
   bureaucracy and how does one choose among them? 3) What are the ends of
   bureaucracy and, specifically, how can ``Public Values-Focused{''}
   bureaucracy be achieved? To the extent possible, the paper answers those
   questions in the context of a variety of contingency variables;
   especially political culture and the political culture focus of greatest
   interest pertains to nations of Latin America. In a nutshell, the paper
   concludes size optimization is not meaningful without the specification
   of a large number of prior contextual variables, the main components of
   which are specified. The normative models reviewed, after assessing the
   idea of ``failed bureaucracy,{''} pertain to cost containment, neutral
   competence and public value notions. The document concludes by
   suggesting that a key to public value-bureaucracy is establishing a high
   level of professionalism and an attendant high degree of bureaucratic
   autonomy.},

Abstract = {The reforms promoted by Mikhail Gorbachev in the Soviet Union
   destabilized the communist regime of the GDR, opening up a process that
   combined internal factors with international negotiations on the
   democratization of the GDR and the unification of the two Germanies. A
   method of inserting unified Germany into the international system was
   required that would boost European stability following the shift in the
   balance of power arising from the crisis in the Soviet empire, and the
   presence of a strong Germany at the heart of the continent. Access for
   the GDR to the institutional framework of the German Federal Republic
   resolved the international problem, but curtailed the democratization
   process begun in the GDR.},

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {36},
Number = {5},
Pages = {487-506},
Month = {SEP 3},
Abstract = {Policy Design Theory (PDT) predicts that the distribution of the costs
   and benefits of governmental intervention depends on the social
   construction and level of power of target groups. The case of Quebec,
   Canada, which recently went through acrimonious policy debates on
   immigration and integration issues, does not correspond to this pattern.
   Degenerative politics - that is, the stigmatization of powerless groups
   and an unequal distribution of the costs and benefits of governmental
   intervention to the detriment of the most vulnerable - did not occur
   even if the conditions were seemingly in place to produce it. Using
   Quebec as a most likely' case, I show that the policy-making sphere
   remained immune to the degenerative dynamics that took hold in the media
   and the legislature. More precisely, I argue that three interrelated
   factors explain the results: past policies and their unintended
   consequences, an implementation structure committed to the needs of
   immigrants, and the specific incentive structure facing political
   actors. The results question the transferability of PDT outside of the
   institutional setting of the USA, where it was first developed and
   applied.},

Abstract = {`New environmentalism' refers to efforts to create social and economic
   sustainability in local communities, emphasizing `Green
   entrepreneurship' as a means of achieving its goals. New
   environmentalism is the type of diffuse, fluid movement not typically
   studied by social movement researchers. As a worldwide network of groups
   aiming to create sustainable communities, Transition exemplifies new
   environmentalism. This study examines the local Transition initiative in
   Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, using participant observation and in-depth
   interviews. We argue that the group's fluid structure attracts
   grass-roots members, but may ultimately undermine its efficacy in
   mobilizing a social movement to achieve collective goals. Transition
   Pittsburgh's entrepreneurial orientation and commitment to the open
   space model of organizing support a fluid movement, but limit its
   capacity to devise strategies and grow as an organization.},

Abstract = {The fighting in some civil wars primarily takes place in a few stable
   locations, while the fighting in others moves substantially. We posit
   that rebel groups that do not primarily fight for a specific ethnic
   group, that receive outside military assistance, or that have relatively
   weak fighting capacity tend to fight in inconsistent locations. We
   develop new measures of conflict zone movement to test our hypotheses,
   based on shifts in the conflict polygons derived from the new
   Georeferenced Event Dataset (GED) developed by the Uppsala Conflict Data
   Program (UCDP). Our empirical results provide support for the suggested
   mechanisms. We find that groups which lack strong ethnic ties and
   sufficient military strength to compete with government forces in
   conventional warfare fight in more varied locations. These findings
   improve our understandings of and expectations for variations in the
   humanitarian footprint of armed conflicts, the interdependencies between
   rebel groups and local populations, and the dilemmas faced by government
   counterinsurgency efforts.},

Abstract = {Can the discovery of petroleum resources increase the risk of civil
   conflict even before their exploitation? We argue that it can, but only
   in poorer states where oil revenues threaten to alter the balance of
   power between regimes and their opponents, rendering bargains in the
   present obsolete in the future. We develop our claims via a
   game-theoretic model of bargaining between a government and a rebel
   group, where decisions over war and peace occur in the shadow of
   increasing oil wealth that both increases national wealth and shifts
   relative power in the government's favor. To test the model's main
   hypothesis, we leverage data on newly discovered oil deposits as an
   indicator of the state's expected future power resources. Our argument
   has important implications for the literature on credible commitments,
   power shifts, and violent conflict.},

Abstract = {The core claims of the practice turn in International Relations (IR)
   remain ambiguous. What promises does international practice theory hold
   for the field? How does the kind of theorizing it produces differ from
   existing perspectives? What kind of research agenda does it produce?
   This article addresses these questions. Drawing on the work of Andreas
   Reckwitz, we show that practice approaches entail a distinctive view on
   the drivers of social relations. Practice theories argue against
   individualistic-interest and norm-based actor models. They situate
   knowledge in practice rather than mental frames or discourse. Practice
   approaches focus on how groups perform their practical activities in
   world politics to renew and reproduce social order. They therefore
   overcome familiar dualismsagents and structures, subjects and objects,
   and ideational and materialthat plague IR theory. Practice theories are
   a heterogeneous family, but, as we argue, share a range of core
   commitments. Realizing the promise of the practice turn requires
   considering the full spectrum of its approaches. However, the field
   primarily draws on trajectories in international practice theory that
   emphasize reproduction and hierarchies. It should pay greater attention
   to practice approaches rooted in pragmatism and that emphasize
   contingency and change. We conclude with an outline of core challenges
   that the future agenda of international practice theory must tackle.},

Abstract = {Is the G20 transforming global governance, or does it reinforce the
   status quo? In this article we argue that as innovative as some
   diplomatic practices of the G20 may be, we should not overstate their
   potential impact. More specifically, we show that G20 diplomacy often
   reproduces many oligarchic tendencies in global governance, while also
   relaxing club dynamics in some ways. On the one hand, the G20 has more
   inductees who operate along new rules of the game and under a new
   multilateral ethos of difference. But, on the other hand, the G20 still
   comprises self-appointed rulers, with arbitrary rules of membership and
   many processes of cooption and discipline. In overall terms, approaching
   G20 diplomacy from a practice perspective not only provides us with the
   necessary analytical granularity to tell the old from the new, it also
   sheds different light on the dialectics of stability and change on the
   world stage. Practices are processes and as such they are always subject
   to evolutionary change. However, because of their structuring effects,
   diplomatic practices also tend to inhibit global transformation and
   reproduce the existing order.},

Abstract = {As Chinese cities edge toward projections of one billion residents by
   2025, they are generating unprecedented demand for food. Ambitions to
   meet this demand with domestic production are still far from reality,
   prompting Chinese agriculture enterprises to buy and invest overseas.
   This article examines the consequences for Brazil, which in 2013
   provided 45 \% of China's soybean imports. It finds that diverging
   traditions of state-society trust have provoked Brazilian uncertainties
   about the objectives and management practices of investing Chinese
   actors. It concludes that successful ``South-South{''} relations between
   China and Brazil will require fresh approaches to trust between state
   and society that break with previous development theory and practice.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses how varied policy analytical capacity can be
   evaluated at the systemic level through observed gaps in environmental
   data monitoring and reporting among countries. Such analytical capacity
   at the knowledge system level facilitates transparency and credibility
   needed for nation-states to cooperate on issues requiring global
   coordination, including ``super-wicked{''} environmental issues like
   climate change. So far there has been relatively sparse attention paid
   to whether countries will have the ability or policy analytical capacity
   to report the necessary data and indicators required for the next round
   of global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) being proposed. In this
   paper, I argue that the varied policy analytical capacity within the
   global environmental knowledge system necessitates the participation of
   new institutions and actors. Identifying gaps in data availability at a
   global, systemic scale, this paper presents a proxy measure of policy
   analytical capacity based on publicly-reported national statistics of
   air and water quality performance. Such discrepancies evaluated at a
   systemic level make a case for channels by which citizen scientists,
   independent watchdogs, private sector companies and third-party
   organizations can participate to enhance the policy analytical capacity
   of governments. (C) 2015 Policy and Society Associates (APSS). Elsevier

Abstract = {This study examines whether the various leadership roles undertaken by
   public sector managers have an important association with subordinates'
   levels of affective commitment to the organization. Our empirical
   findings suggest that not all leadership practices matter. It appears
   that only relations-oriented and change-oriented leadership, and to a
   far lesser extent integrity-oriented leadership, have a substantive
   association with affective organizational commitment. Task-oriented
   leadership and, to a large degree, integrity-oriented leadership, are
   found not to matter much for employees with lower levels of affective
   commitment, but they look to strengthen fondness of the organization
   among those with already high levels of affective commitment. Results
   also suggest that the diversity-oriented leadership role has no
   association with affective commitment to the organization.},

Abstract = {Checklists for evaluation capacity builders include a wide range of
   building blocks for supporting evaluation activity. Yet, the relative
   importance of each building block is not clear. The purpose of this
   article is to identify the capacity related factors that are necessary,
   but not necessarily sufficient, for organisations that wish to
   institutionalise high quality policy evaluations. To retrieve these
   factors, we rely on the necessity function in qualitative comparative
   analysis. We present a study of twenty-seven organisations of the
   Flemish public sector (Belgium), in which the introduction of policy
   evaluations is relatively recent. Our case analysis thus sheds an
   interesting light upon how policy evaluation, and the underlying
   capacity to evaluate is given shape. Our findings point at evaluation
   demand as the most necessary prerequisite for fostering evaluation
   activity, more so than supply related factors. (c) 2015 Policy and

Title = {Clientelism a Stumbling Block for Democratization? Lessons from Mexico},

Abstract = {Clientelism is a form of social conflict management and as such is more
   than mere vote buying or a way of undermining rational-legal systems.
   Integrating clientelism into the debate over the transition to democracy
   makes it possible to explain the outcomes of stagnating political
   transition processes. Under the condition of labor surplus, clientelism
   hinders political inclusion by undermining the class-based organizations
   that might challenge the privileged access of the elite to resources.
   Consideration of clientelism helps explain the case of Mexico, which has
   been classified as a deviant case in transition research because two
   transition processes there, at the beginning and the end of the
   twentieth century, did not end in complete democratization. El
   clientelismo es una forma de gestion del conflicto social y, como tal,
   es algo mas que la mera compra de votos o una manera de socavar los
   sistemas racional-legales. La integracion de clientelismo en el debate
   sobre la transicion a la democracia hace posible explicar los resultados
   de procesos de transicion politica estancados. Bajo la condicion de mano
   de obra excedente, el clientelismo dificulta la inclusion politica,
   socavando las organizaciones de clase que podria desafiar el acceso
   privilegiado de la elite a los recursos. Reflexion sobre el clientelismo
   ayuda a explicar el caso de Mexico, que ha sido clasificado como un caso
   anormal en la investigacion de transicion debido a que dos procesos de
   transicion alli, al principio y al final del siglo XX, no resultaron en
   la democratizacion completa.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) is usually described as a promoter of global
   environmental governance, committed to sustainability and the
   precautionary principle. Regarding international fisheries management,
   however, the EU has repeatedly deviated from these principles. This
   article analyses the EU's policy in two Regional Fisheries Management
   Organizations (RFMOs): the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization
   (NAFO) and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic
   Tunas (ICCAT). The EU's deviation from its environmental principles is
   explained by the weakness of the pro-environmental advocacy coalition in
   the EU's fisheries policy subsystem and the overcapacity of the EU's
   fleet, which first arose when European fishing nations were excluded
   from traditional fishing grounds during the creation of Exclusive
   Economic Zones in the 1970s. At the same time the article finds evidence
   of a trend towards sustainability and precaution in the EU's external
   fisheries policy since the mid-2000s.},

Abstract = {Over the last 20 years, developing countries have witnessed the
   increased role of non-governmental actors such as health industry
   associations and umbrella organizations in the diffusion and governance
   of health innovation. Utilizing extensive interviews with actors in the
   Indian and South African health industries, this paper argues that, in a
   context of emerging pluralism - i.e., a dynamic context of bargaining
   between competing (public and private) interests and values - these
   associations constitute public actors that play dual roles in the
   politics of innovation and development. Specifically, not only do they
   engage downstream by diffusing knowledge to their respective health
   innovation systems in order to achieve common objectives, they also
   engage upstream with their governments to co-develop policies and
   regulations. This dual role of health industry associations and umbrella
   organizations makes them less neutral politically but more effective
   institutionally, and their innovative and political role should be
   seriously taken into account in the healthcare sector.},

Abstract = {Political marketing is now being used more often in election campaigning
   in Malaysia. Therefore, this article explores the practices of political
   marketing in Malaysia by examining political campaigning in the 2014
   Kajang by-election. The article examines (1) the history of political
   marketing in Malaysia, (2) the background of the Kajang by-election, (3)
   the political marketing techniques employed by the political parties and
   candidates contesting the Kajang by-election, and (4) the effectiveness
   of political marketing in attracting electorates to vote for candidates
   in the Kajang by-election. This research employed discourse analysis
   whereby data were gathered from library research and observation
   conducted in Kajang during the by-election from nomination day on 11
   March 2014 until polling day on 23 March 2014. In the Kajang
   by-election, several techniques of political campaigning were utilized
   to attract voters to vote for the candidates. Both political parties,
   the Barisan Nasional (BN) and the People's Justice Party (PKR), employed
   political marketing strategies called the 4Ps (product, promotion,
   party, and price). The candidate Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, the president of
   the PKR, was challenged by Chew Mei Fun, a Malaysian Chinese Association
   (MCA) vice president, representing the BN. Wan Azizah was able to win
   with a victory margin of 19\%. This by-election proved that political
   parties utilized political marketing excessively to attract votes for
   their parties.},

Abstract = {The authors study the influence of domestic political dissent and
   violence on incumbent dictators and their regimes. They argue that elite
   with an interest in preserving the regime hold dictators accountable
   when there is a significant increase in terrorism. To pinpoint the
   accountability of dictators to elite who are strongly invested in the
   current regime, the authors make a novel theoretical distinction between
   reshuffling coups that change the leader but leave the regime intact and
   regime-change coups that completely change the set of elites atop the
   regime. Using a new data set that distinguishes between these two coup
   types, the authors provide robust evidence that terrorism is a
   consistent predictor of reshuffling coups, whereas forms of dissent that
   require broader public participation and support, such as protests and
   insurgencies, are associated with regime-change coup attempts. This
   article is the first to show that incumbent dictators are held
   accountable for terrorist campaigns that occur on their watch.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to an understanding of the processes of
   contestation and localisation of norms in post-conflict societies via a
   Bourdieu-inspired analysis of the process of security privatisation in
   two former Yugoslav countries: Bosnia and Serbia. By drawing on
   Bourdieu's concepts of field, habitus, capital and strategies, this
   paper sheds light on the ways in which, in Bosnia as well as in Serbia,
   a particular habitus and forms of capital inherited from these polities'
   violent past have shaped the implementation of the liberal project of
   security privatisation. The result has been a situation in which
   legislation and institutions aimed at promoting a liberal model of
   security provision co-exist with practices that are inconsistent with
   liberal-democratic principles of accountability and respect for human
   rights and the rule of law.},

Abstract = {The paper aims to contribute to the clarification of several aspects of
   the minorities' right to participate in public life on local level. It
   considers the following elements: analysis of the Macedonian legal and
   constitutional framework; analysis of relevant provision of the
   Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the
   European Union's treatment of the issue in the framework of its foreign
   policy of `Regional Approach' (1996-1999). The analysis relies on two
   comparisons. Firstly, it contrasts the content of the EU conditionality
   in the field of minority rights developed during the 1990's in the
   framework of the eastern enlargement with the content of conditionality
   in the same field developed in the framework of the `Regional Approach'.
   Secondly, the study encompasses a brief comparison with the later
   development of the relevant standards within the framework of the
   subsequently developed EU enlargement policy of Stabilisation and
   Association Process (SAP). Considering that the EU relies on the
   standards developed in the system of Council of Europe in the field of
   minority rights, the analysis in particular attempts to contribute to
   the understanding of the dynamics of this ``borrowing{''}, during which
   the Council and the Commission rely on certain aspects of the body of
   rules of the Council of Europe, while omitting others.},

   Qaeda-Inspired Violence in Spain and the United Kingdom},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {38},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {Spain and the United Kingdom have experienced similar types of political
   violence. Since the 1960s, both countries have suffered casualties as a
   result of long-standing ethno-nationalist conflicts as well as terrorist
   attacks by Al Qaeda-inspired groups. In spite of these similarities, the
   two countries display a striking variation in the attitudes to victims.
   In Spain, Associations of Victims of Terrorism have been highly visible
   and influential, whereas United Kingdom-based organizations have not
   captured the public's imagination and the attention of policymakers in
   the same way. Spanish associations of victims have been present in the
   public sphere and have routinely provided their opinions on
   counterterrorist policy and appropriate government legislation whereas
   this sort of political activity is difficult to trace in the United
   Kingdom. As a result of this puzzle, the article tries to answer the
   following question: Why are associations of victims of terrorism by Al
   Qaeda-inspired attacks more influential in Spain than in the United
   Kingdom? The article will argue that political and sociocultural
   variables account for the difference. More specifically, the article
   demonstrates that the experience of both ethno-nationalist and jihadist
   political violence has affected party systems and cultural frames
   differently, hence providing distinct sets of political opportunities
   for victims' associations to carry out their lobbying strategies.},

Abstract = {The Internet has had a transformative effect in modern societies,
   becoming an empowering tool for individuals and an increasingly
   indispensable part of citizens' lives. Yet, like any technology, the
   Internet also has negative ramifications. For instance, violent groups
   and networks can exploit it in a variety of ways including the planning
   of operations, establishing communications, circulation of propaganda,
   training and recruiting new members, and raising funds. In light of the
   above, terrorists' use of the Internet is an area that has started to
   attract attention from European institutions. So far, the EU response
   has concentrated on raising critical communication infrastructure
   resilience standards to prevent potential cyber-attacks. Yet, these
   efforts have, in reality, been motivated by security concerns regarding
   acts of cyber-espionage, cyber-crime, and cyber-sabotage rather than
   hitherto hypothetical attacks of terrorist origin. On the other hand,
   other malicious uses of the Internet by terrorist groups have received
   comparatively less attention. However, this does not make these policies
   unimportant. Far from it. Some initiatives at the European level of the
   EU designed to undermine online radicalisation, embryonic as they are,
   may have failed already to balance the need for effective action against
   the obligation to protect Internet users' privacy rights.},

Title = {Decision networks and quasi-citizens: who deliberates, where?},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {36},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {345-358},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {This article argues that the focus on deliberative politics in a state
   polity reveals two often overlooked facts about where politics takes
   place and who is participating in it. Recognition of these facts
   suggests the polity is more adaptable to new situations than usually
   conceived and suggest unusual and demanding requirements for democracy.
   The article suggest considering two important elements of democratic
   politics: decision networks, and quasi-citizens. (1) Decision networks
   are composed of networks of stakeholders, experts and authoritative
   decision-makers. Deliberative democracy depends heavily on what happens
   in these ad hoc decision networks. (2) Quasi-citizens: the people whose
   interests and perspectives count in a democracy is not a single group
   defined by citizenship. Deliberation frequently involves non-citizens
   not just as objects of policy, but as individuals and groups whose
   interests and interactions have to be taken into account - that is, are
   represented - in the process of making law and policy. Like citizens,
   their cooperation and judgment that state actions are legitimate are
   often required for law or policy to be effective. The article suggests
   changing the norm of rule by `the people' to rule by `all those
   affected'.},

   This article Highlights how G20 endorsement' promotes and enhances the
   legitimacy of specialist technical agencies and organisations Provides a
   case study highlighting the impact of G20 endorsement on the OECD's
   international tax transparency agenda Develops a mid-level theory of G20
   endorsement in order to analyse this emerging form of authority in
   global governance
   The G20 Leaders' Forum has been touted as The world's premier forum for
   promoting global cooperation', yet beyond this rhetoric the track record
   of the G20 is varied leading critics to claim sit is little more than a
   toothless talkshop'. We argue that such sweeping generalisations are
   difficult to sustain in the light of evidence from some issue arenas in
   which the G20 has been active. This article draws on the extant
   literature on the Gs' and network governance in an attempt to theorise
   and explain the G20's endorsement function, or its capacity to promote
   and legitimise the work of specialised organisations and networks. We
   build on the extant literature using a semi-inductive method focusing on
   the G20's endorsement of the OECD's international tax transparency
   agenda to develop a mid-level framework for analysing this important
   source of authority in global governance.},

   Global Promotional Campaign},

Year = {2015},

Abstract = {Research Highlights and Abstract This article provides A zeitgeist'
   analysis of how the Coalition leadership tried to make the most of
   Britain's big year' of 2012, particularly in terms of the government's
   prosperity agenda'; Rich empirical data about high profile,
   government-wide trends in British promotional strategies and practices
   in the context of austerity; Analysis of the consequences of these
   promotional activities from a number of perspectives, including: GREAT
   as an alternative to existing promotional structures; strategies for
   drawing upon national identity in support of economic growth;
   disciplining techniques for enforcing brand identity; approaches to
   co-branding corporate and governmental Britain; the metrics used to
   demonstrate impact.
   The GREAT campaign is one of the most ambitious national promotion
   efforts ever undertaken. Timed to make the most of Britain's raised
   profile during Olympic year, the aim was to promote trade, investment
   and tourism under a unified identity emphasising British achievements.
   However, the campaign raises a number of issues. The first is how and
   why GREAT emerged as an alternative to established structures for soft
   power, public diplomacy and marketing in the UK. The second is the ways
   GREAT engages with collective identity through the nationalisation and
   commodification of symbolic resources. Third is the practices used to
   include and exclude specific target groups and stakeholders. Fourth is
   the interaction between economic and symbolic resources, including
   public-private collaboration and the evidence used to determine impact
   and value. These themes contribute to an analysis of GREAT that will be
   of interest to scholars of politics and IR in the UK and
   internationally.},

Abstract = {Recent work has shown that the introduction of mobile communications can
   substantially alter the course of conflict. In Afghanistan and India
   targeting mobile communications is a central part of the insurgent
   campaigns. The opposite was true in Iraq. There insurgents instead
   threatened providers who did not do enough to maintain mobile phone
   networks. These differences likely arise from two competing effects of
   mobile communications: they make it easier for antigovernment actors to
   coordinate collective action, thereby increasing violence, and for
   pro-government civilians to collaborate with security forces allowing
   them to more effectively suppress rebels, thereby decreasing violence.
   To study these competing effects we analyze a formal model of insurgent
   action in which changes in the communications environment alter both (i)
   the ability of rebels to impose costs on civilians who cooperate with
   the government and (ii) the information flow to government forces
   seeking to suppress rebellion with military action. Our analysis
   highlights the importance of the threat of information sharing by
   non-combatants in reducing violence and offers some guidelines for
   policymakers in thinking about how much to support ICT development in
   conflict zones. In particular, we show that officials can generate
   reasonable expectations about whether expanding ICT access will
   exacerbate conflict or reduce it by assessing the relative gains to both
   sides from changes in ICT access along several simple dimensions.},

Abstract = {After learning that US-regulated manufacturers were relying on a
   minerals black market in Central Africa to make products, and assessing
   the threats posed to national security by this black market, Congress
   enacted Section 1502 on Conflict Minerals in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
   Reform Act of 2010. 1502 requires US-regulated manufacturers using
   minerals from Central Africa to report on whether their sourcing funds
   armed groups and, if so, to list the products manufactured in the last
   year containing those minerals. Congress's intent was to use market
   pressures from investors, business partners, and consumers to shrink
   companies' use of the Central African minerals black market and lessen
   its negative impacts. 1502 is the latest in a series of measures using
   common legal standards to shrink international black markets. This
   article will describe the legislative history of 1502 in a
   practitioner's context and address debates surrounding 1502.},

Abstract = {This article investigates whether attacks against Israeli targets help
   Palestinian factions gain public support. We link individual-level
   survey data to the full list of Israeli and Palestinian fatalities
   during the period of the Second Intifada (2000-2005) and estimate a
   flexible discrete choice model for faction supported. We find some
   support for the outbidding hypothesis, the notion that Palestinian
   factions use violence to gain prestige and influence public opinion
   within the community. In particular, the two leading Palestinian
   factions, Hamas and Fatah, gain in popularity following successful
   attacks against Israeli targets. Our results suggest, however, that most
   movement occurs within either the secular groups or the Islamist groups,
   but not between them. That is, Fatah's gains come at the expense of
   smaller secular factions, while Hamas's gains come at the expense of
   smaller Islamic factions and the disaffected. In contrast, attacks by
   the Palestinian Islamic Jihad lower support for that faction.},

Abstract = {Drawing on Michael Barnett and Raymond Duvall's concept of institutional
   power, this article presents the empirically ascertained asymmetries
   created by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to investigate the Uruguay
   Round from a power standpoint. The argument is that developing
   countries, especially least developed nations, only accepted the WTO as
   a choice for the lesser of two evils. They are worse-off with the WTO
   trade regime, in contradiction to the positive-sum view of normative
   settings laid out by mainstream International Relations (IR) since the
   1980s. The concept of institutional power is broken down into the
   sub-categories of `go-it-alone' power, market power and forum-shifting
   power to demonstrate how the United States and the European Communities
   relied on their huge markets to shift the forum in charge of
   intellectual property and impose on developing countries a choice
   between accepting the WTO Agreement and being denied access to the
   world's two largest markets. Developing countries thus rationally became
   members of an organisation that entails absolute losses to them. The
   argument that institutions such as the WTO are desirable because they
   are agreed to does not reflect the realities of power and is ultimately
   an ideological stance that precludes mainstream IR from grasping how
   institutions (re)produce inequalities.},

Abstract = {The transfer of some decision-making authority from the domestic to the
   supranational arena as a result of the establishment of the World Trade
   Organization (WTO) in 1995 potentially changed domestic policy dynamics.
   The WTO agreements reflect the trade policy concerns addressed in the
   Uruguay Round in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This article applies
   and adapts historical institutionalism to explain how international
   organizations may constrain and facilitate certain domestic policy
   options. It demonstrates that, while the WTO legal framework has become
   more receptive of environmental sustainability concerns, the social
   sustainability concerns that were increasingly entering the debate over
   biofuel policies were not easily accommodated, and this was seen as a
   constraint on the content of the European Union's (EU) policy adopted in
   2009. Only the environmental dimension of a broader concept of
   sustainability was included in the policy design.},

Title = {Political rationality vs. technical rationality in China's target-based
   performance measurement system: The case of social stability maintenance},
Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Performance measurement is not only a technical tool but also a product
   of politics. Therefore, examining the politics behind the implementation
   of performance measurement systems will yield important insights into
   the purposes, designs, and outcomes of those systems. This study
   investigates how the political function of China's performance
   measurement system affects it technical rationality. Drawing evidence
   mainly from the policy area of social stability maintenance, this
   article argues that these systems are in a paradoxical situation in
   China. On the one hand, the techniques of performance measurement are
   greatly improved when there is a political need to implement such
   systems in local governments. On the other hand, the very fact that they
   have a political function interferes with their functioning in a
   rational, effective manner. The article concludes by suggesting that one
   must examine both the political rationality and technical rationality
   underlying government performance measurement systems so as to
   understand their values and limitations. In the case of China, the most
   important function of performance measurement is to ensure local policy
   compliance. Although such a design causes problems in practice most
   notably, pernicious gaming behavior that seriously harms public

Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},

Volume = {34},

Pages = {49-61},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Performance measurement (PM) has been widely used in China's public
   sector to enhance performance and ensure accountability. Like in other
   countries, PM in China is an arena of political management and
   manipulation by which political priorities are articulated and political
   loyalty and responsiveness are sought. This paper develops a
   regime-centered analytical framework to understand the political nature
   of China's PM. It identifies major political structures that influence
   the adoption and functioning of PM in China, including the unified
   political and administrative system, the Chinese developmental state and
   its performance legitimacy strategy, the unitary but decentralized
   intergovernmental systems, and the bureaucratic culture and informal
   rules. Despite their constraining effects, these structural attributes
   of the Chinese political system fundamentally account for the rise and
   popularity of PM in China. (C) 2015 Policy and Society Associates

Title = {IS OUTPUT PERFORMANCE ALL ABOUT THE RESOURCES? A FUZZY-SET QUALITATIVE
   COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF STREET-LEVEL BUREAUCRATS IN SWITZERLAND},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {93},
Number = {1},
Pages = {177-194},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article refines Lipsky's assertion that lacking resources
   negatively affects output performance. It uses fuzzy-set Qualitative
   Comparative Analysis to analyse the nuanced interplay of contextual and
   individual determinants of the output performance of veterinary
   inspectors as street-level bureaucrats in Switzerland. Moving `beyond
   Lipsky', the study builds on recent theoretical contributions and a
   systematic comparison across organizational contexts. Against a
   widespread assumption, output performance is not all about resources.
   The impact of perceived available resources hinges on caseloads, which
   prove to be more decisive. These contextual factors interact with
   individual attitudes emerging from diverse public accountabilities. The
   results contextualize the often-emphasized importance of worker-client
   interaction. In a setting where clients cannot escape the interaction,
   street-level bureaucrats are not primarily held accountable by them.
   Studies of output performance should thus consider gaps between what is
   being demanded of and offered to street-level bureaucrats, and the
   latter's multiple embeddedness.},

Title = {Doing things with numbers: The Danish National Audit Office and the

Volume = {34},

Abstract = {Like the Supreme Audit Institutions of many other OECD countries, the
   Danish National Audit Office has stepped up its performance auditing of
   public administrations and agencies in order to ensure that they provide
   value for money. But how do performance audits contribute to making
   state institutions change their conduct? Based on the case of the Danish
   National Audit Office's auditing of the quality of teaching at Danish
   universities, this paper seeks to show, first, that the quantification
   and, by the same token, simplification of the practices subjected to
   performance auditing are key to understand how SAIs render complex
   activities amenable to assessment. Secondly, the paper seeks to show how
   the quantification of the quality of university teaching contributed to
   make academic staff and universities, groups that have a large room of

Abstract = {Further integration in the European Union (EU) increasingly depends on
   public legitimacy. The global financial crisis and the subsequent euro
   area crisis have amplified both the salience and the redistributive
   consequences of decisions taken in Brussels, raising the question of how
   this has influenced public support for European integration. In this
   contribution, we examine how public opinion has responded to the crisis,
   focusing on support for monetary integration. Interestingly, our results
   show that support for the euro has remained high within the euro area;
   however, attitudes are increasingly driven by utilitarian
   considerations, whereas identity concerns have become less important.
   While the crisis has been seen to deepen divisions within Europe, our
   findings suggest that it has also encouraged citizens in the euro area
   to form opinions on the euro on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis of
   European economic governance, rather than relying primarily on national
   attachments.},

Abstract = {This study shows that the increased incentive structures from and the
   more intense socialization process with the European Union (EU) since
   the launch of European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) have not translated
   into a higher level of democratic development in Eastern ENP countries.
   However, on the long run (1991-2010), the EU democracy promotion in the
   region under consideration appears to be largely consistent. In
   addition, a content analysis of Progress Reports released by the
   European Commission on the implementation process of European
   Neighbourhood Policy Action Plans (ENPAPs) reveals that some Eastern
   neighbours of the EU have attempted to consider in their reform agendas
   the democracy-related objectives of these documents and that some have
   also sought to adopt international democratic instruments as required by
   the ENPAPs. Though the record is far from satisfactory on norm
   internalization, content analysis of Commission's Reports suggests that
   one should acknowledge a modest democratization role for the EU.},

Abstract = {This article studies the relationship between the big five personality
   traits and political ideology in a large U.S. representative sample
   (N=14,672). In line with research in political psychology, openness to
   experience is found to predict liberal ideology, and conscientiousness
   predicts conservative ideology. The availability of family clusters in
   the data is leveraged to show that these results are robust to a sibling
   fixed-effects specification. The way that personality might interact
   with environmental influences in the development of ideology is also
   explored. A variety of childhood experiences are studied that may have a
   differential effect on political ideology based on a respondent's
   personality profile. Childhood trauma is found to interact with openness
   in predicting ideology, and this complex relationship is investigated
   using mediation analysis. These findings provide new evidence for the
   idea that differences in political ideology are deeply intertwined with
   variation in the nature and nurture of individual personalities.},

Abstract = {Bailouts sponsored by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are famous
   for their conditionality: in return for continued installments of
   desperately needed loans, governments must comply with austere policy
   changes. Many have suggested, however, that politically important
   countries face rather weak stringency. Obstacles to testing this
   hypothesis include finding a measure of political importance that is not
   plagued by endogeneity and obtaining data on IMF conditionality. We
   propose to measure political importance using temporary membership on
   the UN Security Council and analyze a newly available data set on the
   level of conditionality attached to (a maximum of) 314 IMF arrangements
   with 101 countries over the 1992-2008 period. We find a negative
   relationship: Security Council members receive about 30 percent fewer
   conditions. This suggests that the major shareholders of the IMF trade
   softer conditionality in return for political influence over the
   Security Council.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes what the drivers of contestation of secondary
   powers vis-a-vis the regional power are, differentiating therein between
   structural, historical, behavioural and domestic such drivers. We argue
   that in regions characterized by relative stability where major
   interstate violent conflicts are unlikely, as is the case in South
   America, secondary powers rely mainly on soft-balancing mechanisms
   vis-a-vis the regional power. Whereas Brazil's foreign policy behaviour
   is key to South American secondary powers being induced to contest the
   country's powerhood, the choices that the foreign policy elites of those
   secondary powers make regarding what the specific expression of soft
   balancing is to be are influenced by certain domestic groups. Empirical
   examples are given of how Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Venezuela as
   secondary powers unfold these domestic drivers, which shape their
   different ways of soft balancing Brazil. The article thus explains why
   some secondary powers rely more on institutional binding, others on
   economic statecraft, or buffering, while others contest by offering and
   building alternative leadership proposals.},

Abstract = {How have recent changes to US asylum law altered who gets asylum? We
   investigate whether the changes wrought by the Illegal Immigration
   Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) and the Real ID Act
   changed the decision making of immigration judges in asylum cases. We
   find, contrary to much of the commentary surrounding both IIRIRA and
   Real ID, that immigration judges became more likely to grant applicants
   asylum. Furthermore, we find that those applicants who are most at-risk
   of persecution in the countries they are fleeing are also the applicants
   most likely to be granted relief a fact that became increasingly true
   with the implementation of IIRIRA and Real ID.},

Abstract = {Recent research suggests that transitional justice interventions may be
   essential to advancing post-conflict reconciliation in societies that
   have been deeply divided by histories of gross human rights abuses. In
   Northern Ireland, a uniquely `piecemeal' approach to the past emerged
   following the Belfast Agreement combining an array of discrete
   truth-recovery and justice initiatives to address the abuses of the
   Troubles. One of the most important of these interventions has been the
   Bloody Sunday Inquiry, which in June 2010, released a Final Report of
   its findings regarding the controversial shooting deaths of 14 civilians
   in Derry/Londonderry on January 30th, 1972. This article provides a
   qualitative assessment of the degree to which the Inquiry has been able
   to advance crucial aspects of truth and justice for the events of Bloody
   Sunday and explores how these efforts have contributed to ongoing
   processes of reconciliation between Catholic/nationalists and
   Protestant/unionist communities in Northern Ireland.},

Abstract = {Reinhard Hohn's writings have provided the Nazi ideological discourse
   with a crucial synthesis of various models of anti-liberal modernity
   discussed in the Weimar era. Influenced by cultural pessimism, Hohn's
   intention to reverse the trend of the social development back to
   pre-modern community corresponded to an extreme attempt to prevent the
   decline of the west'. His communitarian law doctrine' connected
   Ferdinand Tonnies' sociology of community with the teachings of his
   right-wing counterparts, Jerusalem and Freyer. His constitutional theory
   correlated the political neighbourhoods' conceived by the leader of the
   Young German Order, Artur Mahraun, and Carl Schmitt's concrete orders'
   as the basis for the Third Reich's new social order. The common feature
   was the desire to overcome the atomized society of Hobbesian egoistic
   individuals'. For Hohn, the individualistic rationality had to be erased
   by a combination of forces from above - the Fuhrer - and below - closed
   communities obtained by re-structuring the social body into a net of
   neighbourhoods. This article shows the gradual transformation of Hohn's
   public law theory as he was trying to devise a social structure fitting
   the demands for a substantial' democracy and social justice. His final
   outcome was Fuhrerdemokratie, an anti-rationalist leadership legitimized
   by power relationships among members of exclusive communities.},

Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {115-125},
Abstract = {The introductory essay presents a locally-grounded theoretical framework
   for studying youth and everyday peace(building). Drawing on examples
   from fieldwork as well as insights from the articles to follow in the
   journal, the essay highlights three interrelated and overlapping spheres
   of inquiry. First, it makes the case for examining the age-specific as
   well as gender-, and other contextually-specific roles of youth as they
   relate to everyday peacebuilding. Second, the essay draws attention to
   how everyday peace is narrated by or through youth. It poses questions
   about what values, policies, and governmental structures are
   specifically being resisted and rejected, and how peace is
   conceptualised and/or hidden in the narratives of youth. Third, along
   with these concerns, the nexus of global and local (including discursive
   and institutional) structures that facilitate, curtail, and curtain
   everyday peace (building) practices are important to identify and
   evaluate for their impacts on the roles and ideas of youth. In proposing
   this theoretical framework that recognises the complex and multiple ways
   youth are engaged in their everyday worlds, this essay asks how we can
   engage this recognition within knowledges and practices of everyday
   peace(building).},

Abstract = {Protracted conflicts over the status and demands of ethnic and religious
   groups have caused more instability and loss of human life than any
   other type of local, regional, and international conflict since the end
   of World War II. Yet we still have accumulated little in the way of
   accepted knowledge about the ethnic landscape of the world. In part this
   is due to empirical reliance on the limited data in the Minorities at
   Risk (MAR) project, whose selection biases are well known. In this
   article we tackle the construction of a list of `socially relevant'
   ethnic groups meeting newly justified criteria in a dataset we call AMAR
   (A for All). We find that one of the principal difficulties in
   constructing the list is determining the appropriate level of
   aggregation for groups. To address this issue, we enumerate subgroups of
   the commonly recognized groups meeting our criteria so that scholars can
   use the subgroup list as one reference in the construction of the list
   of ethnic groups most appropriate for their study. Our conclusion
   outlines future work on the data using this expanded dataset on ethnic
   groups.},

Abstract = {In contemporary Argentina, as in much of Latin America, politics is
   often found in the streets. In recent years it has bypassed traditional
   political party politics to bring day-to-day needs to the forefront
   through road blockades and cacerolazos (pot banging). These methods have
   been particularly successful in Argentina, not only in changing policy
   but also in bringing down administrations and politicians. They emerged
   from the 2001 Argentinazo's repertoire of assemblies, demonstrations,
   riots, looting, and sit-ins as the primary tactics for actors
   participating in protests in Argentina today. The continuity of
   resistance in Argentina is a concrete example of Foucault's notions of
   power and resistance in practice.},

   independence and boldness, sometimes putting it at odds with its fellow

   significant. Qatars relations with Saudi Arabia are very important to
   understanding its disposition toward Iran and role in the GCC. The
   government has worked on many occasions to broker negotiations between
   warring parties, and it has taken a welcoming approach to Iran. This
   engagement, in addition to its limited relations with Israel, has drawn
   criticism from neighboring Gulf states.},

Abstract = {Intervention cannot hope to be consequence-lite. Paul Bremer's
   dismantling of the Iraqi army left the way open for the formation of
   rival militias loyal to Iraq's territorial, ethnic and religious
   groupings. In order to extricate itself from the country, the coalition
   had to suppress these. Britain's ``time limit{''} on occupation of three
   months had already been exceeded. There was not even an
   interimconstitution on which a new regime might be based. Increasing
   lawlessness was making this task ever harder. I pondered the eventual
   division of Iraq into three parts, on the pattern of the West's division
   of Bosnia.

Abstract = {Authoritarian regimes use repression as an essential strategy to attain
   regime stability and survival. During the Arab Spring, different forms
   of repression have been employed. We argue that to explain this
   variation, three bundles of characteristics have to be taken into
   account: the setup of the regime, the state, and the challenge. As we
   assume that elites have a wider repertoire of strategies besides
   repression at their disposal, the analysis of repression has to be
   embedded in a broader framework of strategies of rule. Including
   specific forms and target groups of repression, we develop an
   explanatory model addressing the question of which repressive measures
   rulers utilize under which circumstances. The postulated relationship
   between repression and characteristics of the state, regime, and
   challenge are then tested in a comparative analysis of the reactions to
   the challenges arising with the 2011 uprisings in two very different
   Arab countries, Bahrain and Egypt. On the basis of these empirical
   findings, we propose a readjusted model explaining repression.},

Abstract = {This contribution examines the role of capitalism in anti-American
   terrorism. It uses two theoretical frameworks, both of which contrast
   the pacifying effects of higher levels of capitalist development with
   the potentially destabilizing effects of a transition towards
   capitalism, but differ with respect to their definition of capitalism,
   capitalism's interaction with anti-American terrorism, and its empirical
   operationalization. Using panel data for 149 countries between 1970 and
   2007 and providing further system-level time-series evidence, this
   contribution finds no support for hypotheses derived from the classical
   capitalist peace literature. There is no evidence that anti-American
   terrorism increases with external economic liberalization or that it
   decreases with higher levels of economic openness. By contrast,
   hypotheses derived from economic norms theory find empirical support.
   Conceptualizing capitalism as social market-capitalism, this article
   finds that higher levels of market-capitalism are associated with less
   anti-American terrorism, while the process of marketization fuels it.
   Consistent with expectations from economic norms theory, the
   destabilizing effects of the marketization process may stem from the
   violent opposition of antimarket interest groups that have benefited
   from the pre-market order to the economic-cultural change initiated by a
   transition towards a market economy. These interest groups deliberately
   target the USA as the main proponent of market-capitalism,
   globalization, and modernity, where anti-American terrorism serves the
   purpose of consolidating their societal position, rolling back
   pro-market reforms and limiting the perceived Americanization of their
   communities. This contribution's findings suggest that the USA may
   ultimately become a less likely target of transnational terrorism
   through the establishment of market economies, but should not disregard
   the disruptive economic-cultural effects of the marketization process in
   non-market economies.},

Booktitle = {RACE IN THE AGE OF OBAMA, PT 2},
Series = {Research in Race and Ethnic Relations},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {77-99},
Abstract = {Purpose - Many African Americans cheered the election of President Obama
   in 2008 with the hope he would cause an easing of the pain of economic
   and political barriers to collective black progress in America. This
   chapter assesses the role of President Obama in addressing these issues.
   Approach - The Presidential Bully Pulpit is presented as a framework for
   addressing racial inequities. Properly used it can bring keen attention
   to issues a president deems important for consideration by the American
   public. Socio-historical texts and secondary data are used.
   Findings - Data are presented to show how racial discrimination
   continues to affect African Americans during the age of Obama. These
   include housing discrimination, employment discrimination, and racial
   profiling. This chapter shows Mr. Obama has not used the office of the
   presidency as a bully pulpit for addressing these racial inequities.
   Rather he has tended to use the bully pulpit to chastise blacks,
   especially black males.
   Also discussed are some promising developments challenging racism that
   have emerged from his administration, primarily from the Department of
   Justice, and how President Obama could use the bully pulpit more
   productively.
   Originality - This chapter presents a contradiction in the actions of
   President Obama. While he seldom uses the bully pulpit to push his own
   legislative agendas or to push toward solutions to relieve racial
   inequities in society, he does use the bully pulpit to criticize black
   males.},

Abstract = {I wrote the following paper for a book on social movements, but I was
   still preoccupied by the questions that motivated my earlier work. A
   common claim was that everything was being globalized so that the
   nation-state could no longer be the main focus for political action
   (especially action that might challenge the neo-liberal or capitalist
   agenda). There had been a shift in radical politics in favour of social
   movements that were unconnected to political parties, with fields of
   action that engaged people personally but extended globally. In
   principle, such movements were unlimited in their reach. What then could
   be said about local self-government or community control, given that the
   nation-state itself seemed to be losing its power? Did it mean that
   local action was more important, or less? What sort of local autonomy
   was realistic? What kinds of action were called for? My sense was that
   we did not have the categories we needed to answer these questions. We
   were misled by all the standard ways of thinking about political
   matters, including the ones invoked by radicals and progressives. The
   latter were struggling to free themselves from the orthodoxies of
   Marxism and Keynesian welfarism (often described as ``social
   democracy{''}) and to develop new forms of politics, both in terms of
   ultimate objectives now more environmentalist and feminist than before -
   and methods of engagement - now both personal and political, and local
   and global, rather than simply national. Unfortunately, old ways of
   thinking that arose from a particular ``ontology of the political{''}
   (as I later put it) got in the way of the creative action required. In
   this essay, I began with the idea of a social movement by then central
   to many people's understandings of what progressive or radical politics
   could be like - and tried to show how it is burdened by an inappropriate
   and unrealistic set of assumptions. I tried to lead the reader, step by
   step, toward a different understanding of the problem of politics. I
   ended up in a global hyperspace, but I also implied that there are
   particularly important political opportunities at the juncture of
   municipalities and movements. What are the implications of that for
   local self-government or the right to the city?},

Abstract = {Here I try to apply some of the ideas I developed in chapter 7 to the
   Canadian case, initially by challenging the idea that ``cities{''} are
   just creatures of the provinces. I appeal to various historical,
   sociological, and geographical facts to show that the way we actually
   live is at odds with the way the state is imagined to be. There is an
   array of democratic possibilities implicit in our practices of
   self-government, but most of them have not been recognized, despite the
   fact that they are implicit in the principles of a ``free and democratic
   society,{''} which are supposedly enshrined in the Canadian
   Constitution. I am addressing myself to people who are committed to
   those principles and who believe that the Constitution protects them.
   Although I am sceptical about modern constitutionalism, I am prepared to
   accept it as a ground for discussion here. I try to show how it implies
   something quite different from what is usually supposed. For the most
   part, I stick to the standard terminology about local government and
   keep my proposals for constitutional change relatively modest.},

Title = {Implementing `new' norms? Examining `john school' policies in the United
   States},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {278-296},
Abstract = {In the United States, norms are located in the foreground of policy
   debates. To consider how they inform and emerge through policies, this
   paper examines `john schools,' where men arrested for prostitution
   solicitation attend a class to learn about the consequences of their
   actions. Based on multimethod qualitative research with two john schools
   (Project Respect, in Brooklyn, NY, and the Offender Program in Phoenix,
   AZ), I argue that normative dissonance characterizes this contentious,
   moralityoriented policy. While john schools may be designed to reflect
   and enforce particular norms, these norms are continually complicated
   and contradicted as they are implemented and communicated to the
   policy's target population. Therefore, although a new norm emphasizing
   male responsibility for women's victimization in prostitution motivated
   and informed Project Respect's and the Offender Program's design, this
   norm is continually challenged in practice. While the john schools'
   speakers deployed consequential and behavior change discourse to
   discourage the men from soliciting, they also presumed the men would
   solicit again, and they variously cast women who engage in prostitution
   as victims and criminals. The remainder of this paper considers some of
   the broader lessons we may learn from these john schools about norms and
   policy in the United States.},

Abstract = {We develop a theory of the effect of top management succession on the
   performance of public organizations. The theory is rooted in the
   fundamental characteristics of an organization's publicness: ownership,
   funding, and regulation. We construct the concept of publicness fit-the
   match between the organization and the leader's previous managerial
   experience. We argue that the effect of publicness fit on performance
   depends on the balance of adaptation benefits and disruption costs,
   which in turn depends on the prior performance of an organization. We
   propose a research agenda to empirically evaluate propositions developed
   from the theory of publicness fit.},

   Nations Security Council's decision-making towards the Libya crisis},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {31},

Pages = {369-387},
Abstract = {Russia's behaviour in the United Nations Security Council remains poorly
   understood. Applying principal-agent insights, this article analyses the
   Russian abstention towards Resolution 1973, which authorised
   intervention during the 2011 Libya crisis. Introducing a triangle of
   delegation, it shows that preferences diverged regarding the means and
   aims of the intervention. The article also investigates the information
   asymmetries which characterised the decision-making and indicates that
   this affected the Russian capacity to control the North-Atlantic Treaty
   Organization (NATO), which implemented Resolution 1973. It argues that
   Russia can only effectively control such a UN-authorised intervention by
   using, or threatening to use, its veto power.},

Abstract = {If rationalism reflects human confidence in relying on pure logic and
   the abstract value to design or improve human systems, Confucianism was
   no less enlightened during the early Zhou Dynasty than the Renaissance
   and modernity in Europe or early Republican China in the 1910s through
   the 1930s. Amidst the atmosphere of cultural reformation in modern and
   contemporary China, the argument that Confucianism could be a case of
   super-rationality is virtually unintelligent. Gongsun's annoying skill
   of debating was aimed at trivializing all names, each after their proper
   and unrepeatable contextualization. Stability or equilibrium desired by
   Confucian rationalism, as well as mainstream International Relations
   (IR), could not be valued in Gongsun's debate.},

Title = {The Uncertian Security. Human security 1994-2014},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {73},
Number = {1},
Pages = {7-28},
Abstract = {Twenty years ago the release of the UNDP report New Dimensions of
   Security stimulated what was already a sprawling debate on security.
   This article explores the status of human security today as a complex
   and diverse field of knowledge. In four steps I discuss the flexibility
   of the concept, the emphasis on subjectivity, contextual and holistic
   understandings of security as well as how human security is part of an
   ethical and interventionist foreign policy in the post-cold-war era. I
   argue that human security as a field of knowledge is characterized by
   tension. A key tension is between an analytical approach to insecurities
   and social organization on the local level and analyses of human
   security as a rhetorical tool legitimizing peace-/war-making. Exploring
   the symbolic power in the vague and abstract notion of human security,
   how it is represented and employed in concrete contexts, is one approach
   to critical analysis in this field.},

Title = {Orchestration by design: the G20 in international financial regulation},
Booktitle = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AS ORCHESTRATORS},
Year = {2015},
Pages = {88-113},
Abstract = {The G20 has emerged as a central player in global financial regulation,
   but it does not easily fit existing governance models. What kind of
   governance power can the G20, an informal institution with no legal
   personality, no inherent technical expertise or infrastructure and no
   resources, exert? Moreover, faced with a global economic crisis, why did
   states work primarily through the institutionally weak G20 rather than
   through a stronger international financial institution? I argue that the
   concept of orchestration captures a good deal of how the G20 exercises
   governance and why it is attractive to states. Although it has no
   capacity of its own, the G20 is an increasingly focal actor within a
   large regime complex, with the power to convene and enlist intermediary
   bodies to carry out common regulatory goals. At the same time, only
   moderate convergence of state interests on regulatory goals helps
   explain why states pursue orchestration within the institutionally weak
   G20. Its design allows states to engage in regulation softly and
   indirectly, while avoiding sovereignty costs associated with more formal
   institutions. This chapter analyzes three cases of the G20 at work as
   orchestrator, in the areas of economic surveillance, banking regulation
   and accounting standards. The conclusion considers the implications of
   orchestration for the effectiveness of global financial regulation.},

Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {53},
Number = {3},
Pages = {274-293},
Abstract = {Exclusionary rhetoric often emerges in the context of political
   competition in Africa, but why are anti-immigrant strategies used by
   politicians in some transitional democracies and not others? Drawing on
   broader comparative literature, this article proposes three conditions
   under which politicians are likely to `play the immigration card': when
   the costs of immigration become concentrated for key interest groups;
   when embracing anti-immigration rhetoric will divide the support base of
   an opponent; and when the backing of anti-immigration groups is
   necessary to build a winning electoral coalition. A comparative case
   analysis of Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana provides preliminary support for
   these hypotheses.},

Abstract = {By arguing that an interdisciplinary approach must be chosen whenever an
   international phenomenon touches on separate disciplines, this article
   illustrates such a necessity by using the case of the analysis of the
   evolving codification of foreign investors' responsibilities. A
   literature review demonstrates that the analysis of this phenomenon
   necessitates taking into account the content and the application of
   international instruments as well as relations of power between the
   actors involved. Given that such explanatory factors are respectively
   the objects of analysis of International Law and International
   Relations, this analysis requires an interdisciplinary approach and
   ultimately contributes to consolidate the relevance of International
   Studies.},

Abstract = {The relationship between EU foreign policy and national foreign policies
   of the member states is changing due to various factors: the entry into
   force of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009 and subsequent creation of the
   European External Action Service (EEAS); the economic crisis in Europe;
   and shifts in the global balance of power. The article explores these
   new dynamics in light of two cases, Estonia and Finland. It examines why
   the two countries support further integration in the area of foreign
   policy and what determines the limits of their support, applying
   rationalist and constructivist approaches. From a rationalist
   perspective, Finland and Estonia view the EU and the EEAS as a means to
   pursue national interests and make diplomacy more cost-effective; these
   aspects have become more important due to the economic crisis and
   changes in the international context. At the same time both countries
   value the EU as a security community and a source of solidarity, which
   points to the importance of socialization, as conceptualized by
   constructivists. However, the predominance of national foreign policy
   identity and an instrumental approach to the EU leaves limited space for
   deeper socialization, in spite of the new mechanisms of socialization
   introduced by the EEAS.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {22},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1489-1511},

Abstract = {Through policy feedback mechanisms, public policies can shape
   individuals' preferences for those policies. While research has focused
   on the direct link between policies and preferences, how policies alter
   individuals' preferences through indirect means remains less explored.
   Broadly, we argue that how micro-level factors influence policy
   preferences is contingent on the policy context, and specifically we
   contend that how economic risk influences preferences is contingent on
   the policy institutions that privatize social protection
   responsibilities. Using healthcare policy as the empirical context, we
   show that the level of privatization in national healthcare systems will
   colour how the risk of unemployment affects preferences for government
   healthcare.},

Abstract = {Targeted killing operations conducted outside Afghanistan have prompted
   debate regarding their lawfulness. For opponents of targeted killing
   operations, the debate tends to center on the number of civilians
   killed. Proponents respond by questioning the credibility and validity
   of the methods employed to determine the number of civilian casualties.
   This debate is important, but it also obscures the fact that the
   lawfulness of targeting killings is not determined by whether civilians
   were killed alone, while also lending legitimacy to unsubstantiated
   claims that the United States is engaged in an armed conflict with Al
   Qaeda and associated forces. This article classifies the hostilities in
   Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia. It then applies the applicable body of law
   to targeted killing operations in each of these respective states based
   on how the hostilities were classified.},

Abstract = {As Brazil becomes a visible player in international development,
   questions about accountability resonate loudly amidst wider scrutiny of
   the country's cooperation programme. This article takes the case of
   Brazil's flagship ProSAVANA programme in Mozambique to analyse changing
   accountability practices in Brazilian development cooperation. It
   documents the emergence of a transnational civil society movement
   contesting ProSAVANA, and analyses the interaction of this transnational
   movement with evolving domestic political contests surrounding Brazilian
   cooperation. This transnational mobilisation exposed weaknesses in
   Brazilian cooperation regarding transparency of action and lines of
   responsibility - contributing to shifts in both understanding and
   practices of accountability within Brazil. Campaigners called for the
   Brazilian government to accept greater responsibility vis-a-vis
   Mozambican constituents, and established direct lines of interaction
   between Mozambican and Brazilian civil society actors. To some extent,
   these links have enabled ProSAVANA target populations to communicate
   their preferences to Brazilian taxpayers, who can then call the
   Brazilian government directly to account. Such domestic-transnational
   accountability interfaces can contribute to tackling `broken information
   feedback loops' between donors and affected populations. However, the
   enduring significance of such changes will depend on the ability of
   emerging accountability practices to connect a broader range of
   stakeholders, both in Brazil and in Mozambique, and to establish
   constructive dialogue among competing visions and interests.},

Abstract = {The Polish case of Janowiec and Others v. Russia was initiated by a
   group of close relatives of victims of the 1940 Katy Massacres. Only in
   1990 did the Soviet Union recognize that it had perpetrated the
   massacres. The applicants in the Janowiec case alleged that the Russian
   investigation into the massacres, which commenced in 1990 as transparent
   proceedings but was terminated in 2004 in secrecy, cannot be considered
   effective under the Convention. Furthermore, inasmuch as the Russian
   military prosecutors and courts held that the Polish prisoners-of-war
   had disappeared in the spring of 1940 orif hypothetically killedthere
   might have existed just cause for such an execution, the applicants
   complained that such statements denied established historical facts and
   were tantamount to the denigrating and inhuman treatment prohibited by
   the Convention. The Grand Chamber judgment was not in the applicants'
   favor. By a majority, the judges either declined to hear the case on its
   merits or held that there had been no violation of the Convention,
   turningas the four minority judges wrote in their dissentthe applicants'
   long history of justice delayed into a permanent case of justice denied.
   This article is a personal account of the principal lawyer acting on
   behalf of the applicants in the Janowiec case.},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {The relationship between emergency legislation and government
   accountability for human rights violations has captured the interest of
   scholars and political officials since the War on Terror commenced.
   However, the use of emergency laws by democracies during a crisis is not
   novel. Through comparative analysis of the conflicts in Sri Lanka and
   Northern Ireland, this article illustrates that governments have used
   these laws as a means to avoid judicial accountability for decades.
   Moving beyond existing research that tends to offer normative models for
   achieving government accountability in the midst of crisis, this article
   provides findings on the precise conditions that constrain or enable
   accountability in the presence of restrictive laws. Drawing on
   historical institutionalism, the article argues that key features of the
   political context, including veto power, the degree of legal regulation,
   and opportunities for judicial challenges, shape the extent to which
   emergency legislation acts as a constraint on government accountability.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {63},
Number = {4},
Pages = {747-764},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A substantial literature claims that political parties compete over
   issues by selectively emphasizing favorable issues and avoiding issues
   emphasized by their opponents. In recent years, this understanding of
   issue competition has been challenged by empirical studies showing issue
   engagement to be the rule rather than the exception. To move the
   discussion beyond the descriptive question about degree of issue
   avoidance or issue engagement, this article offers a theoretical
   framework of issue competition that addresses central but hitherto
   neglected questions about which parties respond to which parties. The
   main implications of the theoretical framework are tested in a set of
   statistical time-series analyses of party interaction in Denmark
   covering more than 50 years, 24 major issues and 21 elections. These
   analyses offer support to the ideas that parties are more responsive to
   the issue agendas of parties from their own party family than to the
   issue agendas of non-family parties and that large mainstream parties
   are more responsive than niche parties to the common issue agenda of the
   other parties in the party system.},

Abstract = {In a step-level public-good experiment, we investigate how the order of
   moves (simultaneous vs. sequential) and the number of step levels (one
   vs. two) affects public-good provision in a two-player game. We find
   that the sequential order of moves significantly improves public-good
   provision and payoffs, even though second movers often punish first
   movers who give less than half of the threshold contribution. The
   additional second step levelwhich is not feasible in standard Nash
   equilibriumleads to higher contributions but does not improve
   public-good provision and lowers payoffs. We calibrate the parameters of
   Fehr and Schmidt's model of inequality aversion to make quantitative
   predictions. We find that actual behavior fits remarkably well with
   several predictions in a quantitative sense.},

Abstract = {Up until about 2000, most of the work on gender and international
   relations (IR) was nonpositivist in nature. Since 2000, there has been a
   burst of positivist gender/IR scholarship, much of it quantitative. This
   work has addressed several important areas in IR, including terrorism,
   interstate war, human rights, civil war, violence against civilians,
   public opinion, international norms, globalization, and others. Much of
   this work has developed new data, advanced theory, and employed rigorous
   empirical methods. This article surveys this positivist scholarship. It
   discusses how positivist and nonpositivist gender/IR work complement
   each other. This article makes recommendations about directions for
   future scholarship on gender and IR.},

Abstract = {Resilience has gained substantial traction in international politics of
   late. This scholarship has sparked debates concerning the meaning of
   resilience and how scholars should go about studying it. Scholars
   attuned to Michel Foucault's governmentality thesis argue that
   resilience is a product of contemporary neoliberalism and constitutes a
   strategy permitting states to abdicate responsibility in times of
   crisis. The overarching objective of this article is to tell a different
   sociopolitical story of the connections between resilience and
   international politics. In mapping International Relations (IR) scholars
   working on resilience, the gist of the argument presented here is that
   although resilience may be in some instances a neoliberal device for
   governance, it has a wider range of meanings as well. By setting out a
   different narrative of resilience, this article opens the possibility of
   an analysis that sees the emergence of resilience in international
   politics holding great promise for renewing and deepening current IR
   debates, including securitization, international interventions,
   vulnerability, resistance, and the political use of myth.},

Abstract = {Research Highlights and Abstract Using Northern Ireland as a case study,
   this article provides the first nationally representative and systematic
   study of victims' views on how to deal with the past; Focusing
   specifically on Northern Ireland, it both investigates and provides a
   comprehensive account of the marked divisions between the various
   religious groupingsProtestants, Catholics and the non-affiliatedin terms
   of a range of truth recovery mechanisms to deal with legacy of its
   violent past; It empirically investigates and validates two key
   predictorsperceptions of victimhood and general attitudes towards the
   pastin determining the source of these divisions It outlines the
   implications of our findings for other societies emerging from conflict.
   Truth recovery mechanisms have become a cornerstone of peacebuilding
   efforts in societies emerging from conflict. Yet, to date, the view of
   victims in post-conflict societies concerning such arrangements remains
   highly anecdotal and often second-hand in nature. Mindful of this
   omission and using Northern Ireland as a case study, this article
   investigates the views of victims towards a range of mechanisms to deal
   with the legacy of Northern Ireland's violent past. Based on the 2011
   Northern Ireland Social and Political Attitudes Survey, the results
   suggest some marked divisions in relation to this issue, with victims
   within the Catholic community being significantly more supportive of
   such initiatives than either Protestants or those with no religion.
   Moreover, while perceptions of victimhood emerge as the key predictor of
   attitudes among Protestants and the non-affiliated, general opinions on
   how to deal with the past are the key determinant of views among members
   of the Catholic community.},

Abstract = {Policy scholars and the public alike are concerned not only with the
   actions policymakers take in the legislature but also with the money
   that enables policies to reach the legislative agenda. A significant
   portion of these funds come from individual donors. We examine how
   appeals from public policy organisations influence donation behaviour.
   Existing research studies the effectiveness of appeals in isolation, but
   few studies consider the competitive environment in which these appeals
   occur. With nearly 1.5 million nonprofit organisations in the United
   States, Americans face many competing appeals for their limited funds.
   We develop a theoretical account of the effects of competing appeals on
   donation behaviour and test our theory with a large experimental study
   across two Midwestern states. Our results suggest that negative
   emotional appeals, rather than increasing total donation behaviour,
   increase the proportion of donations directed towards the soliciting
   organisation. Furthermore, two competing appeals cancel out one another.},

Abstract = {South Korea and Singapore display distinctive patterns of social
   provision. The Singaporean welfare state has served as the primary
   provider of social infrastructure and services, whereas the South Korean
   welfare state has developed its primary role in supporting income
   maintenance. These differences are not well accounted for in the
   existing literature, which focuses on similarities between the two
   regimes. This paper shows that deep institutional legacies in the two
   countries' respective financial structures powerfully shaped their
   unique social policy instruments. In South Korea, where financial
   openness was low and firms relied on relationship-based financing, the
   corresponding long-term perspectives on production and employment
   encouraged the private provision of welfare-related infrastructure and
   services. In Singapore, where firms have relied heavily on arm's length
   financing, the corresponding flexible investment and employment
   perspectives encouraged the utilization of private income maintenance
   arrangements. Each country's government prioritized the mode of social
   provision that the firms were less willing to engage in. These findings
   suggest that financial liberalization may be an important determinant of
   welfare regimes in developing countries.},

Abstract = {Using a nationally representative survey, this article examines how
   citizen satisfaction with one public institution, public schools, is
   shaped by normative expectations regarding what goals schools ought to
   pursue. We expand extant literature on the role of expectations in
   shaping satisfaction, which typically focuses on performance
   expectations, by exploring goal expectations. Using a constant sum
   allocation exercise, we find that individuals typically express one of
   two distinct preferences for what goals schools ought to pursue-an
   academic focus versus a well-rounded focus. We then show that
   individuals holding these different goal expectations express different
   levels of satisfaction when viewing the same school performance data.
   Our results suggest that policies disproportionately focusing on a
   single goal or expectation may alter public satisfaction, which could
   negatively influence ongoing support.},

Abstract = {I suggest that rescaling might be a response to network failure. In
   order to describe a network's modes of governance, I borrow the idea of
   `disciplines of control'. This framework is applied to the Brazil Grows
   Together (BCJ) case, a policy aimed at pregnant women and early
   childhood care in a state in Brazil. I show that constituency pressures
   at state level led to rescaling, and higher selectiveness. Subsequently,
   network managers steered vertical communication, and promoted broader
   inclusion of stakeholders. I conclude the article by suggesting general
   mechanisms that govern rescaling within the network governance
   framework.},

Abstract = {This article challenges the assumption that ethics committees introduce
   democratic control in policy areas where scientific expertise and
   ethical concerns collide. The claim is that politicians or bureaucrats
   are likely to resort to the use of ethical expertise when they face a
   specific type of dilemma: the impossibility, on the one hand, of
   yielding a consensus on controversial value-based issues via the
   democratic route and the need, on the other, to legitimize controversial
   policy choices in these areas. The article examines this dynamic with
   regard to the European Union's medical biotechnology policy, a contested
   policy domain where ethical specialists are awarded expert status. The
   article finds that establishing ethical experts as a new category of
   expertise alongside scientific experts actually bolsters the
   technocratic domain in areas where it is contested, thus reinforcing the
   authority of experts and bureaucrats in the policy process, rather than
   democratic control.},

Abstract = {Theory on the use of information technology in military operations
   assumes that bringing together units in an information network helps
   units to work together. Decentralized command systems such as mission
   command have been proposed for these networks, so that units can adapt
   to changes in their turbulent working environments. Others have proposed
   centralized command systems that permit higher organizational levels to
   closely direct military operations. This article uses Perrow's (1984,
   1999) Normal Accidents Theory to propose that increasing
   interdependencies between units in information networks places
   incompatible demands on the design of networked military operations. It
   is concluded that networked military operations require decentralized
   command approaches, but only under the condition that interdependencies
   between modules of networked units are weak rather than tight. This
   precondition is essential for retaining control over networked military
   operations.},

Abstract = {Critical engagement with security has become a vibrant area of research,
   giving birth to distinct subfields such as Feminist Security Studies and
   Critical Terrorism Studies. However, a growing number of critical
   scholars have begun to question the achievements of this agenda in
   recent years. They point out how critical discourses on security take on
   the guise of a new orthodoxy and become complicit in the reproduction of
   existing power relations. Some go so far as to declare the ``death{''}
   of critical security studies. In this article, I review these emergent
   debates on the bottleneck faced by critical security studies and
   elaborate on the critiques voiced about the current state of the field.},

Abstract = {Using data from the 2011 British Social Attitudes survey (n=3,311), this
   article compares British public opinion of the purposes and successes of
   the Iraq and Afghanistan missions. Public acceptance of military
   deaths/injuries, the accuracy of public estimates of military fatalities
   and how these differ according to opinions of the missions are
   determined. It is found that the British public is doubtful of the
   missions' achievements and cynical about their purposes. Perceptions of
   the campaigns were associated with the accuracy of estimations of UK
   military fatalities, and the acceptability of military deaths/injuries.
   Implications for social and political theory and British foreign policy
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {Based on the realist theory of international relations, this article
   analyses whether Germany has any incentives to seek (regional) hegemony.
   It concludes that under the current systemic circumstances - in which
   the country's survival is ensured by the United States - Germany has no
   reason to become a hegemon, which is normally a strategy to escape the
   perils of the anarchic international system. Germany can and does focus
   on the pursuit of its national interest in fields other than security.
   Unless the international system faces dramatic change, German foreign
   policy behaviour is unlikely to evolve anytime soon.},

Abstract = {Over the past two decades, the proponents of ``New Security Studies{''}
   have developed a wide-ranging and influential critique of strategic
   studies and their contribution to the study of international security
   and, more generally, international relations as a whole. They commonly
   charge that the rationalist and materialist foundations at the
   epistemological core of strategic studies undermine the field's ability
   to capture the most puzzling aspects of international security and
   international relations. However, this vigorous and influential
   challenge has not been seriously addressed so far. I argue that
   strategic studies remain largely immune to the broadeners' claim and
   will respond to their epistemological objections.},

Abstract = {This article explores the relationship between states' past military

   come to their aid when the terms of their alliance require intervention.
   Following Leeds, I argue that decisions to honor or violate alliances
   depend on changes that have occurred since the signing of the alliance
   and various factors that affect the expected costs of honoring the
   alliance. What I add to this approach is an exploration of whether and
   how a state's performance in prior interstate wars sends signals about
   its likely military effectiveness in the current war. I argue that
   superior records of military performance signal to allies that their
   potential costs for intervention will be lower than they would be with a
   less effective ally. I use an outcomes-based measure of military
   effectiveness to predict when states will violate or honor their
   alliances.},

Abstract = {Modern communication technology is emerging rapidly, with tremendous
   social implications. The key innovations introduced by this technology
   include the increased pervasiveness and the rich nature of digitally
   transmitted information, and a new type of network structure over which
   it is disseminated. The articles in this special issue present
   theoretical and empirical research on the relationship between
   communication technology and political conflict and violence. There are
   different pathways through which this can happen: technology can
   facilitate collective action, but at the same time give governments the
   opportunity to censor content and gather intelligence about dissidents.
   Also, audience effects can be introduced by the rich and instant
   transmission of information from conflict regions. The contributions to
   this special issue can be divided into three groups. A first group of
   articles looks at the effects of old' communication technologies with
   state-of-the-art methods, which is necessary to see if the effects of
   modern technology really differ. A second category of articles focuses
   on new' communication technologies, and try to assess their effect on
   conflict both theoretically and empirically. The third and last category
   reverses this question, and looks at the reflection of war and violence
   in (traditional and new) media channels.},

Abstract = {The article examines how global trends related to militant Islamism have
   influenced patterns of homegrown terrorism in Canada. It seeks to
   understand how an evolving movement has shaped three case studies, two
   cases of homegrown terrorism, the case of Momin Khawaja, the ``Toronto
   18{''} plot, and the emerging trend of extremist travelers. Recognizing
   the notable gap in the literature, a growing number of cases of
   homegrown terrorism and extremism in Canada suggest that further study
   is required. The article asks why Canadians choose to participate in
   this movement and why militant Islamist movements are actively
   recruiting them.},

Abstract = {In this article, it is shown that citizen process preferences are
   complex and include several dimensions. The argument relies on data from
   a representative sample of Spanish citizens (N=2,450) to assess these
   dimensions. Using confirmatory factor analysis as well as Mokken
   analysis, it is shown that citizen process preferences capture support
   for three different models: participatory, representative and
   expert-based. The relationships between these dimensions (where the
   opposition between representation and participation stands as the
   clearest result) and the substantive and methodological implications of
   these findings are discussed.},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {The paper draws an analogy between the ancient Greek practice of proxeny
   and the representative role citizens with multiple affiliations may
   perform in modern-day democratic politics. In recent decades, we can
   witness a trend of decoupling the demos from residency and citizenship.
   This trend has two components. First, there is an increasingly lenient
   stance towards dual citizenship, which frequently goes together with
   offering political rights for non-resident citizens. Second, non-citizen
   residents are also increasingly granted political rights in local
   politics. The aim of this paper is to weigh the implications of this
   change for representative democracies, primarily by pointing out the
   potential role such citizens with multiple affiliations may play as
   diplomatic agents and mitigate the problem of external voice
   deficiencies.},

Abstract = {Eighteenth-century Britain displayed patterns of corruption similar to
   those of developing countries today. Reforms enacted in the late
   eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries eliminated many of these
   patterns. This article develops a theoretical argument that seeks to
   explain why the British elite enacted anticorruption reforms and
   provides evidence using a new data set of members of the House of
   Commons. The author argues that the shock that pushed the British elite
   from preferring the old corrupt regime to preferring the reformed one
   was an increase in government spending and a corresponding increase in
   the costs of tolerating corruption. Features unique to Britain},

Abstract = {A broad range of procedural mechanisms designed to promote public
   involvement in regulatory decision making have been instituted at all
   levels of government. Depending upon the literature one consults, one
   could conclude that these procedures (1) enhance regulatory stringency
   by fostering access by previously underrepresented groups, (2) reduce
   regulatory stringency by institutionalizing access by regulated
   industries, (3) could either increase or decrease stringency depending
   on the relative strength of organized interests in the agency's external
   environment, or (4) have no effect. This study investigates whether
   mechanisms designed to promote public involvement in administrative
   rulemaking affect the stringency of US state environmental regulation.
   The results suggest that requirements to provide public notice of agency
   rulemaking do not have a significant effect on the regulatory compliance
   costs imposed on industry, but mechanisms that provide direct access to
   rulemaking processes serve to decrease these costs. This effect is
   evident for access both to the agencies promulgating environmental
   regulations and to external entities reviewing these regulations. For
   promulgating agencies, the effect does not appear to be conditional on
   the relative power of societal interests. The results provide some
   evidence, however, that political officials respond to the strength of

Abstract = {The article offers a first comprehensive overview of the workings of
   enhanced cooperation in the European Union (EU). Although this form of
   secondary law differentiation exists since the Amsterdam Treaty, it has
   only rarely been used so far. In the article, we formulate a theory of
   when and why enhanced cooperation is used in EU decision-making. Our
   theory builds on rationalist institutionalism focussing on institutions,
   preference constellations and the externality structure of policies. We
   test the plausibility of our theoretical claims by combining comparative
   and within-case analyses of nine cases. The empirical findings underline
   that the usage of enhanced cooperation depends to large degrees on the
   externality structure of the goods under consideration. The article ends
   with a short normative evaluation of the enhanced cooperation procedure.},

Abstract = {The protests against recent proposals for exploring and extracting shale
   gas in Romania are analysed. Examining the specific demands formulated
   by protesters, we investigate the articulation of a counter-discourse on
   the social control of natural resources and on the ecological risks
   involved in the shale gas industry. At the same time, the protests
   indicate a destabilisation of the post-communist neoliberal consensus by
   opposing the privatization and deregulation of natural resources. Using
   a critical political ecology framework, we identify the formation of a
   specific `technonatural' environment of shale gas, which includes
   economic interests, political decisions and ideological representations
   specific to the neoliberalization of natural resources.},

Abstract = {Many scholars argue that leaders' expectations about future shifts in
   the distribution of power can result in preventive war. If a leader
   expects her adversary to be significantly stronger in the future, the
   leader may choose to go to war with that adversary rather than bargain
   with a stronger adversary in the future. However, quantitative
   evaluations of this argument prove difficult, as they require a measure
   of leaders' expectations about future shifts in power rather than simply
   a measure of observed power. In this paper, we develop an empirical
   model of future power to create this measure. We then use that measure
   to evaluate the preventive war hypothesis. Our results support the
   preventive war hypothesis. Increases in a state's expected future
   probability of winning in war increase its probability of another state
   in a dyadic relationship initiating war against it.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {90-106},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This analysis of urban political violence across Africa considers why
   the proportion and frequency of conflict is increasing in urban areas
   while decreasing in rural areas. The decline of formally organized
   violence in predominantly rural areas, and the increase of more
   variegated forms of political opposition and conflict in urban zones, is
   interrogated through demographic and grievance-based explanations. Urban
   violence displays a range of agents, goals, intensities, and triggers
   and is alternatively regarded as a response to the lack of capacity and
   poor governance found in urban contexts, or to the changing demographic
   and political character of African states. Yet, the multiple,
   low-intensity forms of urban violence presentincluding militia attacks,
   communal contests, riots, and protestsindicate a change in the
   collective action capabilities and goals of modern conflict agents.
   These goals are themselves shaped by the experience of mounting urban
   grievances, but the ethnic and regional heterogeneity in urban areas
   prevents substantial collective action to counter the urban
   marginalization practiced by many African governments. Despite the
   low-intensity nature of urban threats, this compounded violence is a
   substantial security threat across developing states and is leading to
   the rise of the fragile city.},

Abstract = {Factors influencing managerial goals and decision-making processes have
   been debated for decades among public administration scholars. Previous
   literature has explained goal setting through theories of performance
   gaps, bureaucratic control, and isomorphic rationality. However, there
   exists no direct empirical test of these theories to determine which
   theoretical expectation may have more or less weight with managers when
   setting organizational goals. Using an original survey of university
   presidents, this study tests how public managers prioritize competing
   performance goals. Findings suggest that the goal setting decisions of
   these public managers is primarily driven by political control
   mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Since 1990, governments around the developing world have broken
   contracts made with multinational corporations (MNCs), but the incidence
   of breach varies across countries and over time. I argue that shared
   firm nationality is a key determinant of contract sanctity. MNCs are
   likely to divert investments or exit in response to breach with a firm
   of the same nationality but unlikely to react in ways costly to the host
   government otherwise. At the level of the economy as a whole, host
   governments gain permissive space to trade-off among national groups of
   investors when a greater diversity of foreign direct investment
   nationalities is present. I use national-, firm-, and dyadic-level data
   from 1990 to 2008 to demonstrate nationality-tied firm responses to
   breach. Counterintuitively, deeper integration with more nationally
   diverse MNCs enables more breach, as governments gain space to
   prioritize other goals over the property and preferences of foreign
   capital.},

Abstract = {Grounded in ongoing fieldwork inside Myanmar and amongst exiled Burmese
   communities, this article provides the first detailed account of the
   legal and human rights status of sexual orientation and gender identity
   minorities in Myanmar, with a focus on the abuses that they suffer. It
   also examines how Burmese activists overcame repressive laws to form an
   indigenous LGBT rights movement that has flourished since the start of
   the country's recent political transition. The research thus sheds light
   not only on future challenges for LGBT rights activism, but also on the
   broader political mobilization of human rights in a changing Myanmar.
   The research also has implications for states during democratic
   transition.},

Abstract = {The idea of demoi-cracy, which proposes to base democratic institutions
   not on one demos but on multiple co-existing demoi, has gained
   increasing popularity in debates about the democratization of the
   European Union. Existing models of demoi-cracy have, however, paid
   relatively little attention to the qualities that Europeans would need
   to possess in order to effectively participate in European politics as
   demoi-cratic citizens. This contribution seeks to identify these
   qualities; it then looks at empirical evidence to assess whether it is
   realistic that Europeans will, at least in the medium term, be able to
   live up to these requirements. While there are some indications that
   Europeans adapt their patterns of political participation to
   demoi-cratic requirements, the danger remains that institutionalizing a
   system of demoi-cracy would further accentuate the existing
   participatory inequalities.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the governance of the security sector in
   situations of armed conflict, and the role of effective governance in
   conflict management. Specifically, it seeks to examine whether the
   security sector has helped to advance conflict management objectives in
   Mindanao, or whether its activities have aggravated the situation. Using
   primary and secondary data, the article critically examines the role of
   the core security sector - the armed forces, the police, and also the
   auxiliary forces, the use of which was expanded during the Arroyo
   administration. Beyond that, it highlights the impact of the civilian
   actors, particularly clans and elected politicians with authority and
   oversight functions over armed units. The article explores the link
   between good security sector governance and conflict prevention using
   Maguindanao, a province in Mindanao in the southern Philippines, as a
   case study with a particular focus on the 2009 Maguindanao massacre.},

Abstract = {The EU is one of the most prominent democracy promoters in the world
   today. It has played an especially important role in the democratization
   of its Eastern European member states. Given the acknowledged success
   and legitimacy of EU democracy promotion in these countries, it could be
   expected that when they themselves began promoting democracy, they would
   borrow from the EU's democracy promotion model. Yet this paper finds
   that the EU's model has not played a defining role for the substantive
   priorities of the Eastern European democracy promoters. They have
   instead borrowed from their own democratization models practices that
   they understand to fit the needs of recipients. This article not only
   adds to the literature on the Europeanization of member state policies
   but also contributes both empirically and theoretically to the
   literature on the foreign policy of democracy promotion. The article
   theorizes the factors shaping the substance of democracy promotion-how
   important international `best practices' are and how they interact and
   compete with donor-level domestic models and recipient democratization
   needs. Also, this study sheds light on the activities of little-studied
   regional democracy promoters-the Eastern European members of the EU.},

Abstract = {The literature on women's descriptive representation has looked at the
   debate on open and closed lists as a choice between electoral systems.
   This article instead focuses on whether voters or the parties are biased
   against female candidates. Using data from six Estonian elections, the
   article finds that voters are not consistently biased against female
   candidates and open lists do not necessarily decrease women's
   representation. However, unknown and non-incumbent female candidates
   fare significantly worse than similar men. The analysis also shows that
   parties do not place women in electable positions on closed lists, and
   closed lists do not improve women's representation.},

Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},

Abstract = {Sovereignty and self-determination are central features of international
   relations and international law. The concepts are often depicted as
   conflicting and incompatible. In addition, the meaning, application and
   relevance of both concepts continue to form the subject of debate. In
   practice, they remain important, fiercely protected and centrally placed
   in conflicts concerning territorial integrity or political status. In
   this paper, we argue that our understanding of the concepts and their
   interrelationships can be enriched by looking past conventional and
   often rigid conceptualisations, instead placing more emphasis on the
   ways in which they are used in particular cases. The aim of this paper
   is to analyse how state sovereignty and peoples' right to
   self-determination are given meaning in state practice. The paper
   focuses on the case of Kosovo, and in particular statements submitted by
   36 United Nations member states to the International Court of Justice.
   Analysing the ways in which states use the concepts to rationalize and
   justify their position on the Kosovo case reveals several diverging and
   sometimes conflicting understandings that indicate a need to go beyond
   and problematize the clear-cut and inflexible conceptualizations that
   often shape the academic debate on the concepts of state sovereignty and
   peoples' right of self-determination.},

Abstract = {Transboundary water resources are very challenging to manage, generating
   numerous unresolved management issues. North America possesses two
   different spatial contexts in which transboundary water resource
   management issues exist, the arid U.S.-Mexico border region and the
   humid U.S.-Canada border region. Past work on the U.S.-Mexico border has
   explored a range of institutional arrangements by which resources are
   managed, with a special focus on both existing and new institutions and
   how the locus of policy formulation may vary across scale. In this
   article, I explore water resource issues in the U.S.-Canadian
   transboundary context through a comparative examination of management
   frameworks in the westernmost section on the U.S.-Canada border.
   Specifically, I examine the Cascadia Corridor region within which the
   Salish Sea and smaller nested watersheds lie, exploring how concepts of
   devolution, regionalization, subnational participation, and spatial
   scale have unfolded in transboundary management efforts in the region.},

Abstract = {While several existing datasets can help to address pressing questions
   on nonviolent resistance, data collection on nonviolent conflict
   involves several distinct challenges, including (1) conceptual
   distinctions between the absence of violence, non-violent behavior, and
   nonviolent direct action; (2) a systematic violence bias in mainstream
   news reports; and (3) incentives to misrepresent. As a way forward, we
   advocate (1) collecting data at multiple temporal and purposive units;
   (2) diversifying source materials; and (3) coding ambiguity as a
   meaningful substantive variable.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the performance of the Popular Health Insurance
   program (Segura Popular), focusing on the transformations and results
   achieved during the Calderon administration. Its most significant
   achievements include the level of coverage, with approximately 44
   million people, and the fact that financial allocations to state
   governments no depend on the number of subscribers. This policy still
   faces complex challenges in order to provide effective health services
   of standardized quality in the 32 states of Mexico. Meanwhile, financial
   protection in health has not been achieved, since personal expenditure
   in Mexico remains high (44\% of total health expenditure). We conclude
   with specific recommendations for strengthening government health
   services in the context of the potential universalization of the public
   health system.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {85-112},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to, prompted by a recent paradigm shift in the
   organizational sciences, to explore some antecedents of organizational
   learning capability, focusing on altruism and relationship conflict.
   Design/methodology/approach - To test the hypotheses, the structural
   equation technique was applied to data from a survey of Spanish firms
   with recognized excellence in human resource management.
   Findings - The results of this research show that, in these firms,
   altruism facilitates learning capacity both directly and indirectly
   (through relationship conflict). Relationship conflict is posited as a
   mediating variable that explains how altruism improves organizational
   learning.
   Research limitations/implications - The limitations of this study
   include excessive heterogeneity of the sample size and industrial sector
   and the type of firm included in the sample. Due to the potential
   benefits that altruism seems to have for organizations, future research
   could continue to investigate the consequences of altruism in
   organizations.
   Practical implications - Altruism provides organizations with a value
   that can facilitate organizational learning capability not only
   directly, but also by reducing relationship conflict. Altruism may offer
   organizations a tool they can use to improve their success in dealing
   with the challenges of today's uncertain and constantly changing
   economic environment.
   Originality/value - This study proposes a common altruistic approach
   that is far removed from traditional self-interested models in
   organizational literature. This study identifies altruism and
   relationship conflict as antecedents of organizational learning
   capability.},
