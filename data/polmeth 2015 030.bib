Abstract = {Greater theoretical consensus and cohesion could offer critical insights
   for the broader community of international relations scholars into the
   role that gender plays in spawning and sustaining processes of violence.
   This review essay examines the role of gender in generating and
   perpetuating violence and aggression, both in theory and practice. I
   make four central claims. First, in many studies involving the role of
   sex and gender in violence, specific causal models tend to remain
   underspecified. Second, a divergence in fundamental assumptions
   regarding the ontological basis of sex differences implicitly permeates
   and shatters this literature. Third, arguments that men and women are
   more or less likely to fight appear too simplistic; rather, it is worth
   considering that men and women may possess different motivations for
   fighting, and fight under different circumstances and for different
   reasons. Finally, systematic differences in the variant psychologies of
   men and women regarding the relative merit of offense and defense exert
   predictable consequences for public opinion surrounding the conduct of
   war in particular.},

Abstract = {We examine the `identity work' of manager-professional `hybrids',
   specifically medical professionals inmanagerial roles in the British
   National Health Service, to maintain and hybridize their professional
   identity and wider professionalism in organizational and policy contexts
   affected by managerialist ideas. Empirically, we differentiate between
   `incidental hybrids', who represent and protect traditional
   institutionalized professionalism while temporarily in hybrid roles, and
   `willing hybrids', who developed hybrid professional-managerial
   identities during formative identity work or later in reaction to
   potential professional identity violations. Questions about willing
   hybrids' professional identities led them to challenge and disrupt
   institutionalized professionalism, and use and integrate professionalism
   and managerialism, creating more legitimate hybrid professionalism in
   their managerial context. By aligning professionalism with their
   personal identity, and regulating and auditing other professionals,
   willing hybrids also position hybrids collectively as elite within their
   profession.},

Abstract = {Over the past two decades, governments have increasingly contracted
   private military and security companies (PMSCs) to support military
   operations in conflicts. However, many observers have argued that such
   companies are greedy market actors' or reckless mercenaries' and their
   level of performance very poor. A minority has defended them as security
   professionals. If market competition is present, the level of
   performance is high and positive contributions to the client's military
   operation can be expected. However, neither PMSC opponents nor
   proponents can account for the variance in the level of performance in
   three crucial cases - Sierra Leone, Iraq, and Afghanistan. This article
   argues that different market structures explain this variance. At least
   three ideal configurations exist: collaborative, competitive, and rival
   structures. These structures influence the level of performance. PMSC
   performance levels are expected to decrease from the first
   configuration, being positive, to the last, being negative.},

Abstract = {Increasing attention has been paid in both public administration and
   organizational theory to understanding how physicians assume a `hybrid'
   role as they take onmanagerial responsibilities. Limited theoretical
   attention has been devoted to the processes involved in negotiating,
   developing, and maintaining such a role. We draw on identity theory,
   using a qualitative, five-year longitudinal case study, to explore how
   hybrid physician-managers in the English National Health Service and the
   organizations they are situated in achieve this. We highlight the
   importance of saliency - how central an identity is to an individual's
   values and beliefs - inmanaging new identities. We found three differing
   responses to taking on a hybrid physician-manager role, with identity
   emerging as a mitigating factor for negotiating potentially conflicting
   roles. We discuss the implications for existing theory and practice in
   the management of public organizations and identify an agenda for
   further research.},

Title = {Extra Credit: Preferential Trade Arrangements and Credit Ratings},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {59},
Number = {2},
Pages = {291-302},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Credit rating agencies such as Moody's and Standard \& Poor's have
   considerable influence in the global economy. Nonetheless, we know
   little about the factors that affect these ratings, particularly factors
   under government control. We argue that participation in preferential
   trade arrangements (PTAs) can significantly improve national credit
   ratings by locking in liberal trade policies at home and abroad. This
   both ensures a stable stream of export revenues and represents a
   commitment to market-friendly policies of which the rating agencies
   approve. We test and find support for this hypothesis with an analysis
   of intra-PTA trade and credit ratings in 100 countries from 1971 to
   2008. As expected, intra-PTA trade consistently improves national credit
   ratings. However, this effect is only partially mediated by trade
   volatility and other economic variables, suggesting that the rating
   agencies' support for PTAs is partly ideological in nature.
   Interestingly, overall trade openness does not affect credit ratings
   once we control for participation in PTAs. It is thus the formal
   commitment to open trade, rather than the volume of trade per se, that
   improves credit ratings. Our results point to the growing importance of
   private actors in international governance, as well as to the
   interrelated nature of trade and financial regimes.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the alleged rollback of democracy by looking at
   the development of political cultures and the quality of democracy at
   the institutional level in three groups of European countries:
   longstanding democracies of western Europe, the first third-wave
   countries (Portugal, Spain and Greece) and the new democracies of the
   1990s in central and eastern Europe. Political culture and political
   structures are examined by bringing in two aspects: the actual
   performance of democracy and the normative foundations of the democratic
   order. Pulling in a range of empirical evidence - comparative population
   surveys, macro-level data on the quality of democracy and contextual
   factors - the findings show that the normative foundations of democracy
   have not been negatively affected over the last decade, either in terms
   of political culture or with regard to political structures. In
   contrast, performance-related measures of democratic practice and
   subsequent support for democracy reveal significant negative
   developments. Thus, if there is a rollback of democracy it is in its
   practice, not in its normative foundations. However, the alarm is set:
   Europe cannot afford a continuing performance crisis if it wants to
   avoid a legitimacy deficit of democracy that goes beyond dissatisfaction
   with performance to eroding the support for the normative base of
   democracy.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the influence of universities on Italian firms'
   probability to innovate. Using firm-level data, we focus on
   institutionalized technology transfer (TT) activities in universities,
   namely spin-offs, patents, and research contracts. Results show that TT
   activities play a significant role in the probability to innovate by
   Italian manufacturing firms located in the same province as the
   university. Nevertheless, the effect is not uniform: the contribution of
   university TT activities to the probability of firms' innovating is
   concentrated in certain territorial areas (North-East and Center) and
   sectors (science based and scale intensive) and among firms that are
   large.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the implications of recent developments in
   firm-based trade theory and empirics for trade policy and negotiations.
   While traditional trade theory focused on the country, and the new trade
   theory of the 1980s adopted the industry as the unit for analysis, the
   newest theory emphasizes the role of firms and firm heterogeneity in
   international trade. We describe insights from this reformulation of
   theory and the empirical literature that illuminates it. The realities
   of trade as now understood show the need for a new new trade policy.
   Evaluating trade at the level of the firm implies that overcoming
   firm-level fixed costs of trade and reducing uncertainty lead to
   increased trade along margins that generate the highest productivity,
   innovation and welfare gains. The traditional market access agenda ought
   now to be less important on the multilateral agenda than services,
   standards, trade facilitation, procurement and innovation policy. The
   analytical needs of a new new trade policy require new models and more
   access to firm-level data to formulate and evaluate the multifaceted
   impacts of trade policy.},

   Inequality in the American States},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {43},
Number = {2},
Pages = {163-187},

Abstract = {Prior literature has emphasized demographic, economic, and political
   explanations for increasing income inequality in the United States, with
   little attention paid to the role of state-level policy. This is despite
   great variation across states in both the level of inequality and the
   rate at which it is rising. This paper asks whether differences in state
   policy choices can help explain this variation; specifically, we
   examined a range of state redistributive policies enacted between 1980
   and 2005 and identified four common approaches likely to impact
   inequality: taxes on the wealthy, taxes on the poor, spending on the
   poor, and labor market policies. We used pooled cross-sectional
   time-series data and a fixed-effects model to assess the relationship
   between states' use of each policy approach and two measures of market
   income inequality: the Gini coefficient and the income share of the top
   1 percent. We find policies played a significant role in shaping income
   inequality in the states. For three of these four policy approaches, we
   found less inequality following expansions of state redistributive
   policy. Yet, for another, we identified the opposite pattern. These
   findings highlight the importance of state policy choices in shaping
   market inequality, and have implications for designing state policies to
   reduce income inequality since the success of these efforts depends on
   the policy approach used to redistribute income and wealth.},

Abstract = {The reported role of social media in recent popular uprisings against
   Arab autocrats has fueled the notion of liberation technology', namely
   that information and communication technology (ICT) facilitates
   organization of antigovernment movements in autocracies. Less optimistic
   observers, on the other hand, contend that ICT is a tool of repression
   in the hands of autocrats, imposing further restrictions on political
   and social liberties. We investigate whether the liberation- or the
   repression-technology perspective can better explain empirically
   observed patterns. To this end, we analyze two outcomes. First, we look
   at which autocracies are more likely to adopt and expand the Internet.
   In line with the repression technology expectation, we find that regimes
   aiming to prevent any independent public sphere are more likely to
   introduce the Internet. Second, we study the effects of the Internet on
   changes towards democracy. This analysis reveals no effect of the
   Internet on political institutions. These findings provide moderate
   support for the repression technology' perspective, and suggest that the
   Internet has not - at least in its first two decades of existence -
   contributed to a global shift towards democracy.},

Abstract = {While the call for national reconciliation as a way to avoid criminal
   trials for human rights violations has been a constant refrain in the
   discourse of the armed forces since the return to democracy in Argentina
   in 1983, it has been made from different positions and in response to
   diverse conjunctures. Changes in the rhetoric of national reconciliation
   have been employed as a political and extrajudicial strategy by both the
   military and civilians for 30 years. The proposal of national
   reconciliation has oscillated between the need to forget the long-term
   effects of an antisubversive war and a sort of duty to remember in which
   all Argentines are brothers in the evocation of collective pain. Aunque
   el llamado a la reconciliacion nacional como una manera para evitar los
   juicios penales por violaciones a los derechos humanos ha sido un
   estribillo constante en el discurso de las fuerzas armadas desde el
   regreso de la democracia en la Argentina en 1983, este se ha hecho desde
   diferentes posiciones y como respuesta a coyunturas diferentes. Los
   cambios en la retorica de la reconciliacion nacional han sido usados
   como una estrategia politica y extrajudicial tanto por los militares
   como por los civiles desde hace 30 anos. La propuesta de reconciliacion
   nacional ha oscilado entre la necesidad de olvidar los efectos a largo
   plazo de la guerra antisubversiva y una especie de deber de memoria en
   el que todos los argentinos estan hermanados en la evocacion de un dolor
   colectivo.},

Abstract = {This article examines a process, namely person-organization (P-O) fit,
   through which public service motivation (PSM) affects work-related
   stress, quit intentions, and organizational citizenship behaviors
   (OCBs). Using a sample of 671 professionals in the Egyptian higher
   education and health sectors, a mediation model is outlined and tested
   empirically using structural equation modeling. Our results show that
   PSM positively affected P-O fit, which in turn had significant positive
   associations with OCBs and negative associations with work-related
   stress and quit intentions. Although P-O fit explained a high proportion
   of mediation in the relationship between PSM, stress, and quit
   intentions, it only explained a low proportion in the relationship
   between PSM and OCBs. In general, our findings suggest that if public
   managers are desirous of improving employee experience at work, then
   achieving congruence between employees' and organizational values is
   important.},

Abstract = {Despite the observed frequency of firm lobbying, scholars attempting to
   explain this behavior have had little luck. Pushing away from theories
   that center on firm characteristics, this paper argues that firm
   lobbying can be best explained with a sociological model of competitive
   action. In particular, firms that perceive other firms to have influence
   on policy are more likely to lobby policy-makers. Since firms are both
   competitors in a free market and socially embedded actors, their belief
   in other firms' influence on policy pushes them to engage in similar
   behavior in order to increase profit and survive. I test this argument
   with a combination of quantitative analysis of survey responses from
   7247 firms in 40 countries from the World Bank Enterprise Survey and
   seven qualitative interviews with key firms in the Turkish Republic of
   Northern Cyprus. The results provide evidence for the hypothesis. This
   finding implies that scholars should not only take into account firm
   characteristics, but also explore the possible effects of how a firm's
   decision to lobby or not is influenced by its environment.},

Abstract = {The article analyses the effectiveness of EU conditionality regarding
   the enforcement of state aid rules in candidate countries during the
   pre-accession phase. Theoretically, conditionality should be able to
   overcome the reluctance of governments to implement control systems that
   restrict their ability to freely allocate subsidies. Effective
   conditionality can take two causal paths: first, it can directly
   influence the political decisions of governments in candidate countries
   regarding state aid, independent of any domestic institutional set-up;
   second, the reduction of state aid levels can be the indirect effect of
   the establishment of domestic monitoring authorities. To test these
   hypotheses, the article undertakes a multi-value qualitative comparative
   analysis (mvQCA) of the conditions for the reduction of annual state aid
   levels with regard to either the credibility of conditionality expressed
   by different stages in the accession negotiations, or domestic
   institutional factors such as the independence and operability of state
   aid monitoring authorities.},

Abstract = {Most of works dealing with the design of international commitments focus
   on the rationality of actors which allows them, among several options,
   to choose the one that responds optimally to their interests. Although
   these works represent a significant contribution to the analysis of
   states' behavior within international institutions, they neglect the
   role of intersubjective structures in the formation of states'
   interests. Curiously, there are few theoretical works that emphasize
   this epistemological limit of rationalist design of international
   commitments. Moreover, few case studies focus on this. The central
   purpose of this study is to show that while the design of international
   commitments is a rational choice on the part of states, this choice is
   primarily conditioned by states' identities. The case study is Chile's
   decision to join Mercosur as an associate member.},

Abstract = {How and why do regime type and interstate war affect government
   spending? We argue that a political leader allocates scarce resources
   between social and military expenditures as a function of their relative
   efficiency in securing her political survival. We derive four hypotheses
   concerning how mobilization for and demobilization from interstate war
   affects government spending differently in democratic and autocratic
   regimes. Compared to democracies, autocracies should increase military
   spending to a greater degree during wartime and decrease military
   spending to a greater extent following a war. Autocracies also should
   cut social spending more during an interstate war and increase social
   spending more during the process of demobilization from war than
   democracies. Our analyses of all states in the international system from
   1950 to 2001 yield support for our hypotheses.},

Abstract = {Social conflict in postcrisis Argentina can be divided into three kinds:
   that concentrating on land issues and the ability to subsist beyond the
   market, that confronting the environmental degradation resulting from
   mining, and that focused on the current dilemmas of labor and union
   organization. Workers did not disappear as collective subjects in
   conflict but, starting from their positions in production or in
   unproductive activities such as government services, challenged the
   dynamics of capital from both old and new social spaces. Their singular
   practices are part of the conflictual scenario that Our America is
   currently experiencing and of the resistance in the region that brings
   new urgency to living with dignity.},

Abstract = {This article compares the Europeanization of central government in four
   Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs): Estonia, Latvia, Poland,
   and Slovakia. Using a large N survey of ministerial civil servants, it
   finds that the Europeanization of central government is characterized by
   partial convergence. The scope of Europeanization is large and similar
   among CEECs, reaching widely and deeply into government ministries.
   Moreover, patterns of Europeanization are similar among CEECs: the same
   ministries form the `inner core' and `outer circle' of Europeanized
   ministries; only a small proportion of civil servants work full-time on
   EU issues and routinely engage in activities that `project' national
   policies at EU level. Compared to old member states, patterns of
   Europeanization show signs of convergence, while the scope of
   Europeanization is larger in CEECs.},

Abstract = {Liberal intergovernmentalism explains the politics to cope with the euro
   area crisis by the constellation of national preferences and bargaining
   power and by institutional choices designed to commit euro area
   countries credibly to the currency union. National preferences resulted
   from high negative interdependence in the euro area and the fiscal
   position of its member states: a common preference for the preservation
   of the euro was accompanied by divergent preferences regarding the
   distribution of adjustment costs. These mixed motives constituted a
   `chicken game' situation characterized by hard intergovernmental
   bargaining and brinkmanship. Whereas negotiations produced a
   co-operative solution averting the breakdown of the euro area and
   strengthening the credibility of member state commitments, asymmetrical
   interdependence resulted in a burden-sharing and institutional design
   that reflected German preferences predominantly.},

Title = {Still a `Force for Good'? Good International Citizenship in British
   Foreign and Security Policy},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICS \& INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {106-129},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Through an analysis of recent foreign policy discourse, in particular
   the UK approach to stabilisation, the article identifies distinctive
   similarities and continuities in the patterns of ethically-minded
   foreign policy, employed by the 1997-2010 Labour government and the
   Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition. The article makes a fresh
   engagement with the concept of Good International Citizenship, arguing
   for a much more overt engagement, by policymakers, with the concept, to
   help address some of the shortcomings associated with both Labour and
   the Coalition's attempts to incorporate ethical obligations into British
   foreign policy.
   This article examines the interaction between the idea of Good
   International Citizenship and the recent evolution of UK foreign and
   security policy. Good International Citizenship centres on the mediation
   of ethical commitments to national interest, to the promotion
   international order, and to the wellbeing of vulnerable non-citizen
   populations. Whilst ethical commitments to non-citizens have become
   overt components of British foreign policy, recent UK governments have
   struggled to reconcile these with commitments to the national interest
   and a stable international order. The article argues that the more
   direct affirmation of Good International Citizenship as a narrative and
   ethos of practice for UK foreign policy might help further the
   increasingly open discussion on the ethics and UK foreign policy. As a
   framework for dialogue and public debate, the concept provides a means
   by which ethical commitments in the traditionally closed world of
   foreign policy might be opened up to wider critical scrutiny.},

Abstract = {This essay explores how an international project between socialist
   nations unraveled transnationally. I explain the cultural shift toward
   taboo topics in the 1970s and argue that the shift was forced by two
   factors: first, the rise of a new generation of youngsters unaffected by
   World War II, and second the relative ease of transnational mobility.
   Starting in 1972, Poland, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia allowed
   citizens to travel more freely in a project called the borders of
   friendship. Exploring changes in the representations of World War II and
   what was later to be called the Holocaust in literature; in the
   celebration of rock music and film; and at international happenings, I
   argue that teenagers starting in the 1970s were raised with an increased
   sense of acceptance not only of their history but also their state.
   Critically, however, they also gained a greater sense of ideological
   irony: just as it became more acceptable to discuss taboo topics like
   Stalinization or the expulsion of Germans, so too was their
   understanding that deviations from strict ideology were more accepted.},

Title = {Englishness Politicised?: Unpicking the Normative Implications of the

Abstract = {Analyses a major shift in elite-political perceptions of the national
   identity of the English and current debates on Englishness. Is the first
   major evaluation of the arguments and implications of the McKay
   Commission. Gives a distinctive overview of academic and political
   debates about Englishness which assesses both sociological and
   political-science contributions and data, and argues the case for their
   better integration. Provides an original assessment of the implications
   of debates about Englishness for constitutional debates about the UK and
   normative arguments about national representation within the UK
   legislature
   This article draws attention to signs of an emerging consensus within
   British politics about the significance of recent shifts in the national
   identity favoured by the English. It focuses on the nature and
   assumptions of this emergent perspective, and critically evaluates the
   prevalent understanding of the politicisation' of Englishness and the
   different kinds of constitutional and normative argument that have
   become prominent in response to the resurgence of this form of identity.
   Drawing upon a bevy of recent social-scientific studies of the
   qualitative dimensions of Englishness, I make the case for a different,
   interpretive approach to politicisation', which reflects a richer and
   broader understanding of the causes and implications of the renewal of
   English nationhood. The article then explores the findings and
   underpinning arguments of one particular expression of this new
   consensus about the politicisation of English identitythe report
   published by the McKay Commission in March 2013. Attention is drawn to
   the particular blend of arguments that undergird its proposals for
   reform in relation to the West Lothian issue. Tensions between some of
   its main normative claims are, it is suggested, symptomatic of a deeper
   set of dilemmas facing the UK policy community.},

Abstract = {Community protests in South Africa are often described as violent.
   Drawing from newspaper articles, interviews with protesters and
   statements by public officials, this paper unpacks the meaning of
   `violent protest'. It shows that violence is both ambiguous and deeply
   entangled with democracy. On the one hand, violent practices may become
   a tool of liberation, promoting democracy by empowering marginalised
   groups. On the other hand, democracy may become a tool of domination,
   undermining dissent by constituting as violent those persons and actions
   that deviate from formal institutional channels. The analysis urges
   scholars to adopt a critical and nuanced view of violence.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},

Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {473-484},
Abstract = {Within current public, political and academic debates, `the middle
   class' functions as a major point of reference for assessing societal
   developments, welfare arrangements and even the society as a whole.
   However, by identifying the middle class with quantitative indicators
   and methods stemming from social structural analysis, it is largely
   neglected that class structures are social artifacts. By contrast, in
   this forum contribution, we want to provide reasons for investigating
   the nexus between middle class and welfare state as a discursive
   relation. We argue in favor of and provide first insights from a
   perspective that sheds light on how the middle class and its
   relationship with the welfare state are discursively constructed and how
   these practices shape the basic rationales of social policy design. We
   want to sketch how an interpretive perspective may contribute to the
   long-standing question of how the middle class is entangled with welfare
   policies.},

   Investment in Third-Party States},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},

Abstract = {Scholarship on the determinants of foreign direct investment (FDI) flows
   has produced valuable insights into the role of host state
   characteristics and home-host relations. This study draws attention to
   another factor in investment decisionsthe political and economic
   relations that home and host states maintain with third-party states.
   More narrowly, we focus on how investors respond to their home-state's
   imposition of economic sanctions against a trading partner. Greater
   economic integration has allowed states to use economic sanctions more
   frequently in recent decades. At the same time, economic sanctions are
   thought to have a distorting effect on global trade and financial flows
   as firms and governments adjust to new constraints. We argue that as
   firms at home in the sanctioning state respond to coercive measures
   against a trading partner by looking for alternative sources of profit,
   they will shift investments to states that can provide indirect access
   to the sanctioned economy. In particular, those states that are
   perceived as prospective sanctions-bustersmajor trading partners of the
   sanctions target or states with a history of sanctions-busting
   behaviorwill benefit disproportionately from the misfortune of others.
   We test this conjecture using data on US economic sanctions and global
   flows of US FDI from 1966 to 2000. The findings reveal that investor
   decision making in part responds to political developments beyond the
   home-host dyad.},

Title = {India and the Libyan Crisis: Flirting with the Responsibility to
   Protect, Retreating to the Sovereignty Norm},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {27-55},
Abstract = {India sat on the Security Council in 2011 when Resolution 1973 passed.
   This authorized NATO's intervention in the humanitarian crisis in Libya,
   which ultimately precipitated regime change. India's engagement with the
   crisis is analysed here with reference to various `identity-discourses',
   treated as `shapers' of India's specific policy-responses to the Libya
   crisis. This study finds that India flirted with the responsibility to
   protect (R2P) norm by abstaining when the Council voted on Resolution
   1973; New Delhi effectively declined to oppose measures to resolve the
   crisis which were broadly consistent with Pillar III of R2P (that is,
   the responsibility of the international community to protect threatened
   persons). But after reflecting on NATO's intervention, Indian leaders
   largely retreated to their traditional preference for relatively strong
   interpretations of the sovereignty norm, suggesting India's flirtation
   with R2P -or at least with Pillar III -was brief and unhappy. While this
   paper finds that `soft' liberal-democratic logic is very firmly
   established -Indian elites are committed to liberal-democratic
   principles, at least at home -it seems likely to take some time before
   the `hard' liberal-democratic logic which shapes Pillar III-consistent
   responses to humanitarian crises becomes influential in Indian
   policy-making circles. In other words, New Delhi is unlikely to become a
   wholehearted supporter of the R2P norm without profound changes to
   India's international identity, which in turn has negative implications
   for the wider effort to further entrench R2P, especially its
   controversial Pillar III.},

Abstract = {Macroeconomic policies in the Eurozone have been dysfunctional since the
   eruption of the financial crisis. The failure of these policies to guide
   the Eurozone out of the crisis has everything to do with the design
   failures in the Eurozone. In this article, we first remind the reader of
   the nature of these design failures. We then analyze how these have led
   to ill-designed macroeconomic policies. We then focus on the role of the
   ECB on correcting for these design failures. We conclude with some
   thoughts about monetary and political unification.},

Abstract = {Corporations have transformed citizenship in general and environmental
   citizenship in particular from a partnership of two into a troika. They
   have incorporated the language of environmental citizenship into their
   identities to the point that even the most consumption-oriented
   corporations claim to be model environmental citizens, true friends of
   the Earth. Whilst not everyone is convinced about the sincerity or
   effectiveness of that embrace, what is certain is that this development
   raises the potential to radically transform the practice of citizenship,
   and even its very meaning. This chapter explores the impact corporations
   have on the formulation and articulation of environmental citizenship,
   with attention to the main debates and controversies surrounding the
   concept of corporate environmental citizenship (CEC). The chapter also
   examines a particular conception of corporate citizenship with
   significant connotations for the future of environmental citizenship,
   the so-called supply-chain citizenship, exemplified here by Walmart. But
   before we delve into the environmental dimension of corporate behaviour,
   we must explore the question of whether corporations are more like
   citizens or more like governments.},

Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},

Abstract = {This article focuses on national identity in post-communist Czech
   Republic. It empirically analyses attitudes of national pride and ethnic
   exclusionism and their interrelations in the years 1995 and 2003.
   Comparative studies dealing with national identity usually refer to the
   Czech Republic as an exceptional case. By focusing on the Czech case,
   this study contributes to a better understanding of local variations of
   concepts such as national pride and ethnic exclusionism. Confirmatory
   factor analysis is used to establish the multidimensionality of national
   pride and ethnic exclusionism in the Czech Republic at two time points.
   The interrelationships between different dimensions of national pride
   and of ethnic exclusionism are analysed using structural equation
   modelling. Data are drawn from the International Social Survey Programme
   National Identity Modules 1995 and 2003. Following empirical results,
   the paper suggests more valid dimensions for the concepts of national
   pride and ethnic exclusionism in the distinctive Czech context and
   discusses their mutual relationships.},

   Efforts to date have proven unpopular among some of the other Gulf
   states, who worry about Riyadhs intentions, suggesting that it may be an
   overly ambitious endeavor. This in turn punctures the veneer of unity
   created by the Arab Spring and manifested, inter alia, in the shared
   opposition to Qaddafi and Assad.},

Abstract = {Oman maintains a generally neutral foreign policy that balances between
   the demands of various regional actors with which it seeks positive

   are its security ties. The pragmatic nature of the foreign policy of
   Oman can be attributed in part to its relative weakness and its
   geographical location at the head of the Arabian Peninsula side of the
   Straits of Hormuz. Thus in its view open relations with Iran are needed,
   in a manner that other Gulf states are not required.},

   sex-love-gift connections in the time of AIDS},
Journal = {REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Abstract = {Over the last decade, one of the most influential explanations for high
   HIV prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa is the existence of sexual networks
   characterised by concurrent partners. Recently, however, a growing
   number of scholars have challenged the evidential basis for the
   concurrency argument. While this dispute has led to a call for more
   sophisticated quantitative methods to measure concurrency, this article
   widens the discussion to emphasise the political economic roots and
   qualitative dimension of concurrent partnered relations. Specifically,
   the paper argues for the importance of situating concurrency within key
   historical processes and, to that end, gives special consideration to
   the growth of `transactional sex' - non-prostitute but material
   relations between men and women. Critics of the concurrency-HIV thesis
   have sometimes dismissed as anecdotal accounts of sex-gift exchanges in
   Africa. Yet by exploring through an ethnographic/historical lens the
   changing configuration of sex, love and gifts in South Africa, this
   article illuminates different manifestations of concurrency, including
   connections between concurrency and condom use.},

Abstract = {A year and a half into the Baghdad surge and the extra troops were still
   on the ground in Iraq. But there was hope. In June 2008 Barack Obama
   emerged as the strongest Democrat candidate to fight the forthcoming
   presidential election. In a speech on 15 July he was emphatic: ``I
   opposed the war in Iraq before it began, and would end it as president.
   I believed it was a grave mistake to allow ourselves to be distracted
   from the fight against al-Qaeda and the Taliban by invading a country
   that posed no imminent threat and had nothing to do with the 9/11
   attacks. Since then, more than 4,000 Americans have died and we have
   spent nearly \$1 trillion.{''} He pledged he would leave, and fast. It
   was to prove easier said than done.

Abstract = {This paper posits that the varied legacies of colonial rule and
   decolonisation can explain interstate variation in the
   institutionalisation of corruption in post-independence India. It
   concludes that the relative freedom from state capture after
   independence depended on two conditions: (1) the institutionalisation of
   bureaucratic autonomy prior to independence and (2) the survival of the
   disruption of decolonisation by an autonomous bureaucracy to be utilised
   by new representative governments following independence. These
   conditions were generally not met across India with the exception of the
   southern state of Kerala.},

Abstract = {Neither Yemen nor Somalia has the internal stability or the state
   capacity necessary to effectively contain local and national security
   threats within their borders, or to keep external threats out from their
   territories. This not only has led to a spill-over of their insurgencies
   into neighbouring countries, but has also led to the entrenchment of
   transnational criminal and terrorist organisations within their borders.
   Violent movements (such as Al Shabaab and the Houthis) operate in the
   same contexts as local branches of global terrorist groups (such as Al
   Qaeda), piracy networks and trafficking organisations. These various
   threats affect the entire Gulf of Aden region and are both thematically
   independent of one another and inherently interconnected. This chapter
   analyses each in turn to provide the reader with a better understanding
   of regional insecurity in this part of the world.},

Abstract = {The chapter examines the impact of the global financial crisis on the
   diversity of post-socialist welfare capitalist paths. It shows how
   global financial crisis in 2008 hit Estonia and Slovenia hard, prompting
   the most significant domestic debates over the appropriate role of the
   state since 1991. The crisis opened a window of opportunity for critics
   of each state's economic model to push for change: Estonian critics
   mobilizing for more active state intervention in the economy and
   Slovenian critics to push for further liberalization. The chapter finds
   that challenges to Estonia's neo-liberal model proved to be short-lived,
   with the crisis and entry into the Eurozone only solidifying Estonian
   elites' commitment to this path, whereas the Slovenian model has faced
   more significant challenges from above and below.},

Abstract = {One of the key dilemmas faced in organizing a state and society concerns
   the importance afforded to central and local goals and interests.
   Adaptation to demographic, economic, political, scientific and
   technological changes in the environment requires changes in the status
   and role of local self-government. Adding to this mix, the
   constitutional and administrative traditions of Serbia affect the
   establishment and development of local self-government. Therefore, the
   enhancement of the model of local self-government must be studied using
   the historical method, among others. This paper aims to provide an
   overview of the historical development of local self-government in
   Serbia from the period of Developed Feudalism up to the mid-1990s.
   Historical considerations and traditions are vital to sustaining a
   certain practice of territorial decentralization of state power and to
   envisaging future solutions for the effective territorial organization
   and models of local (self) government in accordance with the realities
   of the region.},

Abstract = {Given the association between informal residence and the occurrence of
   ``xenophobic{''} violence in South Africa, this article examines
   ``xenophobic violence{''} through a political account of two squatter
   settlements across the transition to democracy: Jeffsville and
   Brazzaville on the informal periphery of Atteridgeville, Gauteng. Using
   the concepts of political identity, living politics and insurgent
   citizenship, the paper mines past and present to explore identities,
   collective practices and expertise whose legacy can be traced in
   contemporary mobilization against foreigners, particularly at times of
   popular protest. I suggest that the category of the ``surplus
   person{''}, which originated in the apartheid era, lives on in the
   unfinished transition of squatter citizens to formal urban inclusion in
   contemporary South Africa. The political salience of this legacy of
   superfluity is magnified at times of protest, not only through the
   claims made on the state, but also through the techniques for protest
   mobilization, which both activate and manufacture identities based on
   common suffering and civic labour. In the informal settlements of
   Jeffsville and Brazzaville, these identities polarised insurgent
   citizens from non-citizen newcomers, particularly those traders whose
   business-as-usual practices during times of protest appeared as evidence
   of their indifference and lack of reciprocity precisely at times when
   shared suffering and commitment were produced as defining qualities of
   the squatter community.},

Abstract = {Theories of democratic decentralisation in democratising states suggest
   that such reforms will provide significant opportunities for parties in
   opposition at the national level by multiplying the arenas of political
   contestation. But this expected outcome may also depend on other
   contextual factors. This comparative study of recent municipal elections
   in South Africa and Zambia shows that parties in Zambia have been less
   likely to engage in municipal elections than those in South Africa. The
   article offers possible explanations for these different outcomes based
   on different factors that structure the competition for offices, as well
   as on the expected benefits of running for office. If local governments
   have few financial resources and limited policy jurisdictions, political
   and personal incentives for engaging in local politics are reduced.
   Hence, if there are concurrent elections, parties instead will tend to
   concentrate their efforts on winning offices at the national level.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This study compares filmic and televisual representations of
   fictional black presidents to white Americans' reactions to the advent
   of the United States's first African American president. My main goal is
   to determine if there is convergence between these mediated
   representations and whites' real-world representations of Barack Obama.
   I then weigh the evidence for media pundits' speculations that Obama
   owes his election to positive portrayals of these fictional heads of
   state.
   Methodology/approach - The film and television analyses examine each
   black president's social network, personality, character traits,
   preparation for office, and leadership ability. I then compare the
   ideological messages conveyed through these portrayals to the messages
   implicated in white Americans' discursive and pictorial representations
   of Barack Obama.
   Findings - Both filmic and televisual narratives and public discourses
   and images construct and portray black presidents with stereotypical
   character traits and abilities. These representations are overwhelmingly
   negative and provide no support for the argument that there is a cause -
   effect relationship between filmic and televisual black presidents and
   Obama's election victory.
   Research implications - Neither reel nor real-life black presidents can
   elude the representational quagmire that distorts African Americans'
   abilities and diversity. Discourses, iconography, narratives, and other
   representations that define black presidents through negative tropes
   imply that blacks are incapable of effective leadership. These hegemonic
   representations seek to delegitimize black presidents and symbolically
   return them to subordinate statuses.},

Title = {Welfare limbo? Social welfare and citizenship debates about New
   Zealanders living in Australia},
Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {53},
Number = {3},
Pages = {253-273},
Abstract = {For most of the twentieth century, New Zealanders could cross the Tasman
   Sea freely to live and work in Australia, with access to citizenship and
   social welfare benefits, similar to those enjoyed by Australians who
   moved to New Zealand. Migration was not difficult as the systems were
   similar. From 2001, however, while Australians living in New Zealand
   could still gain access to citizenship with social welfare benefits,
   many New Zealanders moving to live in Australia have been unable to
   become citizens and, despite paying taxes, cannot receive some social
   welfare benefits or have rights to permanent residence. Effectively,
   they are in welfare limbo. Clearly, Australian political processes drove
   changes to welfare eligibility for New Zealanders living in Australia.
   This `limbo' raises the question, however, as to whether New Zealand
   governments could have done more to protect the rights of New Zealanders
   living in Australia. This intriguing social issue has implications for
   other similar close nations in the Commonwealth managing political
   tensions and social prejudices in integrating supranational entities.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},

Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-57},
Abstract = {This article offers an analysis of the framing strategy of EU
   policymakers within the framework of the open method of coordination
   (OMC). It argues that the institutional embeddedness of agents has an
   impact on the way policy ideas are framed and maintained over time. The
   study interprets a multi-method, qualitative research project that
   analyzes the evolution of European Union higher education policy from
   2000 to 2011, a period in which the introduction of the OMC brought
   about drastic changes, making higher education, once a highly contested
   policy field, a cornerstone of the Lisbon Agenda. By combining framing
   theoretical insights with neo-institutional theory, we show that the
   framing strategy adopted by policy agents in the European Commission
   operates in two ways: first, the strategic adoption of frames increases
   the visibility of the higher education agenda at the European level and
   second, it serves as a means to take action in politically opportune
   circumstances, thereby paving the way for the development and
   implementation of new programs.},

   revolutions. First, each color would be an act of positioning which
   should have only reflect the formation of reality. Second, a color could
   not represent those who wear it. Third, a color was a trigger of emotion
   and the intellectual interpretation of rally was to spread a much
   broader implication to motivate further action. In short, the color
   revolution is not a revolution. The color signifies mutual estrangement
   as well as foregone civility. It does not designate liberalism incurred
   by the notion of revolution against the conservative authoritarian
   regime, nor sitedness in which hybridity is at best an embarrassing
   reality.},

Abstract = {This chapter explores the implications of patrimonial politics in the
   Dutch East India Company empire in the context of establishing a
   settlement at the Cape of Good Hope in southern Africa in the
   mid-seventeenth century. The Cape extended the reach of Company
   patrimonial networks with elite Company officials circulating throughout
   the Indian Ocean empire and consolidating their familial ties through
   marriage both within the colonies and in the United Provinces. These
   patrimonial networks extended to the Cape as elite Company officials
   created families locally or married Cape-born women. As the colony grew,
   the Company created a class of free-burghers some the wealthiest of whom
   were tied directly into elite Company patrimonial networks. But from the
   early eighteenth century onwards these elite Company networks came into
   conflict with the evolving free-burgher patrimonial networks with which
   they were in direct competition. This paper argues that local
   patrimonial networks can evolve in a settler colony that challenge the
   elite patrimonial networks of the imperial elite.},

Abstract = {Rationalist models of decision making typically follow the general form
   of desire+belief=action. But determining an actor's beliefs and desires
   often proves challenging. One set of theories turns to psychologyand in
   particular emotionsto uncover how emotions help to shape and strengthen
   beliefs. Some of this work establishes a fit between emotions and the
   rationalist paradigm. It holds that emotions account for more than
   irrational behaviors; they also serve as a source of rational belief.
   Feeling, it claims, is believing. I argue that if actors belive in the
   reasonability of their feelings, then this move is warranted. But a
   range of behavior defies this logic. Instead, I suggest that actors
   often find themselves torn between contradictory affective intuitions,
   on the one hand, and rational beliefs, on the other. In consequence,
   they hold rational beliefs, but their resulting behavior qualifies as
   irrational. I apply existing work on the distinction between belief and
   alief to make sense of this phenomenon. I illustrate my claims through a
   rereading of the security dilemmawhere irrational intuitions, in
   conjunction with rational beliefs, fuel conflict.},

Abstract = {How emerging powers perceive the predominant power in the international
   system is an important question in international relations and great
   power politics. This question is particularly important in the context
   of a rising China and its relations with the United States. While
   China's perception of the United States can be examined from many
   angles, this study focuses on Chinese official media perception by
   analyzing U.S.-related articles in the People's Daily from 2000 to 2010.
   Our data indicate that the People's Daily's overall attention to the
   United States declined while the overall image of the United States
   moved toward the positive direction. When breaking down the overall
   image by issue areas or dimensions, we find that the United States was
   primarily perceived negatively in the areas of political-ideological
   issues, military-strategic issues, and U.S. role in world affairs,
   whereas in the economic-trade and other issue areas, a favorable image
   of the United States appeared to be expanded. Key implications for
   U.S.-China relations are discussed in the conclusion.},

Abstract = {In societies emerging from conflict and violence, achieving a peaceful
   political settlement is an important goal. In most situations, however,
   achieving this goal is not enough to transform underlying conflicts
   rooted in history and identity. Rather, it is understood that what is
   needed in such situations is ongoing effort towards the transformation
   of underlying historical and relational conflict. But while high profile
   events such as truth commissions often become the public focus of a
   reconciliation process, in fact much of the effort towards conflict
   transformation takes place in lower profile dialogue processes. This
   article theorises a model of agonistic dialogue required for relational
   conflict transformation in divided and post-violent conflict societies.
   Described here as `sustained, intensive relational work', this model
   draws from theories of agonistic democracy to argue for dialogue
   processes that are focused on engaging across deep differences in ways
   that can facilitate an enlarged understanding among former enemies.},

Abstract = {The use of accounting expertise to shape voluntary sustainability
   reporting has been interpreted as an implicit form of financialization'
   whereby technical debates that promote profit maximization are
   privileged over corporate accountability. Research has yet to assess
   empirically how accounting expertise is deployed as a public practice'
   to influence sustainability reporting. To address this gap, I explore
   the emergence of the Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB), and the
   way it uses accounting expertise to shape climate change risk reporting.
   While it is clear that professional accountants are playing a more
   significant role in risk disclosure, the CDSB is a form of experimental
   governance' that exposes accounting expertise to uncertainty and
   contestation. Indeed, the CDSB reconstitutes a public space' within the
   field of accounting where the link between accounting standards and
   sustainability reporting is exposed to environmental politics rather
   than subverted into market-friendly debate.},

Abstract = {There has been a lively debate in Brazil in recent years, involving
   sectors of business, the labor movement, and academics, over
   deindustrialization and the future of the manufacturing sector. This is
   often linked to the growing relation between Brazil and China, which is
   now the country's most significant trade partner. Brazil has experienced
   relative deindustrialization in the sense of a declining share of the
   manufacturing sector in gross domestic product that is mainly
   attributable to the changes in the country's trade balance in
   manufactures. The direct and indirect impacts of China on Brazilian
   manufacturing have contributed to this relative deindustrialization and
   the primarization of Brazilian exports through competition in the
   domestic market and in exports. Nos ultimos anos, instaurou-se no Brasil
   um debate acirrado entre empresarios, academicos e sindicalistas sobre a
   desindutrializacAo e o futuro do setor manufatureiro. O fenomeno e
   frequentemente associado aos crescentes lacos entre Brasil e China, hoje
   o mais importante parceiro comercial do pais. O Brasil vem passando por
   uma relativa desindustrializacAo devida ao intenso declinio da
   participacAo do setor de transformacAo no Produto Interno Bruto.
   Atribui-se essa queda as mundancas provocadas pelos resultados da
   manufatura na balanca comercial. Os impactos diretos e indiretos
   exercidos pela China sobre o setor secundario brasileiro tem contribuido
   para essa relativa desindustrializacAo, assim como para a primarizacAo
   das exportacoes brasileiras por meio da competicAo no mercado domestico
   e nas exportacoes.},

Abstract = {European anti-austerity movements are challenging fundamental
   assumptions about the role of the market and the state. In Spain, the
   twin claims of the movements are a demand for real democracy' and an end

   argue that these demands are intertwined. Using critical discourse
   analysis, I explore the Platform of Those Affected by Mortgages'
   controversial escrache campaign to show how social movements actively
   resisting austerity measures transcend the specific issues around which
   they mobilise to contest hegemonic definitions of crisis and of
   democracy, laying the groundwork for the reconfiguration of Spain's
   political landscape.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the concept of human dignity is better
   understood as an essentially contested concept. Following Walter Bryce
   Gallie's original definition of essential contestability in 1956 and the
   subsequent additions made by several authors over the years, it argues
   that describing human dignity in such terms helps to explain not only
   the theoretical disagreements about the concept, but also its current
   place within the international legal regime. The essentially contested
   concept framework is therefore not only accurate in describing the
   global phenomenon of human dignity (the latter fulfilling the seven
   criteria set out by Gallie regarding this framework), but also useful in
   doing so. The article concludes that for human dignity to properly
   perform its supposed function, it needs to become decontested',
   something that can only happen following the recognition of its
   theoretical structure.},

Abstract = {This article examines how the informal sector, as a group of potential
   `free riders' for public welfare goods, relates to individual social
   policy preferences in low-and middle-income countries. The exclusion
   hypothesis proposes that a large informal sector lowers the preferences
   from formal workers and the middle-and high-income groups for social
   services to be provided by the state, and raises these groups'
   preferences for public welfare goods to become club goods. In contrast,
   the prospect hypothesis argues that formal workers, particularly the
   middle-income group, ally themselves to the informal sector to insure
   against the risk of future employment in informality. The study examines
   individual preferences for the provision of pensions and health care by
   either the state or private enterprises. The two competing hypotheses
   are tested with a hierarchical model using survey data from Latin
   America for 1995, 1998 and 2008. The findings offer support for the
   exclusion hypothesis.},

Abstract = {Scholars have argued that recruiting more women to office is an
   effective way to curb corruption; however, the more precise mechanisms
   underlying why this may be the case have remained unclear. We use
   meso-level theories to elaborate on the relationship and suggest that
   institutional logics mediate the effect of gendered experiences on
   corruption. We make two propositions: First, we suggest that the
   relationship between more women and lower levels of corruption is weaker
   in the state administration than in the legislative arena, because the
   bureaucratic administrative logic absorbs actors' personal
   characteristics. Second, we refine our institutional argument by
   claiming that the stronger the bureaucratic principles are in the
   administration, the less gender matters. We validate our theory using
   data provided by the European Commission (EC) covering the EC countries
   and original data from the Quality of Government Institute Expert
   Surveys, covering a larger set of countries on a worldwide scale.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the potential factors for the development of
   international terrorism in southern Africa. While the region has
   seemingly been spared the terror attacks that have ravaged most other
   parts of the continent, and the globe at large, it is not immune to
   these attacks. Using a survey of the Southern African Development
   Community (SADC) countries, particularly the Democratic Republic of the
   Congo, Mozambique, South Africa, Mauritius, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania,
   which illuminate some of the permissive factors, the article asks,
   largely, first, to what extent is southern Africa at risk of global
   terrorism? And, second, in what ways can southern African states reduce
   the risk of terrorism in the region? Broadly, the article contends that,
   like most developing countries, including those from other parts of
   Africa, there exist permissive, both root and trigger, factors including
   insecure borders, democratization challenges, poverty, urban centers and
   variegated forms of both sub-state and state terrorism, that could
   provide useful platforms for the growth of international terrorism.},

Abstract = {Analysts generally believe that a weaker currency primarily benefits a
   country's manufacturing and primary goods sectors. However, many of
   these industriesand the elected officials who represent themfrequently
   oppose legislation designed to combat the dollar's overvaluation
   relative to the Chinese yuan. I argue that legislators hesitate to take
   aggressive action on the exchange rate issue because doing so could lead
   to a disruption of the broader United States-China economic
   relationship. The threat of an economic conflict emerges as a
   particularly important consideration in the context of currency bills,
   where proposed legislation is linked to trade policy and other areas of
   international economic regulation. A Bayesian statistical analysis of
   legislative behavior on two recent exchange rate bills in the US
   Congress provides overall support for my hypotheses. Legislators with
   ties to business interests that rely heavily on the Chinese economy were
   morelikely to oppose the bills, while the strongest support came from
   legislators representing import-competing domestic producers. The
   results highlight the ways that economic interdependence shapes
   bilateral exchange rate politics in particular, and United States-China
   interactions more generally.},

Title = {Framing identity in Iran: Culture, conflict and the West},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {52},
Number = {5},
Pages = {549-566},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Foreign policy scholars do not often approach understanding the conflict
   between Iran and the West over the nuclear issue in terms of identity
   politics. Many observers would argue that strategic issues take center
   stage and drive the positions of the leaders on both sides. However,
   such a position assumes that leaders in Iran and in the West have a
   unified approach to the conflict. While a strategic approach might
   suggest that the trial agreement signed in the fall of 2013 resulted
   from Iran's economic desperation brought on by tightened sanctions,
   there remain hardliners within Iran who did not want to see cooperation
   with the West despite the potential for Iran's economic gains. We
   continue to see mixed reactions to the April 2015 framework agreement.
   Looking to the past (2005-2010) using a systematic, empirical approach
   to mapping these views offers greater understanding of the ways in which
   Iranian leaders viewed the nuclear negotiations with the West. In turn,
   what we learn from this period informs our effort to understand the
   negotiations as they continue today. Key findings are differentiation
   across the various leaders in terms of which strategies they use, as
   well as differentiation within each leader over time in the strategies
   they use. While observers largely agree that the nuclear issue has been
   elevated in Iranian politics, this analysis shows that there is actually
   much debate about what it means in terms of steps forward and
   orientation toward the West and demonstrates that we can create better
   tools to map these debates.},

Abstract = {This article asks how the UK and Sweden regulate, prevent, or mitigate
   the consequences of mortgage-related household eviction and
   repossession. Contrary to initial expectations, the findings show a
   growth and diversity in both regulation and social spending in the UK
   intended to address this social issue; something that has not occurred
   in Sweden. In the UK's liberal `regulatory welfare regime', the aim is
   to prevent the eviction and repossession of vulnerable borrowers who
   have defaulted on their housing loan. In the Swedish social democratic
   `regulatory welfare regime', effort focuses instead on minimizing the
   risk of default before it occurs rather than after the fact. These
   findings offer a more nuanced understanding of the relations between
   regulation and welfare more generally, demonstrating that regulation may
   be used as a form of social policy once the welfare state has failed, as
   a safety net of last resort.},

Abstract = {It is well recognized that military alliances can provide their members
   with important security benefits. However, less attention has been paid
   to the policy concessions states must grant others to enter into
   military alliances. To study this aspect of alliances, I develop a
   three-actor bargaining model of alliance formation that endogenizes both
   external threat and policy concessions. Specifically, a target state
   bargains with a potential defender over the concessions it must make to
   ally and then responds to a potential challenger. The model suggests
   that what is important for policy concessions in alliances is not just
   the power of the threatened state but its power relative to its
   challenger and how an alliance will change the distribution of power. I
   test implications of this model using data on promised policy
   concessions formalized in alliance treaties and find strong support for
   the hypotheses. More specifically, I find that states are willing to
   make more concessions in exchange for an alliance when they are unlikely
   to defeat their challengers alone and when their allies have a large
   effect on their probability of winning in war. These findings refine
   existing theories of alliances and offer the first large-N analysis of
   policy concessions in alliances.},

Abstract = {Idealized independent media function as watchdogs. Indeed, human rights
   non-governmental organizations have argued that media freedom will
   improve human rights. This makes sense intuitively, yet recent formal
   and empirical studies show that the effect of independent media varies
   across regime types. We explore the relationship among media,
   government, and citizen protest movements and employ a game-theoretic
   model to investigate how the equilibria vary depending on regime type
   and media independence. In terms of equilibrium, we find that media
   watchdogging is most active in autocracies (and not in democracies),
   especially when the government's perceived capability to repress public
   protest is declining. Uncertainty about the government's ability to
   repress plays a central role in accounting for the manifestation of
   media watchdogging in conjunction with public protest. Illustrations
   from Tunisia and North Korea are provided to highlight equilibria
   derived from the formal model that vary as a product of perceptions
   about the government's ability to repress.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},

Volume = {6},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {To understand leadership in international governance, I begin at the
   structural level with state actors. A simple framework that relies on
   state interests and material power can shed light on why powerful states
   take on leadership roles in some negotiations (e.g. arms control) but
   not in others (e.g. human rights). States attempting to cooperate to
   realize joint interests or solve problems often face a set of common and
   persistent obstacles. These obstacles, which I call `cooperation
   problems', can make otherwise beneficial cooperation difficult to
   achieve. I argue that the particular combination of underlying
   cooperation problems present in an issue affects a powerful state's
   desire to take on a leadership position with respect to the incidence of
   international cooperation - that is, agenda setting by putting forth the
   first draft of an international agreement addressing the issue and
   remaining in control of subsequent drafts. Because, from a policy point
   of view, the most interesting cases are those that involve distribution
   problems, I focus on the following two combinations of problems:
   distribution with coordination and distribution without coordination. I
   use the examples of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the Antarctic
   Treaty, the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and

Abstract = {This article examines the democratic impact of the UK coalition
   government's Transparency Agenda, focusing on the publication of all
   local government spending over 500 pound by councils in England. It
   looks at whether the new data have driven increased democratic
   accountability, public participation, and information transmission. The
   evidence suggests that the local government spending data have driven
   some accountability. However, rather than forging new `performance
   regimes', creating `armchair auditors', or bringingmass use and
   involvement, the publication creates a further element of political
   disruption. Assessment of the use and impact of the new spending data
   finds it is more complex, more unpredictable, and more political than
   the rhetoric around Open Data indicates. The danger is that the gap
   between aims and impact invites disappointment from supporters.},

Abstract = {Actors with joint beliefs in a decision-making process form coalitions
   in order to translate their goals into policy. Yet, coalitions are not
   formed in an institutional void, but rather institutions confer
   opportunities and constraints to actors. This paper studies the
   institutional conditions under which either coalition structures with a
   dominant coalition or with competing coalitions emerge. It takes into
   account three conditions, i.e. the degree of federalism of a project,
   its degree of Europeanisation and the openness of the pre-parliamentary
   phase of the decision-making process. The cross-sectoral comparison
   includes the 11 most important decision-making processes in Switzerland
   between 2001 and 2006 with a fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis.
   Results suggest that Europeanisation or an open pre-parliamentary phase
   lead to a dominant coalition, whereas only a specific combination of all
   three conditions is able to explain a structure with competing
   coalitions.},

Abstract = {This article summarizes recent trends in Croatia with regard to class
   analysis and class discourse. It traces the main currents both in
   academic debate as well as more broadly in the public sphere. Issues of
   class were sidelined with the outbreak of war and the rise of
   nationalism in the 1990s. Later, neoliberalism further weakened class
   and leftist discourse. Research on class has been sporadic and rare. New
   developments among a younger generation of leftist activists and
   scholars have begun to challenge the silence on class, but the main
   trends have not been reversed.},

   Organizations: An Exploratory Study},

Abstract = {Given that the performance of public-sector organizations is tied to the
   efficient use of knowledge, this exploratory study examined factors that
   influence knowledge acquisition by work groups in knowledge-intensive
   public-sector organizations. Based upon a review of the absorptive
   capacity and knowledge management literature, we defined knowledge
   acquisition as the change in the collective knowledge of groups over
   time. The amount of individual prior knowledge, and common knowledge
   among group members, managerial practices, and perceptions of knowledge
   applicability were identified as independent variables. Data were
   collected from 179 individuals representing 28 work groups in 7
   public-sector organizations. Using multi-level regression, we found that
   homogeneity of knowledge at the group level and perceptions of knowledge
   applicability influenced acquisition, but that, contrary to much of the
   literature in this domain, prior-related knowledge did not have such an
   influence. Middle-management practices moderated the impact of knowledge
   applicability, suggesting that middle managers provide contextual
   information that permits group members to better understand the
   relevance of external knowledge. Implications for practice include the
   importance of training staff in teams to build homogeneity of knowledge,
   and ensuring that middle managers understand the organization's strategy
   and their roles in the knowledge-utilization process. Implications for
   theory include the notion that prior knowledge can either encourage or
   obstruct knowledge acquisition.},

Abstract = {Testing social movement theory positing that radical organizations are
   ideologically driven at their core, but are supported by civilians who
   are driven by social factors, this research interrogates the disparity
   between radical group ideology and supporter belief set in the context
   of present-day Nigeria. Content analysis of randomly selected Boko Haram
   publications establishes the high, and increasing, levels of religiosity
   exhibited by the violent social movement itself. In contrast, a large-N
   survey of Nigerians conducted in 2012 and 2013 shows that high levels of
   religiosity do not significantly predict willingness to justify
   violence, commitment to non-state violent actors, or positive attitude
   toward Boko Haram among Nigerians as a whole, but rather the opposite.
   Given these findings, Boko Haram may be better understood within the
   tradition of radical extremist movements across the ideological
   spectrum, even while it frames its struggle as that of a distinctly
   religious movement.},

Abstract = {In 2013 Northern Ireland (NI) witnessed the most protracted period of
   public-disorder ever seen in the United Kingdom. After Belfast City
   Council voted to fly the Union flag in-line with the manner adopted in
   the rest of the United Kingdom, loyalist protestors blocked roads,
   attacked offices, and held marches through Belfast city center. During
   what became known as Operation Dulcet, police had to respond to the
   protests and violence, mindful of existing tensions in NI. This article
   reports on data collected from interviews conducted with officers
   involved in the policing of these events. The findings demonstrate that
   the police response was understood using narratives concerning the
   primacy of human rights, a focus on perceived proportionality, and
   ultimately, related to the potential violence linked to historic
   conceptions of community divisions in NI.},

Abstract = {As the financial economy has expanded beginning in the mid-1980s, it has
   done so in part by selling more products to individuals and households.
   Households have had more access to new forms of assets and debts and new
   ways to fund their lifestyles. This occurred at the same time that
   income inequality and job insecurity increased dramatically in the USA.
   We show that a more risk-taking culture that engages in more active
   financial management emerges amongst the middle and upper middle
   classes. We suggest that these households are feeling the effects of
   growing inequality at the top more acutely and they respond by changing
   how they think about their financial lives. For those lower on the
   socio-economic status distribution, financial strategies are more of a
   defensive strategy to get by. Those at the top embrace finance as an
   opportunity to preserve and extend their lifestyles.},

Abstract = {Networks of civil society organizations are a feature of the Eastern
   Partnership and the Union for the Mediterranean, the two strategies of
   the European Union (EU) for relations with the countries of the
   Neighborhood. We examine these structures as instances of
   interorganizational networks. We employ social network analysis and
   multiple regression to test empirically a number of hypotheses about
   these networks. Our results show that the networks are highly
   centralized around EU institutions, but we also find that gradually
   relations among all participants become more horizontal and cooperative,
   that EU institutions become less dominant over time, and that
   organizations from neighboring countries gain centrality. We also find
   that interorganizational cooperation is stronger in the southern than in
   the eastern Neighborhood.},

Abstract = {Ruta Mixteca is the name given to the circular migrations of indigenous
   farm workers between the Mexican state of Oaxaca and California long
   studied by Michael Kearney and his collaborators. Indigenous migrations
   to the United States have expanded in recent years as a result of the
   North American Free Trade Agreement and changes in Mexico's agrarian
   legislation that led to increased privatization of land and natural
   resources, dispossession of the traditional peasantry, and numerous
   local land- and resource-related conflicts. The Zapatista uprising
   stimulated the growth of a host of militant indigenous organizations,
   now also emboldened by constitutional changes that recognize the human
   rights of indigenous peoples according to international standards.
   Indigenous transnational migrations need to adapt to these changing
   conditions.},

Abstract = {After the fall of the Berlin Wall, military intervention in other
   people's wars spawned a new theme in international relations combining
   the desire to enhance conflict-solving mechanisms with ambitions for
   developing a true ``transformational diplomacy{''} capable of changing
   and improving political regimes in other countries. In the euphoria of a
   post-bipolar world, the enterprise seemed ambitious but promising; it
   turned sovereign convention on its head, but also revived the dual idea
   of a global police force and emancipation for the suffering. The
   culmination of this intellectual and political process was undoubtedly
   the central notion of the responsibility to protect, framed in 2001. Yet
   the results have been far from convincing. An end more than a means,
   with outcomes resembling exercises in power more than regulation, the
   practice has seen more than its share of failures and pernicious
   effects, and most of all, a huge disconnect with respect to the kind of
   new conflicts it is meant to resolve. The resulting disorder, often
   underplayed, raises three as yet unanswered questions about this
   approach : who has the authority to intervene, how, and why ?},

Abstract = {Almost all theories of multiculturalism (and similar differentiated
   rights) start by rejecting liberal state neutrality as unable adequately
   to address issues of diversity. In this article, I challenge this move
   and argue that neutrality has been wrongly characterised. Neutrality is
   an unrealisable yet still action-guiding political ideal that is not
   absolute. It only makes sense in relation to a particular range of
   things (in this case, people's ways of life), and needs to be sensitive
   to the changing nature of this range. Unlike neutrality as benign
   neglect', this allows it to be sufficiently neutral over time to
   changing ways of life. Yet difference sensitivity can be realised by
   either withdrawing support for all parties or actively assisting them.
   In the last part of the article, I argue that state neutrality should
   involve withdrawing support for favoured ways of life rather than
   actively recognising the various ways of life and identities of its
   citizens.},

Abstract = {The internet has been ascribed a prominent role in collective action,
   particularly with widespread use of social media. But most mobilisations
   fail. We investigate the characteristics of those few mobilisations that
   succeed and hypothesise that the presence of starters' with low
   thresholds for joining will determine whether a mobilisation achieves
   success, as suggested by threshold models. We use experimental data from
   public good games to identify personality types associated with
   willingness to start in collective action. We find a significant
   association between both extraversion and internal locus of control, and
   willingness to start, while agreeableness is associated with a tendency
   to follow. Rounds without at least a minimum level of extraversion among
   the participants are unlikely to be funded, providing some support for
   the hypothesis.},

Abstract = {US President Woodrow Wilson and Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd
   were separated by institutional contexts, relative power positions and
   decades in time. However, each confronted a similar dilemma - of
   reconciling rhetorical idealism with policy practicalities. Building on
   insights from studies of the US rhetorical presidency, we offer a
   framework highlighting the tensions between outside' moral appeals which
   raise expectations and the inside' technocratic rhetoric of policy
   administration. We argue that norms encouraging moral appeals have come
   to transcend institutional differences between presidential' and prime
   ministerial' systems. Despite the different contexts of the Wilson-era
   League of Nations debate and the Rudd-era carbon tax-Kyoto
   controversies, we argue that pressures to speak in two voices'
   engendered credibility gaps that undermined each leader's congressional
   and parliamentary support. In concluding, we suggest that this analysis
   supports a more nuanced appreciation of the rhetorical imperatives that
   can impede policy efficiency - and the need to limit tendencies to

Abstract = {Studies of venue shopping have typically analyzed the case of an
   individual advocacy group or issue campaign rather than comparing venue
   strategies across multiple groups. Moreover, this literature focuses on
   interest groups and advocacy coalitions whose principal mandate is to
   influence public policy. Using original data, we test theories of venue
   selection among nonprofit organizations that report engaging in policy
   processes but the majority of which do not self-identify as an advocacy
   group. Our analyses explore the where of nonprofit advocacy across three
   different venue types: branch (executive, legislative), domain
   (bureaucracy, elected officials), and level of government (local, state,
   federal). Like interest groups, we find that nonprofits shop among both
   executive and legislative branches and among elected and bureaucratic
   domains; however, they tend to specialize in one level of government.
   Geographic scope and revenue source predicted venue targeting, but most
   other organizational characteristics including age, capacity, and
   structure did not.},

Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {318-334},

Abstract = {Research Highlights and Abstract
   Concepts from domestic and comparative politics can be applied in a
   transnational context; the article develops the notion of transnational
   veto players' to explain the practice of financial reform. Understanding
   the nature of constituency in a transnational context is important for
   explanations of actor preferences and the mode of policy that ensues.
   While actors involved in global standard-setting in finance have formal
   defined constituencies, when operating in a transnational setting their
   interactions render their constituencies diffuse, including peers and
   other interlocutors. In transnational settings, actors act as veto
   players by defining and delimiting the pool of ideas available for
   reform. Too big to fail' has been highlighted as an important target for
   reform but the resulting changes in the regulatory treatment of large
   financial institutions do not alter their core functions.
   Policy processes in transnational settings are shaped by actors whose
   approval and consent are required for reform to take place. These
   transnational veto players' frame and delimit policy options. The
   concept of transnational veto players' is developed through an empirical
   analysis of global reforms in the regulatory treatment of large
   financial institutions deemed too big to fail'. Actors debating and
   developing policy on too big to fail' may have formal defined
   constituencies, as regulators, academics or lobbying organisations, but
   in their transnational interactions they are also informed by a diffuse
   constituency of peers through their multiple associations within policy
   communities. These interactions determine which policy ideas are
   permissible and how they are adopted. The too big to fail' case shows
   how reform activity to curtail the risks posed by large financial
   institutions may also inadvertently strengthen their position as
   transnational veto players.},

Abstract = {Why are legislative proposals closer to the positions of some organized
   interests than others? The literature proposes that policy-makers are
   attentive to the demands of lobbyists that provide relevant information.
   At the same time, being part of a policy community is also claimed to
   enable lobbyists to shape policy formulation. We argue that both factors
   reinforce each other: informational resources are particularly effective
   in reducing the gap between the Commission's policy position and the
   position of lobbyists if both actors are part of the same policy
   community. Analysing data on over 100 policy issues in the European
   Union, we find that the context of a friendly Directorate-General
   reinforces the effectiveness of lobbyists' informational resources.
   However, on its own, a context of friendly relations between the
   policy-maker and the lobbyist contrib-utes little to explaining why the
   European Commission's policy position is closer to some actors than to
   others.},

Abstract = {This paper employs the concept of smart power to construct an analytical
   framework for assessing wartime alliance management. It makes two
   arguments. First, wartime sources of soft power differ from those
   obtaining during peacetime. Second, the coerciveness with which an
   alliance leader wields hard power towards actual or prospective allies
   should vary inversely with the amount of soft power it possesses. The
   smart power framework illuminates three types of alliance management
   failure. The paper's key contentions are illustrated with examples
   furnished from the record of US alliance leadership since World War II.},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {This paper proposes that the prevalence of illegitimate wage practices
   in Southern European societies results from the discord between the
   formal rules (formal institutions) and the socially shared unwritten
   rules that reflect citizens' beliefs (informal institutions). To
   evaluate this, a 2013 survey is reported on whether employers in five
   Southern European countries fraudulently evade tax and social security
   payments by paying employees a portion of their salary off the books. A
   strong association is revealed between the extent of wage
   under-reporting and the degree of institutional asymmetry across these
   societies. The implications for theorising illegitimate wage practices
   are then explored.},

Abstract = {This article develops an assessment of the shift from government to
   governance from the perspective of the concept of democratic
   representation developed by the French political theorist Claude Lefort.
   It is argued that this shift does not primarily entail a change of
   actors, norms or decision-making processes, but that it should rather be
   understood more fundamentally as a symbolic mutation. In governance
   regimes, a novel representation of power and society comes into being
   which transforms the basic symbolic configuration of society. Focusing
   especially on forms of global governance, the article investigates how
   this mutation provides society with a new image of itself, and how it
   affects the democratic nature of current society.},

Abstract = {I conduct an event study of an exogenous pollution shock-smog in the
   winter of 2013 to examine how the market values of firms in polluting
   industries and environmental protecting industries, respectively,
   responded in ``the world's worst polluter{''}: China. I first show that
   politically connected polluters, defined by having at least one board
   member who was a former local bureaucrat, are more likely to be state
   owned and in debt. During the 21 days of the smog, polluters experienced
   a cumulative abnormal return of -5.38\%, while protectors had a
   cumulative abnormal return of 3.50\%. However, politically connected
   polluters were less susceptible to the shock: they experienced a 1\%
   greater positive abnormal return than unconnected polluters. Connected
   protectors also benefited from a greater 1\% abnormal return than
   unconnected protectors. The findings imply that environmental disasters
   have distributional effects, and support a theory that links
   rent-seeking behavior to pollution.},

Abstract = {This study attempts to explore the span of a life in a specific
   terrorist organization, the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). It suggests
   the following: The average lifespan of a person in the PKK is about
   two-and-a-half years (i.e., not a very long one). Females join the PKK
   at a younger age (about 1.4 years) and die at a younger age (about 1.4
   years) compared to males, but their lifespan is not any different than
   that of males. The age at which a PKK member joins the organization, and
   the age at which (s)he dies varies by year. The age at which a PKK
   member joins the organization, and the age at which (s)he dies varies by
   where (s)he comes from. Still, another interesting observation is that
   the average lifespan of a PKK member varies by where (s)he comes from.},

Abstract = {Generalized trust, the faith we place in strangers, is a fundamental
   attribute of democratic societies. We investigate the development of
   generalized trust using survey data collected from Romanian high school
   students within a multi-level, panel research design. We find that
   diversity in the classroom, defined through ethnic and socio-economic
   differences, has negative effects on generalized trust. Associational
   membership interacts indirectly with diversity, counteracting the
   negative impact of ethnic diversity but reinforcing socioeconomic
   distinctions. The findings support cultural theories of generalized
   trust and point to the potentially positive role educational policy
   might play in encouraging trust among youths. (c) 2015 The Regents of

Abstract = {Following older debates in international relations literature concerning
   the relative importance of domestic versus systemic factors, newer
   debates emphasize interdependence among states and the complex
   interactions between systemic and domestic factors. As globalization and
   democratization advance, theories and empirical models of international
   politics have become more complicated. We present a systematic
   theoretical categorization of relationships between domestic and
   systemic variables. We use this categorization so that scholars can
   match their theory to the appropriate empirical model and assess the
   degree to which systemic factors affect their arguments. We also present
   two advances at the frontier of these empirical models. In one, we
   combine hierarchical models of moderating relationships with spatial
   models of interdependence among units within a system. In the other, we
   provide a model for analyzing spatial interdependence that varies over
   time. This enables us to examine how the level of interdependence among
   units has evolved. We illustrate our categorization and new models by
   revisiting the recent international political economy (IPE) debate over
   the relationship between trade policy and regime type in developing
   countries.},

Abstract = {Maritime engagement in the Gulf of Aden is a puzzling case for anyone
   interested in the political and institutional problems underlying
   European Union-North Atlantic Treaty Organization (EU-NATO) cooperation.
   Although the EU's operation NAVFOR Atalanta' and NATO's Ocean Shield'
   operate in the same theatre and with similar mandates, there is no
   formal link between them. No joint planning has been envisaged, and no
   official task-sharing takes place. As this article aims to show,
   cooperation and coordination between EU and NATO forces at the
   operational and tactical levels have nevertheless worked surprisingly
   well. Two faces of EU-NATO cooperation become apparent: the political
   level is dominated by a permanent deadlock, while on the ground and at
   sea staff have developed a modus operandi that allows them to deliver
   fairly successfully in complementing yet detached operations. Based on
   60 interviews with EU and NATO officials (2010-2013), this article
   illustrates how the operational and tactical levels have developed ways
   of coordinating efforts informally despite the lack of a formal
   framework. It aims to show to what extent and how they succeed at
   bypassing organizational boundaries and at overcoming political
   limitations. Although these practices are becoming increasingly
   institutionalized, it remains to be seen whether this will translate
   into formal changes.},

Abstract = {The assembly movement of Buenos Aires was one of the main political
   actors that emerged with the social explosion of December 2001. It
   initially called for a complete renewal of the country's elites, but it
   gradually divided into a sector that focused on neighborhood demands and
   a sector that adopted a national perspective. A detailed examination of
   a decade of development of two assemblies that are paradigmatic examples
   of the movement's division show that they retained their political
   identities over time, with the result that the neighborhood assembly
   disbanded once the problems on which it had concentrated were considered
   resolved while the popular assembly continued to engage in cultural and
   political projects.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We examine the design features of treaties governing international
   rivers and empirically test their effectiveness in managing water
   disputes. We expect peaceful conflict management to be more successful
   and militarized conflict to be less likely in dyadic river claims when
   riparians share membership in treaties with mechanisms for river basin
   organizations, information exchange, monitoring, enforcement, and
   conflict resolution. To test our expectation we analyze a set of
   diplomatic disagreements over cross-border rivers coded by the Issue
   Correlates of War project. We combine this database with treaty content
   data from the Transboundary Freshwater Dispute Database. Empirical
   analyses suggest that information exchange and enforcement provisions in
   river treaties are most effective for preventing militarization of river
   claims and increase the chances that negotiations over river claims
   successfully resolve the issues at stake. Enforcement provisions also
   promote third-party dispute settlement attempts and increase the
   likelihood of compliance with agreements reached. States that share
   membership in river basin organizations are more likely to experience
   militarized disputes and less likely to be amenable to third-party
   dispute settlement. However, the latter states are more likely to reach
   agreements in peaceful negotiations over their river claims. These
   findings demonstrate that institutional design influences riparian
   states' ability to address water disputes.},

Abstract = {Over the last several years research has examined anew the potential for
   climate change to induce political conflict and potentiate social
   unrest. Several explanations for the relationship between weather and
   social unrest have been proposed, including the idea that temperature,
   acting through a physiological response mechanism, gives rise to
   collective aggression. This proposition first appeared in the aftermath
   of the 1960s US riots, which occurred primarily in the heat of summer,
   and has re-emerged within the contemporary literature on conflict and
   climate, in addition to explanations rooted in political economic
   processes. Building on both bodies of work, this article utilizes a
   case-crossover time-series design to explore the relationship between
   meteorological factors derived from high resolution spatial data of
   temperature and precipitation and social disturbances occurring in 50
   major cities in Africa and Asia between 1960 and 2006. Poisson
   regression and generalized additive modeling are utilized to model
   linear and non-linear effects, respectively. A significant, but
   qualified, association between heat and urban social disturbances is
   found. The general relationship is non-linear, with peak levels of
   unrest occurring in the upper 20s (degrees C). The relationship between
   temperature and social unrest within individual cities is linear. In
   addition, there are differential effects of heat on lethal versus
   non-lethal episodes of unrest. The non-linear response to temperature is
   much more pronounced among lethal events than it is among non-lethal
   episodes. The conclusion taken from this research is that heat is
   associated with urban social conflict, but generally does not trigger
   episodes and instead acts to supplement aggression while other factors
   govern the primary timing of social unrest.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the banking crisis in the US and UK. It is
   essential to understand banker agency and the institutional and
   structural contexts which shaped such agency. Bankers experienced
   variegated patters of constraint and opportunity. At one level
   institutional theories that emphasise institutional constraint cannot
   easily account for the authority and agency enjoyed by key bankers. On
   the other hand, bankers were heavily influenced by institutional change
   in the shape of market liberalisation', which produced intense levels of
   competition and pressures to achieve higher profit returns: an exacting
   form of market discipline.
   Bankers and financiers in the US and UK modified institutions and
   revolutionised the banking industry prior to the 2007-8 crisis. These
   agents were however heavily constrained and eventually overwhelmed by
   institutional pressures and wider structural forces that encouraged
   high-risk leveraged trading and which generated systemic risk. To
   account for this, institutional theory needs to incorporate a broader
   canvas of conditioning contexts, particularly the impact of structural
   or systemic forces on agents and the way in which these are actualised
   as a form of ecosystem power'.},

Abstract = {India's claims for regional hegemony have regularly been contested since
   its independence in 1947. The self-proclaimed emerging power is locked
   in an enduring rivalry with the South Asian secondary power, Pakistan.
   This article outlines the evolution of Pakistan's contestation since
   independence and seeks to demonstrate how, when and why Pakistan adapted
   its foreign policy toward India. While the goals of Pakistan's
   contestation remained constant, its means varied at two points in
   post-independence history. From 1947 to 1971, territorial disputes
   combined with a nascent nationalism drove the secondary power's foreign
   policy elite to engage in war and open resistance, and the divergent
   domestic political ideologies of both countries complicated conflict
   resolution. With Pakistan's devastating war defeat in 1971, direct means
   of contestation were no longer an immediate option, and a period of
   reluctant acquiescence ensued. The alleged involvement of Pakistani
   intelligence proxies in a crisis in Jammu and Kashmir in 1987 marked the
   beginning of a renewed phase of resistance, though now through indirect
   means of nuclear coercion and subconventional warfare. This form of
   contestation has increasingly manifested itself in bilateral crises with
   high potential of escalation and primarily targeted symbols of India's
   South Asian hegemony, including its political and commercial centres in
   Delhi and Mumbai in 2001 and 2008 respectively or India's diplomatic
   representations in Afghanistan. The article concludes that the current
   conditions of regional contestation in South Asia, most importantly the
   persistent revisionist versus status-quo domestic agendas, the presence
   of growing nuclear arsenals, and multi-tiered Asian rivalry
   constellations, undermine prospects for conflict resolution and
   complicate modelling future strategic behaviour in the region.},

Abstract = {This article is divided into three parts. The first section analyzes
   some narratives of international financialization and shows how the most
   relevant element of this process from the developing world's perspective
   (i.e. international financial liberalization) has generated significant
   costs for all of these economies. The second section analyzes why the
   element that would theoretically provide the most important advantage in
   terms of international financialization for the developing world (i.e.
   the establishment of a substantial, stable and predictable system of
   financing for development) has not been put into practice. Finally, the
   article analyzes the connection between the two issues (international
   financialization and international financing for development) in the
   context of a center-periphery financialization model, and establishes
   the need for its wholesale reform. This article goes on to propose the
   modification of some of the central elements of the international
   financialization process in the dimension most closely linked to
   development, and the adoption of a systemic approach to international
   financing for development (SAIFfD).},

Title = {What Can Causal Process Tracing Offer to Policy Studies? A Review of the
   Literature},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-21},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Causal process tracing (CPT) has emerged as an important method of
   causal inference in qualitative social science research, most notably in
   case study research designs. There is now a considerable literature on
   the aims, philosophical groundings, and methods of process tracing. This
   paper reviews the CPT literature to assess what new directions it may
   suggest for policy studies. The first part of the paper sets out the
   methodological advantages CPT offers in building and testing theories of
   policy change, most notably in supporting a theoretical pluralism to
   address the problem of complexity in policy studies. Building on recent
   scholarship across the social sciences, the second part examines step by
   step the recently minted best practice for undertaking CPT in policy
   studies. This part includes discussion of the possible pitfalls of CPT
   as a method; common errors involved in its use are set out and
   minimization strategies offered. In particular, while acknowledging the
   usefulness of Bayesian tests for causality as heuristic devices, we
   emphasize the limitations of applying such tests in practice. Possible
   correctives are suggested. The final part of the paper speculates more
   generally on the potential of CPT to improve our investigation of
   patterns of policy change over time.},

Abstract = {This article examines the story of Canberra Airport's transformation
   from a dilapidated aviation facility to a world-class small `airport
   city' juxtaposing aeronautical and non-aeronautical land uses with a
   critical focus on the tensions with established planning and corporate
   institutions. The analysis is framed within five main discourses: the
   global entrepreneurial turn in airport development towards mixed use
   precincts; neoliberal government policies welcoming private investment
   and management within the public sphere and notably airport
   privatisation from the mid-1990s; the rise of airport real estate
   markets and the singular role of a local development company in the case
   of Canberra; a new governance regime privileging the commonality of
   federal privatised airports, but excluding state, territory and local
   determinations; and the specificity of the setting of Canberra as a
   national capital and city having to adapt to the dynamic impacts of a
   new development typology. The comprehensive redevelopment of Canberra
   Airport since the late 1990s highlights both strengths and shortcomings
   in public policy.},

Title = {The Destruction of Identity: Cultural Genocide and Indigenous Peoples},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {63-83},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {International law defines genocide in terms of violence committed ``with
   intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or
   religious group,{''} yet this approach fails to acknowledge the full
   impacts of cultural destruction. There is insufficient international
   discussion of ``cultural genocide,{''} which is a particular threat to
   the world's indigenous minorities. Despite the recent adoption of the UN
   Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which acknowledges the
   rights to culture, diversity, and self-determination, claims of cultural
   genocide are often derided, and their indicators dismissed as benign
   effects of modernity and indigenous cultural diffusion. This article
   considers the destruction of indigenous cultures and the forced
   assimilation of indigenous peoples through the analytical lens of
   genocide. Two case studies-the federally unrecognized Winnemem Wintu
   tribe in northern California and the Inuit of northern Canada-are
   highlighted as illustrative examples of groups facing these challenges.
   Ultimately, this article seeks to prompt serious discussion of cultural
   rights violations, which often do not involve direct physical killing or
   violence, and consideration of the concept ``cultural genocide{''} as a
   tool for human rights promotion and protection.},

Pages = {488-497},
Abstract = {Self-determination, a prime justificatory principle of the international
   society, has become a confused, and confusing, compass. At the heart of
   this confusion, I argue, lies the tacit submersion of self-determination
   in state-determination. In principle, self-determination entails the
   `moral double helix' of duality (personal right to align with a people,
   and the people's right to determine their politics) and mutuality (the
   right is as much the other's as the self's). In practice, state actors
   have labored to tame self-determination: to control and contain this
   perilous principle by yielding the will of `the people' to the interests
   of powerful states, which have repeatedly impaired its moral DNA.},

   Referendums},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},
Pages = {451-470},
Abstract = {The problem of cross-case influences is crucial in the analysis of
   social phenomena. Is a referendum held in a state entirely a `domestic'
   event? No work has applied diffusion theories to the study of referendum
   campaigns. In this paper, I show diffusion effects among the 2005
   Constitutional Treaty referendums. Spain, France, the Netherlands, and
   Luxembourg used the referendum method to ratify the European
   Constitution. Based on 85 interviews with campaigners in all four
   countries, I find that campaign arguments and strategies were not always
   homegrown. However, such diffusion is not automatic and depends on
   diffusion channels.},

   Regional Actor?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},

Volume = {37},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {95-112},
Abstract = {This article analyses Turkey's responses to the Arab uprisings in the
   context of its larger foreign policy transformation and regional
   aspirations. The AKP government seized the uprisings as an opportunity
   to increase its influence in the region by assigning itself a central
   role in the transition processes in various countries. In the process,
   however, Turkey faced a number of setbacks and reversals. Comparing the
   cases of Libya, Syria, and Egypt, the paper argues that Turkey's efforts
   to advance regime change in these sites were marked by inconsistency and
   incoherence. Furthermore, the paper argues that this trajectory of
   reactions can be explained only by taking both ideational and domestic
   factors into account. Despite the shortcomings of Turkey's actions,
   however, the article concludes that Turkey has consolidated itself as a
   regional actor, albeit a controversial one.},

Title = {A narrative-interactionist approach to policy change analysis. Lessons
   from a case study of the cultural policy domain in Catalonia},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},

Abstract = {The cultural policy domain can be considered a relevant object of study
   for analyzing policy change processes in which policy discourse and the
   ambiguity of language have a central role. However, there are few
   studies that analyze cultural policy and policy change. This article
   therefore develops an approach for analyzing policy change based on
   evidence from a case study of the development of cultural policy in
   Catalonia. In this narrative-interactionist approach, policy change is
   taken to mean the result of the symbolic interaction among political
   actors, within a relatively restricted institutional framework. Policy
   change is conditioned by the variations in the process of symbolic
   legitimation of government intervention, in this case in the cultural
   arena. By adapting the concept of frame alignment to policy change
   analysis, this article shows that the alignment between policy frames
   and a master frame underpins this symbolic legitimation. The process of
   alignment is dynamic and leads to a modification of the actors' policy
   frames.},

Abstract = {This article examines how socially oriented non-governmental
   organisations (SO NGOs) in Russia conceptualise the state's role in
   guaranteeing social rights and negotiate relations with the state. It
   demonstrates that these organisations see the state as playing a key
   role in guaranteeing social rights. This facilitates a degree of agency
   in their relationship with the authorities, who are increasingly keen to
   use the experience SO NGOs provide for service delivery. This challenges
   the dominant view of compliant social NGOs which fully cooperate with
   the authorities and highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding

Year = {2015},
Pages = {139-165},
Abstract = {Orchestration is prevalent in global governance. This chapter asks why
   and under what conditions IGOs adopt orchestration for traditionally
   hierarchical tasks. I argue that IGOs rationally adapt to their
   strategic environment by working around binding constraints and tapping
   into alternative resources made available by non-state actors. Under
   certain circumstances, it may be both efficient and effective for IGOs
   to enlist non-state intermediaries to help monitor and enforce states'
   compliance. In this sense, I argue, orchestration is an optimal strategy
   of adaptation. This model of orchestration highlights key hypotheses
   from the orchestration framework chapter (Abbott et al., in this
   volume), especially goal divergence and intermediary availability. I
   provide empirical support for these hypotheses through a comparative
   study of IGOs over a wide range of issue areas, including international
   security, international trade, the environment and human rights. In each
   case, the model helps explain not just the likelihood, but also the
   varying degrees and forms of IGO orchestration of non-state
   intermediaries in monitoring state compliance.},

Pages = {419-438},
Abstract = {In this article, we examine to what extent globalization has altered
   responsibilities for human rights. We give priority to negative human
   rights and take the violation of these rights as the baseline for
   determining harm and injustice. We will focus on the global economic
   order and on climate change and examine whether these aspects of
   globalization provide us with new reasons to value our relationships
   with distant others. We argue that, if a relationship of harm is
   established, fulfilling positive duties is no longer a matter of general
   charity but has become a special obligation of justice. Accordingly,
   human rights and corresponding obligations gain important normative
   weight. We propose to use the ``vulnerability presumption principle{''}
   as a guideline in determining whether or not such a relationship of harm
   is established.},

Abstract = {In a recent International Politics article, Henrik Friberg-Fernros and
   Douglas Brommesson argue that the responsibility to protect (R2P)
   doctrine, as it was originally introduced in the International
   Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS) report, is
   incoherent. More specifically, they contend that there is a fundamental
   conflict between the implications of R2P and the six criteria the ICISS
   sets out to evaluate whether an intervention is justified. This article
   argues that these assertions are based on a misconception of how the
   criteria for justified intervention are interpreted in the ICISS report.
   Building on recent arguments from just war theory, I argue that three of
   these criteria do not stipulate when it is permitted to intervene, but
   rather what is permitted in an intervention. Subsequently, I demonstrate
   that in such an application, these criteria are not incompatible with
   the R2P.},

Abstract = {After the US had initially assessed the Arab uprisings as an opportunity
   and displayed a dual role understanding as an anchor of security and
   modest advocate of democracy, the second role understanding faded the
   more the US perceived the uprisings as a risk rather than an
   opportunity. In respect to practice, the US response did not show clear
   patterns in terms of goals or instruments it pursued, which would
   correspond to the development of these role understandings or to
   predefined geostrategic interests. Indeed, it seems that the US has
   switched from default to ad hoc modus in its foreign policy in the
   region which challenges both, the rational actor, as well as the
   normative actor model. Instead, it might be more appropriate to speak of
   a pragmatic actor who had to navigate through an array of constraints,
   including new realities in the MENA region on one hand and domestic and
   bureaucratic politics in the US on the other.},

Abstract = {Abe has pursued the transformation of Japan's national security policy
   with extraordinary rapidity since 2012. Abe has introduced Japan's first
   National Security Strategy (NSS) and National Security Council (NSC), a
   State Secrecy Law, a revised National Defence Programme Guidelines
   (NDPG) and increased defence budgets and a new `Three Principles of
   Defence Equipment Transfers'. Most significantly, Abe has breached the
   post-war ban on the exercise of the right of collective self-defence,
   opening the way for Japan to provide military support to the US and
   other states in a variety of contingencies. Although Abe's reforms have
   been portrayed as limited and proportionate, they have in fact
   significantly lowered the constitutional and political constraints on
   Japan's use of military power and established new precedents for
   regional and global deployments of the JSDF.},

Abstract = {Despite predictions of renewed pragmatism in relations with China and
   East Asia, the Abe Doctrine' has induced Japanese attempts to lead the
   region in the `encirclement' of China. Abe has sought to make common
   cause with ASEAN on common maritime security issues and based on the
   appeal of upholding the rule of international law. Abe has practiced
   vigorous diplomacy to reestablish Japan's influence most especially with
   ASEAN, and even perhaps surprisingly with North Korea. However, Abe's
   diplomacy has had limited effectiveness. ASEAN has not been enticed into
   joining Japan's encirclement strategy. Abe's historical revisionism has
   only served to continue to alienate South Korea and China. Rather than
   Japan encircling China, Abe's diplomacy has proved counterproductive and
   threatened Japanese isolation.},

Title = {The Influence of Firm Global Supply Chains and Foreign Currency
   Undervaluations on US Trade Disputes},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {69},
Number = {4},
Pages = {913-947},
Abstract = {We apply insights from new, new trade theory to explain a puzzling
   decline in US firm antidumping (AD) filings in an era of persistent
   foreign currency undervaluations and increasing import competition.
   Firms exhibit heterogeneity both within and across industries regarding
   foreign direct investment (FDI). We propose that firms making vertical
   or resource-seeking investments abroad will be less likely to file AD
   petitions, and firms are likely to undertake vertical FDI in the context
   of currency undervaluation. Hence, we argue, the increasing vertical FDI
   of US firms makes trade disputes far less likely. We use firm-level data
   to examine the universe of US manufacturing firms and find that AD
   filers generally conduct no intrafirm trade with filed-against
   countries. We also find that persistent currency undervaluation is
   associated over time with increased vertical FDI and intrafirm trade by
   US multinational corporations (MNCs) in the undervaluing country. Among
   larger US MNCs, the likelihood of an AD filing is negatively associated
   with increases in intrafirm trade. In the context of currency
   undervaluation, we confirm the existing finding that undervaluation is
   associated with more AD filings. We also find, however, that high levels
   of intrafirm imports from countries with undervalued currencies
   significantly decrease the likelihood of AD filings. Our study
   highlights the centrality of firm heterogeneity in international trade
   and investment in understanding political mobilization over
   international economic policy.},

Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {441-453},
Abstract = {During the quarter century before the First World War, anarchist
   terrorism was often blamed on the impact of anarchist agitators on naive
   immigrants. This article seeks to investigate the truth of this claim,
   focusing particularly on Italian emigrants, but also looking at some
   examples of Spanish, French, and Russian emigrants. My conclusion is
   that, with a few exceptions, radicals emigrated, but emigration did not
   create radical terrorists. A particularly good example of this can be
   found by examining the large Italian emigration to Argentina. At most,
   the emigrant experience may have heightened a pre-existing radicalism or
   given more precise configuration to its violent expression.},

Abstract = {When collecting data, some observations will always be hard to
   confidently classify in accordance with stated definitions of war, civil
   conflict, or political violence. This research note draws on the
   experiences of the Uppsala Conflict Data Program in the last decade in
   managing such unclear cases. After explaining the difference between
   unclear and non-cases, I describe the data generating process and how
   this uncertainty is distributed over time in the data. This exercise
   reveals that the 1980s may have been more conflict-filled than the
   1990s, challenging arguments about the stability of the bipolar global
   order as well as the sudden `rise' of warfare in the immediate post-Cold
   War era. The final section suggests different ways that researchers may
   use existing information regarding unclear cases as a way to
   conceptualize the nature of civil strife without having to engage in
   additional data collection.},

Title = {Managing great powers in the post-Cold War world: old rules new game?
   The case of the global war on terror},
Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Pages = {396-423},
Abstract = {This article investigates the impact of the GlobalWar on Terror (GWoT)
   on the primary institution of great power management. To this end, it
   first identifies a misalignment between the new post-Cold War social
   reality and the capacity of some traditional norms of great power
   management to mediate this reality. Having established and described
   this environment of normative uncertainty, I then probe how the GWoT
   propels the consolidation of newidentities and norms of great
   powermanagement in interstate society. I argue that since the beginning
   of the GWoT the primary institution of great power management has
   institutionalized new norms to address transnational violence within its
   processes. At the same time, as hard balancing amongst great powers is
   becoming increasingly obsolete, two distinct social structures have been
   constructed with the GWoT: one that privileges an inequitable social
   structure of friends/rivals amongst states; and another that shapes a
   social structure of enemies with regard to terrorist-state relations. In
   this process, the capacity of managing transnational violence globally
   has increasingly become one of the central constitutive elements of
   being a great power. I conclude by demonstrating how the GWoT has acted
   as a subtle ` bargaining bid' in the process of organizing the current
   social meaning of polarity and great power management amongst states.
   State practices under the GWoT have delineated, in a clearer form,
   underlying expectations about the pattern of interactions between the
   superpower and great powers. Consequently, the GWoT has exerted a
   symbolic and psychological impact over international society by
   institutionalizing not only a specific meaning of unipolarity but also
   further raising the threshold of what is acceptable behaviour on the
   part of the superpower within an interstate social structure of
   friends/rivals.},

Abstract = {While the subject of wartime civilian casualties has been recognized as
   an important issue in International Relations (IR), foreign policy and
   IR scholars have not systematically examined why and how US politicians
   respond to civilian deaths. This article explores the ethics of and
   reasons for responsiveness to Iraqi civilian deaths among politicians in
   the US House of Representatives from 2003 to 2008. The article argues
   that legislative deliberative responsiveness to civilian deaths is
   integral to a just debate about war. It finds evidence that
   partisanship, ideology and sex are associated with responsiveness to
   civilian deaths, and reveals stark differences in the purposes and tone
   of Democratic and Republican rhetoric about civilian casualties. The
   article provides researchers with a more thorough understanding of how
   and why civilian costs of war emerge within debates among US
   politicians, and has implications for studies on discourse ethics,
   congressional war politics and US foreign policy.},

Abstract = {Presidents face the problem of exercising a leadership that is of an
   elusive nature, hard to comprehend and to grasp, and that involves both
   opportunities and risks. Political leaders may confront such questions
   more effectively -and academics and citizens alike may better evaluate
   them-if they understand leadership as ``strategic action.{''} In support
   of this hypothesis, this paper sets out three elements: ``relevant
   agenda{''}, ``inclusive leveraging{''} and ``balanced decision-making
   style{''}. On this basis an analysis is made of the government of Felipe
   Calderon, concluding that he failed to exercise political leadership.},

Abstract = {This article analyses Israel's foreign policy response to the `Arab
   Spring' in comparative perspective. Following the analytical framework
   shared by all contributions to this Special Issue, the article addresses
   four main dimensions in as many parts. Part I examines Israel's initial
   reactions to the advent of the popular upheavals and regime changes in
   the Arab world in 2011-2014 and explores how those reactions have
   evolved over time. Part II identifies Israel's main policy objectives in
   relation to events in the region and particularly its immediate
   neighbours: Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Part III examines the
   instruments which Israel has used, and eschewed, in pursuit of its
   policy objectives. Finally, part IV undertakes a theoretically informed
   analysis with the aim of explaining Israel's distinctive strategic
   posture and policy responses to the events of the `Arab Spring' thus
   far.},

Abstract = {The prioritization of the South-South axis during the Lula da Silva
   government is consensual among analysts of Brazilian Foreign Policy
   regarding its international insertion, as well as the prominent role
   given to the African continent. In order to provide empirical analysis
   to the reprioritization of relations between Brazil and Africa, this
   paper aims at comparing the technical cooperation provided by Brazil to
   African countries during FHC (1995-2002) and Lula da Silva (2003-2010)
   administrations. Its primary source of analyzed data, little explored by
   the Brazilian academic literature yet, was the databank of the

Abstract = {This article assesses the applicability of subcultural theories to
   individual cases of jihadi and Right-wing radicalization in Germany,
   with a focus on the individual initial situation and motivation for
   involvement. Within an overall qualitative research design, the article
   tests deviance/strain and Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies
   (CCCS) subcultural theories against four jihadi and three Right-wing
   extremist cases. The findings show little support for the strain-based
   status frustration hypothesis, but confirm the illegitimate opportunity
   structure thesis; modified versions of the CCCS' resistance, bricolage,
   and homology concepts; as well as some of the postmodern approaches to
   agency and cultural cross-fertilization. The jihadi and Right-wing
   radicals examined here are assertive and purposive agents, strategically
   using the rich cultural arsenal available in the mainstream and/or other
   subcultures, while at the same time being themselves influenced by
   contemporary mainstream preferences of style. The article discusses the
   implications of these findings for radicalization research and specific
   subcultural approaches. It argues for a greater focus on both individual
   agency and the (sub-)cultural context for an improved understanding of
   individual involvement in political violence.},

Title = {Performing Theory/Theorizing Performance in Emergent Supranational
   Governance: The `Live' Knowledge Archive of European Integration and the
   Early European Commission},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {175-191},
Abstract = {This article considers the entanglement of theories of international
   politics and international economics on the one hand and an emergent
   supranational policy actor on the other. The formation of the European
   Communities in the late 1950s and early 1960s is well known as a moment
   of radical supranational institutional creation. This is a period in
   which both economists and political scientists sought to theorize the
   processes of regional integration as it was happening. The article shows
   that the newly-formed European Commission, in both its communicative and
   coordinative discourse, drew selectively on the `live' knowledge archive
   of both international economics and international relations to generate
   a strategic narrative about what European economic integration entailed,
   how it would be accomplished and (crucially) what kind of actor it was.
   At the same time, the semi-inductive quality of academic knowledge
   production meant that the Commission's activities were simultaneously
   being theorized into the live archive from which it was drawing. The
   paper examines the influence of two bodies of theory: one from economics
   (Balassa's theory of international economic integration), and the other
   from political science (neofunctionalism). The former is a striking
   influence on early discussions, initiated by the Commission, on monetary
   union, but its finger prints are rather more enduring -being visible in
   Commission communicative discourse well into the 1970s.},

Title = {A social theory of war: Clausewitz and war reconsidered},
Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Pages = {327-347},
Abstract = {This article presents a new theory of war that is grounded in the
   insights of Clausewitz on the social nature of conflict. Clausewitz had
   argued that war is a political process; he therefore distinguished
   between `war'-understood in political terms-and warfare-understood as
   fighting. He then created a typology covering a spectrum of war ranging
   from total to limited, the political stakes of a conflict determining
   where it would fall on the spectrum. I develop and modify this basic
   framework by arguing that the social organization of the actors has a
   determining role in predicting the stakes of war. I then show how this
   framework helps us understand some key problems in the political science
   literature on war and conflict. I attempt to show two main things: (1)
   that there are different types of wars (and that these differences are
   not necessarily related to the standing of the actors, i.e. the presence
   or absence of sovereignty); and (2) that how war and warfare are related
   is more complicated than previously understood and that this has
   implications for the political science literature on order, conflict and
   violence.
   Very few of the new manifestations in war can be ascribed to new
   inventions or new departures in ideas. They result mainly from the
   transformation of society and new social conditions. (Clausewitz 1989,
   515)
   War cannot be divorced from political life (Verkehr), and whenever this
   occurs in our thinking about war the many links that connect the two
   elements are destroyed and we are left with something pointless and
   devoid of sense (Clausewitz 1989, 605).},

   and yet still declare that science and democracy exhibited no influence

   replace anything, for he knew it would be futile to do so. Gongsun's
   debate that let the utterers determine their own realities amounted to a
   completely opposite claim that the sage did not know. Gongsun deprived a
   name of any universal implication beyond mere expression of a person who
   incurred the name for his or her own distinctive purpose. The simple
   quote ``The white horse is no horse{''} contains all these rich
   meanings.},

Title = {Political skill in job negotiations: a two-study constructive
   replication},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {2-24},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the effects of political skill
   in a specific workplace setting the job negotiation. The authors
   expected negotiator political skill to be positively related to
   distributive negotiation outcome, problem-solving as a negotiation
   strategy to mediate this relationship and political skill to also
   moderate - that is amplify - the link between problem-solving and
   negotiation outcome.
   Design/methodology/approach - In Study 1, a laboratory-based negotiation
   simulation was conducted with 88 participants; the authors obtained
   self-reports of political skill prior to the negotiation and - to
   account for non-independence of negotiating partners' outcome - used the
   Actor-Partner Interdependence Model for data analysis. Study 2 was
   carried out as a real-life negotiation study with 100 managers of a
   multinational corporation who were given the opportunity to re-negotiate
   their salary package prior to a longer-term foreign assignment. Here,
   the authors drew on two objective measures of negotiation success,
   increase of annual gross salary and additional annual net benefits.
   Findings - In Study 1, the initial hypothesis - political skill will be
   positively related to negotiator success - was fully supported. In Study
   2, all three hypotheses (see above) were fully supported for additional
   annual net benefits and partly supported for increase of annual gross
   salary.
   Originality/value - To the authors' best knowledge, this paper presents
   the first study to examine political skill as a focal predictor variable
   in the negotiation context. Furthermore, the studies also broaden the
   emotion-centered approach to social effectiveness that is prevalent in
   current negotiation research.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {78-96},
Abstract = {This article argues for the usefulness of the concept of the empty
   signifier for the analysis of international policy processes. First, it
   emphasizes the importance of considering references to general public
   interest in global politics and the way such interest is constructed.
   Second, it opens up the possibility of examining political strategies in
   the process of developing policy programs. Third, it provides a foil for
   scrutinizing the interplay between universal and particular interests.
   Finally, it offers a framework for analysis that can be used to explain
   the process by which a term comes to both identify and propel a whole
   policy field or development. In an examination of US technology policies
   during the 1990s until mid-2000s, the article investigates the political
   process leading to the development of the term nanotechnology. In so
   doing, it argues that nanotechnology is not a particular technology or a
   specific field of research, but rather a broader political project
   encompassing a wide array of technological areas that are unified in
   name only. It is the term nanotechnology that brings them together under
   one cover, giving them a common identification.},

Abstract = {The paper clarifies the conditions under which policy discourse can
   effectively build consensus and legitimacy over a policy programme. It
   argues that discursive effectiveness depends on the efficient engagement
   of knowledge during policy formulation. It tests its theory against the
   Greek case of pension reform (1990-2002). Conceptually, the paper adds
   to discursive institutionalism. It shows that actor-centred research
   design and policy-level variables can help understand the gravity of
   policy discourse in the policy process. It also shows that the
   ineffectiveness of the governmental discourse ultimately indicates the
   failure of Greek democratic policy-making and politics. Finally, it
   suggests that the relationship of discourse with its institutional
   context might also depend on the attributes of the policy-making process
   that deploys it, as well as, the structural characteristics of the
   polity that produces it.},

Title = {Roles of scholars in environmental community conflict resolution A case
   study in contemporary China},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {316-341},
Abstract = {Purpose - This study aims to investigate scholars' roles in resolving
   environmental community conflict, as environmental community conflict is
   becoming an increasingly serious problem in contemporary China, and it
   explored the underlying factors and mechanisms that influence successful
   conflict resolution.
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on a combination of three types of
   sources - interviews, participant observation and existing literature,
   the study compared and contrasted 35 cases through a two-stage study
   project with 25 environmental community conflict cases in the first
   stage and ten non-environmental cases in the second.
   Findings - Results indicate that scholars serve seven roles in community
   conflict resolution: identification persons for potential sources of
   community conflict and supporters for the people who evaluate conflict
   problems before attempting to solve them; advisers for conflict
   protagonists; leaders of many knowledge-related activities; organizers
   of entrepreneurial activities for other community members; information
   brokers between community members and other stakeholders;
   representatives of the government, firms, community members and other
   stakeholders; and self-interested participants. While scholars'
   participation is important for resolving community conflict, their
   actions are often not effective. Successful community conflict
   resolution involving scholars must satisfy eight underlying factors:
   local scholars' sustained participation; high capacity; improvement on
   the organizational level of community members; emphasis on high
   efficiency knowledge and information transmission; effective finding and
   use of the community's social capital; continual optimization on their
   action strategies; obtainability of some benefits; and non-local
   scholars' sustained external support through social capital. The more
   closely these rules are followed, the more successful scholars'
   participation in community conflict resolution will be.
   Originality/value - The findings have practical implications for
   improving the effectiveness of scholars' participation in community
   conflict resolution in contemporary China and even in other countries.},

Abstract = {This article examines the transnational politics of the Motion Picture
   Association (MPA), the trade association of Hollywood major studios,
   from the viewpoint of the neopluralist. The MPA aims at stopping
   copyright violations by framing materially and discursively markets. For
   this reason, it maintains a worldwide spectrum of relations with other
   business associations, workers of the motion picture industries and
   governments. These relationships serve the MPA in a multitude of ways,
   from intergovernmental negotiations and litigations to anti-copyright
   violation efforts in association with law enforcement. Although the MPA
   has acquired an authoritative position beyond audiovisual sectors, its
   policy remains unachieved owing to pluralizing world spheres. This
   neopluralist perspective underlines first the fundamentally
   multicentered, crosscut and fragmented aspects of globalized politics
   which lead actors to resort increasingly to coalitions. Second, it takes
   a broader perspective at politics showing not only the strengths but
   also the weaknesses of assumed all-powerful organizations. Third,
   neopluralism argues strongly for a reconsideration of the dominant views
   on firms, economies and governments in international political economy.},

Abstract = {Although many scholars of Central and Eastern Europe politics write
   about the relative weaknesses of civil societies, some studies delivered
   evidence of cases where interest groups were able to influence
   particular decisions and policies. Therefore, we aimed at identifying
   and examining the most influential national interest groups of eight
   different policy areas in post-communist Hungary hoping to explore the
   reasons for their success. Older generations of organisations benefit
   from political embeddedness, while newer advocacy groups rely more on
   legal instruments and public mobilisation. The operation of successful
   groups has not been affected by the strong political polarisation of the
   Hungarian party system.},

Abstract = {This article makes a theoretical contribution to the constructivist and
   cultural political economy literatures on crisis. While these new
   approaches have highlighted the imaginary dimensions of crisis, they
   have neglected the specifically historical forms of imagination through
   which events are construed and constructed as crises. In particular,
   they have yet to adequately theorise how the recollection of prior
   crises might interact with efforts to diagnose and resolve a crisis in
   some later present. I respond to this lacuna by developing a novel set
   of tools for analysing the meta-historical dimensions of crisis. These
   include a typology that identifies three distinct ways of recalling past
   crises, and a concept of history-production', which captures how
   different interpretive practices feed into the diagnosis and negotiation
   of crisis episodes. Taken together these tools help illuminate a complex
   interaction not only between historical analogies, narratives, and
   lessons, but also between these representational modes and the imaginary
   dimensions of crisis.},

Abstract = {The literature on the institutionalization of international cooperation
   argues that states include dispute settlement procedures in their
   agreements to ``tie the hands{''} of states. This paper reverses this
   thinking and shows that when a regime provides institutionalized dispute
   settlement, states sometimes seek to undo it. The settlement of maritime
   boundaries is a case in point. Governed by the Law of the Sea regime,
   which provides four institutional mechanisms for states to solve
   disputes, the vast majority of agreements specify bilateral negotiations
   as the only way to deal with future conflicts. The reason for this is
   that states pay attention to both the cost and flexibility of conflict
   resolutions mechanisms. We find that poorer states are more likely than
   wealthy states to specify bilateral negotiations, the cheapest and most
   flexible conflict resolution mechanism. Wealth differentials are also
   associated with greater demands for flexibility.},

Title = {The (International) Political Economy of Falling Wage Shares: Situating
   Working-Class Agency},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {406-430},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {This paper relates the financial and monetary dimensions of the
   contemporary economic crisis to working-class agency via a central
   concern of classical political economy: the distribution of surplus
   between the chief factors of production. The fall in the wage share of
   value added is now accepted as a stylised fact in the empirical economic
   literature. This paper argues that the punctuated pattern of the
   development validates the regulation theoretical narrative of an epochal
   shift from Fordism to finance-led accumulation. Furthermore,
   synthesising econometric studies supports a class-centred explanation.
   In the last instance, the falling wage share is due to successful
   transnational class rule in the form of a neoliberal hegemonic paradigm.
   Crucially, such class rule restructured the environment of trade unions,
   rendering increasingly ineffective its relational power resources. The
   paper concludes by considering the contradictory implications for
   organised labour of the current financial crisis. On the one hand, the
   financial crisis offers an opportunity to link its particular interests
   to the general interest of macroeconomic management since low wage share
   inhibits growth rates. But how might trade unions assert a higher wage
   share in the face of the structural power of (financial) capital?},

Abstract = {Based on fieldwork done in Ekaterinburg, this article deals with the
   enforcement of legal decisions about economic disputes in the late 2000s
   in Russia. As state employees, bailiffs are responsible for the
   implementation of court decisions but their efficiency depends on the
   cases they deal with. In the most successful cases, they are backed by
   private enforcers, hired by the claimant and often coming from the law
   enforcement agencies. This common work reflects an informal
   public-private partnership from below in which bailiffs and private
   enforcers co-execute judicial decisions. Such autonomous public-private
   power configurations at local level challenge the governmental claim to
   build a `power vertical' in Russia from the top.},

   The legal status of prostitution in each country and feminist influences

Abstract = {In the last decades a deep process of institutional reforms and economic
   reorganization took place in central and eastern EU countries (CEE).
   These changes occurred in a context of general economic integration. On
   the one hand, the European Union enlargement programme was launched and
   all CEE countries applied to become EU member between 1994 and 1996. On
   the other hand, the globalization of the world economy characterized
   this historical phase. This article explores to what extent openness to
   global markets mediated the impact of EU integration on the economic
   performance of CEE regions in different periods. The periods examined
   are defined by the main institutional changes that occurred on the road
   towards EU integration. Results show that globally open regions
   performed better than the others, at least in the first two periods
   analyzed.},

Abstract = {Geographical versus industrial diversification has been the subject of
   much debate in equity investment strategies. This article revisits this
   issue and analyzes the contention that if national factors have lost
   importance since the launch of the euro, then the regime dynamics of
   industry indexes in the eurozone countries should be more similar.
   Results show a core group of country-industry indexes sharing the same
   regime dynamics, which comprise the majority of industry indexes of
   France and Germany. After the euro launch, a group of industry indexes
   gained more similarities with the core group of the eurozone - notably
   industries from Italy, Spain and Finland. Nevertheless, dynamics in a
   small group of industries did not change. Overall, synchronization
   between country-industry indexes has increased except for a small group
   of industries.},

Abstract = {This article uses the example of a failed project, whose aim was to
   achieve consensus around constructing a memorial at the former Omarska
   camp in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to illustrate some of the dangers of
   transitional justice interventions involving victims of dislocation and
   violence, as well as the potential for hidden harms. It is based on nine
   years of ethnographic research into a small returnee community in
   Kozarac, in the municipality of Prijedor. Well-intentioned as the
   project undoubtedly was, it had unintended consequences for the social
   relations of the local community. Like other internationally led
   initiatives, it can be argued that it helped reinforce a
   victim-perpetrator dynamic that prevented rather than assisted progress.
   Although we cannot draw too many conclusions from one project, the
   issues highlighted by this initiative have been echoed on a smaller
   scale in much of the international involvement of transitional justice
   scholars and activists in the town since then.},

Abstract = {This article interrogates prevalent romanticized understandings of
   music's role in human rights, and suggests new theoretical and practical
   approaches that foreground questions of efficacy and impact. Music is
   often described as a `universal language', a notion that suggests that
   music is both inherently progressive and able to transcend cultural
   differences. I argue instead for a more complex, constrained view of
   music and its role in human rights, with a greater emphasis on methods
   and practice. Based in part on my research and observations in West
   Africa, I describe and critique common uses of music in human rights and
   development projects, and outline suggestions for more focused and
   effective projects. I also suggest conceptualizing music within the
   capabilities framework, as set out by Sen and Nussbaum. In so doing, the
   aim of this article is to stimulate new discussion on how music can
   protect and promote human rights and human capabilities.},

Abstract = {Stalin's purge of his military elite during 1937-1938 is one of the most
   unusual events of the Great Terror. Why would Stalin execute his most
   qualified officers at the same time as defence spending was rising and a
   world war was approaching? This article argues that a long history of
   the Red Army being perceived as vulnerable to subversion is central to
   understanding this military purge. When faced with perceived plots in
   the military Stalin tended to lean towards restraint, but by 1937 he
   felt he could no longer hesitate, and finally cracked down on what he
   saw as a compromised army.},

Abstract = {The currently accepted narrative regarding WWII in China suggests that
   Nationalist China and the Third Reich had no diplomatic connections
   after their official break of diplomatic relations in July 1941. Based
   on archival material from Germany, China and Taiwan, this article
   challenges this narrative. As I hope to demonstrate, communications
   between Germany and China continued well after July 1941 through back
   channels. From Switzerland, Chinese agents maintained connections with
   the German party intelligence service (RSHA), and Germany acted as a
   mediator between China and Japan. It is the role that intelligence
   personnel played in maintaining this communication channel and their
   role in clandestine Sino-German relations, which form the foundation of
   this paper.},

Abstract = {This article builds a model for explaining the development of
   supranationalism in EU police cooperation, especially concerning
   Europol. This framework is also helpful for understanding the role of
   police cooperation in EU counter-terrorism policy. The article begins
   with a critical analysis of the analytical framework first development
   in my 2003 book and refines this based key events since 2002, as well a
   few important scholarly perspectives. According to the new model,
   supranationalism is explained by `interest shapers,' which include the
   `spilloverenlargement effect,' crises and shocks, and concerns for
   national sovereignty, democracy, and pragmatism. The development of
   these interests and the resulting supranationalism are also affected by
   `institutional dynamics,' including entrepreneurship, path dependency,
   and bureaucratic resistance. These factors help to explain recent events
   and predict future developments concerning EU police cooperation.},

Abstract = {We need moreand betterdata on social mobility in the United States.
   Normative questions must be answered first. We have to know why we care
   about a particular pattern of mobility to know how to set about
   measuring it. The distinction between relative and absolute mobility is
   a case in point. Do we care most about whether people are better off
   than their parents, or about how much movement there is up and down the
   income ladder? Technical difficulties abound for the measurement of
   mobility. It is important not to lose sight of the motivation for the
   exercise: measuring how far the inequality patterns of one generation
   are impressed upon the next, understanding these replication processes
   empirically, and weakening them. America has a historic commitment to
   the ideal of equality of opportunity. Data on mobility, then, comprise
   the measure of the nation.},

Abstract = {Comparative welfare state research is directed mainly toward the
   development of welfare states in advanced democracies, although the
   majority of people live outside the OECD and often face graver social
   risks arising from poverty and starvation. To secure a minimum standard
   of living, nearly all countries have introduced social programs to
   protect their citizens. Yet the timing of when governments take on the
   responsibility of providing social protection varies decisively across
   the world. Using data for 177 territories and independent states over
   the period from 1820 to 2013, we illustrate how social security
   legislation has emerged throughout the world. Although we find that the
   patterns and pathways vary strongly between different regions, the
   evidence shows that the proliferation of social protection is a
   transnational event: regional diffusion and membership in the
   International Labour Organization matter irrespective of the regional
   and temporal context.},

Abstract = {The December 2011 legislative election was among the most fraudulent
   national elections in Russia since the communist period. The fraud,
   however, was not evenly spread across the country. Precinct-level
   election returns from the 83 regions of the Russian Federation suggest
   that the level of fraud ranged from minimal or small in some regions to
   extreme in some others, with moderate to high fraud levels in many
   regions in between. We argue that in an electoral authoritarian context
   like Russia, regional variation in fraud can be explained by differences
   in (a) the perceived need by regional authorities to signal loyalty to
   the center by ``delivering{''} desired election results; (b) the
   capacity of regional authorities to organize fraud; and (c) the
   vulnerability of citizens to political pressure and manipulation. We
   test the effect of signaling, capacity, and vulnerability on electoral
   fraud in the 2011 legislative elections with data on the 83 regions of
   the Russian Federation. We find evidence for all three mechanisms,
   finding that the tenure of governors in office, United Russia's
   dominance in regional legislatures, and the ethnic composition of
   regions are most important for explaining regional variation in
   electoral fraud.},

Abstract = {Drawing on narrative theory in political science and policy studies,
   this article argues that narratives serve definitional purposes in the
   prostitution policy process, but not all narratives are equally
   influential here. To illustrate, it shares Gloria Lockett's narrative.
   Lockett is a 65-year-old African American former sex worker,
   prostitutes' rights activist, and the cofounder and the current
   executive director of the California Prostitutes Education Project, an
   HIV/AIDS prevention and education nonprofit in the San Francisco Bay
   Area. Although Lockett's narrative does not represent all women in
   prostitution, it complicates dominant understandings of prostitution in
   the United States, contests the current criminalization regime, and
   alerts health authorities to sex workers' occupational health and safety
   concerns. Yet even as others share and support her narrative, various
   legal and ideological factors limit its impact in the policy process.},

Abstract = {In 2012, the NGO Save the Children launched its No Child Born to Die
   campaign with the tagline, Breastfeeding Saves Lives. The press release
   explains that in the first hours and days after a baby is born, their
   mother produces colostrum, a substance known to improve immunity, which
   must be delivered to infants in the first sixty minutes of life; this is
   referred to as the power of the first hour. Invoking a sense of urgency
   and a crisis of infant mortality, which breastfeeding is positioned to
   resolve, the campaign cites staggering medical statistics of infant
   deaths in the campaign targets of Africa, Asia and Latin America, and
   also Northern Indigenous and Inuit reserves in Canada. More than
   misrepresenting racialized women in the developed world as uneducated on
   infant health, childcare and child rearing and as lacking agency and
   empowerment, the campaign mobilizes the erroneous conflation of medical
   science, morality, capitalism and public health - a linkage typically
   mobilized by the development industry to the detriment of globally
   marginalized women. In order to understand how this conflation is
   mobilized to manufacture crisis at the expense of examining the root
   causes of infant mortality globally, we collect theories of crisis
   temporalities to develop a feminist politics of crisis.},

Abstract = {Central to much of the critical political economy (CPE) literature is a
   declared focus on emancipation. Yet, rather than highlight sources and
   instances of activity that might result in emancipatory outcomes, much
   of the CPE literature focuses on relations of domination and the way in
   which these are sustained and (re)produced. In contrast, and drawing on
   autonomist Marxism, we argue that an emancipation-oriented approach
   needs to focus upon the ways in which processes of domination are
   contested, disrupted and as a result remain incomplete. In doing so, we
   present an analysis of the European political and economic crisis that
   contrasts starkly with prevailing accounts. Whilst many observers have
   considered the European crisis in terms that signal the death knell of
   labour's prolonged post-1970s defeat, the paper instead renders visible
   the ongoing disruptive effects of the European populace's obstinate,
   subversive and creative capacity to escape those attempts to achieve
   domination and subjugation which existing accounts tend to identify.},

Abstract = {Industrial policy is an important tool of economic policy-making, and
   this has been the case especially since the onset of the current global
   financial crisis in 2008. However, only relatively few empirical studies
   consider the macroeconomic effects of industrial policy, especially for
   European Union countries. In this study we investigate the effect of
   state aid policy on economic growth and investment, using a panel data
   set which covers 27 European Union countries over the period 1992-2011.
   Our results suggest that state aid policy is not an effective tool to
   achieve higher economic growth and investment rates.},

Title = {Correlates of rigorous and credible transnational governance: A
   cross-sectoral analysis of best practice compliance in eco-labeling},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The number of eco-labeling schemes is rising dramatically, yet the rigor
   and credibility of such schemes remains uneven. Whereas some
   eco-labeling organizations (ELOs) comply with best practice guidelines
   designed to increase the credibility of their standards through
   attention to good operating principles, such as transparency and
   impartiality, others do not. Within this article, I attempt to explain
   this variation through multivariate regression analysis of an original
   cross-sectoral dataset of transnational ELO policies and practices. I
   find compelling evidence to suggest that ELOs with environmental
   non-governmental organization (ENGO) partners, nonprofit structures, or
   broad transnational reach are most likely to comply with best practices.
   I also find that private ELOs are more likely to disregard best
   practices than public ones. Conversely, I find little evidence that
   levels of industry funding or sector-specific competition dynamics
   affect best practice compliance. This study contributes new data, a new
   method of comparison, and new findings to the growing literature on
   transnational governance.},

Abstract = {Emphasizing the presence of similar `supranational' doctrines and a
   `preliminary reference' mechanism, recent scholarship has argued that
   the legal institutions of the Andean Community were designed as replicas
   or clones of those in the European Union. From an alternative
   perspective, however, focused on the importance of inter-state
   retaliation mechanisms, as well as trade remedies, in international
   trade regimes, the similarity is much less apparent. Rather, the Andean
   Community appears to be designed as, and in fact operates as, a treaty
   regime that continues to rely on enforcement and escape behaviours by
   states that are common to many international trade regimes, but have
   been persistently rejected by the EU.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE},

Abstract = {What does transitional justice require if it seeks to achieve justice in
   periods of radical change from oppressive regimes and violent conflict
   to peaceful democracies? 1 The examination of pretransitional injustice
   typically reveals law's instrumentality and its pathological effects,
   namely those caused not only by violations of civil-political human
   rights but also by violations of socioeconomic human rights. A normative
   shift is, therefore, the key to legitimizing the new dispensation. Yet,
   given law's complicity in past injustice, a normative shift is only
   possible on the basis of law's own rehabilitation. Therefore, law's
   normative integrity can only be recovered through a substantive
   rehabilitation of victims' capabilities negatively affected by previous
   human rights violations, especially violations of socioeconomic rights.
   With their capabilities restored, victims of historical injustice will
   be able to participate in the operations of transitional justice and
   function as equal citizens in the new dispensation. Accordingly, the
   imperative of participation based substantially on human rights to
   socioeconomic capabilities is at the heart of this reconceptualization
   of transitional justice.},

Abstract = {There has been much theorizing, but little empirical exploration, of the
   relationship between transitional justice (TJ) and economic structures.
   In this article, we articulate three models implicit in present studies:
   TJ as a roadblock to economic growth; TJ as a bridge to human
   development; and TJ as a vehicle of inequality. We then perform a
   plausibility probe of these models using a new cross-national dataset of
   human rights prosecutions, truth commissions and reparations. We find
   that TJ is correlated with both increasing inequality and human
   development, while it appears unrelated to economic growth. In order to
   clarify the nature of these relationships, we examine the case of
   Argentina. We conclude that TJ, while perhaps a byproduct of global
   inequalities across countries, does not necessarily contribute to the
   expansion of aggregate inequality within specific countries. In fact, it
   might provide some tools for resisting economic abuses.},

Abstract = {Although the United States and Nicaragua maintained cooperative
   relations for a period after the Sandinista revolution of 1979, ties
   between the two states deteriorated. What explains the shift from
   cordial to hostile relations? The two dominant explanations have been
   that the aggressive policies of the new Reagan administration forced the
   Sandinista regime into a defensive position of hostility or that a
   downward spiral occurred based on the security dilemma. This paper
   rejects both and offers an alternative: The Sandinistas for ideological
   and domestic political reasons chose antagonistic relations when they
   opted to arm and support the rebels in El Salvador in violation of an
   earlier agreement between the two states. Drawing on research that shows
   the aggressive tendencies of revolutionary states, the article contrasts
   this theory with the spiral model. Moreover, analysis of the archives of
   the early Reagan administration shows that it wanted to find an
   accommodation with Managua. Although the revolutionary Sandinistas were
   motivated by ideology, Washington was more influenced by geopolitical
   concerns.},

Pages = {402-419},
Abstract = {In this article we seek to address the emerging role of the European
   Union (EU) as a security and intelligence actor from the perspective of
   counter-terrorism. Intelligence as a process and product has been
   strongly promoted by the EU as a useful and necessary tool in the fight
   against terrorism, radicalization, organized crime and public order
   problems. A range of agencies has been established that collect, analyze
   and operationalize intelligence in view of strategically defined
   security threats. Examples are Europol and Frontex. This article makes
   an inventory of their roles and competences in the field of intelligence
   and looks at the list of instruments that encourage the sharing of
   intelligence between different law enforcement and security agencies.
   Moreover, it is argued in this article that as intelligence becomes more
   hybrid and as the EU only holds light powers of oversight on ownership
   and integrity of data, considerable governance challenges lurk around
   the corner. As `intelligence' is usually a complex and sensitive
   product, it often travels outside formal bureaucratic channels, which
   undermines accountability and transparency of where, how and for what
   purpose the intelligence was gathered.},

   Narrative: UKIP's Winning Formula?},

Abstract = {This article brings the interpretive approach to the study of the United
   Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), with the aim of exploring the
   different traditions informing UKIP's thinking and the way it has
   responded to various dilemmas since the party was founded 20 years ago.
   Three traditions interact in UKIP's thinking: the Eurosceptic tradition,
   the conservative tradition and the populist tradition. This article
   examines how the party is positioned in relation to each of these
   traditions and how they have been incorporated and modified into a
   distinctive narrative and as responses to dilemmas. It appears that
   UKIP's populist form of Euroscepticism stands in contrast to the
   elite-based form of Euroscepticism embodied by the Conservative Party -
   to which UKIP is considered as a threat. The article also addresses the
   implications of the rise of UKIP for the Conservative Party.

Abstract = {Conditional cash transfers (CCTs) represent an innovation in social
   assistance policy by conditioning welfare benefits on recipients'
   behaviors associated with human capital development. Although social
   assistance has expanded throughout the developing world in the 21st
   century, the political logic guiding CCT adoption differs sharply from
   that of unconditional cash transfers, and from the politics of social
   insurance development. Striking spatial and temporal correlations in
   their adoption also raise the specter of policy interdependence. A
   dynamic logit analysis of social assistance reforms in developing
   nations from 1990 to 2011 reveals that although CCTs have been impelled
   by democratization in developing countries, the model is not embraced
   systematically by the left or the right of the political spectrum.
   Rather, CCTs are more likely to be adopted in contexts of divided
   government and where regional neighbors, and more democratic countries
   in the region, have previously adopted them.},

Abstract = {This essay discusses the medicalisation of contraception by
   gynaecologists in present-day Russia. I explore the disciplining
   discourse and tactics of gynaecologists as experts who aim to orient
   women towards properly planned and prepared pregnancy. Gynaecologists
   are important agents of reproductive control because they instruct women
   in detail about reproductive health and contraception. However, these
   disciplining medical discourses and professional practices are
   characterised by inconsistency. In accordance with the demographic
   priorities of the state, doctors are more oriented towards pregnancy
   treatment than consultation on contraception, and they are inconsistent
   in their regulation of contraceptive use. This biopolitical regime
   reflects the demographic priorities of the Russian stateto increase the
   population of Russiaand the role of women as the primary objects of this
   policy.},

Abstract = {It has become convention in recent years to treat the building of
   institutions as the centerpiece of successful economic reform. The case
   of Estonia challenges this view. Although effective economic
   institutions eventually arose, Estonia began its transition bereft of
   the institutions that supposedly serve as the requisites of robust
   achievement. The institutions only emerged after an ideologically driven
   core of leaders implemented policies that laid the groundwork. In
   particular, the imposition of hard budget constraints sidelined
   political capitalists opposed to the rule of law by severing them from
   the state subsidies, soft loans, and other privileges on which they
   thrive. In the absence of a powerful class of political capitalists,
   Estonian governments were free to forge and continually improve a
   collection of institutions that sets the country apart among its
   postcommunist peers. Good institutions are desirable but not necessary
   for policy reform, and they are better seen as auspicious knock-on
   effects than as prime movers.},

Abstract = {Liberal economists are known to be one of the driving forces behind
   economic liberalisation in various countries, but how did they become so
   politically influential? Constructivists generally suggest that during
   economic crises liberal economists persuaded decision-makers to adopt
   pro-market policy ideas as solutions for economic turbulence. While this
   answer is true, it is also only partial because it disregards the role
   played by governance-related ideas and institutional entrepreneurship in
   the political actions of liberal economists. I argue that ideas
   regarding decision-making mechanisms provided liberal economists with
   the basis for creatively exploiting pre-liberalisation institutions,
   such as central banks and central budget offices, through which these
   economists enhanced their long-term political influence. An in-depth
   examination of a paradigmatic case of economic liberalisation driven by
   liberal economists - Israel's Stabilisation Plan - exemplifies that
   argument. The existence of like-minded economists and similar
   pre-liberalisation policy-making institutions in many other countries
   hints that the Israeli experience is not unique.},

Abstract = {Children have the right to express themselves and to be involved in the
   construction of knowledge. In this article, we argue for the right of
   refugee children to express their thoughts and feelings in research, and
   for the obligation of researchers to enable their self-expression. We
   propose respect as the driving force for enabling children's rights and
   entitlements. As respect is translated and instantiated in the specifics
   of research activities, it brings those rights into practice. We
   describe a set of computer-assisted interviews (CAIs) developed at the
   Victorian Foundation for the Survivors of Torture (VFST). We show how
   they meet the criteria of respect and enable refugee children's
   contributions to knowledge. CAIs allow children to express their
   thoughts and feelings about their own well-being through their
   accessibility, in how they present children with multiple ways to
   contribute to knowledge, and in the usefulness of the individualized
   profiles of responses they provide for holistic analyses. This research
   using CAIs is suitable for providing an evidence base for tailoring
   assessment and services for refugee children and has potential for use
   in rights-based practice.},

Abstract = {We analyze the impact of intermarriage, and transnational social
   relations and experiences on the emergence of European identity.
   According to the structuralist theory of identification, European social
   relations, with European intermarriage as an especially important
   relation, and experiences should explain European identifications. Our
   analysis is based on a survey in Zurich, Switzerland, providing a broad
   array of data that allow testing the impact of a European partner on
   European identification for Swiss and how transnational social relations
   and experiences contribute to both Swiss and non-Swiss feeling European.
   Overall, we find that a partner from another European country (for Swiss
   natives) and transnational social relations and experiences have an
   important role in explaining European identification. The most important
   differences are between Swiss and EU citizens living in Switzerland
   where, for the latter, the meaning of Europe is differently constructed.
   Specifically, EU citizens see less conflict between national and
   European identification.},

Abstract = {Does state weakness lead to representation via taxation? A distinguished
   body of scholarship assumes that fiscal need forced weak(ened) states to
   grant rights and build institutions. The logic is traced to pre-modern
   Europe. However, the literature has misunderstood the link between state
   strength and the origins of representation. Representation emerged where
   the state was already strong. In pre-modern Europe, representation
   originally was a legal obligation, not a right. It became the organizing
   principle of central institutions where rulers could oblige communities
   to send representatives authorized to commit to decisions taken at the
   center. Representation thus presupposed strong state capacity,
   especially to tax. The revision amends our understanding of the
   historical paradigms guiding the literature, as well as the application
   of these paradigms to policies in the developing world. It suggests that
   societal demands for accountability and better governance (the assumed
   aims of representation) are more likely to emerge in response to
   taxation already effectively applied.},

Abstract = {Virtual worlds, persistent online spaces of social interaction and
   emergent gameplay, have hitherto been neglected in International
   Studies. Documents disclosed by Edward Snowden in December 2013 suggest
   that intelligence agencies, including the US National Security Agency
   and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), have been
   less reticent in exploring and exploiting these environments for signals
   and human intelligence. This article introduces virtual worlds as
   sociological sites in the matrix of international politics and explores
   how the intelligence community (IC) has conducted operations in these
   environments, principally for counterterrorism purposes. Reconstructing
   the activities of the IC shows how virtual worlds have been drawn into
   the ambit of state surveillance practices, particularly as a means to
   generate intelligence from virtual-world behaviors that correlate with,
   and predict, real-world behaviors indicative of terrorism and other
   subversive activities. These intelligence activities portend a general
   colonization by the state of previously unregulated interstices of the
   sociotechnical Internet and their analysis contributes to our
   understanding of the relationship between government and the Internet in
   the early twenty-first century.},

Abstract = {This article explores the complex, liminal, and difficult space in which
   stories of women in the Arab Spring were wielded as parts of political
   narratives of gender, race, class, religion, democracy, and
   Westernization in Western media as the Arab Spring unfolded. It examines
   those stories by using the tools of postcolonial feminism. After briefly
   describing what is meant by (gender and) the Arab Spring, the article
   outlines a method for evaluating the significations of the media
   narratives surrounding it. We find two dissonant narratives (of gender
   as emancipatory and of gender as problematic) and ask what assumptions
   about gender (and sex and race and culture) have to be made to produce
   these particular representations. We argue that the dissonant narratives
   have in common using the situation of women as a barometer for the
   success of Westernization, liberalization, and democratization. The
   article concludes by exploring the implications of these findings.},

Title = {Is Prejudice against LGBT Persons Linked to Increased HIV Vulnerability
   for Heterosexual Men? Lessons for Human Rights Advocacy from South
   America},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},

Abstract = {Stigma and discrimination against men who have sex with men (MSM) and
   transsexual-transgender-transvestite (trans) people in Latin America
   increase their vulnerability to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).
   Discrimination in hospitals, schools and workplaces drives them away
   from HIV information, prevention and treatment services that can save
   their lives. This increased vulnerability is reflected in pockets of HIV
   prevalence within these populations, higher than the national averages
   for the general population. This article postulates that prejudice
   against MSM and trans persons is not only life-threatening for them, but
   can also increase the HIV vulnerability of heterosexual males. This
   study explores how negative attitudes towards lesbian, gay, bisexual and
   trans (LGBT) persons among a population of male heterosexual
   long-distance truck drivers in South America may affect their knowledge
   about HIV and AIDS; this, consequently, may affect their HIV
   vulnerability. Employing an independent analysis of an International
   Labour Organization (ILO) survey of 353 long-distance truck drivers from
   Bolivia and Chile, we develop measures of vulnerability to HIV
   transmission and prejudice against LGBT persons. We find that
   vulnerability is strongly associated with prejudice. We conclude that a
   culture of prejudice against LGBT persons in the workplace has a
   detrimental impact on heterosexual men's knowledge and attitudes,
   increasing their HIV vulnerability. One implication is that promoting
   the human rights of the LGBT community must be mainstreamed into HIV
   prevention efforts. Another is that work should be done on emphasizing
   the interconnectedness of human rights. This could make an impact in
   halting the AIDS epidemic across the board.},

Abstract = {The bulk of the literature on `social Europe' has suggested that social
   policy at the level of the EU remains to be characterized by the
   interplay of courts and markets. While we do not disagree with this
   argument, our objective is to shed light on the European Commission's
   entrepreneurship, an element which appears to be somewhat bereft of
   scholarly attention. We show how, by displaying social acuity, defining
   problems and building teams, the Commission has actively promoted a
   policy agenda focused on liberal market building at the expense of
   socially minded regulation. This was however only made possible by a new
   constellation among the Member States after 2004. We substantiate this
   claim by documenting the activity of the Commission in two crucial
   policy domains of the post-Lisbon era: the liberalization of service
   provision, and the impact of the new macro-economic governance on social
   policy after the financial and debt crisis.},

Abstract = {Why are US labor unions so weak? Union decline has had important
   consequences for politics, inequality, and social policy. Common
   explanations cite employment shifts, public opinion, labor laws, and
   differences in working class culture and organization. But comparing the
   United States with Canada challenges those explanations. After following
   US unionization rates for decades, Canadian rates diverged in the 1960s,
   and are now nearly three times higher. This divergence was due to
   different processes of working class political incorporation. In the
   United States, labor was incorporated as an interest group into a labor
   regime governed by a pluralist idea. In Canada, labor was incorporated
   as a class representative into a labor regime governed by a class idea.
   This led to a relatively stronger Canadian labor regime that better held
   employers in check and protected workers' collective bargaining rights.
   As a result, union density stabilized in Canada while plummeting in the
   United States.},

Abstract = {What explains how some international agreements allow countries to buy
   their way out of violations? In some regimes, offering to compensate
   affected parties renders a violation permissible; in others,
   compensation serves at most a provisional function, with full compliance
   the only satisfactory outcome. While allowing for breach-and-pay in
   instances where it leaves all parties better off appears optimal,
   institutions vary a great deal in the extent to which they tolerate such
   ``efficient breach.{''} To account for this variation, we consider how
   the design of the agreement affects the odds of mobilization of domestic
   groups. We argue that when the benefits from violations accrue mainly to
   government itself, efficient breach does leave governments better off.
   Yet when governments benefit only indirectly, through the political
   support offered by interest groups who are the direct beneficiaries of
   violations, the possibility of efficient breach increases the payoffs
   from mobilization. In those cases, allowing for efficient breach
   strengthens the domestic opposition to the very liberalization pursued
   by the treaty. Our model predicts that international trade agreements
   should spurn efficient breach, while investment agreements should favor
   it. We test these implications by considering dispute settlement and
   enforcement mechanisms in both regimes.},

Abstract = {Europe's affluent democracies adopted different policy strategies to
   buffer their labor markets from the effects of the worldwide recession
   that followed the financial crisis in 2007. This article offers a
   sociologically anchored historical institutionalist explanation to
   account for this divergence. Reviewing the politics of employment
   policymaking before, during, and after the crisis in the United Kingdom,
   Germany, and Denmark, the article traces partisan actors' tactics of
   maneuvering within the constraints of institutionally embedded mass
   preferences to legitimate their policies and improve their electoral
   performance. The analysis moves beyond contemporary treatments of
   path-dependent institutional evolution in two important ways. Rather
   than focusing on how arrangements at the work-welfare nexus provide
   actors with particular functional benefits and differential power
   resources, it examines institutions' ideational effects on the
   construction of electorates' interests. Moreover, it illuminates
   partisan politicians' room for strategic agency, breaking with
   interpretations that view government responses as the product of
   particular producer group coalitions.},

Abstract = {The fight against political, especially government, corruption has
   dominated Romanian political discourse for many years. However, the vast
   majority of the political elite have continuously opposed the
   prosecution and conviction of defendants of corruption crimes. After a
   long constitutional conflict that seriously inhibited the fight against
   government corruption between 2006 and 2009, law enforcement agencies
   finally began to experience some success. Nevertheless, the extent of
   government corruption has remained consistently high. This article
   analyses the struggles that have occurred between 2004 and 2013 in the
   fight against government corruption in Romania and particularly examines
   the interplay between formal and informal factors in this field.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to consider certain consequences of large
   post-crisis capital flows in advanced economies. Specifically, I offer
   an examination of the Swiss response to large capital inflows during the
   early stages of the global financial crisis. Why did the Swiss National
   Bank (SNB) intervene in the foreign exchange market and introduce an
   exchange rate floor? Why did the SNB gamble with its highly valued
   anti-inflationary reputation in attempting to stem the appreciation of
   the Swiss franc? To answer these questions, this paper suggests a
   broader and more complete explanation than one that focuses solely on
   the configuration of domestic interests. Specifically, the paper argues
   that a thorough explanation of the SNB's response requires accounting
   for the changing monetary paradigm of the central banking community.
   This emerging monetary paradigm influenced the SNB's policy decisions by
   making the SNB particularly sensitive to financial stability risks and
   by providing it with the policy space to experiment with
   (macroprudential) tools to manage these risks.},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Based on survey research, elite interviews, and an analysis of media
   treatment, this article explores the place of oil and gas in Russia's
   national narrative and self-identity. Objectively, Russia's economic
   development, political stability, and ability to project power abroad
   rest on its oil and gas resources. Subjectively, however, Russians are
   somewhat reluctant to accept that oil and gas dependency is part of
   their national identity. This is particularly true of the elites who
   play a crucial role in defining the dominant national narrative.
   Ordinary Russians generally have quite positive attitudes about the role
   of Gazprom and Russia's emergence as an ``energy superpower{''} - while
   at the same time being wary of becoming a ``raw materials appendage{''}
   of the outside world. One of the unexpected findings to emerge from the
   survey data is the strong regional differences on the question of
   whether Russia should be proud of its reliance on energy. Gazprom is
   popular in the Central Federal District, but less so as one moves east.
   The article concludes with an analysis of the factors constraining the
   role of energy in Russia's national narrative: the prominent history of
   military victories and territorial expansion; a strong commitment to
   modernization through science and industry; and concerns over
   corruption, environmental degradation, and foreign exploitation.},

Abstract = {Public policy initiatives aimed at the prevention of future financial
   crises originate with global harmonization in the form of executive
   standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. This
   article explores the role of the European Parliament (EP) in the process
   of adapting the standards in European Union legislation passed in 2013
   as the Capital Requirements Regulation/Capital Requirements Directive
   IV. Unlike accounts casting the EP as increasingly dependent upon
   outside sources in order to meet its enhanced legislative role, we find
   it increasingly dexterous in developing and using in-house policy ideas,
   expertise, and not least a common sense of institutional purpose.
   Notable EP successes in final legislation include (but are not
   restricted to) a headline cap on bankers' bonuses in the face of
   entrenched business and national interests. The argument is developed by
   drawing upon a broad range of interviews together with other primary and
   secondary sources, tracing the contribution of the EP from the early
   stages of agenda-setting through to the development of an esprit de
   corps among the committee lead team which survived intact throughout the
   black box of trilogue negotiations. Besides illuminating the notoriously
   opaque trilogue process, the analysis also contributes to contemporary
   debates about whether the EP's increased legislative powers are
   resulting in a shift away from its traditional allegiances with diffuse
   interests toward a greater engagement with producer sources in order to
   fulfill requirements for policy expertise.},

Abstract = {Tamar Verete-Zehavi's youth novel Aftershock follows one girl's personal
   process of addressing a painful past. By analysing the way the novel
   engages young readers, this article aims to show how children's
   literature can be a site of civic socialization and ensure children's
   involvement in transitional justice processes as active and autonomous
   agents. Reading the novel against two examples of textual outreach
   materials that target children and were produced by transitional justice
   mechanisms reveals what literature can offer transitional justice in
   terms of the realization of children's rights and freedoms, beyond its
   conventional engagement with these audiences. The article argues that
   children's literature may prove an important complement to the work of
   traditional transitional justice mechanisms and their outreach
   programmes.},

Abstract = {Stockholm syndrome, or captor-bonding, is a psychological crisis
   response to which women are considered especially susceptible. The term
   was coined in connection with a 1973 hostage situation in Stockholm,
   Sweden. I argue that the syndrome originally indicated a crisis of state
   authority. The conception of Stockholm syndrome projected a crisis of
   the legitimate state onto the women hostages and reinforced connections
   between state protection, masculinity and physical force. Crisis
   narratives specifically targeted the women's agency, and the state's
   protector status was restored by gendering dependency and victimhood.
   The particular circumstances of the original Stockholm incident were a
   prerequisite for the syndrome's appearance and continue to inform common
   understandings and scholarly writing on the syndrome. When crisis
   discourse appropriates the Stockholm syndrome, a unitary perspective and
   gendered foundations of state power are reinforced. Possibilities of
   divergent perspectives and counter-discourses, which are critical to
   feminist interventions into crisis narratives, are thereby diminished.},

Abstract = {This article uses data from the 1993-2011 national legislative elections
   in Russia in order to systematically measure and explain the dynamics of
   party system nationalization. The analysis registers a salient
   discrepancy between the extremely low levels of territorial homogeneity
   of the vote in the single-member plurality section of Russia's electoral
   system (1993-2003), on the one hand, and very high levels of party
   nationalization in party-list contests, on the other. This discrepancy,
   facilitated by such factors as the legacies of regime transition,
   federalism, and presidentialism, was reinforced by the integration of
   gubernatorial political machines into the nationwide political order,
   which ultimately resulted in unprecedentedly high levels of party
   nationalization in the 2007-2011 elections. The findings challenge a
   conventional theory that equates the formation of national electorates
   to the progressive process of party system consolidation, suggesting
   that under certain conditions, related but not reducible to the
   authoritarian perversion of the structure of electoral incentives, there
   is no such linear relationship.},

Abstract = {Contemporary political economy debates tend to assume that an increase
   in productivity automatically leads to an equal increase in workers'
   wages. This assumption shapes the way that many scholars think about
   economic globalization, as well as domestic policy reforms. This
   assumption is particularly widespread in the field of international
   political economy, where it is implicitly incorporated through the use
   of neoclassical economic models. Rather than explore the distributional
   struggle between capital and labor, these models use the assumption of
   full employment to predict that policies that increases worker
   productivity automatically leads to an equal increase in workers' wages.
   In contrast, this article argues that the degree to which wages increase
   along with productivity depends on the domestic institutions that
   protect workers' rights to act collectively. This article tests the
   relationship between worker productivity and wages by analyzing data
   from twenty-eight manufacturing industries, in 117 countries, from 1986
   to 2002. The results demonstrate that the degree to which an increase in
   worker productivity leads to an increase in wages depends on a country's
   level of protection for labor rights.},

Abstract = {Global brands remain under increasing pressure to ensure labor standards
   and codes of conduct are met by their suppliers. Little is known about
   how this is addressed by lower tier suppliers. We investigate whether,
   and how, occupational health and safety standards permeate down the
   computer industry value chain. We compare first and second tier
   suppliers' engagement with a private voluntary industry code, the
   Electronic Industry Code of Conduct, and the publicly regulated European
   Union Directive on the Restriction of Hazardous Substances. We find the
   industry code absent at the lower tier, yet second tier suppliers do
   implement the European Union Directive. This is achieved without support
   from public agencies or global value chain linkages. Our findings
   question the emphasis placed on chain governance in studies of labor
   compliance in global value chains, and suggest that alternative and
   complementary approaches may be required for effective labor compliance
   throughout the value chain.},

Abstract = {This article explains the origins of the Australia-New Zealand-United
   States (ANZUS) Treaty by highlighting U.S. ambitions in the Pacific
   region after World War II. Three clarifications to the historiography
   merit attention. First, an alliance with Australia and New Zealand
   reflected the pursuit of U.S. interests rather than the skill of
   antipodean diplomacy. Despite initial reservations in Washington,
   geostrategic anxiety and economic ambition ultimately spurred
   cooperation. The U.S. government's eventual recourse to coercive
   diplomacy against the other ANZUS members, and the exclusion of Britain
   from the alliance, substantiate claims of self-interest. Second, the
   historiography neglects the economic rationale underlying the U.S.
   commitment to Pacific security. Regional cooperation ensured the revival
   of Japan, the avoidance of discriminatory trade policies, and the
   stability of the Bretton Woods monetary system. Third, scholars have
   unduly played down and misunderstood the concept of race. U.S. foreign
   policy elites invoked ideas about a White Man's Club in Asia to obscure
   the pursuit of U.S. interests in the region and to ensure British
   exclusion from the treaty.},

Abstract = {This article concentrates on the North Vietnamese official who became
   the driving force within the Vietnamese Workers' Party (VWP) and was
   crucial in shaping the Vietnamese Communists' protracted war strategy. A
   great deal has been written about the personality and policies of Ho Chi
   Minh, but Le Duan's powerful influence on strategy has been largely
   overlooked. The article covers Le Duan's background and rise to power as
   the VWP First Secretary, as well as his strategic thinking about the
   United States from the 1950s through the deployment of U.S. ground
   troops in 1965. Although other VWP leaders influenced wartime strategy,
   Le Duan as First Secretary carried the greatest weight within the
   Politburo and exerted the strongest influence over the southern
   Communists, who were pivotal in fighting both U.S. and South Vietnamese
   forces. In his role as head of the southern Communists Le Duan developed
   strategies for defeating the United States and then implemented them as
   his power grew. The article spotlights several recurrent themes in his
   thinking: the nature of a protracted war, the role of casualties, and
   U.S. global standing. Each of these subjects influenced how the North
   Vietnamese intended to defeat the United States over the long term and
   offers insights into how Hanoi understood its enemy.},

Abstract = {This article examines Russia's position on the Senkaku/Diaoyu dispute.
   It focuses particularly on the claim that Russia and China are forming
   an anti-Japanese territorial front. Looking closely at official
   statements and actions, as well as Russian-language media and
   scholarship, it finds that Russia, while retaining a position of formal
   neutrality, clearly considers China's claims more favourably. While this
   could be seen to have alarming implications by arraying China and Russia
   on one side against Japan and the USA on the other, the article also
   finds that Russia's support is not without qualifications and that its
   place in the conflict is not yet entrenched.},

Abstract = {Women's empowerment has become a salient issue in nation building in
   recent times. The need to secure basic human rights may well be at the
   core of the attention, but development experts appear to have recognized
   the core role of women in family and community well-being in developing
   countries and are beginning to tout the importance of women's
   empowerment in all the aspects of development policies as reflected in
   the European Union's Millennium Development Goals. This study explores
   political gender differences in Afghanistan, a Muslim country of
   extensive gender differentiation. The gender disparities we observe are
   not what one might have expected. Men outperform women only in those
   specific areas where the prohibitive structural and social limitations
   placed on women by the larger Afghan society would predict. We contend
   that these gaps would attenuate as Afghanistan's nascent democracy
   deepens and extends more freedoms to Afghan women.},

Abstract = {At the center of Chicago's large-scale public housing transformation is
   a stated emphasis on economic integration. Based on interviews, field
   observations, and documentary research in three new, mixed-income
   communities that were built on the footprint of former public housing
   developments in Chicago, this article examines how design choices and
   regulatory regimes militate against the effective integration of public
   housing residents in these contexts. We find that the strategies used to
   maintain social order contribute to redirecting the integrationist aims
   of the development policy toward a kind of incorporated exclusion, in
   which physical integration reproduces marginalization and leads more to
   withdrawal and alienation than to the engagement and inclusion of
   relocated public housing residents and other low-income residents.},

Title = {Spatial Assimilation in US Cities and Communities? Emerging Patterns of
   Hispanic Segregation from Blacks and Whites},
Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {660},
Number = {1},
Pages = {36-56},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article provides a geographically inclusive empirical framework for
   studying changing U.S. patterns of Hispanic segregation. Whether
   Hispanics have joined the American mainstream depends in part on whether
   they translate upward mobility into residence patterns that mirror the
   rest of the nation. Based on block and place data from the 1990-2010
   decennial censuses, our results provide evidence of increasing spatial
   assimilation among Hispanics, both nationally and in new immigrant
   destinations. Segregation from whites declined across the urban
   size-of-place hierarchy and in new destinations. Hispanics are also less
   segregated from whites than from blacks, but declines in Hispanic-black
   segregation have exceeded declines in Hispanic-white segregation. This
   result is consistent with the notion of U.S. Hispanics as a racialized
   populationone in which members sometimes lack the freedom to join whites
   in better communities. Hispanic income was significantly associated with
   less segregation from whites, but income inequality alone does not
   explain overall Hispanic segregation, which remains high. The segmented
   assimilation of Hispanics that we observe supports two seemingly
   contradictory theories: both the idea that spatial assimilation can come
   from economic and cultural assimilation and the notion that economic
   mobility is no guarantee of residential integration.},

Abstract = {The rapid increase in the use and capabilities of Unmanned Aerial
   Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, has led to debates on their place in US
   strategy, particularly their use in assassination missions, or so-called
   targeted killings. However, this debate has tended to focus narrowly on
   two questions: first, whether the US use of UAVs to assassinate its
   enemies, including US citizens, is legal, and second, whether drones
   should be given the autonomy to decide when to kill humans. This paper
   uses the concept of necro-politicsthe arrogation of the sovereign's
   right both to command death and to assign grievable meaning to the
   deadas it emerges in the work of Achille Mbembe to criticize the
   assumptions of these questions. It is argued that debates over endowing
   drones with the autonomy to kill humans assume that the current human
   operators of drones work outside of the context of racial distinction
   and colonial encounter in which they already make decisions to kill. The
   paper supports this argument with reference to the text of a US
   investigation into a strike which killed civilians in Uruzgan province,
   Afghanistan.},

Abstract = {Many examinations of the dimensions of conflict in the European Union
   Council of Ministers focus on the ideological roots of contestation in
   the EU. This article examines the extent to which structural attributes
   of the Member States explain the conflict within the Council of
   Ministers in general as well as in selected policy domains (agriculture,
   fisheries, environment, economic affairs). Drawing on the political
   economy literature of legislative decision-making, a multilevel analysis
   shows that country-level redistributive interests shape the interactions
   considerably and in some of the policy domains that are examined in more
   detail. The impact of ideological variables like the left-right
   positioning of the Member State governments remains inconsistent and
   marginal in this analysis.},

Abstract = {Since the end of the Cold War, the quest to spread democracy has become
   the rallying call of many Western donor agencies. Reflecting this new
   agenda, new program priorities prevailed that placed greater emphasis on
   civil society development, civic engagement and gender empowerment.
   Contrary to expectations, however, many of these programs have often
   adversely affected existing social movements. Most scholars attempting
   to explain these unintended outcomes have focused on the impact of NGO
   professionalization. Examining the Palestinian women's movement, this
   article addresses the inadequacy of this explanation and focuses on the
   political dimension of this discussion by illustrating how Western
   donors' lack of understanding of the Palestinian women's movement and
   its ``embeddedness{''} in the broader political context served to weaken
   and undermine this movement. The influx of Western donor assistance in
   the post-Madrid, post-Oslo era, along with the greater emphasis on
   Western promoted gender empowerment, undermined the cohesiveness of the
   women's movement by exacerbating existing political polarization (that
   went beyond Islamist and secular divisions) and disempowering many
   grassroots activists. Effectively, many of these activists were
   transformed from active political participants involved in their
   organizations to the recipients of skills and services in need of
   awareness raising. Findings in this article also speak to current
   regional developments, especially in light of the current Arab uprisings
   and the promise of greater Western involvement to empower women in the
   region.},

Abstract = {Between 1980 and 2010 California's health care policy field shifted from
   a business-dominated, closed-door pattern of decision making to a more
   open political arena. Through this process, a wide-ranging and diversely
   resourced coalition advocating on behalf of beneficiaries became an
   accepted partner in policymaking. This article examines this
   transformation, considering its broader implications for the political
   dynamics of the public-private welfare state and the role of advocacy
   groups in defending beneficiary interests. We argue that multifaceted
   coalitions exploit three vulnerabilities of the public-private welfare
   state, which presents openings for advancing public priorities: 1)
   diverse and shifting interests, which allow advocates to build broad
   coalitions that include labor and some providers 2) service gaps that,
   when publicized, can generate public outrage; and 3) the hybrid
   institutional form of the public-private welfare state, which can
   connect service delivery organizations with a broader pro-public
   coalition.},

Abstract = {Health issues are increasingly becoming politicized, but little is known
   about how politicization takes shape in the news and its effect on the
   public. We analyze the evolution of politicization in news coverage of
   two health controversies: the uproar over the 2009 mammography screening
   guidelines and the 2006-2007 debate over mandating the HPV vaccine as a
   requirement for middle school-aged girls. We then examine the public
   response to politicization in the HPV case, using original data from a
   survey-embedded experiment that was linked with news coverage in all
   fifty states. We find that real-world politicization is associated with
   decreases in support for HPV vaccine requirements, state immunization
   programs, and confidence in doctors and in government. In addition,
   among those less likely to have encountered real-world politicization,
   we find marginal evidence that exposure to political conflict decreases
   support for state immunization programs and clear evidence that
   politicization reduces confidence in doctors. We discuss the
   implications of these findings and suggest future avenues of research.},

Abstract = {This article leverages normative insights from the dyadic democratic
   peace literature to assess whether the configuration of regime types
   within an intelligence alliance can shape the depth of cooperation
   between its members. The Anglo-Soviet intelligence alliance (1941-45) is
   considered as an initial plausibility probe of this argument. Evidence
   is found to support the premise that cooperation between the
   intelligence services of a democracy and an autocracy is constrained by
   the absence of the democratic norms of bounded uncertainty and
   contingent consent. The article concludes with recommendations on how
   future scholarship can further explore the relationship between regime
   type and the depth of international intelligence cooperation.},

Abstract = {Despite the reflexive nature of historical enquiry and the degree of
   national interconnectness now theorized by historians in the United
   Kingdom, education debates over history teaching in Britain often yield
   a comforting defence of Britain's island story'. The singular island
   story' is an economical narrative device favoured by politicians and
   further mediated through newspapers which profit from such national
   cryogenics. Maintenance of a currency, or crisis, of Britishness can
   also be contrasted with the relative absence of longitudinal or
   comparative enquiry into identity and school curricula. In addition, the
   teaching of states, connections and post-sovereign communities is
   largely under-theorized, potentially contributing to the sterility of
   future debates about citizenship, agency and Britain's wider political
   reach. It is argued here that the public framing of history as
   nationhood and the underdevelopment of children's political literacy are
   mutually reinforcing conditions by which the state has constructed a
   stabilizing, yet shifting presence of the national'.

Abstract = {This article investigates how British European policy thinking has been
   informed by what it identifies as an outsider' tradition of thinking
   about Europe' in British foreign policy dating from imperial times to
   the present. The article begins by delineating five phases in the
   evolution of the outsider tradition back to 1815 through a survey of the
   relevant historiography. The article then examines how prime ministers
   from Margaret Thatcher to David Cameron have looked to various
   inflections of the outsider tradition to inform their European
   discourses. The focus in the speech data sections is on British
   identity, history and the realist appreciation of international politics
   that informed the leaders' suggestions for EEC/EU reform. The central
   argument is that historically informed narratives such as those making
   up the outsider tradition do not determine opinion-formers' outlooks,
   but that they can be deeply impervious to rapid change. We can therefore
   understand why Britain has come to hover near the EU exit door because
   British leaders have consistently drawn upon outsider' narratives as the
   organizing frame for their European policy discourses.
