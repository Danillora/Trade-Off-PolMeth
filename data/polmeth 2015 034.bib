Title = {Mapping out the institutional geography of external security in the EU},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {402-419},
Abstract = {The growth of European Union (EU) competences in the field of external
   security in the last decade has produced a substantial increase in the
   number of EU institutions and bureaucratic actors engaged in the
   planning and management of these policies. Moreover, the expansion of
   competences in such a sovereign sensitive area comes up against the
   persistent intergovernmental nature of the security sector. This has
   resulted, on the one hand, in a complex institutional architecture with
   heavy demands in terms of coordination, and on the other hand, in a
   stark differentiation and stratification of the legal regimes with a
   potential to impact on policy outcomes. This state of uncertainty is
   particularly relevant when looking at relations with countries bordering
   the Union, as the long-standing web of interactions there has developed
   a more complex institutional environment. While most of the scholarly
   literature focuses on single institutional sectors or policies (Common
   Security and Defence Policy, European Neighbourhood Policy, or the
   external side of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice), this study
   seeks to address the issue with a comprehensive analysis of the
   institutional framework that has emerged in the last decade, more
   notably, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. The article
   provides, first, an overview of the EU's institutional actors
   responsible for security policies in the regions bordering the EU, and
   second, an examination of the different mechanisms established to
   address the coordination issue. Finally, this study will argue that the
   traditional military dimension is but one, and certainly not the most
   developed, of the security instruments employed by the EU. At another
   level, it will be argued that the shift of focus from the military to
   other security tools has altered the institutional balance in the
   security sector, substantially adding to the relative influential weight
   of the Commission.},

Abstract = {Cross-cultural cognitive interviewing (CCCI) has increasingly been
   practiced across a range of cultures, languages, and countries, in an
   effort to establish cross-cultural equivalence of survey questions and
   other materials, to detect sources of difficulties in answering survey
   questions for particular subgroups, and to detect problems related to
   translation from source to target languages. Although descriptions of
   such studies have proliferated in both the published and unpublished
   literatures, there has been little effort to reconcile discrepant views,
   approaches, and findings. The current synthesis reviews 32 CCCI studies
   located in peer-reviewed journals and books, along with key unpublished
   sources, to characterize these investigations in terms of their purpose,
   procedures, and findings. Based on a number of trends in this emergent
   field, conclusions are made concerning appropriate methods for cognitive
   testing of cross-cultural instruments, and recommendations are made for
   future practices that will serve to advance the CCCI field.},

Abstract = {As the specter of HIV looms in the background, Botswana's industry of
   orphan-focused aid interventions reflects deep-seated anxieties about
   girls' bodies, health, sexuality, and morality. As foreign NGO staff
   lament ``patriarchal{''} norms that supposedly leave orphaned girls
   culturally and economically ill-equipped to refuse advances from older
   men, these organizations seek new ways to liberate orphans from underage
   sexual relationships. I trace how one NGO attempted to render sugar
   daddies unnecessary by directly giving girls the gifts a boyfriend would
   provide, drawing on human rights and empowerment discourses. However,
   many orphans began to appropriate these NGO resources in order to
   attract even wealthier boyfriends, aggressively pursuing age-unequal
   relationships using the very tools the NGO provided to fight them. While
   tales of failed intervention are commonly represented in development
   studies as evidence of either ``culture clash{''} between foreign aid
   and local customs, or as the ``unintended consequences{''} of aid, this
   article argues that such explanations fail to address the competing and
   coalescing moralities that motivated the girls' behavior. By recognizing
   their actions as efforts to manipulate multiple moral codes that are at
   play during the HIV epidemic, I suggest that we may reach a better grasp
   of the inner lives of aid's targets and gain fresh perspectives on the
   intimate sociopolitical effects of intervention.},

Abstract = {This article examines the political consequences of pre-Election Day
   poll restrictions. Our argument is that laws forbidding the publication
   of polling results hamper voters' electoral coordination when the
   information environment is more complex. We rely on aggregated data from
   elections in 46 democracies to show that the number of wasted votes
   increases in countries with highly fragmented party systems when
   pre-Election Day polls are restricted. This evidence is supported with
   individual data from Internet surveys conducted by the Making Electoral

Abstract = {Creating community health worker jobs in the public sector is a
   prominent goal in the global health development industry. According to
   industry leaders, Ethiopia's government has created community health
   worker jobs at a scale and in a way that other countries can look to as
   a model. Based on extensive document review and interviews with
   district, national, and international health officials, we show that
   narratives about saving lives, empowering women, and creating model
   citizens in a context of resource scarcity allow Ethiopia's ruling party
   to obtain international admiration for creating salaried community
   health worker jobs and to simultaneously avoid criticisms of its
   concurrent use of unpaid women's community health labor. Public sector
   community health worker investments in the twenty-first century reveal
   the layered narratives inherent in global development practices that
   entangle states, international donors, NGOs, and citizens.},

Abstract = {Distribution issues have been critical in international negotiations on
   climate change. These have been framed as a `burden sharing' problem
   since the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Three key
   difficulties are associated with this approach under a cap-and-trade
   system, namely the lack of consensus over what is equitable, uncertainty
   over estimates of policy costs, and lack of political realism and
   economic effectiveness of large-scale international transfers. These
   difficulties point to the risk of failure of post-2020 negotiations if
   these are based on the same premises of `sharing the emission reduction
   pie' within a cap-and-trade regime. History has shown that different
   development paths can lead to similar economic performances with
   contrasted emission intensities. This paper proposes some insights into
   what could constitute a way forward, by recasting the discussion about
   emission reductions from a development perspective. It concludes that
   climate negotiations should depart from the current framework and shift
   to a debate focused on choosing a development path that would address
   domestic issues, while aligning pure climate policies with development
   policies.},

Abstract = {Drawing on survey data from ANES, Gallup, Pew, and other polls, this
   article examines attitudes toward the parties and the party system from
   1996 to 2014. A previous Poll Trends analysis of the parties, through
   1995, found antipathy toward the party system but not toward the parties
   themselves. The data since 1996 demonstrate that extreme discontent now
   extends beyond the party system to the Republican and Democratic
   parties. The data also show that Americans have grown more likely to see
   sharp differences between the major parties, and to perceive both
   parties as too ideological. As for the party system, Americans express a
   high degree of ambivalence. On one hand, many believe that the major
   parties do not do an adequate job of representing the people, and that
   the country needs a third political party. On the other hand, there is
   skepticism that a third party would improve the quality of American
   democracy. Surveys continually register almost no support or even
   willingness to seriously consider support for a third-party candidate.},

   Election Predictions},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Pages = {518-533},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Mass election predictions are increasingly used by election forecasters
   and public opinion scholars. While they are potentially powerful tools
   for answering a variety of social science questions, existing measures
   are limited in that they ask about victors rather than voteshares. We
   show that asking survey respondents to predict voteshares is a viable
   and superior alternative to asking them to predict winners. After
   showing respondents can make sensible quantitative predictions, we
   demonstrate how traditional qualitative forecasts lead to mistaken
   inferences. In particular, qualitative predictions vastly overstate the
   degree of partisan bias in election forecasts, and lead to wrong
   conclusions regarding how political knowledge exacerbates this bias. We
   also show how election predictions can aid in the use of elections as
   natural experiments, using the effect of the 2012 election on partisan
   economic perceptions as an example. Our results have implications for
   multiple constituencies, from methodologists and pollsters to political
   scientists and interdisciplinary scholars of collective intelligence.},

Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN POLITICS AND SOCIETY},

Volume = {57},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1-26},

Abstract = {This article shows that the institutional design of Argentine federalism
   allows for differences in the protective scope of the provincial
   domestic violence laws. It holds that the broad legislative capacities
   of subnational districts enable the working of political and social
   local factors, which, in turn, determine heterogeneity in these laws'
   protective scope. It analyzes, compares, and measures 37 laws on
   domestic violence sanctioned between 1992 and 2009. It advances a
   methodology to measure their differences and it evaluates the impact
   local factors have on legal variations across jurisdictions. The article
   shows that the protective scope of these laws is determined by the
   intensity of the local electoral competition and by the strength of
   women's organizational capacity. Results also show that time matters
   insofar as it allows for the diffusion of more protective laws.},

Abstract = {Information Sharing and Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) are at the heart
   of the contemporary maritime security agenda. The goal of MDA is to
   develop shared understandings of developments and threats at sea. It is
   one of the preconditions for coordination and cooperation between
   diverse maritime security agencies and has often been understood as
   ``key enabler{''}. MDA is a major technical challenge in terms of
   collecting and fusing data and developing expert systems for the
   detection of anomalies. It is also a social, political and legal
   challenge. This study focuses on the latter. It asks how MDA can be
   organized and how the socio-political challenges can be addressed. The
   organization of MDA in Southeast Asia is discussed in-depth, with a
   focus on three major centres that are the backbone of the regional MDA
   structure. Although far from perfect, this regional system has become a
   role model for organizing MDA in other parts of the world. This article
   explores the functions that the three centres perform in the governance
   of maritime security in the region. I argue that each of the MDA centres
   has different strengths, and that their work should be seen as
   complimentary in an overarching system. The strength of the overall
   system is in enabling trust and being flexible and adaptable to the
   changing situation at sea. The conclusion outlines what lessons the
   system holds for the organization of MDA in other regions with a focus
   on the Western Indian Ocean.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN COMPARATIVE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {50},

Abstract = {This paper examines a global campaign in which transnational advocacy
   networks challenged the monopoly rights of Abbott Laboratories over the
   antiretroviral drug Kaletra. It focuses on the cases of Colombia and
   Ecuador and analyzes the different trajectories of the campaign in the
   two countries and how each trajectory contributed differently to the
   global outcome. In both of these cases, I show that activism operated in
   an ``inverse boomerang{''} pattern, by which an international NGO
   reached out to local allies to expand its global coalition, prioritizing
   its agenda over other domestic considerations. I argue that in cases
   where transnational campaigns are initiated globally, there is a
   potential mismatch between global and domestic goals and that the
   campaigns' contribution to global norm-making depends on the type of
   relationship established between international advocates and domestic
   actors. Such relationships are in turn influenced by the political and
   economic context and the institutional arrangements of each country.},

Abstract = {Why do drug gangs develop sophisticated authority functions in some
   places and not in others? Comparing two Brazilian cities, Rio de Janeiro
   and Recife, this article argues that territorially embedded informal
   authority structures from earlier times, coupled with sporadic and
   extremely violent policing, encouraged drug gangs in Rio de Janeiro to
   develop authoritative functions and residents to acquiesce to them. In
   Recife, by contrast, drug gangs inherited diffuse and territorially
   independent authority structures and confronted a much less lethally
   violent police force. Consequently, they failed to find common cause
   with local residents, and their organizational development was
   truncated.},

Abstract = {This forum article outlines a research agenda focused on linkages
   between the UNFCCC and other governance arrangements that also address
   climate change. We take as our point of departure the recognition that
   the UNFCCC is no longer the sole site of global climate change
   governance, and thus the types of linkage across what we call the global
   climate governance landscape including as a central node the UNFCCC are
   important for thinking through how improved global responses to climate
   change may be pursued. The forum identifies two specific types of
   linkage: division- of- labor linkages and catalytic linkages. We
   illustrate these with some examples and raise questions we believe would
   be useful to pursue in future research.},

Abstract = {Renewable energy technology (RET) currently faces many barriers that
   hinder its effective integration into established energy systems. As a
   result, various advocacy mechanisms are often needed to market RET
   effectively, including the expression of geopolitical benefits
   associated with RET development, a tactic that is said to elevate the
   strategic power position of RET within the energy politics game.
   However, no studies examine how, when, and by whom geopolitical
   argumentation is constructed for marketing RET. This article addresses
   this research gap by examining publicized planning and parliamentarian
   protocols on the promotion of solar energy in the Israeli Negev Desert
   from 2001 through 2012. The analysis finds that RET is marketed through
   geopolitics as an enhancement of energy independence and as a platform
   for regional cooperation. Geopolitics was voiced mostly in political
   venues by politicians, after external and internal contextual events
   that hindered RET development. Many linguistic devices, such as
   narratives and simple binary relations, were used to justify the
   potential geopolitical benefits of RET to decision-makers, often through
   rhetoric grounded in power, ideology, and geography.},

Abstract = {While many authors have argued that domestic regulatory gaps as well as
   a lack of international cooperation can at least partly explain the
   emergence of non-state regulation, this article will focus on an
   underexplored pathway of emergence linking international, domestic, and
   non-state regulation. I will argue that even in the presence of a widely
   supported international agreement, a non-ratifying country can provide
   the setting for the emergence of non-state certification programs. This
   will happen when significant domestic legislation on the topics covered
   by the agreement is absent, and non-state actors are able to act as
   institutional entrepreneurs with an interest in implementing key
   elements of this agreement. By tracing the development of certification
   programs for the electronic waste (e-waste) recycling industry, I will
   show why the US, more than other countries, provided an enabling
   environment for the emergence of non-state e-waste recycling
   certification. The US's failure to ratify the Basel Convention on
   transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and an overall lack of
   domestic legislation on e-waste exports created regulatory gaps that
   non-state actors were able to fill. The main global watchdog of the
   Convention-the US-based Basel Action Network-used certification as a
   forum-shifting strategy to implement key parts of the Convention in the
   US. Finally, the article will also show that conflicting interests and
   divergent perspectives on the legitimacy of the Convention and its rules
   have led to the development of a competing industry-supported
   certification program.},

Abstract = {Between 1952 and 1970, Gamal Abdel Nasser and Egypt's Free Officers
   Movement established the paradigmatic pan-Arabist revolution from above.
   Yet it has become something of a cliche to maintain that the Free
   Officers had no blueprint of action before seizing power and that they
   later instrumentalised pan-Arabism in their foreign policy, thinly
   veiling their actual commitments to Egyptian nationalism and
   imperialism. By contrast, this contribution underlines the impact of the
   British colonial context on the Free Officers' political formation and
   their early identification with pan-Arabism in turn. Drawing on
   pamphlets, speeches, media output and memoirs, it shows that the Free
   Officers developed a distinctive form of anticolonial nationalism that
   emphasised social justice and invoked overlapping Egyptian and Arab
   identities. Their aspirations for liberation thus entailed a connected
   foreign policy and nation building programme in which pan-Arabism was a
   prime - and early - component.},

Abstract = {Mobile phone use has become a defining feature of what it means to be
   young, and the relatively remote Lao-Vietnamese borderland area that is
   the focus of this study is no exception. Drawing on Benedict Anderson's
   ImaginedCommunities, this article investigates the interplay between the
   everyday styles of being young, the forces of digital capitalism and the
   enactment of nationalism. We do this with a focus on ethnic minority
   youth's appropriation of the mobile services offered by Viettel, the
   most popular mobile services provider in the study area and owned by the
   Vietnamese Ministry of Defence. We suggest that the everyday
   performances of being young, revolving around the mobile phone, are
   affected by the forces of digital capitalism. We further suggest that
   the cultural context of Viettel's digital capitalism is embedded in a
   fabric of Vietnamese nationalism, leading ethnic minority youth,
   consciously and unconsciously, to enact nationalism through their
   everyday styles of being young.},

Title = {TRUE COLORS WHITE CONSERVATIVE SUPPORT FOR MINORITY REPUBLICAN
   CANDIDATES},
Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {79},
Number = {1},
Pages = {28-52},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Although the vast majority of minority candidates run under the
   Democratic label and minority voters are more supportive of the
   Democratic Party, in recent years a nontrivial number of minority
   candidates have won Republican Party nominations in high-profile
   elections (i.e., governor and US Senate). In this study, we assess the
   level of support that white conservative voters give to minority
   Republican candidates. We are interested in seeing whether these voters
   are less supportive of the Grand Old Party (GOP) standard-bearer when
   the candidate is not white, since the vast majority of Republican
   candidates and Republican identifiers are non-Hispanic whites. Our data
   come from the 2006, 2010, and 2012 Cooperative Congressional Election
   Study (CCES) surveys-election years with minority Republican nominees
   for governor and US Senate. Controlling for various factors, we
   consistently find that white conservatives are either more supportive of
   minority Republicans or just as likely to vote for a minority as they
   are a white Republican (a null result). Although we hesitate to dismiss
   the presence of racial prejudice in voting behavior, in the case of
   white conservatives our analyses suggest that the base of the GOP does
   not discriminate against minority nominees in high-profile contemporary
   general elections. At a minimum, the level of ideological polarization
   in American politics masks racially prejudiced voting behavior, and at a
   maximum, it renders it inoperable, because white conservatives view
   recent minority Republican nominees as at least as conservative as white
   GOP nominees and their level of support reflects this.},

Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN POLITICS AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {Import substitution industrialization was the postwar development policy
   of choice in Latin America, and the diagnosis of its weaknesses heavily
   influenced subsequent policy recommendations. Yet few attempts have been
   made to test the predominant sectorally based explanation of ISI's
   failings against alternatives. This article develops a model of direct
   (clientelistic) linkages between politicians and their supporters and
   tests it against the standard sectoral model based on indirect linkages.
   Examining three features of process (economic sector influence,
   legislative voting, and exchange rate policy) and analyzing the
   distributional implications of the overall policy in Brazil, this
   article demonstrates that a clientelist model provides a more complete
   and coherent account of the empirical record. By demonstrating that
   variation in linkage type alters the political constraints on policy
   choice, the analysis also provides new insight into enduring puzzles,
   including the better performance in East Asia.},

Title = {Integrating the Central European Past into a Common Narrative: The
   Mobilizations Around the `Crimes of Communism' in the European
   Parliament},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {344-363},
Abstract = {After the Cold War, a new constellation of actors entered transnational
   European assemblies. Their interpretation of European history, which was
   based on the equivalence of the two `totalitarianisms', Stalinism and
   Nazism, directly challenged the prevailing Western European narrative
   constructed on the uniqueness of the Holocaust as the epitome of evil.
   This article focuses on the mobilizations of these memory entrepreneurs
   in the European Parliament in order to take into account the issue of
   agency in European memory politics. Drawing on a social and political
   analysis centered on institutionally embedded actors, a process-tracing
   analysis investigates the adoption of the furthest-reaching official
   expression of a `totalitarian' interpretation of Communism to date: the
   Resolution on European Conscience and Totalitarianism from April 2009.
   This case study shows that the issue was put on the parliamentary agenda
   by a small group of Central and Eastern European politicians who had
   managed to `learn the ropes' of effective advocacy in the Assembly. An
   official vision of Communism then emerged through intense negotiations
   structured by interwoven ideological and national lines of division.
   However, this narrative largely remains of regional, rather than
   pan-European, relevance. In the competition for the definition of
   `Europe' and its values, the persistent diversity in the assessment of
   Communism gives evidence of the local rootedness of remembrance despite
   the pan-European ambitions of memory entrepreneurs.},

Abstract = {With European Union Training Missions (EUTM) Mali and EUTM Somalia, the
   EU seeks to stabilize countries facing state weakness caused by
   intrastate conflict. While the EU formally promotes security sector
   reform (SSR) through its foreign policy, the EUTM missions in Mali and
   Somalia in one sense can be described as ``counterinsurgency by
   proxy{''} as military trainees combat local insurgencies shortly upon
   graduation. This raises the question whether the EUTM missions are
   consistent with SSR aims, such as creating a security sector that is
   legitimate, sustainable, and under civilian control, or inadvertently
   risk contributing to negative side effects in the medium term. Based on
   extensive interviews in Belgium, Kenya, Mali, Sweden, and Uganda with
   personnel who either served in or planned these missions, this study
   analyses factors which hinder the EUTM concept from being fully
   consistent with SSR and identifies possible policies to ameliorate the
   risk of unintended side effects.},

Abstract = {Political scientists often turn to natural experiments to draw causal
   inferences with observational data. Recently, the regression
   discontinuity design (RD) has become a popular type of natural
   experiment due to its relatively weak assumptions. We study a special
   type of regression discontinuity design where the discontinuity in
   treatment assignment is geographic. In this design, which we call the
   Geographic Regression Discontinuity (GRD) design, a geographic or
   administrative boundary splits units into treated and control areas, and
   analysts make the case that the division into treated and control areas
   occurs in an as-if random fashion. We show how this design is equivalent
   to a standard RD with two running variables, but we also clarify several
   methodological differences that arise in geographical contexts. We also
   offer a method for estimation of geographically located treatment
   effects that can also be used to validate the identification assumptions
   using observable pretreatment characteristics. We illustrate our
   methodological framework with a re-examination of the effects of
   political advertisements on voter turnout during a presidential
   campaign, exploiting the exogenous variation in the volume of
   presidential ads that is created by media market boundaries.},

Abstract = {Environmental Impact Assessment (EM) is a central process in sustainable
   development to mitigate the anticipated impacts of development projects.
   Every national government in mainland Southeast Asia has, or is in the
   process of developing, legislation on environmental governance and
   shares a common interest in implementing and enforcing EM. Yet despite
   the fact that significant environmental impacts occur across borders, no
   multi-country EM agreements have yet been passed and implemented.
   Increased regional cooperation could present an opportunity to address
   this gap, potentially linked to ASEAN or other regional organizations.
   Based on this hypothesis, a consultative research process under the
   auspices of the Mekong Partnership for the Environment interviewed 127
   key stakeholders in five countries (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand,
   and Vietnam) to assess the positions, levels of influence and readiness
   to cooperate on EIA principles and standards. Using a political economy
   approach, the research team found strong support among government and
   non-governmental stakeholders alike for reform of national EIA
   procedures, increased public participation and the development of
   regional EM standards. At present, government officials in some
   countries favour increased cooperation, while others express
   reservations and concerns about the value of such cooperation. The
   article explores the underlying interests and incentives behind these
   varied standpoints and concludes with a discussion of possibilities for
   regional institutions, national governments and donor agencies to
   advance cooperation on environmental governance.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the paradox in post-conflict societies of
   continued marginality of cross-ethnic parties despite significant
   convergence in public attitudes and identities. In so doing, it examines
   the argument that parties that attempt to reach across the divide are
   constrained by consocational institutions designed to accommodate rival
   identities in such environments. The paper explores this puzzle in the
   context of Northern Ireland, drawing upon qualitative evidence from
   elite interviews and focus groups collected in 2012 and 2013. It
   concludes that cross-community parties operating in the region do
   encounter formal institutional barriers, but that such barriers only
   partially explain the phenomenon and an interplay between formal and
   informal constraints underlies their position of relatively limited
   electoral success.},

Abstract = {Web questionnaires, including those used in mixed-mode surveys,
   generally produce higher levels of item nonresponse than
   interviewer-administered questionnaires. Item nonresponse is generally
   seen as having a detrimental impact on data quality. The current study
   examines using motivational statements to reduce item nonresponse in a
   web survey component of a mixed-mode design. The effects of alternative
   implementations are compared, both for web surveys and for mixed-mode
   surveys. In addition, the mixed-mode results are compared to a
   face-to-face survey. The current study adds to the literature on the use
   of motivational statements by using a unique large-scale randomized
   experiment to examine the impact of the timing of the motivational
   statement, and to compare with the same survey in an
   interviewer-administered context. Findings show that a motivational
   statement following immediately after an item is left unanswered greatly
   outperforms either the control or a motivational statement at a later
   point in the survey. Using this immediate reactive prompt reduces item
   nonresponse to levels equivalent to a face-to-face version. Conversely,
   the control (no statement) and later placed motivational statement lead
   to significantly greater item nonresponse. Point estimates for the
   tested variables are not affected by the additional responses obtained.
   The results suggest practical design implications to reduce item
   nonresponse when using a web design, specifically the use of a reactive
   motivational prompt in a planned way.},

Abstract = {As address-based sampling becomes increasingly popular for multimode
   surveys, researchers continue to refine data-collection best practices.
   While much work has been conducted to improve efficiency within a given
   mode, additional research is needed on how multimode designs can be
   optimized across modes. Previous research has not evaluated the
   consequences of mode sequencing on multimode mail and phone surveys, nor
   has significant research been conducted to evaluate mode sequencing on a
   variety of indicators beyond response rates. We conducted an experiment
   within the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health across the
   U.S. Risk Factor Survey (REACH U.S.) to evaluate two multimode case-flow
   designs: (1) phone followed by mail (phone-first) and (2) mail followed
   by phone (mail-first). We compared response rates, cost, timeliness, and
   data quality to identify differences across case-flow design. Because
   surveys often differ on the rarity of the target population, we also
   examined whether changes in the eligibility rate altered the choice of
   optimal case flow. Our results suggested that, on most metrics, the
   mail-first design was superior to the phone-first design. Compared with
   phone-first, mail-first achieved a higher yield rate at a lower cost
   with equivalent data quality. While the phone-first design initially
   achieved more interviews compared to the mail-first design, over time
   the mail-first design surpassed it and obtained the greatest number of
   interviews.},

Abstract = {In this introduction, we review the literature on intellectual property
   rights and access to medicines, identifying two distinct generations of
   research. The first generation analyzes the origins of new intellectual
   property rules, in particular the World Trade Organization's Agreement
   on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), and
   the significance of TRIPS to developing countries. The second generation
   examines national-level experiences, as countries adjust their laws and
   practices to conform to TRIPS. Based on the insights provided by the
   articles in the special issue, we contribute to the second generation by
   considering a pair of overarching sets of issues. First, we highlight
   the domestic political challenges that affect how countries go about
   implementing their new obligations under TRIPS. We argue that alliances
   and coalitions are necessary to underpin the use of policy instruments
   designed to conform to TRIPS while taking into account local conditions
   and needs, and we present insights that allow us to understand why
   alliances and coalitions are difficult to construct and sustain in this
   area. Second, we explain why policies that many countries adopt in
   response to TRIPS often do not generate their desired or intended
   outcomes. In the last section of the introduction, we review the
   articles that appear in this special issue.},

Abstract = {This article adopts a risk assessment approach identifying the maritime
   threats and challenges that might confront Asia over the next decade. It
   addresses the evolving strategic environment, shifts in the maritime
   balance of power and the likelihood and impact of particular threats in
   the maritime domain. Issues considered include: the consequences of
   maritime sovereignty disputes; developments in regional naval forces;
   increased exploitation of marine resources, both living and non-living;
   and trends in illegal activity at sea. Three scenarios for the future
   maritime security environment are identified along with the possibility
   of ``strategic shocks{''} that reflect inherent uncertainty in
   attempting predictions of the future. The paper concludes with possible
   measures to mitigate the risks of the threats and challenges.},

Title = {How Robust Standard Errors Expose Methodological Problems They Do Not
   Fix, and What to Do About It},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {159-179},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {``Robust standard errors{''} are used in a vast array of scholarship to
   correct standard errors for model misspecification. However, when
   misspecification is bad enough to make classical and robust standard
   errors diverge, assuming that it is nevertheless not so bad as to bias
   everything else requires considerable optimism. And even if the optimism
   is warranted, settling for a misspecified model, with or without robust
   standard errors, will still bias estimators of all but a few quantities
   of interest. The resulting cavernous gap between theory and practice
   suggests that considerable gains in applied statistics may be possible.
   We seek to help researchers realize these gains via a more productive
   way to understand and use robust standard errors; a new general and
   easier-to-use ``generalized information matrix test{''} statistic that
   can formally assess misspecification (based on differences between
   robust and classical variance estimates); and practical illustrations
   via simulations and real examples from published research. How robust
   standard errors are used needs to change, but instead of jettisoning
   this popular tool we show how to use it to provide effective clues about
   model misspecification, likely biases, and a guide to considerably more
   reliable, and defensible, inferences. Accompanying this article is
   software that implements the methods we describe.},

Abstract = {In many cities of the global North, city leaders are using greening as a
   way to compete in the globalized economy. Critiques of this development
   strategy typically focus on downtown areas, and many have noted that
   such processes often displace poor and working class people. Less
   studied are those areas that have not been fully incorporated into the
   postindustrial economy and where the struggles around social justice,
   economic development, and ecological restoration are still being played
   out. It is this insufficiently informed area of knowledge which this
   paper seeks to address and as to which we ask: What has been the impact
   of the green economy discourse in relatively more marginalized urban
   areas? Using industrial areas of Southeast Chicago and South Seattle as
   case studies, this paper draws on previously unreported qualitative data
   to argue that community efforts to promote environmental justice in
   these areas have the potential to redefine practices of green economic
   growth to incorporate social equity and community coherence. However,
   their ability to do so is constrained by the difficulty in challenging
   neoliberal discourses of the primacy of growth and the need of greening
   to benefit the consumer class. The paper contemplates the implications
   of the lessons learnt for greening cities in both developed and
   developing countries.},

Abstract = {Many types of time series data in political science, including polling
   data and events data, exhibit important features-such as irregular
   spacing, noninstantaneous observation, overlapping observation times,
   and sampling or other measurement error-that are ignored in most
   statistical analyses because of model limitations. Ignoring these
   properties can lead not only to biased coefficients but also to
   incorrect inference about the direction of causality. This article
   develops a continuous-time model to overcome these limitations. This new
   model treats observations as noisy samples collected over an interval of
   time and can be viewed as a generalization of the vector autoregressive
   model. Monte Carlo simulations and two empirical examples demonstrate
   the importance of modeling these features of the data.},

Abstract = {Italian society is undergoing significant demographic changes: on one
   hand, the widespread decrease in birth rates and extended life
   expectancies lead to a substantial aging of the population; on the other
   hand, rising immigration rates constitute an important factor behind the
   renewal and growth of young population segments. According to
   conventional disciplinary divisions, such changes are the established
   domain of demography; however, it mainly draws on ethno-national
   categories to investigate them. In reference to the Italian context,
   this article specifically highlights the way national demography employs
   forecasts and value judgments derived from a qualitative and selective
   definition of population to address the marked increase in children born
   to foreign parents. By examining the reproductive behaviours of migrants
   in Italy, the article thus offers a wide-ranging reflection on the
   social boundaries that shape the formation of an `other' generation.},

Title = {TRADITIONAL VALUES AND THE INGLEHART CONSTRUCTS},
Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {79},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {291-324},
Abstract = {Despite criticism regarding their theoretical foundations and
   composition, Inglehart's values constructs have become near currencies
   in cross-cultural research. Drawing on these critiques, this article
   argues that Inglehart's three most influential instruments measuring
   cultural values-the Postmaterialism Index, the self-expression survival,
   and the secular-traditional measures-obfuscate the complexity of the
   value space at the individual level. To overcome the limitations of
   Inglehart's instruments, I present an alternative method in the form of
   multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), a geometric approach to data
   analysis. MCA separates out those axes of cultural values-religiosity,
   authoritarianism, and materialism-that Inglehart's scales treat as part
   of broader cultural dimensions. The assessment of the configuration
   observed in MCA against dimensions identified with principal component
   analysis and factor analysis shows that the MCA solution is more
   consistent conceptually. A multilevel analysis using a reduced battery
   from the exploratory phase reveals that in most countries the
   religiosity and authoritarianism constructs are not structurally
   equivalent, and therefore cannot be compared. In countries where these
   scales do show a good agreement, the associations with generational
   cohorts confirm that religiosity and authoritarianism constitute
   distinct value domains, and therefore should not be subsumed under
   broader constructs.},

Abstract = {Today's politicians are confronted with new information technologies to
   tackle complex decision-making problems. In order to make sustainable
   decisions, a profound analysis of societal problems and possible
   solutions (policy options) needs to be performed. In this
   policy-analysis process, different stakeholders are involved. Besides
   internal direct advisors of the policy makers (policy analysts),
   external experts from different scientific disciplines can support
   evidence-based decision making. Despite the alleged importance of
   scientific advice in the policy-making process, it is observed that
   scientific results are often not used. In this work, a concept is
   described that supports the collaboration between scientists and
   politicians. We propose a science-policy interface that is realized by
   including information visualization in the policy-analysis process.
   Therefore, we identify synergy effects between both fields and introduce
   a methodology for addressing the current challenges of science-policy
   interfaces with visualization. Finally, we describe three exemplary case
   studies carried out in European research projects that instantiate the
   concept of this approach.},

Abstract = {Scholars have increasingly turned to fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative
   Analysis (fsQCA) to conduct small- and medium-N studies, arguing that it
   combines the most desired elements of variable-oriented and
   case-oriented research. This article demonstrates, however, that fsQCA
   is an extraordinarily sensitive method whose results are worryingly
   susceptible to minor parametric and model specification changes. We make
   two specific claims. First, the causal conditions identified by fsQCA as
   being sufficient for an outcome to occur are highly contingent upon the
   values of several key parameters selected by the user. Second, fsQCA
   results are subject to marked confirmation bias. Given its tendency
   toward finding complex connections between variables, the method is
   highly likely to identify as sufficient for an outcome causal
   combinations containing even randomly generated variables. To support
   these arguments, we replicate three articles utilizing fsQCA and conduct
   sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations to assess the impact of
   small changes in parameter values and the method's built-in confirmation
   bias on the overall conclusions about sufficient conditions.},

Abstract = {In the wake of the 22 May 2014 military coup, Thailand began drafting
   its twentieth constitution since 1932. But the drafting process was
   dogged from the start by fundamental differences between the military
   junta and legal experts working on the new constitution. The military
   wanted to invoke ``the people{''}, yet at the same time suppress their
   actual political participation. The constitution drafters wanted to
   create ``active citizens{''} who were loyal to conservative, royalist
   notions about Thailand's state and society, hoping they would be
   mobilized to police those notions, and so undermine those forces
   supporting a more open democratic politics. In the end, attempts to
   craft a charter shaped by legalistic ideas of moral citizenship and
   virtuous bureaucratic rule foundered in September 2015 when the draft
   constitution was voted down by the National Reform Council, a body whose
   members had been appointed by the junta itself. This article examines
   what was at stake in the struggles over the meanings of Thailand's 2015
   draft constitution, arguing that the junta deliberately sabotaged a
   constitution which embodied a view of the populace that was radically at
   variance with military preferences.},

Abstract = {This study assesses whether polling discrepancies for black candidates
   can be explained by an interaction of racial salience in an election and
   the candidate's electoral strength. We hypothesize that voters will have
   few nonracial justifications for their lack of support for a black
   candidate when race is a salient issue and the candidate is electorally
   viable. As a result, polls will experience more problems with socially
   desirable response bias in such contexts. We use pre-election polls for
   the near-complete universe of black US Senate and gubernatorial
   candidates from 1982 to 2010, statewide polls from the 2008 and 2012
   presidential elections, and an original measure of the racialization to
   test our hypothesis. Our results demonstrate that the racialization of
   the election leads polls to significantly overestimate only support for
   state-level black candidates and President Obama in contexts where the
   candidate has the most electoral strength. In the conclusion, we discuss
   how the results inform pollsters about potential hazards for social
   desirability response bias.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the public discourses on reducing emissions
   from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) across seven
   countries, to assess whether they support policy reforms. We argue that
   transformational discourses have at least one of these characteristics:
   they advocate specific policy reforms that address the drivers of
   deforestation and forest degradation; take into account the potential
   risks of a REDD+ mechanism; go beyond technocratic solutions to reduce
   emissions; and explicitly challenge existing power relations that
   support drivers of deforestation. The evidence indicates the
   predominance of win-win storylines, a lack of engagement by state actors
   with debates on the potential negative socioeconomic outcomes of REDD+,
   and little attention to the drivers of deforestation. The article
   concludes that to achieve a shift toward transformational public
   discourse, reformist policy actors and the media need to engage dominant
   policy actors in debates about how to reduce pressure on the forest.},

Abstract = {The role of commercial ships in the Mediterranean migration crisis is
   little-noticed in the media and by the general public, and largely
   disregarded in the EU's political responses to the crisis. Whereas
   large-scale national and regional actions such as the
   Italian-administered Mare Nostrum and the EU's Frontex-administered
   Triton operations have become part of the vocabulary surrounding the
   crisis, the rescue of 42,000 migrants by commercial vessels in 2014 -
   and the implications thereof - is rarely commented upon. More
   importantly, the commercial shipping industry is rendered invisible in
   the EU policy responses to the Mediterranean migration crisis, which
   disregards both the efforts and challenges experienced by the industry.
   For this reason, this profile zooms in on the migration crisis from the
   point of view of commercial shipping, and argues that it is of
   fundamental importance that European policy responses to the crisis
   tackle the multiple disincentives experienced by the commercial shipping
   industry towards upholding the duty to render assistance to vessels in
   distress at sea. The concrete policy actions suggested here answer to
   the challenges experienced by the commercial shipping industry; aid the
   industry in its efforts to undertake its legal and moral duty to render
   assistance; and, in effect, save more lives at sea.},

Title = {Global labour unions and just transition to a green economy},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Questions of justice in the transition to a green economy have been
   raised by various social forces. Very few proposals, however, have been
   as focused and developed as the ``just transition{''} strategy proposed
   by global labour unions. Yet, labour unions are remarkably absent from
   discussions of the transition towards a green economy. This is
   surprising as labour unions are arguably the largest organizations in
   the world fighting for basic rights and more just social relations. This
   paper tries to advance the potential contribution of labour unions in
   this arena by asking: what is the full scope of ``just transition{''}
   today and how have labour unions developed and refined it over the years
   to render the move towards a green economy both environmentally and
   socially sustainable? The concept of just transition is hotly debated
   within labour unions and has different interpretations, and hence
   different strategies. The last section assesses these interpretations by
   means of a normative framework, which seeks to fuse political economy
   and political ecology. Empirically, we add to the growing literature on
   labour environmentalism, as well as transitions more generally.
   Analytically, our goal is to place the various approaches to a ``just
   transition{''} within a heuristic framework of environmental justice
   that is explicit about power relations when demanding justice, two
   themes central to this special issue.},

   Modelling},
Booktitle = {POLICY PRACTICE AND DIGITAL SCIENCE: INTEGRATING COMPLEX SYSTEMS, SOCIAL
   SIMULATION AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN POLICY RESEARCH},
Series = {Public Administration and Information Technology},
Year = {2015},

Abstract = {This chapter deals with the assessment of the quality of a simulation.
   The first section points out the problems of the standard view and the
   constructivist view in evaluating social simulations. A simulation is
   good when we get from it what we originally would have liked to get from
   the target; in this, the evaluation of the simulation is guided by the
   expectations, anticipations, and experience of the community that uses
   it. This makes the user community view the most promising mechanism to
   assess the quality of a policy-modelling exercise. The second section
   looks at a concrete policy-modelling example to test this idea. It shows
   that the very first negotiation and discussion with the user community
   to identify their questions is highly user-driven, interactive, and
   iterative. It requires communicative skills, patience, willingness to
   compromise on both sides, and motivation to make the formal world of
   modellers and the narrative world of practical policy making meet.
   Often, the user community is involved in providing data for calibrating
   the model. It is not an easy issue to confirm the existence, quality,
   and availability of data and check for formats and database
   requirements. As the quality of the simulation in the eyes of the user
   will very much depend on the quality of the informing data and the
   quality of the model calibration, much time and effort need to be spent
   in coordinating this issue with the user community. Last but not least,
   the user community has to check the validity of simulation results and
   has to believe in their quality. Users have to be enabled to understand
   the model, to agree with its processes and ways to produce results, to
   judge similarity between empirical and simulated data, etc. Although the
   user community view might be the most promising, it is the most
   work-intensive mechanism to assess the quality of a simulation.
   Summarising, to trust the quality of a simulation means to trust the
   process that produced its results. This process includes not only the
   design and construction of the simulation model itself but also the
   whole interaction between stakeholders, study team, model, and findings.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Pages = {509-524},
Abstract = {The mediation efforts of the European Union (EU) Delegation in Yemen
   started with the uprising in 2011 which led to the conclusion of the
   National Dialogue Conference in 2014. This article examines the EU's
   understanding of mediation vis-a-vis its practice. The case of Yemen
   lends itself to trace EU mediation capabilities from the implementation
   of the ``Concept on Strengthening Mediation and Dialogue Capacities{''}
   to a more systematic approach because the Mediation Support Team (MST)
   of the European External Action Service took office in 2011. Building on
   an analytical framework of mediation as a tool of EU foreign policy,
   this article demonstrates how EU mediation presents itself along a
   political and a technical dimension. The collaboration of the MST and
   the EU Delegation personnel in Yemen fostered an increase in mediation
   awareness. However, it could not develop its full potential as the UN
   Special Advisor sidelined the EU and other members of the Group of Ten
   Ambassadors through his proactive approach. Despite those difficulties
   of standing up to established actors in the field, this study argues
   that EU mediation is about balancing its political and technical
   dimension. For now, the political seems to outweigh the craft of
   mediation in the case of Yemen.},

Abstract = {In 2015, the OSCE will commemorate two seminal dates: the 40th
   anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act and the 25th anniversary of the
   Charter of Paris for a new Europe. This study takes these seminal dates
   for the OSCE as well as the current dramatic Ukrainian crisis as
   starting points to analyze three questions: How has Russia's
   relationship and role with/within the OSCE evolved throughout the years?
   Which role has the OSCE been playing in European security governance?
   How does the Ukrainian crisis affect Russia's OSCE policy and what does
   it mean for the OSCE? Studying Russia's OSCE policy is key to understand
   the OSCE's role as a framework for security governance in Europe with
   both its successes and failures. In order to answer these research
   questions, this study uses insights from (regional) security governance
   literature.},

Abstract = {The economics of climate policy after Rio led to a climate centric
   paradigm which departs from the original UNFCCC's cooperative framework
   for designing climate policies from the perspective of sustainable
   development. This resulted in a cap-and-trade approach which aims to
   mitigate the adverse effects on development through appropriate
   transfers to achieve fair burden sharing. However, the continuation of
   this paradigm cannot untie the development-climate Gordian knot. (The
   Gordian Knot refers to a seemingly intractable problem. According to a
   Greek legend, Gordios arrived in Phrygia in an ox cart, was made King
   and dedicated his cart to Zeus, tying it up with an intricate knot. The
   person who would untie the knot would rule Asia. Alexander the Great
   found a solution by cutting it with his sword. Hourcade et al. (The
   design of climate policy. MIT Press, Cambridge, p 408, 2008) explain
   that, after Rio Earth Summit (1992), the climate negotiations remained
   disengaged from the debates on development pathways, thus tying up a new
   Gordian knot of misunderstandings.) Instead one loses sight of the
   benefits of cooperation in a global agreement to abate GHGs emissions.
   The challenge is now to align the development and climate objectives
   taking into consideration the changing context since the 1990s which
   includes a re-equilibrium of the world economic balance and the adverse
   context created by the 2008 financial crisis. This paper proposes that
   carbon finance should be considered as part of a general reform of the
   financial system. The adoption of a carbon value as a notional price
   could trigger a wave of low-carbon investments in the world thereby
   redirecting some global savings towards low-carbon investments, thus
   providing a lever for equitable access to development.},

Abstract = {The military operation in Libya (2011) is a paradigmatic case regarding
   the growing interaction of new security challenges: regional
   instability, transnational organized crime and illegal immigration. The
   main aim of the paper is to answer the question: Why has Italy employed
   a specifically military instrument to tackle transnational and
   non-military threats? Through process tracing the research looks at the
   political debate over the decision-making process in the case of the
   Italian military engagement in Libya, emphasizing the role played by the
   strategic culture, international norms and domestic dynamics.},

Abstract = {Female genital mutilation (FGM) has been the target of significant
   transnational activism over the past several decades, prompting the
   development and promotion of a strong international norm against the
   procedure. However, groups that perform FGM generally view it as a
   requirement of their culture-they are subscribing to a strong local norm
   in favor of the practice. What happens when the international and local
   norms collide? Under what conditions are individuals and communities
   most likely to abandon the local norm and embrace the international one?
   The article lays out a theoretical framework for thinking about
   local-level norm change. I argue that the normally high barriers to
   defecting from the local norm supporting FGM are more likely to be
   overcome when there are non-circumcising groups living nearby and when
   there are local elites among the group of first movers. To evaluate this
   argument, I administered an original representative survey about FGM
   among Maa-speaking peoples in three rural Kenyan communities.},

Abstract = {In 1925 a new electoral system was introduced in Chile. This reform
   changed the electoral formula from a cumulative voting system to a
   proportional one (d'Hondt) and established new rules about district
   magnitude and form of voting. It has been argued that this reform was
   motivated by the emergence of new parties or the expansion of the
   electorate. This article offers an alternative explanation: in the case
   of Chile, the main reason for the electoral reform was the parties' need
   to solve problems of strategic coordination stemming from the
   characteristics of the Chilean cumulative voting system. In this
   context, the Chilean case shows that there are many routes to
   proportionality.},

Abstract = {This article outlines the factors that explain changes in the rules of
   the game in Chile after the restoration of democracy in 1990. It looks
   particularly at the reasons why the right-wing partiesstrong defenders
   of the constitution imposed by General Augusto Pinochet in 1980accepted
   reforms that eliminated many of what the literature has termed
   authoritarian enclaves. The article explains this shift by observing
   significant changes in the political context that, in turn, affected the
   priorities of veto players. In this context, short-term strategic
   calculations by the right-wing parties, aiming to achieve a new balance
   of power less detrimental to their interests, opened a window of
   opportunity that led to congressional approval of important reforms.
   Particular institutional features of the Chilean political systemparty
   discipline and a balance of power in favor of the executivealso helped
   the political actors to reach agreement.},

Abstract = {The Syrian crisis has from May 2011 and onwards been met by the EU with
   rounds of tightening sanctions attempting to put pressure on the Syrian
   regime and the elites surrounding it. Based on a typology for the
   sanctions and a periodization showing how the measures have proceeded,
   the article discusses the EU sanctions and to what degree they have
   influenced the situation in Syria. Furthermore, the article sheds light
   on regional and international dimensions of EU policies towards Syria
   and demonstrates how the policies are met with the Syrian regime's
   ability to adapt to conditions related to changing internal and external
   challenges. The article concludes that what in the first phases of the
   EU sanctions against Syria represented a deviation from the traditional
   pragmatic EU policies vis-a-vis the Middle East, seems during the latest
   phase to be followed by a more cautious approach, which also takes
   security concerns into consideration.},

Abstract = {While the twentieth century is considered as the century of population
   explosion and burning of fossil fuels, environmental policies and the
   transition to effectively use renewable energy sources have become a
   priority of strategies in regions, countries and internationally.
   Different projects have been initiated to study the best suitable
   transition process towards renewable energy. In addition, an increasing
   number of climate change and energy policies is being formulated and
   released at distinct levels of governments. Many of these policies and
   projects pursue the aim of switching from energy sources like fossil
   fuels or nuclear power to renewable energy sources like solar, wind or
   water. The aim of this chapter is to provide foundations of policy
   implementation and particular methods as well as to investigate five
   policy implementation cases through a comparative analysis.},

   systems for management. After discussing some essential features of
   complex systems, we discuss the current focus of managers and management
   theory on prediction and the problems arising from this perspective.
   Ashort overviewis given of the leadership and management literature,
   identifying what information is lacking concerning the management of
   complex systems. Next agent-based gaming, which allows for modeling a
   virtual and autonomous population in a computer-game setting, is
   introduced as a tool to explore the possibilities to manage complex
   systems. The chapter concludes with a research agenda for management and
   leadership in complex systems.},

Title = {Embracing ``embedded security{''}: the OSCE's understated but
   significant role in the European security architecture},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Pages = {579-599},
Abstract = {The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is
   perhaps the world's least-known major security organization. However,
   the same characteristic which puts the OSCE seemingly continually on the
   verge of irrelevance with respect to the other actors in European and
   global security is in fact what has allowed it to endure and is in fact
   its greatest asset. That is, the OSCE's distinct combination of modern
   and postmodern characteristics in both its composition and its
   activities allows it to create what can be called ``embedded
   security{''}. Tracing the evolution of one particular set of
   decision-making rules embedded within a normative framework which
   questioned the fundamental meanings of ``security{''}, and exploring
   present-day activities, this article reinterprets the OSCE in the light
   of this new model. In so doing, it re-contextualizes both the OSCE's
   origins and its contemporary relevance. Instead of a modernist,
   functional, rule-driven interpretation which situates the OSCE on the
   periphery in a crowded field, this explanation puts the OSCE at the
   centre of the postmodern and normative European security architecture.},

Abstract = {Did the Supreme Court decision in the Affordable Care Act case change
   public opinion about health care reform? Utilizing a multi-wave panel
   design with observations collected just hours before and after the
   Court's decision, this study addresses macro-level questions concerning
   the Court's effect on opinion about health care reform generally and the
   individual mandate specifically. Findings show that support for health
   care reform remained constant despite significant positive movement on
   the mandate. The panel design also allows for the analysis of
   micro-level change and the testing of hypotheses related to cognitive
   models, individual attributes, and assessments of the Court's
   legitimacy. Despite some evidence of micro-level variation, the data
   ultimately point to a decision that induced a general, persistent, and
   relatively unconditional uptick in support for the provision the Court
   deemed constitutional.},

Abstract = {As researchers increasingly use mail survey methods to collect health
   and other data, research focused on optimizing features of survey design
   and administration in cost-effective ways is needed. We conducted two
   studies to examine the effects of sequential prepaid incentives and
   envelope messaging on response rates, item nonresponse, and costs in two
   mail surveys using address-based samples. Sample members in study 1 were
   randomly assigned to groups that received a preincentive of \$2 versus
   \$5, a second incentive of \$0 versus \$2 (sent only to nonresponders),
   and an envelope bearing no message or a monetary-focused message.
   Results indicated that the \$5 preincentive significantly increased
   response rates, but neither the second incentive nor the message had an
   effect. Informed by the results of study 1, study 2 delivered a \$2
   preincentive to all sample members, but increased the amount of the
   second incentive to \$5. Study 2 also tested a health-focused envelope
   message. While envelope messaging again failed to motivate
   participation, the administration of a second incentive, valued at a
   larger amount than the preincentive, significantly increased response
   rates. With regard to their effects on item nonresponse, while none of
   the variables was associated with item-missing levels in study 2, a
   significant three-way interaction was found in study 1 such that missing
   data was higher in the presence of a monetary message when a \$2
   preincentive was paired with a \$2 second incentive. Cost analyses
   indicated that while larger incentives increased response rates, they
   also increased costs.},

Abstract = {The strategic nature of political interactions has long captured the
   attention of political scientists. A traditional statistical approach to
   modeling strategic interactions involves multi-stage estimation, which
   improves parameter estimates associated with one stage by using the
   information from other stages. The application of such multi-stage
   approaches, however, imposes rather strict demands on data availability:
   data on the dependent variable must be available for each strategic
   actor at each stage of the interaction. Limited or no data make such
   approaches difficult or impossible to implement. Political science data,
   however, especially in the fields of international relations and
   comparative politics, are not always structured in a manner that is
   conducive to these approaches. For example, we observe and have
   plentiful data on the onset of civil wars, but not the preceding stages,
   in which opposition groups decide to rebel or governments decide to
   repress them. In this article, I derive an estimator that
   probabilistically estimates unobserved actor choices related to earlier
   stages of strategic interactions. I demonstrate the advantages of the
   estimator over traditional and split-population binary estimators both
   using Monte Carlo simulations and a substantive example of the strategic
   rebel-government interaction associated with civil wars.},

Abstract = {One of the current research endeavors in international environmental
   politics is understanding the link between democracy and international
   environmental protection. Scholars in the field seek to identify the
   international and domestic factors that increase state commitment to
   international environmental treaties and agreements. Counter to the
   traditional literature on international environmental commitment, this
   paper reconceptualizes both traditional and alternative theories in
   order to identify domestic institutional factors that may increase state
   cooperation with international environmental agreements. In particular,
   this study posits that democratic governments in comparison to
   authoritarian governments increase state compliance with international
   environmental agreements; however, there may be domestic environmental
   conditions, such as limited access to clean water that may constrain
   democracies in participating in international environmental agreements.
   This study presents a quantitative analysis measuring the effects of
   democracy on state compliance behaviors with international environmental
   agreements. The results of the study provide support for an alternative
   bottom-up theoretical framework focusing on domestic environmental
   politics in addressing international environmental agreements.},

Volume = {15},

Pages = {61-77},

Abstract = {The paper offers an analysis of the historical, material, and ideational
   factors involved in shifting socio-environmental activism dynamics in
   Brazil, with a focus on the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam project located
   on the Xingu River in the Brazilian Amazon. Relying on qualitative
   research at a variety of levels, the paper seeks to answer the question:
   What does the Belo Monte case portend for our understanding of the
   capacity of green economy to facilitate a greater environmental
   sensitivity in a national context? The case study illustrates how green
   activism has been weakened by a combination of self-interested
   calculations by activists and strategic maneuvers by the state.
   Critically for environmental policymaking, the case study reveals how
   the state and its international allies can use the green economy
   discourse as a hegemonic tool to isolate opposition, break alliances,
   and further resource-extraction-oriented economic policies.},

Abstract = {Media headlines and international press coverage have called attention
   to the Tana River Delta, a small, rural, poor region on Kenya's eastern
   coast. In part, these news articles tracked the events around a court
   case launched by Tana villagers and nongovernmental organizations
   against several government agencies and a private sugar company. Why did
   an obscure, local court case in a remote, pastoral community draw
   international media attention? How did those involved in the case make
   their claims about the Tana Delta resonate with a wider audience?
   Proponents and their allies, I argue, linked Tana land-use plans to
   global debates over biofuels, drawing on language of food security, land
   tenure, and sovereignty. To explain the tactics of claim-making in the
   Tana Delta, I offer the hybrid theoretical lens of ``contentious
   political economy{''}-bringing together contentious politics' attention
   to historically based and adaptive claim-making cycles, political
   economy's interest in new markets and private authority, and political
   ecology's sensitivity to geography and discourse. By appealing to the
   contested politics of biofuels, Tana villagers participated in the
   latest episode of ongoing contestation over land control and exclusion
   in the global South. The contentious political economy lens reveals how
   this otherwise-marginalized region ended up at the heart of debates over
   food security, land rights, and resource conflicts.},

Abstract = {Many scholars argue that European imperialism shaped today's tropical
   Africa, for better or worse. Some imperial historians see the British
   empire as a fertile capitalist pioneer, kindling class-conscious,
   national, politics overseas. Economists of differing persuasions can see
   it, to the contrary, as the engineer of an underdevelopment that
   strangles popular sovereignty. Together with most Africanist historians,
   this article doubts that Europe had such creative or destructive power;
   British rule, among others, had to respond as much to African history as
   to metropolitan will. Anti-colonial nationalisms, in turn, were neither
   class not ideological vanguards but regional coalitions. Nation-building
   thereafter was an elusive aim, steered by minority visions imperfectly
   seen and widely disputed, from capitalism to socialism. All these
   complexities rest, it is widely argued, on the historic difficulty of
   exercising power in what was until recently an underpopulated continent
   with openly available resources.},

Abstract = {Introducing the category weak nationalism', this article emphasises the
   scales of intensity and the different operational modes of nationalism
   across time and space, as well as within the same space. It refuses to
   create a model or another dichotomy - strong/weak - on a par with
   earlier ones like organic/civic, Eastern/Western, bad/good. Rather, it
   approaches nationalism as a binary variable on a scale from weak/low to
   strong/high. It argues to extend the research focus beyond the fixation
   on extreme cases to so-called weak or weaker manifestations that remain
   subordinate and under-researched, all the time stressing the
   changeability of nationalisms in their local context and in the course
   of time. While it is a category more recognisable in a common sense
   approach than in a strictly quantifiable one, it can be identified and
   comparatively evaluated by the mobilising ability of the nationalist
   message in the public sphere.},

Abstract = {Morocco and Mauritania's regimes differ radically in their political
   structures and contemporary histories, yet they employed several similar
   strategies to secure survival during the Arab uprisings. Besides limited
   repression, constitutional reforms and palliative concessions, both
   regimes also used a distinct strategy of co-optation to aid
   authoritarian resilience. Targeting rural politicians with weak party
   affiliations for co-optation, regimes used it to build and reinforce
   loyalist political parties in the late 2000s. Once the uprisings began,
   both regimes deployed these loyalist parties to undertake
   counter-revolutionary activities to contain and counterbalance the power
   of youth and Islamist movements.},

Abstract = {This article examines the issue of presidential failure in South America
   by evaluating the multiple factors that create risk of resignation,
   removal, or impeachment of presidents. The study draws on various
   economic variables that have not been thoroughly investigated in the
   past and uses survival analysis to identify what factors are
   influential. In performing this testing, the importance of variables
   such as civil protest, executive wrongdoing, and specific measures of
   economic hardshipinflation and prolonged recessionbecomes clear.
   Majority legislative support also remains significant, supporting early
   arguments about the influence of presidential institutions. This
   investigation provides a unique perspective on presidential survival
   while evaluating the importance of previously excluded variables in a
   comprehensive manner.},

Abstract = {Dual-frame telephone surveys that sample from both landline and
   cell-phone frames have become common because the US population is
   increasingly abandoning landline phones. Designing a dual-frame
   telephone survey requires a decision on the sample allocation, and
   ultimately the allocation of respondents, from each of the two frames.
   The allocation of the sample to the two frames influences the unequal
   weighting effect (UWE), and consequently, the precision of estimates
   calculated from the survey data. The sample allocation also influences
   cost, since obtaining cell-phone respondents is often more expensive
   than obtaining landline respondents. In this paper, we present results
   that designers of dual-frame studies can use to determine an allocation
   of responders that optimizes the precision of the survey estimates for a
   given cost.},

Abstract = {We increasingly understand technical artefacts as components of complex
   product systems. These systems are designed, built, maintained, and
   deprecated by stakeholders with different interests. To maintain
   interoperability between components, standards are being developed. The
   standardisation process itself is, however, also influenced by different
   stakeholders.
   In this chapter, we argue that a full, comprehensive overview of all
   relevant components of a system is increasingly difficult. The natural
   response to complex problems is to delve into details. We suggest that
   an opposite move towards a more abstract approach can be fruitful. We
   illustrate this by describing the development of smart meters in the
   Netherlands. A more explicit focus on the values that play a role for
   different stakeholders may avoid fruitless detours in the development of
   technologies. Policymakers would do well by not only addressing
   functional requirements but also taking individual and social values
   into consideration.},

Abstract = {Framing narratives about shared history, norms and the future can be an
   important practice of creating transnational memory in Europe. This was
   the task of the European Union's `A New Narrative for Europe' project
   initiated by the European Parliament and implemented by the European
   Commission during 2013-2014. Some 20 people from the cultural sphere
   formed a so-called Cultural Committee that eventually submitted the
   declaration `New Narrative for Europe: The Mind and Body of Europe' to
   the Commission President and the German Chancellor in Berlin on 1 March
   2014. Analysing the process of narrative production illustrates the
   strict limits of such top-down cultural engineering in a transnational
   polity like the EU, however. It highlights in particular, the deep
   schism between the two milieus of politicians and officials in Brussels
   and people from culture, their lack of narrative consistency and their
   inability to disseminate their `new narrative' more widely under
   conditions of ad hoc transnational public spheres constituted by major
   crises, not declarations.},

Booktitle = {E-GOVERNANCE FOR SMART CITIES},
Series = {Advances in 21st Century Human Settlements},
Year = {2015},

Abstract = {Smart City is often considered as an all inclusive city integrating
   various aspects of Quality of Life of the people. However, unless it is
   planned and managed through Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) some of
   its socio-economic and spatial issues can be left behind in the
   development process. Through a case study of Hubli-Dharwad City in
   Karnataka, this paper shows how the poverty hot spots are left behind
   though many innovative programmes are carried out in the city. It points
   out the need to introduce SDI in Indian Cities as an essential part of
   Smart City building process.},

Title = {What Next for the Indonesian Navy? Challenges and Prospects for
   Attaining the Minimum Essential Force by 2024},

Volume = {37},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {A greenwater navy ought to be effective within its country's immediate
   waters, especially the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) while also
   possessing a limited extra-regional force projection ability. Based on
   this definition, the Indonesian Navy does not adequately perform this
   dual role. While President Joko ``Jokowi{''} Widodo's Global Maritime
   Fulcrum (GMF) vision gives the navy's long-term greenwater ambitions
   greater traction, it still faces capacity-building constraints thus
   prompting it to adopt the Minimum Essential Force (MEF) blueprint as an
   interim measure. This article examines the Indonesian Navy's prospects
   of attaining its MEF targets by 2024 as part of its long-term greenwater
   naval ambitions commensurate with Indonesia's ``maritime mediumness{''}.
   To identify these capacity gaps, this article models the navy's MEF
   projections based on three scenarios: Standard, Optimistic and Austere.
   Results show that under an Austere Scenario, the navy cannot possibly
   achieve its MEF targets across all categories by 2024. The Optimistic
   and Standard Scenarios are more realistic. Gaps in certain categories,
   primarily the PICR-10514 light frigate programme which forms a key facet
   of the navy's greenwater aspirations, are identified. But the risks of
   project overruns and budget challenges may militate against the modest
   projections derived in this study. Therefore, this article proposes a
   recalibration of the MEF specifications, by reducing the number of
   high-capability PKR-10514s optimized for war fighting in exchange for a
   larger force of low-capability ``PKR-minus{''} optimized for EEZ duties.},

Abstract = {Response propensities are increasingly being used during data collection
   for responsive survey design applications. Better propensity models,
   with more predictive power, are needed to guide responsive interventions
   during data collection. However, available data on both respondents and
   nonrespondents to improve these models are limited. This analysis
   investigates the usefulness of a new type of paradata, in the form of an
   interviewer observation taken at the call level, to increase the
   predictive power of propensity models. The interviewer observation
   investigated is the interviewer's assessment of the likelihood that a
   given respondent will participate in the survey, collected at each
   contact of a telephone study. We evaluate whether these ratings improve
   the fit and discrimination of ``classic{''} response propensity models
   that include call record data and interviewer characteristics. Then, the
   performance of the interviewer observation is tested in a simulated
   responsive survey design, where propensity models are generated at
   several dates during data collection, to determine whether the
   observations improve the accuracy of the predictions made at these time
   points over using classic propensity models. The interviewer ratings not
   only contribute to the predictive power of the classic models overall
   but, on their own, appear to perform better than the classic model at
   predicting high probability cases in the responsive survey design
   context.},

Abstract = {In Lebanon and Jordan the (non-)encampment of Syrian refugees is serving
   states' labour market goals. The Lebanese economy requires' large
   numbers of non-encamped low-wage Syrian workers, but the Jordanian
   regime assists its Transjordanian support base by restricting poor
   Syrians' access to the labour market through encampment. While
   acknowledging the importance of both states' differing historical
   experiences hosting refugees, and the security and budgetary motivations
   for policies of (non-)encampment, this article uses a critical political
   economy analysis of economic and labour market statistics to dislodge
   the centrality of the security discourses that increasingly inform
   discussions of refugee populations and the policies directed towards
   them. It demonstrates that the camp is not only a space of

Abstract = {Dyadic data are common in the social sciences, although inference for
   such settings involves accounting for a complex clustering structure.
   Many analyses in the social sciences fail to account for the fact that
   multiple dyads share a member, and that errors are thus likely
   correlated across these dyads. We propose a non-parametric,
   sandwich-type robust variance estimator for linear regression to account
   for such clustering in dyadic data. We enumerate conditions for
   estimator consistency. We also extend our results to repeated and
   weighted observations, including directed dyads and longitudinal data,
   and provide an implementation for generalized linear models such as
   logistic regression. We examine empirical performance with simulations
   and an application to interstate disputes.},

Abstract = {This article explores the interplay between ethnic change and individual
   psychology in shaping mass opinion on immigration. Recent research
   suggests that personality traits related to uncertainty aversion
   structure left-right orientation in American politics, and we argue that
   this personality cleavage should shape citizens' reactions to ethnic
   change. Using national survey data and a survey experiment, our analysis
   reveals that ethnic change polarizes citizens by personality, as those
   averse to uncertainty feel heightened cultural threat from ethnic
   change, while those open to uncertainty feel less threatened. The
   association of traits related to uncertainty aversion with left-right
   orientation suggests that polarization over immigration is exacerbated
   by the interaction of citizen personality and ethnic context. While the
   opinion literature on immigration is replete with studies analyzing the
   separate effects of ethnic context and individual differences, this
   article contributes to the literature by analyzing the two in
   conjunction.},

   Illuminating a Transparency Causal Mechanism},

Volume = {57},
Number = {3},
Pages = {77-99},

Abstract = {More than 100 freedom of information (FOI) laws have been enacted
   worldwide, nearly half within the last 10 years. Yet these cross-domain,
   lynchpin transparency measures have received little scholarly attention.
   This article assesses the 16 FOI measures adopted across Latin America.
   Is secrecy being surrendered in a region marked by legacies of opacity?
   Why are some laws fulfilling their de jure potential in practice while
   others are not? This article aims to achieve 3 general objectives. It
   analyzes the de jure and de facto strength of Latin American FOI
   regimes; it exposes critical data-based and methodological challenges in
   evaluating and comparing transparency laws; and it illustrates how a
   causal mechanism, driven by the interactive dynamics of legislative
   balances of power and cabinet compositions, has had a determinate
   influence in shaping the strength of FOI regimes from adoption to
   implementation and reform.},

Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {400-414},
Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {Duration data are often subject to various forms of censoring that
   require adaptations of the likelihood function to properly capture the
   data generating process, but existing spatial duration models do not yet
   account for these potential issues. Here, we develop a method to
   estimate spatial-lag duration models when the outcome suffers from right
   censoring, the most common form of censoring. We adapt Wei and Tanner's
   (1991) imputation algorithm for censored (non-spatial) regression data
   to models of spatially interdependent durations. The algorithm treats
   the unobserved duration outcomes as censored data and iterates between
   multiple imputation of the incomplete, that is, right censored, values
   and estimation of the spatial duration model using these imputed values.
   We explore the performance of an estimator for log-normal durations in
   the face of varying degrees of right censoring via Monte Carlo and
   provide empirical examples of its estimation by analyzing spatial
   dependence in states' entry dates into World War I.},

Abstract = {The emerging literature on the so-called Arab Spring' has largely
   focused on the evolution of the uprisings in cities and power centres.
   In order to reach a more diversified and in-depth understanding of the
   Arab Spring', this article examines how peripheries have reacted and
   contributed to the historical dynamics at work in the Middle East and
   North Africa. It rejects the idea that the Arab Spring' is a unitary
   process and shows that it consists of diverse springs' which differed in
   terms of opportunity structure, the strategies of a variety of actors
   and the outcomes. Looking at geographical, religious, gender and ethnic
   peripheries, it shows that the seeds for changing the face of politics
   and polities are within the peripheries themselves.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates what made possible Sweden's ``urge to go
   ahead{''} in climate policy, an issue particularly interesting given the
   problem with non-compliance in the climate regime. The material reveals
   that there was tension regarding how great burden Sweden should shoulder
   and to what extent emissions reductions should be made domestically.
   Despite this tension, Sweden decided to have a more ambitious national
   target (-4 \%) than required by the EU burden sharing agreement (+4 \%),
   which allocated the EU's Kyoto Protocol targets within EU-15. It was
   also decided that emissions reductions should not account for the
   flexible mechanisms or carbon sinks. Importantly, the national -4 \%
   target was over-implemented (-16 \% in 1990-2011). These decisions were
   institutionalized until the center-right government in 2009 formulated
   the 2020 targets. Using argumentative discourse analysis, I conclude
   that what made possible Sweden's comparatively ambitious climate policy
   was the discourse coalitions (although different in character) formed
   around primarily two story lines that were blended: Opportunity (in line
   with the discourse on ecological modernization) and Ecological Justice
   (in line with the discourse on civic environmentalism). However, the
   latter was de-emphasized by the center-right government that came to
   power in 2006, reflecting the influence of a Sacrifice story line and
   the increased importance of the norm of cost-efficiency. Convincing
   others about the truthfulness of the Opportunity story line would
   possibly be effective for making others willing to commit to obligations
   and actually implement them. However, the diminishing importance of the
   Ecological Justice story line may affect negatively how Sweden is viewed
   internationally. If the overarching aim is to get as many countries as
   possible to commit to and comply with quantitative commitments within
   the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, then it might
   not only be of importance whether Sweden can ``deliver{''} but possibly
   also how one delivers.},

Abstract = {Developing countries devote significant resources to lowering consumer
   prices for basic goods and services such as food and electricity.
   Theories of the welfare state only partially elucidate why consumer
   subsidy regimes grow so large and become entrenched. While the welfare
   state literature stresses how concentrated, organized beneficiary groups
   push for the expansion and protection of well-known programs such as
   pensions, the developing world's consumers are atomized, and subsidies
   themselves are of low visibility. The size and durability of consumer
   subsidy regimes stem primarily from political uncertainty and price
   shocks that provide politicians with strong incentives to avoid blame
   for repeal. Over time, environmental pressures and fears of political
   backlash against repeal reinforce one another, increasing the fiscal
   burden subsidies impose and dramatically raising the political cost of
   program exit. In this sense, consumer subsidy programs come to form
   ``policy traps{''}aEuro{''}initially modest policies that quickly grow
   and become entrenched, thereby greatly reducing politicians' maneuvering
   room. We utilize this framework to analyze the meteoric growth and
   entrenchment of utility subsidies in post-crisis Argentina. In
   Argentina, subsidies grew despite the private provision of subsidized
   services-making it difficult for the government to claim credit-even in
   sectors with weakly organized interests.},

Abstract = {Electoral rules have the potential to affect the size and composition of
   the voting public. Yet scholars disagree over whether requiring voters
   to register well in advance of Election Day reduces turnout. We present
   a new approach, using web searches for ``voter registration{''} to
   measure interest in registering, both before and after registration
   deadlines for the 2012 U.S. presidential election. Many Americans sought
   information on ``voter registration{''} even after the deadline in their
   state had passed. Combining web search data with evidence on the timing
   of registration for 80 million Americans, we model the relationship
   between search and registration. Extrapolating this relationship to the
   post-deadline period, we estimate that an additional 3-4 million
   Americans would have registered in time to vote, if deadlines had been
   extended to Election Day. We test our approach by predicting out of
   sample and with historical data. Web search data provide new
   opportunities to measure and study information-seeking behavior.},

Abstract = {Using computer simulations in examining, explaining and predicting
   social processes and relationships as well as measuring the possible
   impact of policies has become an important part of policy-making. This
   chapter presents a comparative analysis of simulation models utilised in
   the field of policy-making. Different models and modelling theories and
   approaches are examined and compared to each other with respect to their
   role in public decision-making processes. The analysis has shown that
   none of the theories alone is able to address all aspects of complex
   policy interactions, which indicates the need for the development of
   hybrid simulation models consisting of a combinatory set of models built
   on different modelling theories. Building such hybrid simulation models
   will also demand the development of new and more comprehensive
   simulation modelling platforms.},

Abstract = {The digital divide remains formidable in scaling information and
   communication technology (ICT)-enabled opportunities for effective
   leadership and development in countries lagging behind. In a country
   like Nigeria, leadership and development challenges often hinge on the
   lack of effective coordination beneficial of eParticipation. This
   chapter discusses the application and practice of eParticipation in
   simulation exercise for leadership training in Nigeria. The Crisis Game,
   a simulation exercise, of the Nigeria's National Institute for Policy
   and Strategic Studies (NIPSS) provides a case study with the theme of
   political zoning. Three major theories of structuration, institutional
   and actor-network are used to ascertain the significance of
   eParticipation in bridging digital divide. Its findings include low
   level and inadequate utilization of ICT devices and processes for
   eParticipation at the highest level of leadership training in Nigeria.
   The chapter recommends stronger institutionalization of ICT support;
   public enlightenment; collaborative research on eParticipation; and
   legislation for enhancing eParticipation capability in bridging global
   digital divide.},

Title = {Uncertainties at the European Union's southern borders: actors,
   policies, and legal frameworks},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {369-380},
Abstract = {A multiplicity of legal and political arrangements regulate the European
   Union's external borders. With borders representing the intersection
   between national and international law and politics, the EU also
   acquired some legal competences in this realm. The resulting triple set
   of rules coincides with the growing disaggregation of the classical
   functions of borders. This state of affairs generates legal and
   procedural uncertainties and results in a growing ambiguity and lack of
   transparency, in terms of competences and accountability. Due to the
   EU's concerns with transnational terrorism, and the growing
   securitization of migration, the EU's borders with the states of the
   Middle East and North Africa are particularly relevant in this regard,
   with the resulting uncertainties touching upon fundamental rights. This
   article discusses the conceptual starting point of the growing
   institutional, legal, and political complexity at the EU's southern
   borders, together with relevant aspects and developments, thus also
   providing the background to the different contributions in this special
   issue.},

Abstract = {A long-held axiom, political leaders are said to favour an action space
   sufficiently wide to allow them, as a minimum, a face-saving exit. This
   makes it particularly interesting for us to study those rare cases where
   political leaders seem to be deliberately reducing their policy options
   to the point of having merely one line to pursue. The handling by
   Russian President Vladimir Putin of the early 2014 crisis over Crimea,
   eventually leading to the annexation by Russia of the Ukrainian
   Peninsula on 21 March 2014, seems to represent such a rare case. Through
   the use of state-controlled media, a highly dichotomized framing of the
   crisis was presented to the Russian audience, essentially leaving Putin
   with just the one option of acting to ``save{''} the Crimeans from the
   Ukrainian Government by bringing them into Russia.},

Title = {E-Governance for Smart Cities},
Booktitle = {E-GOVERNANCE FOR SMART CITIES},
Series = {Advances in 21st Century Human Settlements},
Year = {2015},
Pages = {1-43},
Abstract = {This chapter `E-Governance for Smart City' is intended to give
   conceptual clarity of the subject matter of the book. The chapter is
   expected to give broad direction to the book. Until now E-Governance
   literature is dominated by authors who are computer scientists and IT
   specialists since there are several technical issues to be solved (like,
   for example, big data management) but this book takes a departure and
   will be authored by domain specialists related to city. We are jointly
   working out the emerging E-Governance System for Smart City from the
   point of view of urban domain specialists such as specialists in urban
   development, urban planning, climate change, carbon accounting, water
   Governance, energy governance, public realm and so on. To start with
   definition of E-Governance and E-Government is collated from different
   organizations point of view. Then how consumers of Governance, such as
   Citizen, Government and Business benefit from E-Governance is
   enumerated. Further, it traces five distinct phases of E-Governance
   development such as Phase-1(1996-1999): Basic Web Presence,
   Phase-2(1997-2000): Interactive web, Phase-3(1998-2003): Transaction
   web, Phase-4(2000-2005): Integrative and Transformation web and
   Phase-5(2005+): Smart City Governance web. Prior to 2005 there has been
   rapid transition in phases but with the emergence of phase-5, there is a
   trend in stabilization of urban E-Governance. This chapter enumerates
   new functional specialization of E-Governance in different phases and
   discusses Smart City E-Governance System and its prime requirements.},

Pages = {272-287},
Abstract = {This article focuses on the party of Jobbik ('The Better') and places
   its rhetoric and activism within the context of the Hungarian political
   system and its internal pathologies. A deeper and broader insight of
   nationalism's socio-psychological appeal in Hungarian politics and
   society will help the reader understand better why and how the economic
   crisis has been a watershed for Jobbik's popularity among certain
   segments of the Hungarian electorate. This piece of work has primarily
   relied on a qualitative and discourse analysis of Jobbik's speeches,
   official statements and the party's political programme. Sources such as
   opinion polls and public surveys have also been of complementary
   importance. The research embeds this information in scholarly and
   theoretical literature in the thematic areas of Political Psychology and
   Nationalism. What this article demonstrates is that Jobbik has been
   particularly efficient in coordinating its socio-psychological campaign
   and mobilizing a series of social grievances for its political benefit.
   Meanwhile, the party has been equally successful in legitimizing its
   campaign by embedding it within the traditional framework of the
   political culture of nationalism in Hungary.},

   UNIT-NONRESPONSE ADJUSTMENTS A SIMULATION STUDY},
Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {79},

Abstract = {The usual approach to unit-nonresponse bias detection and adjustment in
   social surveys has been post-stratification weights, or more recently,
   propensity-score weighting (PSW) based on auxiliary information. There
   exists a third approach, which is far less popular: using multiple
   imputed values for each missing unit of the survey outcome(s). We
   suggest multiple imputation (MI) as an alternative to PSW since the
   latter is known to increase variance substantially without reducing bias
   when auxiliary variables are not associated with the survey outcome of
   interest. Given that most social surveys have multiple target variables,
   creating imputed data sets may address bias in survey outcomes with less
   variance inflation. We examine the performance of PSW and MI on mean
   estimates under various conditions using fully simulated data. To
   evaluate the performance of the methods, we report average bias, root
   mean squared error, and percent coverage of 95 percent confidence
   intervals. MI performs better under some of our scenarios, but PSW
   performs better under others. Even within certain scenarios, PSW
   performs better on coverage or root mean squared error while MI performs
   better on the other criteria. Therefore, robust methods that
   simultaneously model both the outcomes and the (non) response may be a
   promising alternative in the future.},

Abstract = {The long established distinction between civic nationalism and
   ethnonationalism is useful heuristically to understand different
   dimensions of nationalism and perhaps track a movement from ethnic forms
   to civic allegiances, though some have challenged its empirical veracity
   and others question the normative implications of such a distinction.
   This paper demonstrates the ways in which the two are elided in everyday
   discourses about migrants in Australia. We argue suspicion of cultural
   difference, identified more than three decades ago as the new racism,
   has given way to talk of the need for migrants to follow the law'. This
   serves rhetorically to reinforce the notion that migrants, often implied
   to overlap with the category Muslims', are insisting on breaking the law
   and/or changing it and are therefore culturally incompatible with a
   modern liberal democracy. We argue that since ethnic nationalism, like
   racism, is out of favour normatively, ethnic nationalist arguments are
   now superficially concealed beneath the acceptable language of civic
   nationalism. The manner in which this occurs is mapped discursively
   using data from a corpus of twenty seven focus groups conducted around
   Australia.},

Abstract = {In recent years, intellectual property rights protections have increased
   in Central America. Transnational access to medicines campaigns focused
   particular attention on the public health implications of these
   protections in the context of debates around the ratification of the
   US-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), but these efforts did
   not lead to long-term engagement with intellectual property and access
   questions by local health activists. This paper explores differences in
   priority focus between global access to medicines movement and local
   health activists in Central America, arguing that transnational access
   advocates' core arguments rely on assumptions that mesh poorly with
   on-the-ground realities in Central America. I examine differences in
   drug markets and political alliances, suggesting that these factors help
   explain the imperfect connection between global access to medicines
   frames and the needs of patients and advocates in Central America.},

Abstract = {Surveys have long been critical tools for understanding elections and
   forecasting their results. As the number of election surveys has
   increased in prevalence, researchers, journalists, and standalone
   political bloggers have sought to learn from the wealth of information
   released. This paper explores three central strategies for pooling
   surveys and other information to better understand both the state of an
   election and what can be expected when voters head to the polls.
   Aggregation, predictive modeling, and hybrid models are assessed as ways
   of improving on the results of individual surveys. For each method,
   central questions, key choices, applications, and considerations for use
   are discussed. Trade-offs in choices between pooling strategies are
   considered, and the accuracies of each set of strategies for forecasting
   results in 2012 are compared. Although hybrid models have the potential
   to most accurately pool election information and make predictions, the
   simplicity of aggregations and the theory-testing capacity of predictive
   models can sometimes prove more valuable.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to determine whether a mandatory labelling system of
   genetically modified (GM) food is justified or misconceived and
   therefore whether legal transformations are necessary. Although numerous
   benefits have been attributed to GM foods, they pose serious hazards to
   humans, animals, plants, and the environment. Much of the argument made
   in favour of GM foods and against their mandatory labelling proves to be
   economically oriented and fails to engage objectively with the
   threatened hazards from such foods. The article illustrates our argument
   with reference to Malaysia, the European Union, the United States, and
   Canada.},

Abstract = {According to cognitive research, members of a social majority are better
   than minority members at estimating the consensus, since the latter tend
   to overestimate the popularity of their opinion. These differences have
   been explained using the motivational reasoning model. The purpose of
   the current study is twofold: to verify that majority members indeed
   provide more accurate public consensus estimations and to test the
   effect of political orientation on this relation. Following the
   motivational reasoning model, it is suggested that proponents of
   right-wing ideology will overestimate support for their group,
   especially when in the minority, since they have a stronger reaction to
   political threat. The research involved three case studies. In the
   first, data from 33 surveys conducted over 10 years (N = 15,129) were
   analyzed using multilevel analysis. The results showed that (a) majority
   members are more accurate in gauging consensual opinions than minority
   members; (b) the gap in accuracy between majority and minority members
   increases with the size of the majority; and (c) those holding
   right-wing attitudes tend to overestimate their group size, more so when
   in the minority or when support for their opinion declines. The second
   case study analyzed data on four different issues, using a
   within-subject approach (N = 450). The findings were similar, with the
   exception of a nonsignificant effect for majority size. Finally, in the
   third case study, the causal mechanism suggested was supported by an
   experimental setting (N = 388). The results are discussed in light of
   the motivational reasoning model regarding information processing and
   ideology.},

Abstract = {How and why do developmental state institutions persist? We address this
   conceptual question through an empirical puzzle: even though Pakistan
   and Turkey, like South Korea and Taiwan, constructed postwar
   developmental state institutions, the Pakistani and Turkish economies
   have been unable to upgrade to higher value-added production following
   the Korean and Taiwanese experience. If, as many scholars argue, the
   creation of developmental state institutions is necessary and sufficient
   for high growth outcomes, how can we understand the divergence between
   these two sets of cases? We argue that that the persistence of
   developmental state institutions is contingent on the absence of
   articulated opposition from agrarian actors and provincial capitalists
   against regimes of industrial promotion. While Korea and Taiwan
   suppressed or co-opted potential challengers from the countryside, such
   actors in Pakistan and Turkey effectively challenged the developmental
   state in the mid-1970s. We suggest that the politics of developmental
   state persistence are analytically distinct from the origins of
   developmental states, thus enabling a more dynamic understanding of the
   relationship between the politics of developmental state institutions
   and late industrialization.},

Abstract = {The Turkish presidential elections of 10 August 2014 were the first
   direct elections in the history of republican Turkey. The election of
   prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the first round illustrated his
   dominant position in Turkish politics, as well as the inability of
   opposition parties to provide an alternative candidate who appealed to
   the Turkish electorate. Growing social polarization and concern about
   emerging autocratic tendencies, corruption allegations and the
   multilevel crisis in the Middle East failed to dissuade Turkish voters.
   Nevertheless, the fulfilment of Erdogan's declared intention of
   introducing presidentialism in Turkey will depend on the result of the
   upcoming parliamentary elections, to be held in June 2015 at the latest.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},

Pages = {405-416},
Abstract = {Politicians and scholars agree that a shared historical consciousness
   could help foster a common European identity, something which is
   currently lagging behind economic and political integration in the EU.
   To this end, a flagship of the European remembrance scene is to be
   opened to the public in Brussels in 2015: the House of European History
   (HEH). Here, we see that European institutions can play an important
   role in developing historical narratives that more accurately reflect
   European political and social reality today than the national paradigms
   originated from the 19th century. My article investigates the role of
   `marginal voices' in the HEH's depiction of European history, looking at
   the issues of colonialism and migration and the manner in which they are
   dealt with. At the same time, I probe whether the HEH offers
   counter-narratives to the prevailing picture of European integration as
   a success story. An examination of the various concepts underlying the
   museum's approach reveals major difficulties to include exclusion in the
   official memory. Although a primary aim of the curators is to portray
   diversity and to offer multiple perspectives, the concept of diversity
   employed is rather limited, rooted in the structure of the project.},

Abstract = {In this introduction, we do five things. First, we briefly review some
   of the contributions that anthropology has made in recent decades to the
   study of development. Second, we discuss the overall importance of
   population processes in development. Third, we provide an introduction
   to the field of anthropological demography. While each of these sections
   is necessarily brief, they are meant to situate the articles in this
   issue, placing them in a broad framework that suggests the contributions
   that anthropology can make to the study of comparative international
   development in general, and to the relationship between population and
   development in particular. To this end, the fourth aim of this
   introduction is to consider how anthropology approaches the social
   science task of comparison. Familiarizing readers with this engagement
   will, we hope, help in thinking about the contributions of the papers in
   this issue. The final section provides a brief introduction to each
   article, suggesting some of the ways they intersect with and illuminate
   themes we have raised here.},

Abstract = {The growth of global governance-in terms of the proliferation of rules,
   laws, and institutional forms as well as their interactions-is an
   increasingly debated issue. Scholars are raising concerns about some of
   its negative impacts, but they are divided on the extent of these
   impacts and on the needed solutions. While some question the viability
   of international institutions and argue for embracing complexity, others
   see current growth concerns as a call for more order and a turn to
   constitutionalism. This article argues for a turn to sustainable
   development instead. This approach addresses the system's underlying
   problem: its unsustainable development, which threatens to produce more
   rather than better governance arrangements and to enhance existing
   participation inequalities. The article uses the sustainable development
   paradigm to envision how to prevent rather than respond to growth
   concerns, and to integrate equity considerations into institutional
   strategies. A discussion of reducing, reusing, and recycling
   international institutions illustrates how to implement this approach
   and suggests areas for future research.},

Abstract = {Forty years after the division of Cyprus, the unstable political agenda
   still prevents a meaningful bi-communal discourse on the joint
   management of natural resources, especially water, a vital resource for
   all islanders. Until now, both communities have deployed unilateral,
   tactical methods to securitise the water discourse by linking it to high
   politics; yet, the situation remains deadlocked. Processes by which the
   water discourse in Cyprus acquired multiple meanings of securitisation
   over time and across different groups remains understudied, as does the
   concept of asecurity. We suggest moving water management in Cyprus into
   an asecuritisation realm, where decision-making processes are founded on
   a shared social identity with water acting as a unifying agent. Based on
   empirical findings from multiple methods employed dealing with social
   dilemmas involving scarce natural resources, we conclude that an
   alternative way of organizing political space with no a priori reference
   to the securitisation logic would create new opportunities for
   transforming the discourse beyond the political lock-in and
   incorporating bi-communal dynamics into natural resource management,
   laying the groundwork for future cooperation on other emblematic issues.},

Abstract = {This article offers a different perspective for understanding Moldovan
   discourses of passivity by turning its attention to representations of
   national identity. Its main focus is a Moldovan ballad, Mioria, and the
   way in which it discursively both frames and legitimises inaction. It
   builds on the idea that Mioria is a central part of the way in which
   Moldovans represent their identity with respect to the writings of Ion
   Dru, its main promoter in Moldovan society. More importantly, the ballad
   is conceptually linked to national characteristics such as lamentation
   and kindness, characteristics that can be summed up under the headline
   of passivity'. Thus, drawing from constructivist and post-structuralist
   approaches, the article stresses how these elements inform the Moldovan
   view of the self, its identity and even its representations of foreign
   affairs, framing the Moldovan lack of agency on a discursive level.},

Title = {TRIPS Implementation and Secondary Pharmaceutical Patenting in Brazil

Year = {2015},
Volume = {50},
Number = {2},
Pages = {228-257},

Abstract = {This article compares national approaches towards secondary
   pharmaceutical patents. Because secondary patents can extend periods of
   exclusivity and delay generic competition, they can raise prices and
   reduce access to medicines. Little is known about what measures and
   policies countries have enacted to address applications for secondary
   pharmaceutical patents, how they function, and whether, in practice,
   these measures limit secondary patents. We analyse the cases of India
   and Brazil. We assemble data on pharmaceutical patent applications filed
   in the two countries, code each application to identify which constitute
   secondary applications and examine outcomes for each application in both
   countries. The data indicate that Brazil is less likely to grant
   applications than India, but in both countries, the measures designed to
   limit secondary patents are having little direct effect. This suggests,
   on the one hand, that critics of these policies, such as the
   transnational pharmaceutical sector and foreign governments, may be more
   worried than they should be. On the other hand, champions of the
   policies, such as NGOs and international organizations, may have cause
   for concern that laws on the books are not having the expected impact on
   patent outcomes in practice. Our findings also suggest that, at the drug
   level, the effects of countries' approaches towards secondary patents
   need to be understood in the context of their broader approaches towards
   Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
   (TRIPS) implementation, including when and how they introduced
   pharmaceutical patents in the 1990s and 2000s.},

Abstract = {This contribution focuses on the Arab Spring' in Morocco and on the
   interactions between the mainly urban-based activists that made up the
   20 February Movement (F20M), and the population in rural areas. Based on
   six weeks of fieldwork between November 2013 and March 2014, mostly in
   the areas in and near Marrakech, we find that while the urban F20M
   events stimulated and inspired protests in rural areas, in practice
   there were only sporadic contacts based on the activists' personal
   feelings of belonging rather than their organizational membership. This
   is mainly due to discursive disconnects between the centre and
   periphery. As for the outcomes, in particular the new constitution, many
   respondents believe that nothing has changed so far.},

Abstract = {What explains the choice of corporate political strategy in
   environmental politics? Drawing on recent models of actor strategy
   formation in political economy, this article argues that basic material
   interests of firms are translated into strategies in the context of
   institutional environments. I advance a typological model that posits
   how distributional effects-positive versus negative-and perceived
   regulatory pressure-low versus high-interact in leading firms to adopt
   one of four ideal-type strategies: opposition, hedging, support, and
   non-participation. This article examines the model through the case of
   corporate strategies in the making of the European Union's Emission
   Trading Scheme. The article contributes to theory-building on business
   strategy in environmental politics by offering a probabilistic
   explanatory model, and it flags hedging strategies as an increasingly
   prevalent form of business behavior.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we argue that beyond understanding nations as imagined
   communities, the metaphor of an imagined family' or filial community' is
   a more useful concept towards understanding links between gender and
   nationhood as family relations in four ways: (1) providing a clear,
   hierarchical structure; (2) prescribing social roles and
   responsibilities; (3) being linked to positive affective connotations;
   and (4) reifying social phenomena as biologically determined. In order
   to empirically substantiate our claim, we will explore the prevalence
   and use of family metaphors in a key symbol of nationhood discourses.
   Through a qualitative analysis of national anthems as mnemonics of
   national identity', we demonstrate the widespread presence of family
   metaphors, discussing how they reproduce ideas of family and gender.
   Finally, we discuss how the imagined family' as present in anthems and
   other forms of national representation could inform future studies of
   nationalism and national politics.},

Title = {Lebanese-Palestinian Governance Interaction in the Palestinian Gathering
   of Shabriha, South Lebanon - A Tentative Extension of the `Mediated
   State' from Africa to the Mediterranean},
Journal = {MEDITERRANEAN POLITICS},

Abstract = {This article offers a qualitative case study of the interaction between
   Lebanese state institutions and Palestinian authorities concerning the
   unofficial Palestinian camp of Shabriha. It particularly highlights the
   indirect nature of these interactions and the brokering role of Lebanese
   political parties. Governance in Shabriha is conceptualized as a
   manifestation of a `mediated state', a notion that has been instrumental
   in understanding governance in sub-Saharan Africa but has not yet been
   applied to the Mediterranean. Based on empirical insights from Shabriha,
   the article offers a tentative reconsideration of the mediated state
   concept in order to extend it to scholarship on Mediterranean politics
   and governance.},

Abstract = {This chapter provides a starting point for better understanding how
   different approaches, tools, and technologies can support effective
   stakeholder participation in policy development. Participatory policy
   making involves stakeholders in various stages of the policy process and
   can focus on both the substance of the policy problem or on improving
   the tools and processes of policy development. We examine five
   international cases of stakeholder engagement in policy development to
   explore two questions: (1) what types of engagement tools and processes
   are useful for different stakeholders and contexts? And (2) what factors
   support the effective use of particular tools and technologies toward
   constructive outcomes? The cases address e-government strategic planning
   in a developing country, energy policy in a transitional economy,
   development of new technology and policy innovations in global trade,
   exploration of tools for policy-relevant evidence in early childhood
   decision making, and development of indicators for evaluating policy
   options in urban planning. Following a comparison of the cases, we
   discuss salient factors of stakeholder selection and representation,
   stakeholder support and education, the value of stakeholder engagement
   for dealing with complexity, and the usefulness of third-party experts
   for enhancing transparency and improving tools for engagement.},

Abstract = {The article looks at the European Union's (EU) attempts at ordering the
   Pan-European space and how Russia has sought to position itself in the
   EU-centric unipolar order and how that has affected the development of
   EU-Russia relations during the post-Cold War era. The analysis will move
   in four successive steps: (i) the development of the EU's attempts at
   hegemonic, post-sovereign ordering is reconstructed; (ii) the
   development of EU-Russia relations in light of these processes is
   analysed; (iii) then, the crisis in Ukraine as a certain culmination
   point is discussed; (iv) the article ends with conclusions concerning
   the development of EU-Russia relations in light of the problematic as
   well as an assessment of the significance of this particular facet in
   the wider processes of ordering discussed in the Special Issue together
   with a prognosis concerning the future.},

Abstract = {This chapter presents a survey of Europe's geopolitical topography,
   concentrating on developments in Central and Eastern Europe since the
   breakup of the Soviet Union. Ukraine's position as a focal point of
   geopolitical rivalry between the United States, the European Union and
   Russia will be examined against a backdrop of Russian energy exports to
   the West. The eastward expansion of NATO and the EU has sharpened the
   competition between Russia and the West, accentuated vacillations within
   Ukraine's political elites and aggravated a host of domestic Ukrainian
   rivalries. Meanwhile, the population's yearning for decent governance
   has gone unheeded.},

Abstract = {The EU regards itself as an important actor on the world stage. Yet an
   actor does not really see the audience clearly, as the theatre is
   normally dark. This renders it difficult to gauge the reaction of the
   recipients of the script or narrative. The term `the fourth wall'
   conceptualizes the idea of audience. This audience, as recipients of the
   EU's script, have not been examined as rigorously as is required, to
   date. This article examines how the EU seeks to have an international
   impact in its promotion of regionalism to the Association of Southeast
   Asian Nations. It argues that there is a need to better understand the
   fourth wall in the EU's self-projection and that the EU may well be
   obliged to `break the fourth wall' in the international arena.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},

Abstract = {Until recently, in per capita terms, Portugal was one of the most
   significant European contributors to international United Nations (UN)
   peacekeeping operations around the world. In the last few years,
   European Union and NATO missions and operations have topped deployment
   to UN operations. One can thus state that participation in peace support
   operations (PSO) has become a lodestar of Portuguese defence and foreign
   policies. The range of forces deployed, as well as the geographical
   diversity of deployment attest to the ambition and effort made by the
   Portuguese governments in becoming relevant in international affairs
   through PSO in the last 30 years. Given the limitations of a small power
   as Portugal, specialisation in the field of PSO is an asset for its
   positioning on the international scene, endowing it with a more active
   voice in matters of collective security and access to leadership
   positions.},

Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},

Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {62-82},

Abstract = {The article sets out to examine the complexity of national identity and
   to provide a more nuanced understanding of how inclusive and exclusive
   characteristics of national identity, which appear theoretically
   contradictory but show empirically considerable compatibility, relate to
   each other. In order to empirically investigate the nature of national
   identity, the article develops a multidimensional model-consisting of an
   ethnic, cultural, territorial and civic dimension. The article explores
   the understanding of national identity in two specific groups: members
   of the Scottish National Party (SNP) in the United Kingdom and members
   of the Frisian National Party (FNP) in the Netherlands. The evidence
   presented is based on data from two full membership studies, and the
   model is operationalised using a confirmatory factor analyses. The
   conclusion is that national identity can be conceptualised as consisting
   of one, or several, base layer(s) that can be `topped-up' with secondary
   layers.},

Title = {Redefining ``sub-culture': a new lens for understanding hybrid cultural
   identities in East-Central Europe with a case study from early 20th
   century L'viv-Lwow-Lemberg},
Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {700-720},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a new definition of the term subculture', as a way
   of better understanding hybrid identities specific to East-Central
   Europe, before applying this definition to a case study from the
   now-Ukrainian city of L'viv from around 1900. The first section outlines
   the theory, arguing that the continued focus on the nation state -
   either from the top down', or else the bottom up' as a source of
   contestation, by historians and anthropologists, has limited the ability
   to study groups in the interstices of the national projects that
   typically remain defined in monolithic ethno-linguistic terms. It
   examines the theoretical term subcultures' to propose a new definition
   that accounts for such hybridity, by having particular sensitivity to
   context (historical, social, geographical) and cultural practice, in
   addition to any prevailing national narratives at a given time. The case
   study in the second section focuses on linguistic hybridity in the city
   then known more commonly as Lemberg (German) or Lwow (Polish). It argues
   that Lemberg/Lwow/L'viv produced an urban dialect that blended Polish,
   Ukrainian, Yiddish and German elements. This dialect should be
   reassessed as a mixed, hybrid or transitional code, rather than as a
   linguistic variant of a titular nation. Archival evidence - in
   particular, court records - is quoted to show that at the lower end of
   L'viv society, people routinely mixed and transcended linguistic and,
   thereby, ethnic and religious boundaries. This offers direct evidence of
   a specific subsection, or subculture, in urban life where people
   interacted and intermingled intensely. As such, the paper offers new
   possibilities for investigating hybrid' identities, as well as proposing
   a counterpoint to recent research focusing on deliberate indifference or
   opposition to national segregation for various socio-political, economic
   and cultural reasons (Judson 2006: 19-65; King 2002; Zahra 2008).},

Abstract = {Beneath the secular veneer of official rhetoric, nationally unified
   school textbooks provide a striking image of the Islamist message
   promoted to young people in Egypt. While distorting the struggles and
   complexity of Egyptian history and heritage, the textbooks construct
   patriotic devotion and a form of docile neoliberal Islamism' as the
   route to national renaissance. They present a notion of ideal
   citizenship where personal piety, charity and entrepreneurship are the
   proposed solutions to Egypt's problems'. However, to actually relieve
   its problems', the regime has relied on religious associations for the
   provision of social services, depended on significant foreign assistance
   and periodically activated anti-western nationalism. This article
   details textbook constructions of national identity and citizenship in
   the late Mubarak era and reflects on whether the 2011 uprising proves
   their failure in securing his legitimacy. It describes key changes since
   2011 and explores whether the Sisi regime is offering alternative
   formulas of legitimation.},

Abstract = {In the field of civil society and democracy promotion, the relevance and
   effectiveness of donor strategies is often linked to their ability to
   adjust to local contextual factors. Despite the importance attached to
   tailor-made approaches, donor-sponsored democracy promoting NGOs in such
   different parts of the world as Ghana and Indonesia have very similar
   organizational characteristics. This paper explores the question of why
   they are so similar. We draw on institutional theory and use the concept
   of organizational isomorphism to illustrate how different pressures
   result in the homogenization of organizational characteristics. We find
   that besides the more commonly identified unequal power relation between
   donor and recipient, homogenization also stems from the NGOs themselves
   and from the relation between their various organizational
   characteristics (i.e., mission, staff, strategy, and structure).
   Furthermore, we argue that the process of homogenization can be seen as
   the institutionalization of trust between donor and recipient. In our
   discussion, we reflect on the limitations of our findings and on what
   they mean for donor support to NGOs and democracy.},

Abstract = {Why have only two of the eleven original members of the Western Climate
   Initiative implemented a cap-and-trade system? This article compares the
   implementation of cap-and-trade in California and Quebec versus in New
   Mexico and British Columbia. Ideas around the reality of anthropogenic
   global warming and the legitimacy of cap-and-trade created favorable
   context in three jurisdictions, although institutions condition the
   expression of these ideas in the policy-making process. Since
   parliamentary institutions concentrate power, elite consensus is more
   important in Canada, while in the United States public opinion plays a
   more significant role. However, ideational factors shaped by political
   institutions do not explain differences in cap-and-trade implementation.
   Growth in shale gas production, welcomed in British Columbia and New
   Mexico but resisted by Quebec and marginal in California, further
   explain different outcomes. Ideas, mediated by institutions, are the
   necessary prerequisites for action, while material factors influence
   policy instrument choice.},

Abstract = {When ethno-cultural heterogeneity exists and thrives within a
   nation-state, social tension and ethno-nationalist sentiments are not
   considered surprising. Yet in many nation-states, various native-born
   communities have diverse and potentially contradictory national
   identities without the desire for self-determination. In this paper, I
   explore the circumstances in which ethno-culturally distinct, peripheral
   communities may develop variants of the dominant national identity -
   ensuring that they remain excluded from the national narrative - yet
   remain part of the nation-state. To do so, I conduct a comparative
   analysis of the native-born Muslim communities in Spain's two North
   African exclaves. I find that most Muslims are Spanish citizens yet
   understandings of Spanish-ness' appear to vary between the exclaves. I
   use these findings to propose further steps for refining current
   conceptualisations of the nation-state, in an effort to better
   understand cases in which variations in the dominant national identity
   exist, but without ethno-nationalist sentiments.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses speeding, that is, ``too fast{''} responses, in web
   surveys. Relying on the response process model, we argue that very short
   response times indicate low data quality, stemming from a lack of
   attention on the part of respondents. To identify speeding, prior
   research employed case-wise procedures. Using data from nine online
   surveys, we demonstrate that response behavior of individual respondents
   varies considerably during a survey. Thus, we use case-and page-wise
   procedures to capture speeding behavior that taps different, although
   related, phenomena. Moreover, page-specific speeding measures capture
   aspects of data quality that traditional quality measures do not cover.
   Employing both page-specific and case-wise speeding measures, we examine
   whether removing speeders makes a difference in substantive findings.
   The evidence indicates that removing ``too fast{''} responses does not
   alter marginal distributions, irrespective of which speeder-correction
   technique is employed. Moreover, explanatory models yield, by and large,
   negligible coefficient differences (on average about one standard
   error). Only in exceptional cases differences exceed two standard
   errors. Our findings suggest that speeding primarily adds some random
   noise to the data and attenuate correlations, if it makes a difference
   at all. The paper concludes by discussing implications and limitations.},

Abstract = {Courts of last resort in the American states offer researchers
   considerable leverage to develop and test theories about how
   institutions influence judicial behavior. One measure critical to this
   research agenda is the individual judges' preferences, or ideal points,
   in policy space. Two main strategies for recovering this measure exist
   in the literature: Brace, Langer, and Hall's (2000, Measuring
   preferences of state supreme court judges, Journal of Politics 62(2):
   387-413) Party-Adjusted Judge Ideology and Bonica and Woodruff's (2014,
   A common-space measure of state supreme court ideology, Journal of Law,
   Economics, \& Organization, doi: 10.1093/jleo/ewu016) judicial CFscores.
   Here, we introduce a third measurement strategy that combines CFscores
   with item response (IRT) estimates of judicial voting behavior in all
   fifty-two state courts of last resort from 1995 to 2010. We show that
   leveraging two distinct sources of information (votes and CFscores)
   yields a superior estimation strategy. Specifically, we highlight
   several key advantages of the combined measure: (1) it is estimated
   dynamically, allowing for the possibility that judges' ideological
   leanings change over time and (2) it maps judges into a common space. In
   a comparison against existing measurement strategies, we find that our
   measure offers superior performance in predicting judges' votes. We
   conclude that it is a valuable tool for advancing the study of judicial
   politics.},

Abstract = {Counter-summits are important arenas of global environmental politics.
   Drawing upon Death's analysis of summitry as a form of environmentality,
   the forum argues that these alternative venues are defined by
   counter-summitry, a set of practices that are performative, enact
   legitimacy, and communicate norms of responsible conduct. This forum
   analyzes counter-summitry at the People's Summit in Rio de Janeiro, held
   in opposition to the UNDP's 2012 Rio+20 summit. I explore the actions of
   La Via Campesina-one of the larger participating movements at the
   People's Summit-analyzing this movement's mobilizations at Rio+20 and
   the People's Summit's final outcome document. These function as a form
   of counter-summitry, influencing the production of environmental
   subjects. I conclude with several questions to help direct debate
   concerning the relationship between counter-summitry and global
   environmental politics.},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of the middle classes in the divergent
   distributional outcomes that characterize South Korea and Chile. While
   equality has been historically low in South Korea, it has been high in
   Chile throughout the twentieth century, increasing substantially during
   the period of military rule. The analysis provides a historically
   grounded explanation of the role of the middle classes in these
   outcomes, emphasizing processes over time and contextualized
   comparisons. In Chile, the middle class became sufficiently politically
   powerful to obtain social improvements for itself, but reacted against
   popular mobilization and allied with the propertied classes, supporting
   a military regime that pursued policies that worsened inequality. In
   South Korea, on the other hand, the middle class, not threatened by
   intense mobilization from below, played an active role in keeping
   inequality low through the twentieth century. The timing and
   thoroughness of land redistribution, the pace of industrialization, and
   the extent of pressures from the popular classes and of political
   polarization, all powerfully shaped middle-class distributional
   politics. Hence, middle-class distributional politics is integral to the
   power struggles that shape distributional outcomes.},

Abstract = {The EU is clearly in the process of developing an external dimension to
   the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ). This paper focuses on
   ex. Police and Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters (PJCCM)
   provisions. These developments pose specific legal basis issues for the
   EU, given its complex EU-member state legal relationship, and the
   inter-institutional balance, all reflected in the treaty framework
   post-Lisbon. New Court of Justice rulings are now emerging which will
   assist in this issue. Equally the approach to be taken in developing
   these relationships will be crucial. This paper proposes the adoption of
   an Onuf style constructivism in order to best capture the reality of the
   process that is developing, and has developed for the ex. PJCCM measures
   internally. This then needs to be allied with a constitutionalism model
   to ensure a balanced development of all three aspects of the AFSJ.},

Title = {Money can't buy you love: the European Union member states and Iranian
   nuclear programme 2002-2009},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {56-76},
Abstract = {The controversy of the Iranian nuclear programme divided the European
   Union (EU) member states. Whereas some states preferred confrontation,
   others were in favour of the accommodation. Policy commentators
   frequently ascribed this difference to diverging economic interests of
   Europeans, but this link remained underexplored. In this article, the
   empirical link between the economic interests and positions towards Iran
   is explored. The analysis rests on the evaluation of both overall and
   strategic trade flows. The results suggest that while trade played a
   certain role in the shaping of the policies, the effect of the strength
   of the alliance with the USA explains a large part of the puzzle. The
   article thus casts shadow on the established policy narrative of
   economic interests being the driver of the EU members' Iran policy. In
   addition, the theoretical implications cast shadow over the
   applicability of commercial liberalism on instances of confrontation
   short of war.},

Abstract = {As the EU has expanded its authority into areas of high politics such as
   monetary, defense, and foreign policy, it has simultaneously developed
   procedures for handling more sensitive and classified information. These
   critical policy domains require standards regulating secure information
   and personnel, but the concept of official secrets is in tension with
   the treaty norms of the EU. Observers allege that the classified
   information policy of the EU was imposed through the coercion of
   external actors such as North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and
   the USA in a significant historical departure from the information
   security policies of European member states. This article evaluates the
   content of EU-classified information policies and compares them to the
   content of European member states, NATO, and the USA, in an effort to
   clarify the mechanisms of policy diffusion in the area of information
   security.},

Abstract = {Self-reported measures of media exposure are plagued with error and
   questions about validity. Since they are essential to studying media
   effects, a substantial literature has explored the shortcomings of these
   measures, tested proxies, and proposed refinements. But lacking an
   objective baseline, such investigations can only make relative
   comparisons. By focusing specifically on recent Internet activity stored
   by Web browsers, this article's methodology captures individuals' actual
   consumption of political media. Using experiments embedded within an
   online survey, I test three different measures of media exposure and
   compare them to the actual exposure. I find that open-ended survey
   prompts reduce overreporting and generate an accurate picture of the
   overall audience for online news. I also show that they predict news
   recall at least as well as general knowledge. Together, these results
   demonstrate that some ways of asking questions about media use are
   better than others. I conclude with a discussion of survey-based
   exposure measures for online political information and the applicability
   of this article's direct method of exposure measurement for future
   studies.},

Abstract = {Before the 1980s, LGBT groups in Latin America were largely (though not
   entirely) excluded from the state. This article argues that a
   combination of factorsdemocratization, social movement demands,
   neoliberal globalization and its accompanying discourse of modernityhas
   led many state actors to seek to incorporate LGBT groups into the state.
   Considering two cases of self-proclaimed revolutionary parties, Mexico's
   PRI and Nicaragua's FSLN, the article examines how and why these parties
   incorporated LGBT organizations and what impact such incorporation had
   on the LGBT groups themselves. In both countries, LGBT groups benefited
   from clientelistic resources at the same time that they found themselves
   deradicalizing, often forced to accept visibility without rights. But in
   Nicaragua, a more recent revolutionary experience and ties to a
   combative, autonomous feminist movement have allowed some LGBT activists
   to resist the state's efforts to co-opt their movement.},

Abstract = {This article introduces Pierre Bourdieu's notions of field, interest,
   and symbolic power into the study of global environmental politics, for
   the purpose of positioning the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   (IPCC) within the international field of climate politics. Revisiting
   historical accounts of the IPCC's establishment, the article explores
   the IPCC's role in generating international interest in climate change
   and the field of forces and struggles that has emerged around the
   organization and its assessment activities as a result. The IPCC
   continues to hold a central position within the climate field because of
   its symbolic power to construct the meaning of climate change. This
   makes the organization, its assessment activities, and the knowledge it
   produces central objects of struggle within the climate field, and the
   forces that this contestation produces structure all aspects of the IPCC
   and its work. The article identifies how developing-country attitudes,
   climate skepticism, and bandwagoning impact the IPCC's place in climate
   politics and its assessments of the climate problem.},

Abstract = {In this research note, we investigate the effectiveness of warnings as a
   method for increasing respondent motivation and decreasing survey
   satisficing. Four different styles of warning messages are examined in
   data from a randomized survey experiment conducted on the Internet. The
   analysis shows that three of the four warnings significantly improve
   respondent engagement. There is some evidence, however, that warning
   messages increase socially desirable responding (SDR) for certain types
   of people. We conclude that warnings can be a useful method for
   increasing attention, but that researchers should first establish that
   these protocol do not have unintended consequences, either for the
   entire sample or for theoretically relevant subgroups.},

Abstract = {The existing literature on foreign policy formulation suggests that
   individual leaders in small and politically unstable states exert a
   disproportionate impact on foreign policy-making. Some analysts further
   contend that personalized foreign policy decision-making is more likely
   to suffer from discontinuities. This article, however, argues that the
   foreign policies of small and politically unstable states exhibit
   considerable variation in terms of constancy. It does so by offering a
   comparative study of the foreign policies of the Philippines and
   Thailand towards China. It demonstrates that the Philippines' policy
   towards China underwent significant changes in the last few years of the
   administration of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, and that bilateral
   relations deteriorated rapidly after Benign Aquino III came to power in
   2010. In contrast, Thailand has maintained a cordial relationship with
   China despite domestic political turmoil since 2006. This article
   suggests that neither the shift in the distribution of capabilities nor
   the presence or absence of territorial disputes sufficiently explains
   this variation. It argues that the personalization of foreign policy and
   economic dependence are two important factors that determine constancy
   and change in the foreign policies of small states towards major powers.},

Abstract = {In a global context in which authoritarian regimes often hold elections,
   defeating dictators at the polls can play a key role in transitions to
   democracy. When the opposition is allowed to campaign for votes in such
   elections, there are strong reasons to believe that its efforts will be
   more persuasive than those of the authoritarian incumbent. This article
   examines the effect of televised campaign advertising on vote choice in
   the 1988 plebiscite that inaugurated Chile's transition to democracy.
   Using matching to analyze postelectoral survey data, it shows that the
   advertising of the opposition's no campaign made Chileans more likely to
   vote against dictator Augusto Pinochet, whereas the advertising of the
   government's yes campaign had no discernible effect. These findings
   suggest that the no campaign played an important causal role in the
   change of political regime.},

Abstract = {The South China Sea (SCS) is a conflict-ridden international arena of
   rivalry between China, the USA, India, and the other ASEAN countries
   over sovereignty, resources and security. In this geopolitical clash
   China is the dominant force and Vietnam its main challenger. While most
   analysts assume that the various claims to the mostly uninhabited
   islands are motivated by the presence of submarine mineral resources,
   the conflicts evoke strong nationalist feelings in Vietnam and China,
   fuelled by narratives of the historical presence of fisheries and
   navies. By analysing the tension between complex territorial claims, new
   technologies and forms of knowledge applied by these states to delineate
   their material borders on the sea and vernacular notions of social
   space, this paper explores how sovereignty and nationality is enacted on
   a day-to-day basis. Thus, I argue that maritime territorialisation is a
   paradox of treating the sea as land' produced by the performance of a
   socially constructed image of the state geo-body capitalising on strong
   nationalistic sentiments in China and Vietnam.},

Abstract = {The list experiment, also known as the item count technique, is becoming
   increasingly popular as a survey methodology for eliciting truthful
   responses to sensitive questions. Recently, multivariate regression
   techniques have been developed to predict the unobserved response to
   sensitive questions using respondent characteristics. Nevertheless, no
   method exists for using this predicted response as an explanatory
   variable in another regression model. We address this gap by first
   improving the performance of a naive two-step estimator. Despite its
   simplicity, this improved two-step estimator can only be applied to
   linear models and is statistically inefficient. We therefore develop a
   maximum likelihood estimator that is fully efficient and applicable to a
   wide range of models. We use a simulation study to evaluate the
   empirical performance of the proposed methods. We also apply them to the
   Mexico 2012 Panel Study and examine whether vote-buying is associated
   with increased turnout and candidate approval. The proposed methods are
   implemented in open-source software.},

Abstract = {Irresponsible fiscal behavior by subnational units is a concern for
   federal or decentralized systems, especially in the developing world.
   States' expenditures in Brazil have been no different. Still, spending
   varies considerably among the Brazilian states, even after controlling
   for their financial resources. This article provides a political
   explanation for the variation in current spending, focusing on
   intergovernmental political relationships. It argues that credit
   claiming for pork distributed in a state plays a crucial role and that
   governors elevate state spending in order to make up for their loss in
   political credit from the pork distributed by the president. Analyzing
   data from the period 1996-2005, it finds that expenditures decrease as
   the relative number of federal deputies from the state governor's party
   increases compared to the number of deputies from the president's
   governing coalition when the national agenda encourages federal pork
   distribution in the states.},

Abstract = {Recent advances in research tools for the systematic analysis of textual
   data are enabling exciting new research throughout the social sciences.
   For comparative politics, scholars who are often interested in
   non-English and possibly multilingual textual datasets, these advances
   may be difficult to access. This article discusses practical issues that
   arise in the processing, management, translation, and analysis of
   textual data with a particular focus on how procedures differ across
   languages. These procedures are combined in two applied examples of
   automated text analysis using the recently introduced Structural Topic
   Model. We also show how the model can be used to analyze data that have
   been translated into a single language via machine translation tools.
   All the methods we describe here are implemented in open-source software
   packages available from the authors.},

Abstract = {Canonical works and recent studies posit that authoritarian repression,
   like that targeting Social Democrats during the ``Second Founding{''} of
   the German Empire, depends on structural factors such as landholding
   inequality. However, at this juncture, the role of these variables was
   more complex than that in the ``grand sweep{''} of German history.
   Liberal support for the 1878 Antisocialist Law was the result of an
   interaction between the strategy of the government and structures in
   society at large. Public outcry surrounding an assassination attempt on
   the Kaiser was provoked by the Chancellor through the press, and
   utilized as a political instrument by calling new elections. Liberals
   contesting districts with high landholding inequality came under
   conservative pressure led by landed aristocrats, and were forced to take
   up stances supporting repression. This first step in the ``Second
   Founding{''} of the Empire marked an important move away from liberal
   governance which precluded democratic reform in Imperial Germany.},

Abstract = {Currently two contrasting perspectives dominate the literature on
   interest group community development. The collective action perspective
   presumes that interest group communities tend to be dominated by groups
   with few obstacles for political mobilization. The neo-pluralist
   perspective instead stresses that many interest group communities have
   inherent balancing mechanisms, assuring that over time these communities
   become increasingly diverse. Both perspectives, however, have primarily
   been developed and used in domestic settings. I argue that these
   traditional perspectives also are highly useful in studying
   transnational interest group communities. I analyze the mobilization
   patterns of 6,655 interest groups active at UN climate summits between
   1995 and 2011. While the results mostly confirm a neo-pluralist
   perspective, which entails more diverse mobilization patterns, business
   and highly specialized interests did have a clear, and possibly crucial,
   advantage in the early stages of development.},

   Regimes amid the Arab Uprisings},

Volume = {20},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The popular mass uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
   call into question the assumption, widespread prior to the ``Arab
   Spring{''}, that militaries in these countries were subservient to
   civilianized and consolidated authoritarian regime incumbents. In most
   countries militaries have stepped in to suppress uprisings, replace
   incumbents, or cause civil wars. The analysis of political-military
   relations explains the immediate outcome of popular mass mobilization in
   the MENA region and helps re-conceptualize coup-proofing as an important
   authoritarian survival strategy. Accounting for variation in the degree
   of officers' loyalty toward incumbents provides an opportunity to test
   the efficacy of coup-proofing. The article accounts for questions
   largely ignored in the theoretical literature: which coup-proofing
   mechanisms work best, and under which circumstances? In a qualitative
   comparison of Egypt and Syria, the article illustrates that
   authoritarian regimes have applied fundamentally different coup-proofing

Abstract = {This article analyses the role of narratives in European Union (EU)
   external relations in the revised European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP)
   and systematically explores how they operate in practice in the context
   of the EU's border management practices vis-a-vis the ``southern
   borderlands{''}, in particular with respect to their inclusionary and
   exclusionary potential. Key EU documents and statements by EU agents,
   released throughout the first three years of Arab uprisings and
   pertaining to the revised ENP, will be subjected to a thorough
   examination which highlights four observations: first, in spite of the
   fact that the revised ENP is rooted in several narratives, some
   nevertheless dominate over others; second, the simultaneous presence of
   and recourse to different narratives contribute to an increase, rather
   than a decrease, of uncertainty in the EU's southern borderlands; third,
   despite a multitude of narratives which serve to legitimize EU action in
   the framework of the revised ENP, the latter perpetuates the logics of
   its predecessor by generating benefits mainly for the EU itself; fourth,
   that the first three years of the revised ENP have in practice
   demonstrated that an imbalance exists between on the one hand the
   original acceptance of the narratives by EU stakeholders and on the
   other hand their willingness to abide by them and fill them with life.},

Abstract = {Is it domestic politics or the international system that more decisively
   influences foreign policy? This article focuses on Latin America's three
   largest powers to identify patterns and compare outcomes in their
   relations with the regional hegemon, the United States. Through a
   statistical analysis of voting behavior in the UN General Assembly, we
   examine systemic variables (both realist and liberal) and domestic
   variables (institutional, ideological, and bureaucratic) to determine
   their relative weights between 1946 and 2008. The study includes 4,900
   votes, the tabulation of 1,500 ministers according to their ideological
   persuasion, all annual trade entries, and an assessment of the political
   strength of presidents, cabinets, and parties per year. The findings
   show that while Argentina's voting behavior has been determined mostly
   by domestic factors and Mexico's by realist systemic ones, Brazil's has
   a more complex blend of determinants, but also with a prevalence of
   realist systemic variables.},

Abstract = {When and what is the nation, and nationalism, and when have both emerged
   in the Arab world? I suggest new ways of approaching these questions,
   and new answers. Revisiting the dating debate', I propose distinguishing
   between negative nationalism (rejecting foreign rule) and positive
   nationalism (holding the people' as the source of legitimacy), the
   latter distinctively modern, the former not. Empirically, I examine
   these theoretical propositions in light of the Arab Spring's dual
   revolution, vividly captured by its popular slogan: The people want(s)
   to bring down the regime'. I submit that the manifest revolution of
   toppling regimes pales in comparison with the ideational revolution of
   engendering positive nationalism. While the former revolution has been a
   huge surprise, the history of the Arab world abounds in precedents;
   conversely, Arab societies' subscription to the people' as the prime
   political legitimator - asserting their own inalienable political right
   to tell right from wrong - is novel. In that sense (positive)
   nationalism is the revolution of the Arab Spring, challenging both
   authorities and polities.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the research gap of water desecuritisation and
   advances an interdisciplinary approach within the issue area of
   peacebuilding. It draws upon three strands of research: security,
   peacebuilding and transboundary water management. The article examines
   three core questions: (1) how is desecuritisation conceptualised and
   understood in theory as well as within the context of water development;
   (2) in what ways are water conflict addressed within the liberal
   peacebuilding paradigm; and (3) what are the roles and implications of
   technocracy in resolving conflict and building peace? The article
   conducts a conceptual scoping, which critically probes what
   desecuritisation and peacebuilding do politically in the water sector.
   It draws empirical illustrations from the Israeli-Palestinian water
   conflict where water is securitised while major peacebuilding efforts
   have been made to desecuritise the conflict. It concludes that technical
   blueprints may run the risk of depoliticising conflict dynamics, which
   contradicts the normative assumption about desecuritisation as a return
   to normal politics. Moreover, the technocratic turn in peacebuilding
   practices have empowered certain actors, who act as the ``new{''}
   peacemakers while others are marginalised.},

Abstract = {This article calls for a decentring research agenda and serves as a
   reminder to look beyond the centres when seeking to understand attempted
   or accomplished processes of transformation. The Arab Spring is not a
   unitary whole but part of a variety of processes which differs in terms
   of space (diverse countries, diverse areas in countries), time (the
   Ghedim Izik protests in Western Sahara started in October 2010, while
   protests in the Rif are still ongoing), substance (demands for civil and
   political rights, equality rights, material claims, autonomy),
   strategies (from violence to apathy), involved actors (social movements,
   civil society organizations or individual actors) and outcomes (from
   regime repression to empowerment of peripheries).},

Abstract = {This article critically analyses an intuitive and influential conceptual
   framework by which to understand state strategy in territorial
   conflicts. According to this framework, a state in a territorial dispute
   can pursue one of three general strategies: threaten or use force; offer
   territorial concessions; or delay. This article argues that it is
   problematic to regard these three candidate strategies as mutually
   exclusive. It is argued that not only can a strategy of escalation be
   compatible with one of delay, but many uses of force can be employed
   instrumentally in service of delaying. The framework, this article
   contends, does not so much capture ``strategy{''} as it does certain
   aspects or outcomes of strategy, which while appropriate for certain
   analytical tasks is less so for others. The 2012 Scarborough Shoal
   incident is examined and China's strategy during the event is
   scrutinized with a view towards assessing the strengths and weaknesses
   of applying the framework to an analysis of narrower scope. Lastly, it
   is argued that a framework for conceptualizing state strategy in
   territorial disputes should not be confined to three alternatives; it
   should be more broadly constructed, allowing for more nuance and taking
   seriously all the domains of statecraft.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we examine the role of political ideology in shaping
   black voters' evaluations of political candidates' race and skin tone.
   Our findings challenge simplistic notions of black preference for
   descriptive representation. Instead, we argue that race matters to how
   black Americans evaluate candidates for political office, but that it
   does so in combination with both candidates' skin tone and voters'
   ideology. Specifically, our data from a set of randomized experiments
   show that black conservative Democrats, relative to their more liberal
   copartisans, express a stronger preference for black candidates relative
   to white counterparts and prefer darker-skinned candidates relative to
   lighter-skinned ones. In exploring this result, we argue that
   conservative black Democrats, who are liberal economically but more
   socially conservative, use skin tone as a heuristic to help determine
   which candidate is most likely to match their party-atypical but
   race-typical political preferences. Thus, despite being less likely to
   support affirmative action policies, black conservatives are actually
   more prone to using race and skin tone heuristics in their evaluations
   of candidates for political office. These findings are substantively
   significant. As black voters have become much more ideologically
   diverse, their preferences with respect to candidate race and skin tone
   may have greater electoral consequences.},

Abstract = {Between 1996 and 2009, a process of struggle for and (after 2002)
   partial achievement of the second incorporation of the popular sectors
   took place in Argentina. This process involved a combination of routine
   and contentious political dynamics that reformulated state-society
   relations in the postcorporatist period. As a continuation of the first
   incorporation (1943-55), the second incorporation displayed some similar
   features; other attributes were specific to this second process, mainly
   that it was not corporatist but territorial and that the central agents
   of transformation were not trade unions but the disincorporated popular
   sectors, which were territorially organized into a reincorporation
   movement. This article conceptualizes these dynamics and analyzes the
   role played by the main political actor related to this historical
   process, the piquetero (picketer) movement.},

Abstract = {This chapter aims to add to the technology debate in the sense that it
   aims to research the role of values and trust in computational models in
   the policy process. Six case studies in which a computational model was
   used within a complex policy context were research for the role values
   play within these models. Conclusions deal with the role of the designer
   of the model, the number of different actors, the amount of trust
   already present, and the question of agency by humans or technology.
   Additionally, margins of error within the model are discussed as well as
   authority by one actor over others concerning the model.},

Abstract = {This chapter seeks to provide a brief introduction to the method of
   microsimulation and its utility for the development of public policy.
   Since the inception of microsimulation in the 1950s, its use for policy
   purposes has extended from the economic to other domains as data
   availability and technological advances have burgeoned. There has also
   been growing demand in recent times to address increasingly complex
   policy issues that require new approaches. Microsimulation focuses on
   modelling individual units and the micro-level processes that affect
   their development, be they people's lives or other trajectories. It
   comes in various types, for example along the dimensions of arithmetical
   or behavioural, and static or dynamic. It has its own distinctive
   model-building process, which relies on empirical data and derived
   parameters with an insertion of chance to simulate realistic
   distributions. The particular utility of microsimulation for policy
   development lies in its ability to combine multiple sources of
   information in a single contextualised model to answer `what if'
   questions on complex social phenomena and issues.},

Title = {Participatory E-Budgeting Using GIS-Based Spatial Decision Support
   System: Kozhikode Municipal Corporation},
Booktitle = {E-GOVERNANCE FOR SMART CITIES},
Series = {Advances in 21st Century Human Settlements},
Year = {2015},
Pages = {307-350},
Abstract = {The 73rd and 74th Amendment of the Indian Constitution has brought the
   power to prepare development plans to the grass root level - to the
   Grama Panchayat on the rural side and to the Municipalities on the urban
   side. Annual budgeting in these institutions is of utmost importance as
   the implementation of development schemes is possible only through a
   logical and balanced allocation of available funds. At the municipal
   level the budget provides a balanced and coordinated approach to
   municipal activities so that requirements and responsibilities of all
   sections are analyzed while preparing a budget. One important
   innovation, Smart City embarks on is a web-based participatory
   e-Budgeting which empowers citizen. E-Budgeting will use an interactive
   and dedicated annual Municipal budgeting web site and will also use
   web-based Geographic Information System (GIS). A hundred percent
   E-Literate Smart City with smart people would like to be part of
   E-Budgeting. Participatory budgeting allows local citizens in a
   municipal ward to identify, discuss, and prioritize public spending
   projects, to make decisions about how money is spent every year.
   Kozhikode was practicing Participatory annual planning and budgeting
   since the mid-1990s. This chapter explores how the existing
   participatory budgeting can be converted to e-budgeting befitting a
   Smart city. It also demonstrates how Spatial Decision Support System
   (SDSS) that uses Geographic Information System (GIS) can be deployed in
   Kozhikode using most up-to-date data for budgetary decision making to
   help the community to arrive at the most rational budget allocation.},

Abstract = {This paper offers insights into an innovative and currently flagship
   approach of the European Union (EU) to the mitigation of chemical,
   biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) risks. Building on its
   long-time experience in the CBRN field, the EU has incorporated methods
   familiar to the students of international security governance: it is
   establishing regional networks of experts and expertise. CBRN Centers of
   Excellence, as they are officially called, aim to contribute to the
   security and safety culture in different parts of Africa, the Middle
   East, South East Asia, and South East Europe, in the broadly construed
   CBRN area. These regional networks represent a modern form of security
   cooperation, which can be conceptualized as an epistemic policy networks
   approach. It offers flexibility to the participating states, which have
   different incentives to get involved. At the same, however, the paper
   identifies potential limitations and challenges of epistemic policy
   networks in this form.},

Abstract = {In contemporary Europe, national identities are fiercely contested and
   governments have sought ways to strengthen national identification.
   Notwithstanding this European pattern, government policies are
   implemented differently and belonging to the nation comes to involve
   different images and enactments across contexts. In the Netherlands,
   especially, belonging to the nation is at stake in many high-profile
   public and political struggles. In this context, a pervasive public
   imaginary we call dialogical Dutchness' represents the Dutch as
   distinctly anti-nationalist and open to difference. This raises the
   question whether national boundaries actually become traversable in view
   of such a national imaginary. How does one become a Dutch subject if
   Dutchness entails not being nationalist? Through the analysis of a Dutch
   social policy practice - state-provided parenting courses - we show how
   dialogical Dutchness is negotiated and transformed in actual enactments
   of national difference and belonging. Although dialogical Dutchness
   foregrounds openness to difference and valorises discussion, it comes to
   perpetuate and substantiate boundaries between those who belong to the
   nation and those whose belonging is still in question.},

Abstract = {The various methodological techniques that fall under the umbrella
   description of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) are increasingly
   popular for modeling causal complexity and necessary or sufficient
   conditions in medium-N settings. Because QCA methods are not designed as
   statistical techniques, however, there is no way to assess the
   probability that the patterns they uncover are the result of chance.
   Moreover, the implications of the multiple hypothesis tests inherent in
   these techniques for the false positive rate of the results are not
   widely understood. This article fills both gaps by tailoring a simple
   permutation test to the needs of QCA users and adjusting the Type I
   error rate of the test to take into account the multiple hypothesis
   tests inherent in QCA. An empirical application-a reexamination of a
   study of protest-movement success in the Arab Spring-highlights the need
   for such a test by showing that even very strong QCA results may
   plausibly be the result of chance.},

Abstract = {The nationalist messages that family and school transmit are very often
   concurrent, making it difficult to measure their independent impact on
   individuals. In order to separate out the leverage of these two agents
   of socialisation, this article focuses on a case study in which such
   concurrence cannot be taken for granted: Catalonia. The article exploits
   variation in parents' national identification, resulting from the
   presence of a population born in other regions of Spain outside
   Catalonia, to tease out the effect of both parents and Catalan school in
   crafting individuals' identification. The results, which draw on the
   analysis of a household survey, suggest that more years of schooling
   makes more likely that individuals develop a dual identity; however,
   parents' attachment to Catalonia is key in fostering an exclusive

Abstract = {With the spectre of post-Spring Islamist rule looming, Christians in
   Syria and Egypt were forced to choose between quasi-secular autocracy
   and sectarian populism. The status quo ante under al-Assad and Mubarak,
   though democratically deficient, temporarily contained civil hostilities
   and afforded Christians with a modicum of secular protection and even
   prosperity, the degree of which sheds light on the relative absence of
   Syrian Christian protestors and the salient Coptic presence during the
   Egyptian revolution. This article explores how socio-economic and
   religious peripheral designations intersected with state policy to
   determine political (in) action amongst Christian minorities in two
   crucial countries of the region.},

Abstract = {This article interprets the role and significance of the International
   Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in global environmental and energy
   governance. First, we conduct a comparative analysis of IRENA and other
   recent innovations in global governance, showing that IRENA stands out
   with regard to the timing of creation, speed of ratification, and focus
   of the mandate. Second, we identify three mechanisms through which IRENA
   can promote the global diffusion of renewable energy: (1) by offering
   valuable epistemic services to its member states, (2) by serving as a
   focal point for renewable energy in a scattered global institutional
   environment, and (3) by mobilizing other international institutions to
   promote renewable energy. Finally, we reflect on the conditions that
   could make IRENA's policies a continued success and on the lessons that
   the experience with IRENA holds for other attempts at innovation in
   global governance.},

Title = {Estimating the Severity of the WikiLeaks US Diplomatic Cables Disclosure},

Abstract = {In November 2010, the WikiLeaks organization began the release of over
   250,000 diplomatic cables sent by U.S. embassies to the U.S. State
   Department, uploaded to its website by (then) Private Manning, an
   intelligence analyst with the U.S. Army. This leak was widely condemned,
   including by then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. We assess the
   severity of the leak by considering the size of the disclosure relative
   to all diplomatic cables that were in existence at the time-a quantity
   that is not known outside official sources. We rely on the fact that the
   cables that were leaked are internally indexed in such a way that they
   may be treated as a sample from a discrete uniform distribution with
   unknown maximum; this is a version of the well-known ``German Tank
   Problem.{''} We consider three estimators that rely on discrete
   uniformity-maximum likelihood, Bayesian, and frequentist unbiased
   minimum variance-and demonstrate that the results are very similar in
   all cases. To supplement these estimators, we employ a regression-based
   procedure that incorporates the timing of cables' release in addition to
   their observed serial numbers. We estimate that, overall, approximately
   5\% of all cables from this timeframe were leaked, but that this number
   varies considerably at the embassy-year level. Our work provides a
   useful characterization of the sample of documents available to
   international relations scholars interested in testing theories of
   ``private information,{''} while helping inform the public debate
   surrounding Manning's trial and 35-year prison sentence.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions does science influence environmental policy?
   International relations (IR) scholars argue that to gain political
   influence, science should not connect to policy before scientific
   consensus has been reached. We take this suggestion as a point of
   departure for investigating how science is and should be connected to
   policy in international environmental governance. Using insights from
   science and technology studies (STS), we discuss the contributions of
   IR, both to present its limitations and to further develop understanding
   of scientific consensus within IR and the need for separation and
   connection between science and policy. The organization and performance
   of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is used as an
   illustrative case. We conclude that the focus within STS on contextual
   and informal factors could improve understanding of the science-policy
   relationship, which tends to focus on the formal organizational design
   of the interplay between science and policy.},

Abstract = {Despite several reform measures, the electricity sector in India is
   grappling with multiple challenges including significant system losses,
   supply shortages, demand management and integrating renewable energy
   into the system network. At the same time institutional arrangements and
   relations have also transformed and consumers are asserting their demand
   for improved quality and services through the regulatory process. Both
   utilities and policy makers see Information and Communication Technology
   (ICT) as an important tool in meeting growing aspirations in the
   electricity sector. Many state utilities have improved their interaction
   with consumers through IT enabled web-based systems. Some are providing
   billing, payment and grievance redressal facilities online. Utilities
   also see significant use of ICT in improving operational efficiencies,
   theft detection, mapping of assets, managing load, outage management,
   etc. Integration of all urban basic services as envisaged under a smart
   cities, requires collection and analysis of electricity consumption data
   on real-time basis. Most utilities have deployed, automated meter
   reading (AMR) systems, prepaid meters and time of day meters for large
   revenue industrial consumers. In future, advanced Metering
   Infrastructure (AMI) compatible smart meters are expected to facilitate
   two-way communication between utilities and consumers. A Smart Grid
   Vision for India has been drafted to `transform the Indian power sector
   into a secure, adaptive, sustainable and digitally enabled eco-system
   that provides reliable and quality energy for all with active
   participation of stakeholders'. With part funding from the central
   government, state utilities are experimenting with smart pilot projects
   and if successful and effective, these pilots would be rolled out in a
   bigger way. The Energy and Resources Institutes (TERI's) recent
   initiative on making a renewable-based mini-grid smart showcases the
   possibility and utility of smart technologies in load management and
   reduced need for human intervention. The drive for smart grids and smart
   cities would certainly improve quality of civic life. However, it would
   require huge investments, resources and greater co-ordination between
   state level electricity providers and city governments. The investments
   envisaged will result in greater stress on state and city governments
   and ultimately on consumers. Hence, policy makers and regulators will
   have tread cautiously and weigh the costs and benefits of the smart
   initiatives in light of the equity objectives of the country.},

   by drawing on fieldwork conducted in summer 2012 among Palestinians of
   various ages, genders, and legal statuses living in France. By
   privileging my Palestinian informants' own understanding of what it
   means to be stateless, I question some of the assumptions that inform
   UNHCR's discourse on statelessness. I show that, while they echoed some
   of UNHCR's views on statelessness, several of my Palestinian
   interlocutors diverged from these views in that they expressed
   skepticism about the state's emancipatory potential. At a broader level,
   I show that the official categories associated with statelessness and
   that are used by UNHCR in its effort to end statelessness do not fully
   capture the predicament of Palestinians in the twenty-first century.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the sovereignty concerns of the government of the
   Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR) ahead of a 1985 joint
   cooperation agreement with the United States to account for US Prisoners
   of War/Missing in Action (POW/MIA) lost in Laos during the Vietnam War.
   It attempts to demonstrate that from the Laotian side, domestic security
   concerns and diplomatic factors were the main drivers of cooperation
   with the United States. The domestic security factor was the perceived
   threat of violence arising from American-supported subversive activities
   conducted by Thailand-based anti-LPDR resistance groups as well as
   private groups searching for alleged live POWs inside Laos. The
   diplomatic factor stemmed from Laos' desire for the United States to
   respect the country's independent foreign policymaking vis-a-vis its
   ally Vietnam. Drawing on primary sources, this article posits two
   arguments: first, the LPDR wanted to use the 1985 joint cooperation
   agreement to obtain compliance from the United States to end its support
   for both anti-LPDR resistance groups and private POW searchers; and
   second, to utilize POW/MIA negotiations with Washington to reaffirm
   Laos' sovereignty vis-a-vis Vietnam.},

Abstract = {Reconsidering development by reflecting on climate change means
   rethinking development goals, more than pursuing climate targets. Much
   analysis in the development-climate literature has framed development as
   a co-benefit, while the objective has been climate stabilization. This
   misses the point that development drives emissions, not vice versa. A
   different approach must address low-emission technologies, but also the
   high-emission parts of `development'. Politically, climate change must
   be understood as a development problem. In this conception, a key task
   for climate policy is to explore different development paths, with the
   difference in emissions being a result. Development goals need to be
   represented as explicit objectives, both in analytical modelling and as
   political goals. Methods that treat climate policy as a self-control
   mechanism in the development system, or back-cast from development
   goals, need to be improved. The article further considers levers to
   change development paths, considering lessons on how to influence change
   in complex systems. The obsession of the existing economic order is with
   economic growth and development; what needs to be considered is the
   quality of development and what it means to live well. A social contract
   for low-carbon development requires the rich to pay for mitigation, use
   less, and assist the poor; lift the poor out of poverty; and change the
   aspirations of the middle class. Such a contract requires thinking
   beyond short-term political and economic time frames, with much
   longer-term thinking and vision.},

Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Digit-based election forensics (DBEF) typically relies on null
   hypothesis significance testing, with undesirable effects on substantive
   conclusions. This article proposes an alternative free of this problem.
   It rests on decomposing the observed numeral distribution into the ``no
   fraud{''} and ``fraud{''} latent classes, by finding the smallest
   fraction of numerals that needs to be either removed or reallocated to
   achieve a perfect fit of the ``no fraud{''} model. The size of this
   fraction can be interpreted as a measure of fraudulence. Both
   alternatives are special cases of measures of model fit-the mu{*}
   mixture index of fit and the Delta dissimilarity index, respectively.
   Furthermore, independently of the latent class framework, the
   distributional assumptions of DBEF can be relaxed in some contexts.
   Independently or jointly, the latent class framework and the relaxed
   distributional assumptions allow us to dissect the observed
   distributions using models more flexible than those of existing DBEF.
   Reanalysis of Beber and Scacco's ( 2012) data shows that the approach
   can lead to new substantive conclusions.},

Abstract = {Prepaid survey incentives are an attractive tool for attempting to
   combat declining response rates. However, researchers have expressed
   concern that the use of incentives may bring less motivated respondents
   into the sample, reducing response quality. In this paper, we explore
   whether a prepaid cash incentive in a telephone survey affected the
   prevalence of 11 indicators of response quality by comparing the answers
   of respondents who received a \$5 incentive with those of respondents
   who did not receive one. Significant differences between the incentive
   and control groups are observed for only two of these 11 indicators; the
   respondents who received the incentive had less item nonresponse but
   spent less time per question. We find some evidence that these effects
   may be limited to the second half of the questionnaire. We also assess
   whether the effect of the incentive varied according to respondent
   characteristics, such as age, educational attainment, and household
   income, finding minimal evidence that this was the case. Overall, these
   findings should be reassuring for researchers considering the use of
   prepaid cash incentives.},

Abstract = {In this chapter, we discuss the consequences of complexity in the real
   world together with some meaningful ways of understanding and managing
   such situations. The implications of such complexity are that many
   social systems are unpredictable by nature, especially when in the
   presence of structural change (transitions). We shortly discuss the
   problems arising from a too-narrow focus on quantification in managing
   complex systems. We criticise some of the approaches that ignore these
   difficulties and pretend to predict using simplistic models. However,
   lack of predictability does not automatically imply a lack of managerial
   possibilities. We will discuss how some insights and tools from
   ``complexity science{''} can help with such management. Managing a
   complex system requires a good understanding of the dynamics of the
   system in question-to know, before they occur, some of the real
   possibilities that might occur and be ready so they can be reacted to as
   responsively as possible. Agent-based simulation will be discussed as a
   tool that is suitable for this task, and its particular strengths and
   weaknesses for this are discussed.},

Abstract = {The issue of conditionality and how the EU should seek to influence
   positive transformations in its periphery is as relevant today as it was
   in the early 1990s. There are some important lessons that can still be
   learned from the Spanish transition to democracy in this respect. By
   combining strict conditionality with its `normative power', the European
   Community managed to shape-if not make-the Spanish transition to
   democracy. The consensus surrounding European integration worked as a
   unifying factor amongst all of the elite groups by giving them a common
   goal. This broad consensus ensured that no elite group could act in the
   sort of irresponsible way that could jeopardise the democratisation
   process and, by inference, the integration of Spain with the Community.
   At the same time, the EC worked as a sort of moderating force. Neither
   of these positive effects would have occurred had the EC not used its
   leverage potential and remained firmed in its stance of conditioning
   accession to Spain taking clear steps towards democratisation.},

Abstract = {The article scrutinizes the structural conditions under which the
   European Commission works to implement the political aim of constructing
   a pan-European path to commemorating the mass crimes of the twentieth
   century. The pivotal obstacle to attaining a common European way of
   remembering the `negative history' of the continent (or to at least
   opening up room for discussion about it) lies in the debate between
   those who stress the singularity of the Holocaust and those who demand
   that the atrocities of both the National Socialist and the Communist
   regimes should equally be recognized. Bearing this in mind, the article
   analyses how the Commission makes use of existing networks of experts in
   research, memorialization and education and how the specific
   interrelatedness of these networks affects the Europeanization effort.
   In particular, it examines the role of networking conferences,
   highlights two exemplary fields of antecedent interrelations between the
   memory actors who were convened by the Commission and points to the
   implications of the fact that the networks and actors involved do not
   necessarily share a pan-European agenda.},

Booktitle = {E-GOVERNANCE FOR SMART CITIES},
Series = {Advances in 21st Century Human Settlements},
Year = {2015},
Pages = {47-64},
Abstract = {E-Governance or Smart Government is buzzword across Europe to improve
   interaction between government and stakeholders. Governments both at
   national and local level are making efforts to transform themselves into
   a well-connected entity that responds efficiently to the needs of its
   citizens by developing an integrated back-office infrastructure. Cities
   are implementing smart and innovative means to improve quality of life
   and enhance competitiveness. Various measures are being taken to provide
   transparent, efficient, innovative and responsive government through
   adoption of various Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
   tools. Stuttgart, located in south-west of Germany is no exception which
   started its E-Government initiative a decade ago, has today crossed
   significant milestones. Various e-services platforms are created to
   inform and assist citizens and e-transaction platforms are created to
   reduce the burden on existing staff in various departments. These
   services have shown remarkable results in management of some areas such
   as waste, mobility, human resource, etc. These platforms are still
   evolving and being created and developed after a thorough research,
   planning and consultative process with various stakeholders. Stuttgart
   has been successful in extending the reach of services digitally to its
   citizens and promoting a sense of sustainability. This city takes care
   of wide spectrum of administrative, political and social services
   through diverse ICT and Geographic Information System (GIS) platforms.
   Stuttgart is hub of high-tech auto industry and also known for its
   advanced ICT industry and highly innovative green technologies. This
   sense of sustainability is also reflected in adoption of environmental
   friendly practices which are being supported by befitting e-democracy
   and E-Governance measures. The objective of this paper is to review
   process of formation of E-Government services in Germany and the key
   milestone related to development of E-governance in Stuttgart. An case
   of best practices in mobility is presented to ascertain if Stuttgart
   leads its way to be a smart city.},

Abstract = {The paradigm shift in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is an
   instructive case to study the Europeanization of national media
   discourses. Yet, the symbolic influence of CAP reform cannot be
   sufficiently understood without considering its embeddedness in global
   policy frameworks. Hence, by means of content analysis, this paper aims
   to elucidate the impact of both global and EU farm- policy ideas on
   domestic debates. In particular, it seeks to reveal to what extent the
   multiple authorship behind the reform is reflected in discussion. Thus,
   the focus is on the institutional entrepreneurs with a say in the media,
   the ideas promoted and discursive interrelations.},

Abstract = {High rerunning rates among incumbents and among the two major parties
   allow studies of U.S. incumbency advantage to bypass the selection
   problem of who chooses to rerun. In countries where rerunning is not
   widespread among individuals or parties, estimation using methods
   developed for the United States may result in a sample selection bias.
   In countries with party switching, there may be a disconnect between
   party and individual estimates. This article proposes a definition of
   incumbency advantage that is valid for countries that present any of
   these characteristics and that is valid for cross-country comparison:
   the effect of incumbency for an individual politician on the
   unconditional probability of winning. I illustrate the issues raised in
   this article with evidence from Brazilian mayoral elections.},

Abstract = {The experiences of communities in Rio de Janeiro under threat of removal
   through gentrification or mega-event construction present an opportunity
   to review the process and impact of urban community mobilization. This
   article assesses the determinants of community strategies, the
   challenges to implementation, and the impact of mobilization on outcomes
   for such communities. It reviews the case of Vila Autodromo, detailing
   the dynamic influence of both rational expectations and the right to the
   city ideology in developing resistance strategies and providing evidence
   to confirm the importance of social capital and civic capacity for
   community efficacy. The analysis updates theorizing beyond the politics
   of clientelism and contributes to understanding how the urban regime
   approach may apply to the Latin American context, while demonstrating
   the continued relevance of the political opportunity structure for
   determining policy outcomes.},

Abstract = {Although Likert scales in agree-disagree (A/D) format are popular in
   surveys, the data quality yielded by them is controversial among
   researchers. Recognizing the measurement issues involved with the A/D
   format, researchers have developed other question formats to measure
   attitudes. In this study, we focused on an alternative question type,
   the item-specific (IS) question, which asks the respondent to choose an
   option that best describes his or her attitude. Using political efficacy
   items from the American National Election Studies (ANES), we compare
   extreme response style (ERS) between A/D and IS scales. Latent class
   factor analysis showed that ERS exists in both A/D and IS scale formats,
   but differs slightly across the two. Also, when analyzing ERS within
   subjects across two waves, there is only a single ERS for both question
   formats, after controlling for the correlation within respondents. The
   last finding suggests that ERS is a stable characteristic.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to comparative environmental politics by
   integrating comparative analysis with debates about ontological politics
   as well as science and technology studies. Comparative environmental
   analysis makes two tacit assumptions: that the subject of comparison
   (e.g., an environmental policy framework) is mobile and can be detached
   from its contexts; and that studying this subject in more than one
   location can identify its diffusion and implementation anywhere. These
   assumptions are sites of ontological politics by predetermining (or
   restricting) environmental outcomes. Environmental analysis needs to
   consider how its own comparative acts might reify supposedly global
   frameworks rather than acknowledging how different localities
   appropriate and give meaning to them in diverse ways. The concept of
   civic epistemologies illustrates how domestic politics are organized
   around supposedly global concepts, rather than how global concepts
   diffuse around the world, as illustrated here by a comparative analysis
   of the United Nations' Green Economy Initiative.},

Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {79},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Recent polls report majorities of the public supporting marriage
   recognition for same-sex couples. These reports are not uniform, with
   some polling organizations still reporting less than a majority in
   favor. I examine variation in these results using meta-analysis to
   examine variation among organizations (n(org) = 21) and question
   wordings (n(qw) = 36). I also examine direct effects that explain
   variation based on question framing from 1996 to 2014 (n(poll) = 138).
   The results show that after accounting for this variation, a majority of
   the public supports same-sex marriage in 2014, and any deviations from
   that estimate can be explained by question framing and organizational
   ``house{''} effects. The results indicate that questions that focus on
   the issue of ``same-sex marriage{''} garner less support than questions
   on legal recognition of marriages for same-sex couples; this finding
   suggests that framing accounts for why some polls do not report
   majorities in favor.},

Title = {Money or Mandate? Why International Organizations Engage with the
   Climate Change Regime},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {79+},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Inter-governmental organizations (IGOs) engage with other regimes,
   particularly in climate change, where an increasing number of IGOs
   participate in the annual negotiations. None of the three dominant
   explanations for this behavior-statist, substantive issue linkage, and
   resource-dependency theory-adequately accounts for variation in the
   nature of IGO engagement. This article proposes that variation is best
   captured by organizational type. Normative organizations have a legal
   mandate to supervise a body of international law, are strongly wedded to
   their core mandate, and are less likely to engage with new issues.
   Functional organizations are project-oriented, seek to maximize
   resources, and are more likely to engage with new issues. A comparative
   case study of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the
   United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) illustrates how
   organization type explains variation in their rhetoric, structure, and
   policy. UNHCR, a normative organization, was more reluctant than IOM, a
   functional organization, to engage with climate change displacement and
   migration debates. This article calls for international relations
   scholars to investigate how differences in IGO design lead to
   differences in organizational behavior.},

Abstract = {Many global environmental agreements have shown diverse changes in their
   long-term implementation. Comparative studies on international regimes
   are limited, and research on change in such regimes is not well
   developed. A comparative typological study of change in global
   environmental regimes is presented in this paper. Ernst B. Haas's
   ``three models of change{''} is chosen as a framework to explain change
   in the regimes. The models are (1) incremental growth, (2) turbulent
   nongrowth, and (3) managed interdependence. They reflect the shift of
   power balance among member states and their knowledge of policies. The
   models are applied to five case studies covering the Ramsar, CITES
   (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora
   and Fauna), Basel, Ozone, and Climate regimes, which have been in effect
   for over 15 years. The three models help explain diverse changes in
   those regimes. Five factors, (1) shift of power balance and political
   leadership, (2) the scope of the regime (narrow or wide), (3)
   institutional legacy, (4) consensual knowledge and conflict of political
   value, and (5) learning between rival groups, have made major
   contribution to the change in those regimes.},

Abstract = {Replacing a banknotes series is meaningful for politicians and the
   general public even today, while most transactions are executed through
   virtual means. The choice of images carried on banknotes represents the
   limits of the State's sovereign border and becomes a means of banal
   nationalism. Moreover, by utilising scopic regimes, the hegemony
   portrays the cultural and political borders: historical figures from the
   country's past on one side, and an imagined or physical border,
   expressed through the illustrations on the back. This paper addresses
   the latter and examines the case of the State of Israel. The analysis of
   sites and landscapes that appear on national banknotes can decipher the
   construction process of a territorial identity' which, along with
   struggles for maintaining identity, provides the basis of the
   nation-state. Using Williams's typology of selective tradition, we argue
   that Israeli banknotes demonstrate a mixture of residual and new
   cultural content.},

Abstract = {This article examines whether there is gender segmentation in civic
   participation in Latin America, and whether such segmentation is related
   to gender differences in political participation. Confirming the
   findings of other studies, this analysis indicates that there is gender
   segmentation in civic associational activities, and that men are more
   involved than women in political activities, except for voting. Among
   those involved in civic activities, however, women attend meetings more
   often than men or about equally in all types of activities under
   consideration, except for sports and recreational pursuits. This
   highlights the need to differentiate between type and intensity of civic
   participation and provides empirical evidence that Latin American women
   have strong community ties through a variety of organizations. The
   regression analysis shows that civic engagement has a positive effect on
   political participation but that the magnitude of that effect varies by
   gender depending on the activity.},

Title = {Smart City E-Governance: Issues and Future},
Booktitle = {E-GOVERNANCE FOR SMART CITIES},
Series = {Advances in 21st Century Human Settlements},
Year = {2015},
Pages = {353-390},
Abstract = {Issues for developing Smart City E-Governance in India are unique. Two
   basic issues are the levels of E-Governance Infrastructure in position,
   namely information and communication technology (ICT) and relative
   ability of population subgroups to access the E-Governance
   infrastructure. There has not been uniform social development of urban
   and rural population and also population subgroups such as male and
   female, scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribes (ST), Muslims and
   non-Muslims in India. Therefore uniform environment of developing Smart
   City E-Governance does not exist. These target groups require differing
   policy set to make their access to Smart E-Governance possible. This
   partitioning of subgroups into different levels of accessibility to
   Smart E-Governance is the major issues of Smart E-Governance in India.
   There has been rapid development in ICT such as telephones, mobiles and
   Internet in India in absolute terms but when it is converted to
   percentage figures it gives very negative impression doubting the
   possibility of Smart City E-Governance in India. Also, E-Government
   survey conducted by United Nations in 2012 places India in the lowest
   quartile. However recent development of E-Commerce in India gives
   considerable hopes for E-Governance. E-Commerce and E-Governance shares
   the same ecosystem but E-Commerce has shown very rapid development and
   GDP generated can even surpass health and education sector in India.
   These developments are mainly generated by potential smart cities in
   India. This gives positive assurance that carefully selected about 31
   mega cities, million pilus cities in India and can be developed for
   Smart City E-Governance. Other towns from about 8,000 census towns have
   to wait to overcome their population-related access to Smart City
   E-Governance. This concluding chapter in the last part highlights the
   further reaches of E-Governance discussed in all chapters of the book as
   part of its future.},

Abstract = {This paper evaluates the competitiveness of the European Union (EU) and
   Russia's regime preferences in their foreign policies towards Ukraine in
   the scope of the ongoing Ukraine crisis. It is argued that the
   underpinning geopolitical environment Ukraine currently resides in,
   wedged between two much larger powers (the EU and Russia), renders it a
   vulnerable target state for regime promotion from both sides. Indeed,
   since the 2004 Orange revolution in Ukraine, both the EU and Russia have
   had discernible regime promotion strategies in their foreign policies.
   The EU's regime promotion has focussed on facilitating democracy in
   Ukraine, along with more material interests (trade and strategic aims)
   while Russia has reacted with increasingly zero-sum policies which
   pursue its preference for having a loyal and Russian-facing regime in
   Ukraine. Ultimately, the increasing competitiveness of the EU and Russia
   has been a key factor in the onset of the Ukraine crisis, which offers
   important insight into the relationship between large powers and the
   smaller third states which lie in their overlapping spheres of
   influence.},

Abstract = {This article examines how allies who shared the same overall goal chose
   different tactics. It compares how Norway, Poland, and Lithuania pursued
   a strengthened emphasis on collective defense in the revision of NATO's
   strategic concept, which was adopted in 2010. In their efforts on
   influence the outcome of this process, the three allies made use of both
   bilateral and multilateral channels, but differed in terms of rhetoric,
   political access, use of media, and mix of national and alliance
   interests. The article finds that not only size, but also different
   levels of alliance maturity and diplomatic skills can explain the
   different tactics. As the study demonstrates, these differences not only
   create internal dynamics in the form of learning and division of labor,
   but they can also affect decision-making.},

Abstract = {Smart cities are smart not only in terms of higher level of services but
   also having an efficient and effective system. Its locationality brings
   balanced regional development. Better governed institutions are the one
   where procedures are transparent. E-Governance has increased the
   interlinkages between different departments. Through E-Governance,
   services provided are varying from birth/death certificate, booking of
   community facilities and town planning. The usage of mobile for
   M-Governance also provides last mile connectivity and its applicability
   streamlines not only the data collection but also analysis. The chapter
   attempts to understand the definitions of E-Governance and its
   parameters. Through two case studies of Ahmedabad and Hyderabad, it
   tries to find answers of: whether E-Governance or M-Governance's
   implementation led to transformative governance including increased
   participation or transparent administration or not? and where both the
   cities stand in the 5 stages of E-Governance evolution from basic web
   presence to well-connected smart governance and 4 model of
   non-transformation of government structure to creation of smart
   administration to rearranging the position of government within the
   urban system.},

Abstract = {The Cancun conference decided to establish a Climate Green Fund (CGF) to
   help developing countries align their development policies with the
   long-term UNFCCC objectives. This paper clarifies the links between the
   two underlying motives: the first, technical in nature, is the necessity
   to redirect the infrastructure instruments in these countries (energy,
   transportation, building, material transformation industry) to avoid
   lock-in in carbon-intensive pathways in the likely absence of a
   significant world carbon price in the coming decade; the second,
   political in nature, is the interpretation of the CGF as a practical
   translation of the notion of the common but differentiated
   responsibility principle, since the funds are expected to come from
   Annex 1 countries. This paper shows why this latter perspective might
   generate some distrust given the orders of magnitude of funds to be
   levied in Annex 1 countries especially in the context of the financial
   crisis and major constraints on public budgets. It then explores the
   basic principles around which it is possible to minimize these risks by
   upgrading climate finance in the broader context of the evolution of the
   financial and monetary systems. After exploring how such links could
   help make climate policies that contribute to reducing some of the
   imbalances caused by economic globalization by reorienting world savings
   and reducing investment uncertainty, it sketches how this perspective
   might be palatable for the OECD, the major emerging economies and fossil
   fuel exporters.},

Abstract = {Protracted droughts and scarce water resources, combined with internal
   and cross-border migration, have contributed to the securitization of
   discourses around migration and water in much of the Middle East.
   However, there is no clear understanding of the conditions under which
   water, climate change, and migration are conceived of as security
   concerns or of their policy implications. This article explores the
   different means through which Israel, Jordan, and Syria have framed
   issues of water, climate change, and migration as national security
   concerns. Based upon an analysis of governmental and publicly available
   documents, coupled with field interviews with Israeli and Jordanian
   policymakers, experts, and nongovernmental organizations, we identify
   two different framings of the water-climate-migration nexus, depending
   on whether migration is largely external or internal. In Israel and
   Jordan, concern with influxes of external migrants elevated migration as
   a security issue in part through impacts on already-scarce water
   resources. In Syria, where severe drought in the early 2000s prompted
   large-scale internal migration, officials downplayed connections between
   scarce water resources, drought, and internal migration, part of a
   broader pattern of rural neglect. Unlike much of the conventional
   literature that has posited a linear relationship between climate
   change, decreasing water availability, and migration, we provide a more
   robust picture of the water-climate-migration nexus that shows how
   securitized framings take different forms and produce several unintended
   consequences.},

Abstract = {In most multidimensional spatial models, the systematic component of
   agent utility functions is specified as additive separable. We argue
   that this assumption is too restrictive, at least in the context of
   spatial voting in mass elections. Here, assuming separability would
   stipulate that voters do not care about how policy platforms combine
   positions on multiple policy dimensions. We present a statistical
   implementation of Davis, Hinich, and Ordeshook's (1970) Weighted
   Euclidean Distance model that allows for the estimation of the direction
   and magnitude of non-separability from vote choice data. We demonstrate
   in a Monte-Carlo experiment that conventional separable model
   specifications yield biased and/or unreliable estimates of the effect of
   policy distances on vote choice probabilities in the presence of
   non-separable preferences. In three empirical applications, we find
   voter preferences on economic and socio-cultural issues to be
   nonseparable. If non-separability is unaccounted for, researchers run
   the risk of missing crucial parts of the story. The implications of our
   findings carry over to other fields of research: checking for
   non-separability is an essential part of robustness testing in empirical
   applications of multidimensional spatial models.},

Abstract = {Nation-building throughout Southeast Asia has been undertaken in
   contexts where minority groups, living on the margins of society, are
   being forced into recent state constructions, and have had their
   cultures eroded as a result. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for
   education have provided international benchmarks for literacy. These
   have been adopted by the Cambodian state, and a number of donors and
   NGOs have funded and enacted policies with the explicit aim of improving
   the language skills of Cambodia's highland communities. However, these
   are being implemented in communities that do not speak Khmer (the
   Cambodian national language), and do not have indigenous systems of
   writing. Drawing on fieldwork in Cambodia, this paper argues that the
   impact of the MDGs has been to depoliticize an inherently contested
   terrain, and to ironically silence communities on fundamental issues by
   teaching them to read, write and speak the national language. This has
   limited their capacity to perform sovereignty by restricting the very
   voice they are entitled to speak.},
