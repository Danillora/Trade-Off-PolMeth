Title = {Make do, or mend? EU security provision in complex conflicts: the
   Democratic Republic of Congo},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {101-119},
Abstract = {This article assesses whether the EU contributes to long-term positive
   change in societies emerging from violent conflict, helping them ` mend'
   or whether it simply encourages societies to `make do' with the status
   quo. To do so, the article focuses on two of the principles found in the
   Treaty, peace and justice for human rights violations. It examines how
   the EU translates the principles of peace and justice into policy and
   puts them into practice by analyzing EU engagement in peace mediation,
   transitional justice, and security sector reform in general and through
   in-depth examination of EU engagement in the Democratic Republic of
   Congo. It questions the prevailing discourse that greater
   inter-institutional coherence would improve EU security provision and
   considers whether and how the EU prioritizes between peace and justice.
   The article finds that principles may be translated into policy and put
   into practice, and practice is often ahead of policy. But this is uneven
   within as well as across the institutions. Greater coherence between
   principle, policy, and practice, rather than between institutions, would
   improve EU security provision and enable prioritization. If the EU
   settles for making do, it undermines its considerable potential to
   contribute to long-term solutions to complex conflicts.},

Title = {E-Governance and Its Role in Infrastructure Services of UAE, Case
   Study-Dubai},
Booktitle = {E-GOVERNANCE FOR SMART CITIES},
Series = {Advances in 21st Century Human Settlements},
Year = {2015},
Pages = {81-97},
Abstract = {As per World Bank (www.worldbank.org) definition (AOEMA report):
   `E-Government refers to the use by government agencies of information
   technologies such as Wide Area Networks, the Internet and mobile
   computing that have the ability to transform relations with citizens,
   businesses and other arms of government'. These technologies are meant
   to serve a variety of different ends that includes: (1) Better delivery
   of government services to citizens. (2) Improved interactions with
   business and industry. (3) Citizen empowerment through access to
   information. (4) More efficient government management etc. Many
   countries are adapting to the E-Governance and its applications in the
   field of infrastructure to improve the governmental services and
   providing empowerment to the citizens. Dubai is an example of one such
   city in the UAE which has been at the forefront of adopting the advanced
   technologies to improve the efficiency of governance and including
   itself in the list of smart cities. This chapter is effort to represent
   Dubai as the city which has transformed itself to form smart city and
   adopted the technologies for E-Governance in the field of
   infrastructure. With the effort of visionary leadership of UAE has
   initiated numerous E-Government programmes that aimed at effective
   policy making, and service delivery. The city is constantly growing with
   substantial influx of expat population every year to contribute to the
   city's trade and commerce. To achieve the target, the city is making
   efforts to reach to every individual through information and network
   especially in the field of infrastructure facility provision creating a
   strong bond with the government. The smart technology in E-Governance
   becomes active from the time when a person enters the city as well as in
   day to day services. Today the UAE is considered to have one of the most
   advanced and world-class information and communication technology
   infrastructures. This chapter has listed few smart services that are
   used in Dubai as a part of E-Governance. With the Information technology
   picking up, the e-services are becoming mere necessity in the human
   life. Use of the smart facilities to interact with the Dubai residents
   is offering convenience in better service delivery, people empowerment,
   easy access to information, improved productivity and cost savings in
   business and participation in public policy decision-making in the
   governmental activities. Although there are some grey areas and gaps for
   which the city is making best efforts to come up with an efficient
   solution and set up an example of E-Governance in front of the developed
   world. With the success of its E-Government initiatives and its overall
   popularity for its strong infrastructure and standards of living, it
   will achieve its goal in public sector integration, and successfully
   deliver its services to all residents.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the construction of migration policies in the EU
   neighbourhood. While realist accounts insist that nation-states are
   rational actors and policies are based on their needs and interest-based
   calculations, the constructivist arguments, promoted by World Society
   theory, emphasize the impact of global political culture on shaping
   policies of social entities. On the example of migration policy-making
   in the EU neighbourhood post-Soviet states I argue that migration
   policies are highly standardized despite diverging geopolitical
   interests of these nationstates. Population control migration models are
   promoted under the global cultural theme of economic progress and are
   highly individual-centred in content, regardless of emigration or
   immigration concerns of nation-states, their power dynamics and economic
   standing. These scripted purposes for policy adoption diffuse regardless
   of imposed conditionality.},

Abstract = {The article is a result of field studies on the transformations of
   multicultural heritage in the east-central European cities of Cracow,
   Wroclaw, Lviv and Chernivtsi. In all these cities, a majority of the
   pre-war populations (and in Wroclaw, practically all pre-war residents)
   disappeared as a result of WWII. After decades of silence imposed by the
   ruling communist elites, collective memories of the post-war populations
   are now surfacing in public discourse. Precisely how the contemporary
   populations living in the zones of ` dismembered multiethnicity'
   approach the past's cultural diversity in the everyday life remains,
   however, an underinvestigated topic. Under these circumstances,
   ethnography proves to be an innovative methodological approach
   particularly suited to studying local expressions of transnational
   memory. Based on the methodological approach of multi-sited ethnography,
   the article examines thematic restaurants which allude to cultures of
   some perished ethnic groups (in particular, Jews, Poles and Germans).},

Abstract = {The establishment of measurement equivalence/invariance (ME/I) across
   groups is a precondition to conducting any cross-group comparisons;
   otherwise, one could not know for sure whether the observed
   between-group difference is due to real differences among the constructs
   of interest or to differences in how they are measured. However, many
   multinational corporations (MNCs) actually measure and compare results
   of customer surveys across groups defined by countries, languages, or
   between Business-to-Business (B2B) and Business-to-Consumer (B2C)
   customers without first testing ME/I. In this article, we illustrate how
   to apply multiple statistical techniques to investigate ME/I, plus we
   evaluate both construct equivalence and differential item functioning
   (DIF). We hope that illustrating how such analyses can be done with
   relative ease may encourage more practitioners to perform ME/I as a
   routine practice rather than an exception.},

Abstract = {In this article, I trace how the race-making of people, viruses, and the
   places they share became a powerful means by which Chinese public health
   professionals made sense of two major infectious outbreaks that
   threatened to stall or interrupt China's development: the SARS outbreak
   of 2003 and the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009. By inscribing
   geographical stability onto infected bodies in motion through the
   languages of race and genetics, Chinese public health professionals
   sought to constrain the mobility of infection and, in doing so, to
   contain the symbolic and material threats to China's modernity and
   development that flu-like infections, and the people who carried and
   spread them, had come to represent. While SARS in this imaginary became
   a ``Chinese{''} or ``Cantonese{''} disease, H1N1 became a EuroAmerican
   disease that, when it reached inside China, adhered more easily to those
   Chinese who did not quite belong. In constructing this imaginary, public
   health professionals' racialization of certain groups thought to be
   infectious joined with the racialization of the infections themselves.
   H1N1 could not easily infect most Chinese because both the virus and its
   hosts were racially alien.},

Abstract = {Why did ASEAN create a regional human rights body? The 2008 ASEAN
   Charter includes the ``promotion and protection{''} of human rights
   among ASEAN's Principles and Purposes. It also declared that ASEAN would
   establish a human rights body. This raises an empirical puzzle given the
   prevailing ASEAN norm of ``non-interference in the internal affairs of
   one another{''}, which traditionally has meant that human rights records
   are excluded as a criterion of membership of ASEAN, and as a topic for
   (official) dialogue. Member states have refrained from publicly
   criticizing one another in regard to human rights. This article argues
   that regional norms are shaped by competing perceptions of legitimacy.
   Members' interpretations of the legitimacy of ASEAN and its norms as
   perceived by those outside the region ``external regional legitimacy{''}
   were crucial in shaping the decision to establish a regional human
   rights body. This article makes the case that more attention should be
   paid to legitimacy in the study of regional norms.},

Abstract = {Many political leaders of the Global South oppose linkages between trade
   liberalization and environmental protection. We field-tested a
   combination of surveys and conjoint experiments in Costa Rica,
   Nicaragua, and Vietnam to examine whether citizens in developing
   countries share this position. The results show that citizens do not
   view economic integration and environmental protection as a trade-off.
   To the contrary, individuals with greener preferences are more
   supportive of trade liberalization. Furthermore, and in contrast to
   prevailing government rhetoric, the majority of citizens support
   environmental clauses in trade agreements. These findings suggest that
   there might be room for more ambitious efforts to include environmental
   standards in international trade agreements.},

Abstract = {This article examines the fiscal dimensions of recent support for
   Catalan secession. Since the region is a cultural community distinct
   from the rest of Spain, much research has spotlighted national identity
   features in the calculus of Catalan political aspirations. This study
   supplements this work by contextualising support for Catalan
   independence in terms of the state's fiscal arrangements with the use of
   public opinion survey data. Even after controlling for self-reported
   cultural identity and other relevant factors, it argues that support for
   independence is a function of grievances rooted in the desire for
   Catalonia to assume responsibility for taxation and spending policy.
   Meanwhile, it validates some observations about Catalonia's separatist
   movement, while bringing others into question, and offers support for
   the theoretical framework linking political economy to secessionism. The
   results suggest that Spain might be able to stave off Catalonia's
   separatist bid through some form of political and taxation policy
   reconfiguration, with the caveats that cultural identity factors and the
   existence of other separatist movements across the country complicate
   this strategy.},

Abstract = {Methodological nationalism is still dominant in nationalism studies.
   When studying the construction of national identities, scholars
   generally limit their study to the borders of one nation-state, while
   only paying attention to members of that particular nation. Implicitly,
   foreign actors and influences are left out of the picture. I will
   challenge this methodological nationalism with a case study, which
   demonstrates that the place of Toledo within the Spanish national
   imagination, and more particularly that of El Greco, the most important
   representative of the city's artistic heritage, was largely determined
   by foreigners. During the nineteenth century, El Greco was rediscovered
   primarily by foreign scholars and artists. Moreover, it would be the
   rise of international tourism in the early twentieth century that
   convinced Toledans to adopt El Greco as the city's main artistic icon.
   This case, thus, clearly shows that in nationalism studies
   methodological nationalism can be avoided by also including foreign
   actors.},

Title = {Subnational Adaptation Finance Allocation: Comparing Decentralized and
   Devolved Political Institutions in Kenya},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {118-139},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Adaptation finance is designed to help vulnerable populations withstand
   effects of climate variability and change. However, levels of
   vulnerability seldom determine finance distribution. Political and
   economic preferences of national and local government decision-makers
   tend to direct funding streams. This article takes an institutional
   approach to adaptation finance allocation by comparing decentralized and
   devolved local governance structures managing adaptation finance in
   Kenya before and after the Constitution of 2010. Prior to reforms,
   funding was directed through decentralized mechanisms operating within
   district councils and local authorities; recently, devolution of
   political, administrative, and fiscal decision-making to county
   governments coincided with piloting of new local adaptation funds.
   Theory suggests that devolution institutionalizes more participative
   decision-making and fairer allocations. Evidence suggests vulnerable
   communities are indeed more likely to access, design, and receive
   allocations of finance in devolved political systems.},

Abstract = {This article investigates forest policies and institutions surrounding
   REDD+ in three heavily forested countries: India, Tanzania, and Mexico.
   The comparative analysis leads to three key insights. First, each of the
   case study countries has multiple land tenure statutes that result in
   different distributions of the costs and benefits of forest protection
   for key stakeholders. Second, land tenure regimes that offer local
   communities the most secure forest rights are not necessarily those
   associated with benefit-sharing mechanisms outlined in national REDD+
   policy proposals. Third, a credible commitment by government to share
   REDD+ benefits with forest-dependent people is contingent on the
   interests of key actors involved in the policy process. Political and
   administrative structures that limit the power and authority of forest
   government bodies lead to more responsive and accountable policy
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {Transboundary haze pollution from land and forest fires is an annual
   environmental disaster in Southeast Asia that cannot be resolved without
   applying both domestic and international legal systems. This article
   will examine the extent to which international law has influenced ASEAN
   approaches in addressing transboundary haze pollution. It does so by
   examining two international legal frameworks. The first is customary
   international law, namely the state responsibility for transboundary
   environmental harm principle, and the second is Multilateral Environment
   Agreements (MEAs) in atmosphere and biodiversity. It discusses how
   international law frameworks can contribute to solving regional
   environmental problems, and how fully applying the principles of
   international law and improving cooperation in ASEAN can strengthen the
   regional legal framework. Ultimately, the best solution to land/forest
   fires is to improve collaboration at the local level through
   capacity-building and customary practices. ASEAN approaches to
   transboundary haze pollution do not currently address the problem
   effectively.},

Abstract = {Until recently, consensus existed in certain circles that the African
   industry was not suitable for cost-effective production of quality, safe
   drugs. Yet, public and private pharmaceutical enterprises have cropped
   up on the continent, with some venturing into production of
   sophisticated and complex drugs, such as antiretrovirals (ARVs). In our
   study, we analyse and contrast the dynamics of local pharmaceutical
   manufacturing in Mozambique and Zimbabwe with the objective of
   understanding why pharmaceutical production in Africa is picking up
   momentum and the influence of global funding for ARVs in this process.
   Our analysis identifies two routes of development for local
   pharmaceutical manufacturing: a favourable economic outlook and support
   from the international community created the necessary conditions for
   the development of the nascent pharmaceutical industry in Mozambique,
   while in Zimbabwe, the presence of an established local industry was
   instrumental in bringing in favourable, if not always coherent,
   government regulation. In both countries, the introduction of AIDS
   treatment created windows of opportunity for local production of
   pharmaceuticals by increasing public sector demand, providing fresh
   funds, and providing a justification for government regulation favouring
   local production. Despite the long-standing and well-known problems that
   created persistent shortcomings in human resources and in the economic
   and industrial environments, we conclude that pre-existing developmental
   roots, international funds and supportive state industrial policies are
   encouraging more manufacturers to enter the business of local
   pharmaceutical production in Africa. However, the opportunities brought
   in by fresh AIDS funds will need to be sensibly managed at both the
   local and global levels, as the world's interest on the disease may not
   last in the long term.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the evolution of popular protest in the Rif within
   the Moroccan context of contention. It considers the specificity of the
   demands expressed and the strategies for mobilization adopted as a
   result of a long-term process of regional activism. The article finds
   that protesters in the Rif have had agency to conduct their own
   strategies, using the opportunity structure opened at state level to
   advance their own agenda. The pre-existing mobilizing structures and the
   reproduction of patterns of centre-periphery tension in the course of
   the contention have fostered a progressive localization of protest in
   the region, which has strengthened regional identity and regionalist
   activism in the Rif.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},

Volume = {23},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {459-476},
Abstract = {Proposing an `inverted telescope' for border studies, we problematized
   existing calls to `see like a border', arguing that such moves miss an
   opportunity to define what is properly political about b/ordering space.
   Inverting the telescope on borders that matter reveals an ontologically
   grounded politics of bordering, one that illuminates an inherent
   multiplicity to borders that can best be captured in those contact zones
   that resist our conventional understanding of where European borders
   lie. Focusing on localized bordering practices that contest demarcation
   and reappropriation within the logics of global, European and
   state-centered geopolitical designs, we canvas the ontological politics
   emerging from the furnace of three spatio-temporal European horizons:
   the Istrian peninsula connecting Slovenia and Croatia; the historical,
   path-dependent trajectory of a seasonal labor force crossing Polish and
   Danish borders; and a `European' border located deep in Amazonia. We
   name the space produced by the tensions in each of these theaters Cafe
   Europa, designating both a material location of border praxis as well as
   a collective intellectual project in which the authors are themselves
   self-reflexively implicated.},

Abstract = {Starting from the state-of-the-art and recent evolutions in the field of
   system dynamics modeling and simulation, this chapter sketches a
   plausible near term future of the broader field of systems modeling and
   simulation. In the near term future, different systems modeling schools
   are expected to further integrate and accelerate the adoption of methods
   and techniques from related fields like policy analysis, data science,
   machine learning, and computer science. The resulting future state of
   the art of the modeling field is illustrated by three recent pilot
   projects. Each of these projects required further integration of
   different modeling and simulation approaches and related disciplines as
   discussed in this chapter. These examples also illustrate which gaps
   need to be filled in order to meet the expectations of real decision
   makers facing complex uncertain issues.},

Abstract = {Crowdsourcing ideas have been developed and initially applied in the
   private sector, first in the creative and design industries, and
   subsequently in many other industries, aiming to exploit the `collective
   wisdom'in order to perform difficult problem solving and design
   activities. It was much later that government agencies started
   experimenting with crowdsourcing, aiming to collect from citizens
   information, knowledge, opinions and ideas concerning difficult social
   problems, and important public policies they were designing for
   addressing them. Therefore, it is necessary to develop approaches, and
   knowledge in general concerning the efficient and effective application
   of crowdsourcing ideas in government, taking into account its special
   needs and specificities. This chapter contributes to filling this
   research gap, by presenting two novel approaches in this direction,
   which have been developed through extensive previous relevant research
   of the authors: a first one for `active crowdsourcing', and a second one
   for `passive crowdsourcing' by government agencies. Both of them are
   based on innovative ways of using the recently emerged and highly
   popular Web 2.0 social media in a highly automated manner through their
   application programming interfaces (API). For each of these approaches,
   the basic idea is initially described, followed by the architecture of
   the required information and communications technology (ICT)
   infrastructure, and finally a process model for its practical
   application.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-18},
Abstract = {In 2003, the European Union (EU) launched its Strategy against the
   Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction in which it sought the
   strengthening of an effective multilateral non- proliferation regime,
   with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as its cornerstone.
   Focusing upon the implementation of that strategy 10 years on, this
   paper considers the EU's navigation of the NPT negotiation environment
   and the structural conditions at play between the Nuclear and
   Non-Nuclear Weapon States and the Grand Bargain enshrined between them.
   It shows that the EU's ``multilateralist combat{''} within the NPT has
   met with limited success due to the EU's lack of bargaining power - the
   EU has neither the will nor the capacity to make the bargaining
   concessions necessary to achieve its goals in this forum. Further
   challenging claims that the EU may offer a ``benchmark{''} for the NPT
   community; this paper suggests that the EU is more a mirror of the
   imbalance of the Grand Bargain than a solution in how to resolve it.},

Abstract = {In this article I analyze how far right movements and parties in Europe
   are challenging European notions of open borders and the freedom of
   movement through active involvement in national and European politics.
   This involves a discussion around the de/rebordering of European space
   and the relationship between bordering processes and a politics of
   belonging in which the drawing of boundaries becomes a way of
   establishing inclusion/exclusion in response to a politics of fear,
   insecurity, and threat. Thereafter I address what distinguishes such a
   politics and how various far right movements and parties have emerged as
   structural and social-psychological responses to it as well as the
   reasons behind their affective (and electoral) success in Europe. In
   examining this, I stress the idea of `subjective deprivation' in
   relation to the bordering of essentialist identities, highlighting the
   role of `emotional governance' and `nativism' as crucial for
   understanding the appeal of these movements. Finally I discuss how these
   bordering processes have come to rely on gendered notions of masculinity
   and on the occurrence of control and surveillance as members of the far
   right redefine national and European borders.},

Abstract = {Noting that European Union (EU) institutions are increasingly engaged in
   civil protection in the member states, security governance is used as an
   analytical framework to assess the depth of EU engagement in delivering
   civil security. It is shown that a state-centric approach is no longer
   adequate to understand the provision of civil security across Europe. To
   varying degrees, the EU has acquired responsibilities to facilitate,
   coordinate, manage, and regulate civil security, whether before or after
   a civil crisis occurs. The analysis demonstrates that, whilst
   intergovernmental practices and inter-state cooperation remain salient
   features of civil security, the responsibilities undertaken by the EU
   institutions across the entire policy spectrum are more substantial than
   a strictly intergovernmental perspective would suggest.},

Abstract = {Politicians and citizens increasingly engage in political conversations
   on social media outlets such as Twitter. In this article, I show that
   the structure of the social networks in which they are embedded can be a
   source of information about their ideological positions. Under the
   assumption that social networks are homophilic, I develop a Bayesian
   Spatial Following model that considers ideology as a latent variable,
   whose value can be inferred by examining which politics actors each user
   is following. This method allows us to estimate ideology for more actors
   than any existing alternative, at any point in time and across many
   polities. I apply this method to estimate ideal points for a large
   sample of both elite and mass public Twitter users in the United States
   and five European countries. The estimated positions of legislators and
   political parties replicate conventional measures of ideology. The
   method is also able to successfully classify individuals who state their
   political preferences publicly and a sample of users matched with their
   party registration records. To illustrate the potential contribution of
   these estimates, I examine the extent to which online behavior during
   the 2012 US presidential election campaign is clustered along
   ideological lines.},

Abstract = {We apply a specialized Bayesian method that helps us deal with the
   methodological challenge of unobserved heterogeneity among immigrant
   voters. Our approach is based on generalized linear mixed Dirichlet
   models (GLMDMs) where random effects are specified semiparametrically
   using a Dirichlet process mixture prior that has been shown to account
   for unobserved grouping in the data. Such models are drawn from Bayesian
   nonparametrics to help overcome objections handling latent effects with
   strongly informed prior distributions. Using 2009 German voting data of
   immigrants, we show that for difficult problems of missing key
   covariates and unexplained heterogeneity this approach provides (1)
   overall improved model fit, (2) smaller standard errors on average, and
   (3) less bias from omitted variables. As a result, the GLMDM changed our
   substantive understanding of the factors affecting immigrants' turnout
   and vote choice. Once we account for unobserved heterogeneity among
   immigrant voters, whether a voter belongs to the first immigrant
   generation or not is much less important than the extant literature
   suggests. When looking at vote choice, we also found that an immigrant's
   degree of structural integration does not affect the vote in favor of
   the CDU/CSU, a party that is traditionally associated with restrictive
   immigration policy.},

Abstract = {Electoral forensics involves examining election results for anomalies to
   efficiently identify patterns indicative of electoral irregularities.
   However, there is disagreement about which, if any, forensics tool is
   most effective at identifying fraud, and there is no method for
   integrating multiple tools. Moreover, forensic efforts have failed to
   systematically take advantage of country-specific details that might aid
   in diagnosing fraud. We deploy a Bayesian additive regression trees
   (BART) model-a machine-learning technique-on a large cross-national data
   set to explore the dense network of potential relationships between
   various forensic indicators of anomalies and electoral fraud risk
   factors, on the one hand, and the likelihood of fraud, on the other.
   This approach allows us to arbitrate between the relative importance of
   different forensic and contextual features for identifying electoral
   fraud and results in a diagnostic tool that can be relatively easily
   implemented in cross-national research.},

Title = {Evaluating Measurement Invariance in Categorical Data Latent Variable
   Models with the EPC-Interest},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Many variables crucial to the social sciences are not directly observed
   but instead are latent and measured indirectly. When an external
   variable of interest affects this measurement, estimates of its
   relationship with the latent variable will then be biased. Such
   violations of ``measurement invariance{''} may, for example, confound
   true differences across countries in postmaterialism with measurement
   differences. To deal with this problem, researchers commonly aim at
   ``partial measurement invariance{''}; that is, to account for those
   differences that may be present and important. To evaluate this
   importance directly through sensitivity analysis, the ``EPC-interest{''}
   was recently introduced for continuous data. However, latent variable
   models in the social sciences often use categorical data. The current
   paper therefore extends the EPC-interest to latent variable models for
   categorical data and demonstrates its use in example analyses of U.S.
   Senate votes as well as respondent rankings of postmaterialism values in
   the World Values Study.},

Abstract = {This text reports the results of an evaluation of the performance of
   multilevel regression modeling and poststratication (MRP) in
   reconstructing state-level estimates from federal-level data. The
   evaluation makes use of Eurobarometer data and relies on the fact that
   Eurobarometer provides representative survey data for each European
   Union state to further explore the performance of MRP. I repeatedly draw
   subsets of the entire Eurobarometer sample, then I compute adjusted
   country means using MRP with census data, and I compare the resulting
   estimates to the true country means from the full sample. I do that for
   ten survey items from various Eurobarometer waves. The results show that
   MRP is generally successful in producing estimates that are highly
   correlated with the true values (mean of 0.90). But the approach is less
   capable of reconstructing the relative rankings of the country means and
   hitting the range of plausible values of the individual state means. I
   also show that the great part of the adjustment comes from the modeling
   of the state means and not from poststratification, and that
   population-weighted samples perform no worse than samples in which
   countries have equal shares of the pool of respondents.},

Abstract = {The emergence and empowerment of Sahrawi civil protests and
   pro-independence activism inside the Western Sahara territory under
   Moroccan occupation have to be seen in the context of varying sets of
   opportunity structures which this peripheral movement has actively
   seized in the past two decades by symbiotically combining domestic
   non-violent resistance and international diplomatic' activities.
   Different forms of recognition received from the two reference centres -
   the Moroccan state and the Polisario Front - plus the international
   community have been crucial in this process, with the last representing
   the most significant achievement of the movement. The Arab Spring has
   been a particularly fruitful window of opportunity in this regard.},

Title = {Underreporting in Political Science Survey Experiments: Comparing

Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {306-312},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {The accuracy of published findings is compromised when researchers fail
   to report and adjust for multiple testing. Preregistration of studies
   and the requirement of preanalysis plans for publication are two
   proposed solutions to combat this problem. Some have raised concerns
   that such changes in research practice may hinder inductive learning.
   However, without knowing the extent of underreporting, it is difficult
   to assess the costs and benefits of institutional reforms. This paper
   examines published survey experiments conducted as part of the
   Time-sharing Experiments in the Social Sciences program, where the
   questionnaires are made publicly available, allowing us to compare
   planned design features against what is reported in published research.
   We find that: (1) 30\% of papers report fewer experimental conditions in
   the published paper than in the questionnaire; (2) roughly 60\% of
   papers report fewer outcome variables than what are listed in the
   questionnaire; and (3) about 80\% of papers fail to report all
   experimental conditions and outcomes. These findings suggest that
   published statistical tests understate the probability of type I errors.},

Abstract = {Electoral competitiveness is a key explanatory construct across a broad
   swath of phenomena, finding application in diverse areas related to
   political incentives and behavior. Despite its frequent theoretical use,
   no valid measure of electoral competitiveness exists that applies across
   different electoral and party systems. We argue that one particular type
   of electoral competitiveness-electoral risk-can be estimated across
   institutional contexts and matters most for incumbent behavior. We
   propose, estimate, and make available a crossnationally applicable
   measure for elections in 22 developed democracies between 1960 and 2011.
   Unlike extant alternatives, our measure captures vote volatility and is
   constructed at the party (not system) level, exogenous to most policy
   predictors, and congruent with the perceptions and incentives of
   policy-makers.},

Abstract = {Over the last decades, indigenous movements have propelled the political
   empowerment of historically marginalized groups in Latin America. The
   Maya struggle for ethnic equality in Guatemala, however, since its
   reawakening during the peace process, has reached an impasse. Based on
   field research consisting of dozens of elite interviews, this article
   analyzes the patterns of and obstacles to present-day Maya mobilization.
   It combines movement-internal and -external factors in an overarching
   theoretical argument about indigenous movements' capacity to construct
   strong collective voices. In the Guatemalan case, organizational
   sectorization, the lack of elite consensus on key substantive issues,
   and unclear alliance strategies compromise the effectiveness of
   horizontal voice among Maya organizations. These problems are
   exacerbated by the lasting effects of the country's unique history of
   violence and state strategies of divide and rule, preventing the
   emergence of a strong vertical voice capable of challenging the
   Guatemalan state.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},

Volume = {24},

Pages = {335-352},
Abstract = {This article analyses two different approaches to defense sector reform
   (DSR) in the Western Balkans. It explores the role of NATO in the reform
   process in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), as well as Norway's involvement
   in Montenegro. Based on this, the article then compares and contrasts
   the two processes, and looks at the factors that have influenced their
   success or failure. The analysis show that both BiH and Montenegro have
   taken significant steps towards Euro-Atlantic integration, and that NATO
   and Norway have succeeded in part of their work to assist this effort.
   However, it also suggests that certain key factors for success in SSR
   have been less than optimal, such as donor coordination and the
   principle of local ownership. Both actors are also limited by the lack
   of a conceptual framework or guidelines for their work on DSR.},

Abstract = {This chapter presents the contours of two giant natural gas projects
   designed to supply the EU: the EU-sponsored ``Nabucco{''} and Gazprom's
   ``South Stream.{''} The manner in which both projects have been
   cancelled is revealing of the way business is currently being conducted
   in the EU. One variant of ``Nabucco{''} would have linked up to a
   trans-Caspian pipeline from Turkmenistan but has been resisted by Russia
   and Iran. Only Azerbaijan's Shah Deniz 2 project is still on track,
   expected to deliver 10 bcm/year to the southern Italian grid by the year
   2020.},

Abstract = {This chapter reviews relations between the EU-NATO tandem and Russia
   during the period leading up to the latest Ukrainian crisis. President
   Yanukovich was overthrown following his decision to join the Eurasian
   Customs Union and power in Kiev has passed to Western Ukrainian
   nationalists. After Russia annexed Crimea, a rebellion was set off in
   the Donbas against the new power in Kiev. The decision to restore Kiev's
   authority in the East by force of arms has led to civil war. Successive
   stages of the conflict are explored to identify the forces shaping the
   fortunes of Ukraine, at the heart of Europe's energy transmission
   networks.},

Abstract = {The financing of Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) operations
   questions the capacity of the European Union (EU) to contribute to
   crisis management. Instead of a single mechanism that would be used for
   all kinds of missions, different mechanisms are applied, depending on
   the objective and nature of the operation. The aim of this article is to
   explain change and inertia in the way these operations are funded. The
   first section is dedicated to the presentation of the legal framework
   and its characterization as a fragmented and flexible structure. It
   allows for identifying the changes that have affected the financing of
   EU operational activities abroad. The main problems and challenges in
   financing CSDP operations are dealt with in the second section. The
   third section explains: (1) why changes have occurred in some areas and
   (2) why inertia has prevailed in other areas in spite of the problems
   previously identified. Three main explanations are tested. Rules and
   practices in financing CSDP operations (1) result from operational
   needs, (2) are influenced by proactive supranational institutions and
   (3) are triggered by the Member States. These three explanations are not
   mutually exclusive. They all contribute to the understanding of CSDP
   operations, but the relative importance of each factor depends on the
   operations at hand. Generally, the second factor is at play in the case
   of civilian operations, while the third one prevails with regard to
   military operations. The first factor brings a complementary explanation
   to both kinds of operations.},

Abstract = {Although there are numerous contributions on ethnic electoral politics,
   relatively little research has been devoted to explain the scope of
   success of ethnic minority parties. This article addresses the issue
   within the bounds of post-communist Europe, paying particular attention
   to the effect of cultural legacies. It was confirmed, first of all, that
   ethnic parties are likely to emerge only if their titular minority has a
   number of voters larger than what is necessary to obtain parliamentary
   representation. Otherwise, the most successful were the ethnic parties
   representing the minorities characterised by legacy of regional
   domination, that is, those whose members had once enjoyed a dominant
   position as a ruling nation on a given territory (e.g. Hungarians in
   Slovakia). The second-successful were the parties representing homeland
   minorities, that is, those which have resided on a given area for more
   than two centuries, but have never been members of a ruling nation. The
   parties representing diaspora or immigrant minorities were the least
   successful. Further research could assess the importance of these
   factors in other regions of the world.},

Abstract = {The growing literature on the use of social media for social protests
   generally, and during the Arab Spring in particular, has generally
   failed to show a periphery-inclusive perspective. This article employs
   statistical data on the use of alternative media outlets (Facebook,
   Twitter, blogs and YouTube) in Egypt's spring to show how an alternative
   media structure was expanding which not only empowered social and
   geographic peripheral actors but was, in turn, also empowered by their
   contributions. YouTube videos and Twitter messages from peripheral areas
   exposed police brutality towards protestors in the backstreets that
   could otherwise have been unnoticed and saved lives in isolated areas in
   Egypt. Social media thus gained critical mass and expanded to the point
   that it had an overflow effect from the virtual sphere to the real
   world. Contrasting the roles of alternative and state-run media machines
   in different phases of the revolution, the article traces how
   peripheries could challenge the existing opportunity structure through
   alternative media, but also how their role has contracted again after
   the revolution reached its peak.},

Title = {Transition and Marginalization: Locating Spaces for Discursive
   Contestation in Post-Revolution Tunisia},
Journal = {MEDITERRANEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2, SI},

Abstract = {Transitions to democracy nourish expectations for an expansion of space
   for political liberalization, redistribution and recognition. From 2011
   to 2013, the landscape for civil society in Tunisia widened with the
   establishment of several thousand associations. However, during this
   period vulnerable groups, including sexual minorities, perceived and
   experienced increased degrees of marginalization. This article analyses
   the potentialities and boundaries for members of homosexual communities
   in Tunisia as they manoeuvre through a post-revolution transition
   characterized by rapid expansions and contractions of the public sphere.
   It highlights the competing priorities within the public sphere, in
   particular those voices left on the periphery as a multiplicity of
   issues are presented for discursive contestation and argues that some
   groups effectively stand to become more marginalized during the
   transition to democracy than previously under authoritarian rule.},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {Since coming to power in 2000, Russian president Vladimir Putin has
   tried to construct a narrative of regaining Russia's status as a major
   global power. However, in practice the Kremlin has yet to create a
   coherent strategy or achieve a sense of a co-ordinated foreign policy.
   While North Africa has not been at the forefront of this narrative,
   recently Moscow has intensified its diplomatic links and cooperation
   with the regimes in the region. The Arab Spring presented Russian policy
   makers with a series of challenges regarding the uncertainty of the
   developments in the region, but also with renewed economic
   opportunities. This profile analyses Moscow's relationships with the
   countries in North Africa (Libya, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria)
   in the wake of the Arab Spring. In each case the Kremlin aimed to take
   advantage of the new opportunities without really being guided by an
   overarching strategy for the region. However, Russia increasingly seems
   to be keen to position itself in the region as an alternative to the EU
   or the US, not least in light of the current war in Ukraine.},

Abstract = {The value of cross-national surveys in examining how political and
   social contexts shape attitudes and behavior has been demonstrated over
   the past 20 years. Their vulnerabilities, such as measurement
   equivalence, have also received considerable attention. Less attention
   has been paid to how variations in the timing of the fieldwork may
   affect data quality. We investigate how the timing of the survey in the
   electoral cycle may affect survey cooperation and satisficing. For some
   indicators, we find support for a context effect in that reluctance to
   cooperate and satisficing decrease as an election approaches, and this
   effect is more pronounced among the politically interested. Our results
   have implications for both cross-national survey research and campaign
   effects studies in that conducting fieldwork close to an election can
   alter data quality and campaigns can influence behavior but also
   cooperation with surveys.},

Title = {Normative power and organized hypocrisy: European Union member states'
   arms export to Libya},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Pages = {264-286},
Abstract = {The 2011 Libyan civil war prompted a reassessment of the normative
   foundation of the EU's conventional arms export control regime as
   armaments manufactured in Europe were used by Gaddafi's forces during
   the war. The EU's foreign policy identity is based, partly, upon a
   common approach to arms export involving respect for common criteria for
   export licences. Yet, prior to the civil war, considerable amounts of
   military equipment had been exported by member states to Libya,
   notwithstanding grounds for restraint on the basis of several of the
   criteria. This article traces member states' arms export to Libya during
   2005-2010 to explore whether member states favoured restraint or export
   promotion. It concludes that although aware of the risks of exporting,
   in a competitive market for military goods, member states sought
   commercial advantage over restraint, and comprehensively violated export
   control principles. This casts doubts on assertions of the EU acting as
   a ``normative power{''}.},

Abstract = {Drawing together 10 years of surveillance data on and material gathered
   through ethnographic engagements with a small group of 20 young people
   and families, the article interrogates tensions and complementarities in
   the ways in which divergent research modalities come to represent
   kinship, family life, and changing forms of child vulnerability over
   time. The article begins by drawing out some of the tensions between
   demographic and ethnographic modes of inquiry, exploring the divergent
   objects and values of each. The focus then shifts from these broader
   epistemological debates to explore the life of a selected ``case{''} as
   it unfolds within both a demographic database and through ethnographic
   research in one locality in South Africa. To resolve the tensions
   between these perspectives, the article concludes that we must move
   beyond a focus on empirical divergences between forms of research
   representation. Rather, we must develop more rigorous methodologies for
   critical, comparative, ``multi-sited{''} analyses of forms of experience
   and local-life worlds. Understanding the divergent insights that can be
   gained through different modes of inquiry, and the ways in which they
   shape and are shaped by everyday experiences in locality, is essential
   to coming to terms with contemporary forms of governance and everyday
   life.},

Abstract = {Nationalism and revolution have generally been held to go together. Many
   nation-states have had their origins in revolution, from the Americans
   in the 18th century to a host of Third World nation-states in the 20th
   century. Generally, both modern revolutions and modern nationalism have
   the same origins, in 18th century Enlightenment thought. But this paper
   argues that, despite this common origin, the principles of revolution
   and nationalism are divergent, and can set one against the other.
   Revolutions emphasise freedom and equality; nationalism emphasises
   integration and unification. These principles can clash, though not
   inevitably and not always. The paper examines the 1789 French
   Revolution, the 1848 revolutions and the 1917 Russian revolution. It
   shows that in the first two cases, revolutionary aspirations came up
   against and were eventually displaced by nationalist aims. In the case
   of 1917, revolution paradoxically, and unintentionally,
   institutionalised nationalism. These examples show that, though linked
   at some high level of modern thought, revolution and nationalism express
   different and at times divergent strands of modernity.},

Abstract = {Online survey methods and online access panels are commonly used in both
   academic and private industry research. However, many industry reviews
   indicate the presence of fraudulent and inattentive online panel
   participants who pose a threat to data validity, with estimates of 8-25
   percent of the sample being impacted. Although these challenges are not
   unique to online surveying, the nature of online panels may offer
   possibilities to improve data quality through real-time filters, rather
   than in data analysis. In this study, we retain all panel respondents
   passing and failing common web-survey quarantining methods to directly
   analyze filtering results on data quality. Through a choice experiment,
   we build a mathematical model to measure respondent irrationality
   through the classic strong axiom of revealed preference (SARP), which
   serves as the primary data-quality metric to test the efficacy of
   quarantining methods. We show that inattentive respondents failing
   ``trap{''} or ``red herring{''} questions, as well as fraudulent
   respondents heavily selecting low-probability screening questions, have
   significantly lower data quality compared to passing respondents.
   Removing failing respondents significantly improves data quality when
   filters are strategically executed. We also simulate the data-quality
   benefits of real-time filtering techniques during web-data collection.
   We conclude by advocating the use of low-probability filters as
   qualifiers, as well as strategic placement of trap questions just before
   the most crucial sections of a survey.},

Abstract = {While political campaigns commonly employ clientelistic mobilization
   tactics during elections in developing countries, studying vote buying
   with mass surveys has proven difficult since respondents often will not
   admit to receiving a gift or favor in exchange for their votes. This
   study explores the degree to which respondents vary in their reporting
   of the receipt of goods or favors. Analysis of list experiments included
   in 10 surveys conducted in eight Latin American countries demonstrates
   the widespread prevalence of underreporting and shows that it is best
   predicted by three different sources of question sensitivity. First,
   bias is greater among respondents with higher levels of education,
   likely due to greater understanding and awareness of democratic norms
   about vote buying. Second, since vote buying is often stigmatized as
   resulting from poverty, those who are particularly sensitive to
   questions about income also prove to be much more likely to edit their
   answers. Finally, bias is positively associated with the degree to which
   the goods distributed violate democratic norms, as bias is smallest in
   countries in which the gifts consist largely of innocuous campaign
   materials and items such as clothing and food. The results not only
   point to probable biases in analyses conducted using direct measures of
   gift dispensation, but also illuminate how social attitudes about vote
   buying have spread in different countries in Latin America.},

Abstract = {The potential democratizing effect of political decentralization reforms
   has been a matter of substantial theoretical and empirical debate. This
   article analyzes the effect of local democratic institution building on
   the political attitudes and behavior of citizens living in small towns
   in Uruguay. More specifically, using a natural experiment design, this
   research seeks to establish the causal impact of recently established
   elections of local authorities on individuals' political engagement. It
   develops a comparative case study analyzing the consequences of this
   institutional innovation in two towns. It shows that individuals from
   the town where citizens have the opportunity to elect their local
   authorities have more positive attitudes toward politics than those from
   the town without such elections.},

Abstract = {Spatial theories of lawmaking predict that legislative productivity is
   increasing in the number of status quo policies that lie outside the
   gridlock interval, but because locations of status quo policies are
   difficult to measure, previous empirical tests of gridlock theories rely
   on an auxiliary assumption that the distribution of status quo points is
   fixed and uniform. This assumption is at odds with the theories being
   tested, as it ignores the history dependence of lawmaking. We provide an
   alternative method for testing competing theories by estimating
   structural models that explicitly account for temporal dependence in a
   theoretically consistent way. Our analysis suggests that legislative
   productivity depends both on parties and supermajority pivots, and we
   find patterns of productivity consistent with a weaker, contingent form
   of party influence than found in previous work. Parties appear to exert
   agenda power only on highly salient legislation rather than strongly
   influencing outcomes through voting pressure and party unity.},

Abstract = {Using a case study of Beijing's participation in the Shangri-La
   Dialogue, a prominent annual security gathering in Singapore, this
   article analyses China's approach to Asian security multilateralism. It
   does so by developing and employing a typology consisting of four
   characterizations of multilateral engagement: China as ``blocker{''};
   China as ``socialized participant{''}; China as ``shaper{''}; and China
   as ``opportunistic participant{''}. The article shows that in its
   approach to the Shangri-La Dialogue, China displays all four of these
   traits, while noting that some are more prevalent and compelling at
   certain points in time. It uses this finding to draw conclusions about
   Beijing's future engagement with the Shangri-La Dialogue and its broader
   approach to security multilateralism. It also contributes to the larger
   debate over whether China is a ``revisionist{''} or a ``status quo{''}
   rising power.},

Title = {World Culture in European Memory Politics? New European Memory Agents
   Between Epistemic Framing and Political Agenda Setting},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {391-404},
Abstract = {In this contribution, we focus on the efforts dedicated to creating a
   `European' memory culture, particularly since EU enlargement in 2004.
   Based upon analytical premises of neoinstitutionalist world society
   studies, we interpret memory politics as a project that is not only
   driven forward by political movements and policy-makers, but also by
   quasi-neutral epistemic agents of memory deliberately pursuing
   knowledge-based strategies of agenda setting. This has been an important
   dimension of memory politics in former debates, especially in debates
   over Holocaust memory. It is central as well in current discourses over
   memory in an enlarged European Union. Accordingly, we shed light on the
   activities of two new Central and Eastern European network
   organizations-the Platform of European Memory and Conscience and the
   European Network Remembrance and Solidarity-and their efforts of gaining
   legitimacy in European memory debates. By analysing their activities and
   rhetoric, we show that they use expert-oriented practices of epistemic
   framing in order to break up the Western European consensus over
   Holocaust memory towards broader `anti-totalitarian' conceptions of
   European history. However, a comparison of both actors reveals important
   differences in their strategies oscillating between mere political
   agenda setting and scientific reflection.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {454-472},
Abstract = {This article analyses the origins and development of the European Border
   Surveillance System (EUROSUR) in order to better understand its
   functioning in view of its stated objectives. Particular attention will
   be devoted to the European Commission's recurring claim that one of
   EUROSUR's main goals is to save lives at sea. This contribution
   questions that assertion. It rather considers EUROSUR as representative
   of the steady, technocratic development of a European system for border
   management. The reliance on the exchange of information, the
   reinforcement of FRONTEX, the European Union's agency for the
   coordination of operational cooperation between national border guards
   and the emphasis on cooperation with third countries support this claim.},

Title = {The Hybrid Continent: Tensions and Resilience in Europe's Neoterritorial
   Model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {82-99},
Abstract = {Despite its elusiveness and undefined boundaries, policy-makers and
   pundits have strived to pin down what `Europe' as a territorial project
   actually represents and where it might (and should) be going. Two of the
   most intriguing arguments refer to Europe as either a `super-state in
   the making' or a neo-medieval empire.' These models are typically
   presented as either mutually exclusive or in tension with one another.
   In this paper, I argue that the European territorial project's current
   trajectory is actually characterized by a mix of the two models. Such
   hybrid form of governance can be defined as `neoterritorial' since it is
   based on the modern principle according to which freedom can only
   flourish in a clearly demarcated political space. Yet, this enclosed
   political space does not necessarily require the modern nation state's
   entire legal and institutional paraphernalia, but can instead be based
   on a `pooling' of sovereignty and a flexible institutional framework and
   be spread out over a larger and more heterogeneous area than the
   traditional nation state. This hybrid model is epitomized by the
   Schengen regime, the institutional arrangement governing the management
   of Europe's borders. Despite its ongoing internal tensions and the
   challenges it has faced over the years, this model has become-and it is
   likely to remain in the foreseeable future-an established presence in
   Europe's political landscape.},

Abstract = {After a decade of civil war and four consecutive conservative
   administrations, El Salvador's leftist FMLN won its first presidential
   election in 2009. How has public policy changed under this New Left
   government, and why? This article addresses the question in the area of
   public health care. An alliance of health sector leaders with both
   technocratic and diplomatic abilities capitalized on the policy window
   opened by the FMLN's electoral victory and worked within the parameters
   set by President Mauricio Funes, the FMLN, and civil society to
   universalize health care. The new minister of health, a professional
   highly esteemed inside and outside the country, was able to engage both
   a large social movement protesting neoliberal policy and an energetic
   health diplomat sent by the Pan American Health Organization. In
   designing its reform, this alliance benefited from international as well
   as bottom-up policy diffusion.},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen an increase in the amount of statistics
   describing different phenomena based on ``Big Data.{''} This term
   includes data characterized not only by their large volume, but also by
   their variety and velocity, the organic way in which they are created,
   and the new types of processes needed to analyze them and make inference
   from them. The change in the nature of the new types of data, their
   availability, and the way in which they are collected and disseminated
   is fundamental. This change constitutes a paradigm shift for survey
   research. There is great potential in Big Data, but there are some
   fundamental challenges that have to be resolved before its full
   potential can be realized. This report provides examples of different
   types of Big Data and their potential for survey research; it also
   describes the Big Data process, discusses its main challenges, and
   considers solutions and research needs.},

Abstract = {Malaysia and China upgraded their relationship to a Comprehensive
   Strategic Partnership in 2013 and signed a Joint Communique in 2014.
   Although the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership includes a pledge to
   strengthen cooperation between the armed forces of the two countries, so
   far, however, Sino-Malaysian defence ties have advanced only
   incrementally. This article focuses on the development of defence
   relations between the two countries from 1991 until the first half of
   2015. It examines several areas of defence diplomacy, including visits
   by senior officials, the exchange of military students, arms sales,
   defence and security consultations and combined military exercises. It
   concludes that although Malaysia-China defence ties have not developed
   as quickly as other aspects of the bilateral relationship, this does not
   mean that the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership lacks depth, or that
   Kuala Lumpur fundamentally distrusts Beijing because of recent
   developments in the South China Sea.},

Abstract = {This article shows how and why the initial attempts of the Lula
   administration in Brazil to promote innovative counterhegemonic
   participatory strategies, such as those put in place by the PT in some
   of its subnational governments, fell by the wayside. It is argued that
   the implementation and scope of participatory initiatives under Lula
   were caught between electoral motivations and the need to secure
   governability. On the one hand, the need to produce quick results in
   order to maximize vote-seeking strategies hindered attempts to promote
   counterhegemonic participation, while Lula and his inner circle opted
   for policies that would score immediate marks with the poorest sectors
   or influence public opinion. On the other hand, participation also took
   a back seat because the PT concentrated most of its energies on reaching
   agreements with strategic actors, such as opposition parties or powerful
   economic groups.},

Title = {HOW INSTITUTIONS AFFECT GENDER GAPS IN PUBLIC OPINION EXPRESSION},
Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {The expression of opinions in ordinary political discussions between
   citizens is essential to public opinion dynamics such as opinion
   leadership, false consensus, or pluralistic ignorance. One of the main
   predictors of expressiveness in citizens' discussions is gender.
   Although research documents consistent gaps between men's and women's
   expressiveness through political discussion, most insights are based on
   the United States. Absent a comparative perspective, little
   consideration has been given to major differences across countries in
   men's and women's access to various institutions, and whether this
   access correlates with gender gaps in discursive expression. Access
   affects opportunities of women and men to encounter politically relevant
   information and connect with potential discussants. The present article
   tests whether greater egalitarianism in political representation,
   education, and workforce participation reduces gender gaps in political
   discussion. Multilevel analyses of the International Social Survey
   Program data set (approximately N = 36,600; 33 countries) show that
   several country-level features affect the contribution of gender to
   political discussion, but in ways that suggest a trade-off between
   gender equality and opinion expressiveness.},

Abstract = {Indonesia's new president, Joko Widodo, is new to foreign affairs and
   seemingly has little interest in diplomacy, a marked contrast with his
   predecessor Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who sought a role as an
   international statesman. Instead, Jokowi - as he prefers to be known has
   declared that he will focus on domestic affairs as part of a broad
   reform programme, with a particular emphasis on strengthening
   Indonesia's maritime infrastructure and reasserting the authority of the
   state. However, an activist presidency in these areas, even if intended
   only as a domestic effort, will create unintended foreign policy
   challenges for Indonesia because the country's economic and maritime
   interests are so closely intertwined with those of its neighbours. This
   article examines Jokowi's statements on foreign affairs, offers a survey
   of his foreign affairs advisers and places the president in the
   country's historical and political context. It then examines potential
   flashpoints in Indonesia's relationships with its neighbours over
   Jokowi's agenda. It argues that under Jokowi, foreign policy is likely
   to become less clear, less conciliatory and less cooperative, with
   negative consequences for Indonesian leadership in the region.},

Abstract = {Ernest Gellner's work on nationalism is situated in a larger social
   metaphysic and philosophical anthropology. This paper investigates some
   of these overarching intellectual commitments and their implications for
   his arguments about nationalism. Two main issues are examined. Does the
   method of philosophic history' provide any philosophical or
   methodological support for his treatment of nationalism? What are the
   implications of the common culture of industrial civilization for his
   arguments about nationalism? Addressing these issues together
   contributes to the continuing evaluation of Gellner's work, particularly
   to recent discussion of his arguments about necessity and nationalism.},

Abstract = {Green economy has become one of the most fashionable terms in global
   environmental public policy discussions and forums. Despite this
   popularity, and its being selected as one of the organizing themes of
   the United Nations Rio+20 Conference in Brazil, June 2012, its prospects
   as an effective mobilization tool for global environmental
   sustainability scholarship and practice remain unclear. A major reason
   for this is that much like its precursor concepts such as environmental
   sustainability and sustainable development, green economy is a woolly
   concept, which lends itself to many interpretations. Hence, rather than
   resolve long-standing controversies, green economy merely reinvigorates
   existing debates over the visions, actors and policies best suited to
   secure a more sustainable future for all. In this review article, we aim
   to fill an important gap in scholarship by suggesting various ways in
   which green economy may be organized and synthesized as a concept, and
   especially in terms of its relationship with the idea of social and
   environmental justice. Accordingly, we offer a systemization of possible
   interpretations of green economy mapped onto a synthesis of existing
   typologies of environmental justice. This classification provides the
   context for future analysis of which, and how, various notions of green
   economy link with various conceptions of justice.},

Abstract = {In this chapter, two ideal types of practitioners who may use or create
   policy informatics projects, programs, or platforms are introduced: the
   policy informatics-savvy public manager and the policy informatics
   analyst. Drawing from our experiences in teaching an
   informatics-friendly graduate curriculum, we discuss the range of
   learning competencies needed for traditional public managers and policy
   informatics-oriented analysts to thrive in an era of informatics. The
   chapter begins by describing the two different types of students who
   are, or can be touched by, policy informatics-friendly competencies,
   skills, and attitudes. Competencies ranging from those who may be users
   of policy informatics and sponsors of policy informatics projects and
   programs to those analysts designing and executing policy informatics
   projects and programs will be addressed. The chapter concludes with an
   illustration of how one Master of Public Administration (MPA) program
   with a policy informatics-friendly mission, a core curriculum that
   touches on policy informatics applications, and a series of program
   electives that allows students to develop analysis and modeling skills,
   designates its informatics-oriented competencies.},

Abstract = {The Ukrainian crisis and Russia's annexation of Crimea marks a new low
   in RussiaNATO relations. When we examine the relationship between NATO
   and Russia through the postCold War era, we can ask: was the
   deterioration in relations determined by geopolitical, historical,
   cultural and identity factors, or could sustainable partnership might
   have been possible had alternative decisions been taken? We argue that
   different reasons account for each of the four instances of
   deterioration in the relationship. Throughout the period some constants
   can be identified: cooperative rhetoric rarely mirrored reality; a
   mismatch in expectations, commitments and perceptions torpedoed the
   prospect of a more stable cooperative partnership; and, a surprising
   persistence in low-key but significant cooperation can be noted. The
   article concludes with the observation that dissonance at the heart of
   NATO-Russia relations is best understood as the consequence of Russia's
   attempt to navigate its way through a strategic trilemma and divorce
   signals Russia's failure to square the circle.},

Abstract = {We propose a game theoretical model to assess the capacity of Catalonia
   to become a recognised, independent country with at least a de facto
   European Union (EU) membership. Support for Catalan independence has
   been increasing for reasons pertaining to identity and economics. Spain
   can avoid a vote for independence by effectively `buying-out' a
   proportion of the Catalan electorate with a funding agreement favourable
   to Catalonia. If, given the current economic circumstances, the
   buying-out strategy is too expensive, a pro-independence vote is likely
   to pass. Our model predicts an agreement in which Spain and the EU
   accommodate Catalan independence in exchange for Catalonia taking a
   share of the Spanish debt. If Spain and the EU do not accommodate, Spain
   becomes insolvent, which in turn destabilises the EU. The current
   economic woes of Spain and the EU both contribute to the desire for
   Catalan independence and make it possible.},

Abstract = {Ever since the 15th century, empires have invented Europe as a
   meaningful political space to legitimize territorial ambitions and
   establish hierarchies between Europeans and professedly lesser
   geocultural entities. Maps have played a crucial role in naturalizing
   the geopolitical arbitrariness-what we term cartopolitics-that has
   underlain such Europeanization. In this article, we draw on historical
   maps to expose the cartopolitical cleansing done by the EU-today's grand
   Europeanizing power-and free Europe from its hegemonic cartopolitical
   inscription. Heavy on symbolism yet light on mathematical accuracy, old
   maps of Europe readily earn our mistrust. Meanwhile, EU cartography,
   foreseeing that strident symbolism could antagonize its members'
   national iconography and hamper enlargement, offers a plain technicality
   divested of political allegory that demands indifference. However, the
   seemingly unobjectionable Europe portrayed by EU maps relies on
   decorative strategies analogous to those of ancient maps and should
   arouse similar suspicion. Ironically, for all their subtlety to
   cultivate an affiliation with Brussels, EU maps inadvertently prop up
   Eurosceptical discourses chewing at the EU's external appeal and
   internal cohesion. Our conviction is that dislocating Europe's borders
   to show Europes that were and could be may inspire refreshing
   imaginations about the meaning and boundaries of Europe and the EU.},

   Obama's own words in his speech in Cairo in 2009. Whether the US can
   substantially implement the 3D's of diplomacy, defense and development,

Abstract = {As in other post-conflict states, the international community has been
   actively promoting the implementation of the rule of law in Timor-Leste.
   The justice system remains the weakest branch of Timor-Leste's
   governance architecture. The effectiveness of the justice system is
   hampered by the fact that laws and proceedings are not always translated
   into languages understood by all court actors. Timor-Leste has a long
   history of multilingualism, with at least sixteen language varieties
   being spoken in the country. Both Tetum and Portuguese are official
   languages, with Portuguese being predominantly used in the courts, even
   though less than 10 per cent of the population is fluent in the idiom.
   The post-colonial legacy was one of two separate legal systems the
   formal legal system and the traditional system operating in parallel.
   More than a decade after independence, the former continues to have only
   a peripheral presence in the lives of most East Timorese. This gap
   between the language of the people and the language of the courts
   heightens the challenges to nation- and state-building in Timor-Leste.
   The purpose of this article is to examine the current language policy in
   nmor-Leste and discuss possible avenues for strengthening the formal
   justice system in a multilingual environment.},

   A Gender Analysis of Euro-Mediterranean Security Relations},

Abstract = {In the academic literature on EU-southern Mediterranean relations, a
   focal point of neglect has been the gendered dimension of
   Euro-Mediterranean relations. This article argues that the
   Euro-Mediterranean space has been formed within the gendered global
   West/non-West relations with the purpose of promoting the West's
   security interests. Euro-Mediterranean security relations, thus, embody
   a gendered power hierarchy between the hybrid hegemonic masculinity of
   the EU (bourgeois-rational and citizen-warrior) and the subordinate
   (both feminized and hypermasculinized) southern neighbourhood. In
   addition, it shows that following the Arab Spring the EU has been
   determined to maintain the status quo by reconstructing these gendered
   power relations. This gender analysis contributes to the literature on
   Euro-Mediterranean relations through its specific focus on the
   (re)construction processes of gendered identities within the
   West/non-West context in tandem with the EU's competing notions of
   security.},

   LARGE-SCALE, FACE-TO-FACE SURVEYS GENERALIZABLE TO GERMANY? EVIDENCE

Abstract = {In survey research, a consensus has grown regarding the effectiveness of
   incentives encouraging survey participation across different survey
   modes and target populations. Most of this research has been based on
   surveys from the United States, whereas few studies have provided
   evidence that these results can be generalized to other contexts. This
   paper is the first to present comprehensive information concerning the
   effects of incentives on response rates and nonresponse bias across
   large-scale surveys in Germany. The context could be viewed as a
   critical test for incentive effects because Germany's population is
   among the most survey-critical in the world, with very low response
   rates. Our results suggest positive incentive effects on response rates
   and patterns of effects that are similar to those in previous research:
   The effect increased with the monetary value of the incentive; cash
   incentives affected response propensity more strongly than lottery
   tickets do; and prepaid incentives could be more cost effective than
   conditional incentives. We found mixed results for the effects of
   incentives on nonresponse bias. Regarding large-scale panel surveys, we
   could not unequivocally confirm that incentives increased response rates
   in later panel waves.},

Abstract = {This article theorizes about the implications for domestic climate
   politics of three distinct roles countries play in the global carbon
   supply chain: fossil fuel producer, manufacturer of carbon-intensive
   goods, and final consumer. Because international responsibility is
   assigned to territorial emissions, countries at either end of the global
   supply chain effectively evade environmental responsibility by shifting
   fossil fuel combustion to manufacturing countries. In so doing, they
   lessen the political challenges of reducing domestic emissions. Although
   exporters of carbon-intensive goods are reluctant to disadvantage local
   producers, importers can craft policies that both reduce territorial
   emissions and create local jobs. Ironically, fossil fuel exporters can
   emerge as leaders in reducing their own territorial emissions, a finding
   illustrated by case studies of British Columbia and Norway. The
   conclusion argues that shifting responsibility for carbon emissions to
   the point of either final consumption or fossil fuel extraction could
   facilitate an international climate agreement.},

Abstract = {Recent political debates over solutions to the federal budget deficit
   and the ending of the past decade's wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have
   likely put defense and military spending on the chopping block. Does the
   American public support such a policy choice? Are Americans more or less
   supportive of defense and military spending than they were prior to
   September 11, 2001? This article reviews academic, independent, and
   media polls to address these questions. We find that contemporary levels
   of support for defense and military spending remain above ``normal
   levels{''} between 1960 and 2000. We also find that although Americans
   are still opposed to cutting defense and military spending, they are
   more likely to support such cuts as a solution to the federal budget
   deficit after 2007.},

Abstract = {This chapter addresses the psychological enablers of bureaucracy and
   ways to protect bureaucrats and society from its adverse effects. All
   organizations benefit from formalization, but a bureaucracy is defined
   by the dominance of coercive formalization. Since bureaucrats are not
   bureaucratic among friends, one might ask what changes someone at work
   into a bureaucrat and why do bureaucrats and bureaucratic organizations
   exhibit their characteristic behaviors?
   The pattern of behavior arises from fundamental psychology and in
   particular (1) our capacity for habitual behavior, (2) the difference
   between intelligence as manifestation of the coping mode of cognition
   and understanding as manifestation of the pervasive optimization mode,
   and (3) the phenomenon of authoritarianism as the need for external
   authority through a lack of understanding of one's living environment.
   The combination of these phenomena leads to a formal definition, the
   ``Bureaucratic Dynamic,{''} in which the prevalence of coercive
   formalization scales with ``institutional ignorance{''} (as measure of
   how well workers understand the consequence of their own (in) actions,
   both within the organization as well on the wider society) and ``worker
   cost of failure.{''}
   Modern organizational theory has become progressively more aware of the
   inefficiencies and dangers of bureaucracy. The framework developed in
   this paper can be applied to protect society, organizations, and workers
   from the adverse effects of bureaucracy. Yet while non-bureaucratic
   organizations can produce excellence, they also rely on it and are
   therefore somewhat fragile. Improved protective measures can be
   developed using the framework developed in this chapter.},

Abstract = {This article explores the role of the European Union (EU) in addressing
   financial exclusion. From a multidisciplinary point of view, we focus on
   the EU's approach, emphasising the peculiarities derived from the
   European integration process. In spite of the high level of financial
   inclusion in the EU in comparison with other regions, there is a
   substantial percentage of people and small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
   facing difficulty in accessing financial services; the population at
   risk of financial exclusion is growing due to increasing unemployment
   and cuts in social assistance services. This article, after
   contextualising the problem of financial exclusion in the global
   context, presents a revision of European initiatives associated with
   this problem, notably the reform of the financial system and the
   increasing integration of its internal market. We discuss the extent to
   which this legislation and related policy recommendations are effective,
   particularly considering the current framework of economic governance.},

Abstract = {Mobilizing climate finance for developing countries is crucial for
   achieving a fair and effective global climate regime. To date, developed
   countries retain wide discretion over their national contributions. We
   explore how different degrees of international coordination may
   influence the fairness of the global financing effort, and we present
   quantitative scenarios, for both the metrics used to distribute the
   collective effort among countries contributing funding, and the number
   of contributing countries. We find that an intermediate degree of
   coordination-combining nationally determined financing pledges with a
   robust international review mechanism-may reduce distortions in relative
   efforts as well as shortfalls in overall funding, while reflecting
   reasonable differences over what constitutes a fair share. A broader
   group of contributors may do little to improve adequacy or equity unless
   it can converge on credible measures of responsibility and capacity. Our
   analysis highlights the importance of building common understandings
   about effort sharing.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, drug consumption has increased in Colombia and
   Mexico, countries traditionally concerned with drug production and
   trafficking. Governments and observers have associated this growth with
   spikes in violence. Drawing on drug consumption surveys and fieldwork in
   four cities, this study argues that contrary to this perception, there
   is no automatic connection between domestic drug markets and violence.
   Violence depends on whether large drug-trafficking organizations (DTOs)
   control low-level street dealers and on whether those DTOs have a market
   monopoly at the local level. When dealers are independent, violence
   might be sporadic, but when DTOs control dealers, violence can explode
   (given competition between DTOs) or implode (if one organization holds a
   monopoly). Control over dealers provides DTOs not only income but also
   informants and armed muscle. This article also shows that domestic drug
   markets are not new, and have grown incrementally in the past two
   decades.},

Abstract = {This article examines developments in the renewable electricity sector
   in Brazil and China since 2000. The two countries share many interests
   with respect to solar and wind power, but institutional differences in
   state-business relations led to different outcomes. In China, in a
   context of corporatist state-business relations, state interventions
   were more far-reaching, with the state coordinating with state-owned
   banks, offering large financial and investment incentives to state-owned
   or state-connected enterprises. By contrast, in Brazil's public-private
   partnerships, state support to promote renewable energies was shaped by
   a stronger preference for competitive auctions and stricter financing
   rules. The differences in state-business relations help explain the
   observed developmental trajectories in wind and solar power.},

Abstract = {Ethnic armed conflict has plagued southeast Myanmar for over sixty-five
   years, and has been the cause of significant and repeated episodes of
   forced migration. The dynamics of forced migration have undergone
   profound changes in the region since 2012, following the signing of
   bilateral ceasefire agreements between the government and several Ethnic
   Armed Groups (EAGs). Within this context, this article describes and
   analyses the decision-making processes and approaches to return,
   resettlement and rehabilitation of forced migrants Internally Displaced
   People (IDPs) and refugees. In relation to academic and policy
   literatures on local agency and humanitarian protection, we argue that
   forced migrants in and from Myanmar demonstrate great resilience and
   significant capacities for self-protection and that external support
   should be geared towards supporting local coping strategies and attempts
   to achieve dignified and ``durable solutions{''} to their plight. This
   approach requires an in-depth exploration of local contexts, and forced
   migrants' decision-making processes. We present a typology of
   conflict-induced forced migrants in and from southeast Myanmar, followed
   by an analysis of five main factors that influence their decisions, and
   help to explain some of the key differences between different types.},

Abstract = {This article considers the role of generalization in comparative case
   studies, using as exemplars the contributions to this special issue on
   climate change politics. As a research practice, generalization is a
   logical argument for extending one's claims beyond the data, positing a
   connection between events that were studied and those that were not. No
   methodological tradition is exempt from the requirement to demonstrate a
   compelling logic of generalization. The article presents a taxonomy of
   the logics of generalization underlying diverse research methodologies,
   which often go unstated and unexamined. I introduce the concept of
   resonance groups, which provide a causeway for cross-system
   generalization from single case studies. Overall the results suggest
   that in the comparative study of complex political systems, case study
   research is, ceteris paribus, on par with large-N research with respect
   to generalizability.},

Abstract = {Empirical claims that US Supreme Court decisions tend to follow public
   opinion raise important questions about the countermajoritarian role of
   the American judiciary. Yet, for the vast majority of federal cases, the
   de facto court of last resort is actually a US court of appeals. We
   examine the role of public opinion in shaping decisions on these courts.
   We argue that the courts of appeals' position in the judicial hierarchy,
   lack of docket control, and lack of public attention encourage circuit
   judges to ignore public opinion and adhere to consistent legal rules;
   however, appeals by federal litigants are strongly associated with
   public opinion. Consequently, circuit judges actively resist ideological
   shifts in public opinion, as they issue consistent rulings in the face
   of varying case facts. Applying multilevel modeling techniques to a data
   set of courts of appeals decisions from 1952 to 2002, we find strong
   support for our theory.},

Abstract = {With the prospects for reaching a binding international treaty on
   emissions mitigation seemingly remote, global climate governance in the
   near to mid-term future is likely to rely on bottom-up accretion of
   domestic efforts and initiatives. This opens up new possibilities but
   also raises questions about the ability of states to produce collective
   action internally. This is especially so in federated systems where
   shared jurisdictional authority and divergent interests present barriers
   to coordinated action. While political will, leadership, and public
   pressure are necessary conditions, each prioritizes the ``whether{''}
   and marginalizes the ``how.{''} This article focuses on the latter,
   exploring how domestic climate governance emerges from the intersection
   of three archetypal modes of coordination-coercion, competition, and
   collaboration-and arguing that bringing and holding together these three
   modes is essential to achieve, and sustain effective coordinated
   governance. Two cases-Canada and Australia-each with a common
   coordination challenge but divergent coordination outcomes, illustrate
   the analytic leverage that can be gained by adopting this approach.},

Abstract = {Scholars of global climate governance have focused increasingly on
   alternative venues to the UN climate regime, with much attention
   focusing on the growth of transnational climate governance. This article
   considers the phenomenon of bilateral intergovernmental climate
   cooperation. It seeks to understand the development of EU-China and
   EU-India climate cooperation as possible instances of diffusion of
   ideas, policies, and institutions. While Chinese and Indian climate
   policies should be understood as primarily domestic developments, there
   is some limited evidence of diffusion from the EU to China. Domestic
   factors in China and India-particularly the degree of fit between
   externally promoted and pre-existing domestic ideas and frames and the
   underlying material conditions driving these frames-help to explain the
   variation between the two cases with respect to observed patterns of
   diffusion.},

   European Integration},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {330-343},
Abstract = {This article is a socio-historical analysis of the European
   institutions' attempts to promote a memory of European integration since
   the 1950s. It demonstrates how the European institutions and their
   representatives referred to and symbolized various pasts in order to
   root the European project historically. EU elites have used the past for
   their contemporary political strategies resulting in specific `regimes
   of historicity', which evolved in correspondence with the context of
   European integration. For the pioneers of the European Community, the
   future was the dominant time-category. From the mid-1970s, the
   increasing weight attributed to memory and heritage is the sign of the
   emergence of a new regime of historicity: presentism. In this regime,
   the official discourses and initiatives attempt at (re-) enacting a
   common European past in the citizens' present. Through the analysis of
   concrete actions-historiographical projects, official ceremonies,
   cultural programmes-I show that the promotion of a transnational
   European memory is a manifestation of this regime of historicity.
   Memorialization processes, which often neglect historical accuracy,
   re-present elements of the past in order to materialize commonalities
   and to foster collective identification. These uses of the past are
   addressed to the public and are apart of the legitimation strategies of
   the EU.},

Title = {THE COMPARABILITY OF MEASUREMENTS OF ATTITUDES TOWARD IMMIGRATION IN THE
   EUROPEAN SOCIAL SURVEY EXACT VERSUS APPROXIMATE MEASUREMENT EQUIVALENCE},
Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {79},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {244-266},
Abstract = {International survey data sets are analyzed with increasing frequency to
   investigate and compare attitudes toward immigration and to examine the
   contextual factors that shape these attitudes. However, international
   comparisons of abstract, psychological constructs require the
   measurements to be equivalent; that is, they should measure the same
   concept on the same measurement scale. Traditional approaches to
   assessing measurement equivalence quite often lead to the conclusion
   that measurements are cross-nationally incomparable, but they have been
   criticized for being overly strict. In the current study, we present an
   alternative Bayesian approach that assesses whether measurements are
   approximately (rather than exactly) equivalent. This approach allows
   small variations in measurement parameters across groups. Taking a
   multiple group confirmatory factor analysis framework as a starting
   point, this study applies approximate and exact equivalence tests to the
   anti-immigration attitudes scale that was implemented in the European
   Social Survey (ESS). Measurement equivalence is tested across the full
   set of 271,220 individuals in 35 ESS countries over six rounds. The
   results of the exact and the approximate approaches are quite different.
   Approximate scalar measurement equivalence is established in all ESS
   rounds, thus allowing researchers to meaningfully compare these mean
   scores and their relationships with other theoretical constructs of
   interest. The exact approach, however, eventually proves to be overly
   strict and leads to the conclusion that measurements are incomparable
   for a large number of countries and time points.},

Title = {Governing migration from a distance: interactions between climate,
   migration, and security in the South Mediterranean},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {473-490},
Abstract = {Links between security and migration are well established and are
   associated with the meaning, status, and practice of borders in the
   international political system. This article assesses how and with what
   effects the effects of environmental and climate change have entered
   this relationship between migration and security. It does so by
   assessing the EU's external governance of migration in ``South
   Mediterranean Partner Countries{''} (SMPCs): Algeria, Egypt, Iraq,
   Israel, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Palestine, Syria, and Tunisia. It is
   argued that a focus on promoting ``adaptation{''} and building
   ``resilience{''} has developed that is consistent with the logic of
   governing migration from a distance. However, the article challenges
   ideas that environmental/climate change act as simple migration
   ``triggers{''} and instead explores implications of movement towards and
   not away from risk, as well as the potential for populations to be
   trapped in areas that expose them to risk. It is shown that both have
   important implications for the relationship between migration,
   environmental/climate change, and security in SMPCs.},

Pages = {420-437},
Abstract = {This contribution focuses on the European Parliament (EP) as an actor in
   European Union (EU) border policies. It situates the Parliament in the
   dynamics of the Schengen project and discusses the distinct role it
   plays therein, as well as its impact thereon. The article argues that
   the EP managed to establish itself, years before the entry into force of
   the Lisbon Treaty, as a credible actor in border policies able to bring
   the citizens' perspective into EU border policies. With its keen
   interest in the Schengen area as an area in which citizens can move
   freely without being subject to border controls, and with its focus on
   fundamental rights, it played, and continues to do so, a role in
   ensuring that ``Schengen works{''}. The article presents its powers and
   the interplay with the other EU institutions, mainly on the basis of a
   number of key examples.},

Abstract = {The 2014 crisis in Ukraine has refocused attention on Russia as a
   European security actor. Despite showing renewed military capability,
   compared to the post-Soviet period, Russian society-military relations
   have remained the same. This relationship (between society and the
   security organs) provides the key context for assessing security.
   Analysis of everyday militarization and the role of voluntary
   organizations (such as DOSAAF {[}Dobrovol'noe obshchestvo sodeistviya
   armii, aviatsii i flotu] and Nashi {[}Molodezhnoe demokraticheskoe
   antifashistskoe dvizheni]) in supporting the military can provide an
   important insight into Russian behaviour as a security actor. These
   organizations generate a pro-military outlook and at the same time
   provide training and activities, thus contributing to military
   effectiveness by developing the competency of young people prior to
   military service as well as increasing public knowledge of military
   affairs. However, strong support for the military, a lack of independent
   information, and an absence of a shared vision on how society-military
   relations should be developed and also represent political challenges in
   terms of everyday militarization. This dynamic is important for
   understanding both Russia's security posture and wider security
   implications for Europe.},

Abstract = {How does political competition shape institutions that govern the
   expansion of social policy subnationally? Brazilian states have shown a
   surprising variation in the design of their public health institutions,
   which regulate the distribution of health resources and citizen access
   to public health care. While many states have experienced fragmentation,
   some have remained highly centralized and discretionary, and only a
   select few have established a coordinated system based on power sharing
   and rules-based distribution. Accounts that link public health care
   expansion to federal government imposition, the presence of the public
   health care movement, and leftist parties cannot fully explain this
   variation. Instead, in the three Brazilian states examined here, the
   nature of subnational political competition triggered different
   institution-building strategies. The findings indicate that plural
   political competition yielded incentives for limiting state-level
   discretion and for sharing power with municipal governments, while
   political concentration reinforced the attraction to centralized and
   discretionary policymaking.},

Abstract = {Following the premature collapse of an eclectic right-wing and
   centre-left government, Israelis went to the polls on the 17 March,
   2015. Despite what appeared to be a clear-cut right-wing victory, the
   thirty-fourth government of Israel was constituted 14 May, 2015, over
   two months after incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's apparent
   electoral triumph. This profile examines the contours of Israel's recent
   election campaign and formation of a new government, assessing the
   triumphs and pitfalls of Israel's major political parties during the
   election period. Similarly, this profile delineates the major political
   issues and dominant personalities featuring throughout the campaign.
   Subsequently, this profile traces the often-frantic coalition
   negotiations that led to formation of the thirty-fourth Israeli
   administration. Finally, the domestic and foreign policy implications of
   an increased hegemony of right-wing parties in the current government
   are outlined. Conversely, the narrow majority of the new government
   suggests ideological homogeneity may come with a price of increased
   political instability for Prime Minister Netanyahu.},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {The accuracy of U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) demographic
   and financial forecasts is crucial for the solvency of its Trust Funds,
   other government programs, industry decision-making, and the evidence
   base of many scholarly articles. Because SSA makes public insufficient
   replication information and uses antiquated statistical forecasting
   methods, no external group has ever been able to produce fully
   independent forecasts or evaluations of policy proposals to change the
   system. Yet, no systematic evaluation of SSA forecasts has ever been
   published by SSA or anyone else-until a companion paper to this one. We
   show that SSA's forecasting errors were approximately unbiased until
   about 2000, but then began to grow quickly, with increasingly
   overconfident uncertainty intervals. Moreover, the errors are largely in
   the same direction, making the Trust Funds look healthier than they are.
   We extend and then explain these findings with evidence from a large
   number of interviews with participants at every level of the forecasting
   and policy processes. We show that SSA's forecasting procedures meet all
   the conditions the modern social-psychology and statistical literatures
   demonstrate make bias likely. When those conditions mixed with potent
   new political forces trying to change Social Security, SSA's actuaries
   hunkered down, trying hard to insulate their forecasts from strong
   political pressures. Unfortunately, this led the actuaries into not
   incorporating the fact that retirees began living longer lives and
   drawing benefits longer than predicted. We show that fewer than 10\% of
   their scorings of major policy proposals were statistically different
   from random noise as estimated from their policy forecasting error. We
   also show that the solution to this problem involves SSA or Congress
   implementing in government two of the central projects of political
   science over the last quarter century: (1) transparency in data and
   methods and (2) replacing with formal statistical models large numbers
   of ad hoc qualitative decisions too complex for unaided humans to make
   optimally.},

Abstract = {Questions about racial or ethnic group identity feature centrally in
   many social science theories, but detailed data on ethnic composition
   are often difficult to obtain, out of date, or otherwise unavailable.
   The proliferation of publicly available geocoded person names provides
   one potential source of such data-if researchers can effectively link
   names and group identity. This article examines that linkage and
   presents a methodology for estimating local ethnic or racial composition
   using the relationship between group membership and person names. Common
   approaches for linking names and identity groups perform poorly when
   estimating group proportions. I have developed a new method for
   estimating racial or ethnic composition from names which requires no
   classification of individual names. This method provides more accurate
   estimates than the standard approach and works in any context where
   person names contain information about group membership. Illustrations
   from two very different contexts are provided: the United States and the
   Republic of Kenya.},

Abstract = {This meta-analysis quantifies the dose-response relationship between
   monetary incentives and response rates in household surveys. It updates
   and augments the existing meta-analyses on incentives by analyzing the
   latest experimental research, focusing specifically on
   general-population household surveys, and includes the three major
   data-collection modes (mail, telephone, and in-person) under the same
   analytic framework. Using hierarchical regression modeling and
   literature from the past 21 years, the analysis finds a strong,
   nonlinear effect of incentives. Survey mode and incentive delivery
   timing (prepaid or promised) also play important roles in the
   effectiveness of incentives. Prepaid incentives offered in mail surveys
   had the largest per-dollar impact on response. Incentive timing appears
   to play an important role in the effectiveness of incentives offered in
   telephone surveys but not in-person surveys. Our model estimates a null
   effect of promised incentives in mail surveys; however, given the dearth
   of experiments testing this type of incentive, we are unable to draw
   firm conclusions regarding their effectiveness. Survey burden and survey
   year both were negatively correlated with response overall. However,
   neither significantly impacted the dose-response relationship. Survey
   sponsorship affected neither response rate nor incentive effectiveness.
   The development and results of the model are discussed, and
   dose-response estimates specific to mode and incentive timing are
   presented.},

   Promoter to Leader in the Global War on Terrorism},

Abstract = {Even prior to the country's independence, Africa has always been central
   to Algeria's foreign policy. Algerian nationalists not only found
   support on the African continent in their struggle for independence, but
   they also sought to contribute to the decolonization of Africa and to
   free it from all forms of neocolonialism. Algerian diplomacy became even
   more involved in African affairs after independence. Using the Role
   Approach, this article shows how Algerian policymakers exercised various
   roles within the structures of the Organization of African Unity and, to
   this day, in those of the African Union to serve the country's perceived
   national interests. While from the 1960s through the 1990s, Algerians
   played the roles of developer, mediator, and anti-imperialist, since the
   1990s, they have played the role of antiterrorist in order partly to
   regain the credibility that the regime had lost during the domestic
   civil strife. The antiterrorist role has been relatively successful as
   the country succeeded in greatly improving its relations with the West,
   the United States in particular. At the same time, though, this had led
   to a relative neglect of Algeria's bilateral relations with African
   states which allowed its regional rivals to fill the vacuum. However,
   since 2013, Algeria has shown some resolve in reclaiming its influence
   on the continent and to strengthen the role it has played in the
   structures of the African Union.},

Title = {EFFECTS OF A GENERAL RESPONSE STYLE ON CROSS-CULTURAL COMPARISONS
   EVIDENCE FROM THE TEACHING AND LEARNING INTERNATIONAL SURVEY},
Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {79},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {267-290},
Abstract = {This paper investigates the integration of response styles (extreme and
   midpoint responding and socially desirable responding) and their effects
   on self-reports among 76,887 teachers from 18 countries in the Teaching
   and Learning International Survey (TALIS). Socially desirable responding
   (with a positive and a negative impression management factor) and 17
   core constructs related to the teaching profession were measured with
   Likert scales; extreme and midpoint response styles were derived from
   these measures. Using factor analysis, a general response style was
   extracted with socially desirable and extreme response styles as
   positive indicators and midpoint response style as a negative indicator.
   This general response style was more strongly correlated with constructs
   of personal involvement, such as teacher efficacy and job satisfaction,
   than constructs with less personal involvement, at both the individual
   and country level; however, statistical correction for response styles
   had negligible effects on the size of cross-cultural differences and
   country rankings in any construct. We conclude that the general response
   style can be interpreted as response amplification versus moderation,
   and that there is no indication that correcting for the general response
   style increases the validity of cross-cultural comparisons of TALIS
   teacher data.},

Abstract = {Migrant journeys are often conceived as linear movement from a sending
   country to a receiving country. However, a recent work suggests that the
   notion of linear migrant journeys is a misrepresentation. I argue that
   European regulations that standardise immigration policy around a common
   goal of `burden- sharing' such as the Dublin II Regulation interact with
   the journeys of migrants to create paths that are not linear, circular
   or guided solely by intent. Rather migrant journeys can be conceived as
   a series of negotiations with state policies that shape experiences,
   choices and destinations through constructions of illegality. Mobility
   becomes an on- going condition rather than a temporary one. Borders then
   are reproduced as phenomenological rather than physical. I illustrate my
   argument through an ethnographic case study of a Sudanese man seeking to
   join his wife and child who had filed an asylum application in France.
   He interacts with the borders of Europe throughout his journey; however,
   as he becomes known as an undocumented migrant he moves further from the
   possibility of entering Europe with immigration status despite being
   within the territorial boundaries. Conversely, as his physical proximity
   to Europe increases and is established, his legal proximity decreases.},

   the gas trade across the iron curtain involved political risks. During
   the decades that followed, their cooperation survived several major
   East-West crises without a affecting the gas trade. However, Brussels's
   intervention in its pursuit of open access to Russia's energy resources
   was rejected by Russia. From about 2005 onwards, the European Commission
   increasingly took it upon itself to control and limit the energy
   relationship with Gazprom. Meanwhile, Russia's gas exports to former
   Soviet republics were complicated by difficulties to pay, followed by
   Russian demands for political and economic concessions. In Ukraine, the
   involvement of ``oligarchs{''} as intermediaries at both ends led to

Abstract = {The cascade of sanctions put in place by the United States and the EU
   are examined. Having reached the present adversarial configuration, the
   EU also aims to limit its natural gas imports from Russia. Current
   options for substituting Russian gas with alternative supplies are
   reviewed within a global framework of trading routes, accessibility,
   lead times and price structures. The added costs and geopolitical
   implications of altering suppliers and supplies are assessed.},

   Prynne William., 1633, Histrio-mastix The players scourge, or, actors tragaedie, divided into two parts. Wherein it is largely evidenced, by divers arguments, by the concurring authorities and resolutions of sundry texts of Scripture ... That popular stage-playes ... are sinfull, heathenish, lewde, ungodly spectacles, and most pernicious corruptions; condemned in all ages, as intolerable mischiefes to churches, to republickes, to the manners, mindes, and soules of men. And that the profession of play-poets, of stageplayers; together with the penning, acting, and frequenting of stage-playes, are unlawfull, infamous and misbeseeming Christians. All pretences to the contrary are here likewise fully answered; and the unlawfulnes of acting, of beholding academicall enterludes, briefly discussed; besides sundry other particulars concerning dancing, dicing, health-drinking.

Abstract = {Against the backdrop of the current trend to criticise elite-centred
   approaches to the study of nationalism, this article sheds light on ways
   in which elite and popular notions of nationhood are mediated. Thus,
   public discourse on national identity is explored as a discourse that
   ordinary people can influence and in which elites make claims to
   represent the people. To illustrate the dynamics of representative
   claim-making and reception, the article uses a case study from German
   public discourse; the debate about Thilo Sarrazin's 2010 book Germany
   Does Away With Itself. It finds that, although Sarrazin clearly breaches
   well-established rules in national identity discourse, his ideas gain
   traction from the moment he becomes accepted as representing ordinary
   Germans. The findings are discussed against the backdrop of the history
   of German national identity discourse and anti-essentialist approaches
   treating nationhood as a political claim.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the relationship between religion, secularisation
   and nationalism in Quebec and the Basque Country using a comparative
   approach. I will first outline the ethnic-religious origin of these
   nationalist movements. Second, I will examine the extent to which the
   `new' secular and violent nationalism (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna and Front
   de Liberation du Quebec) that emerged in the 1960s was fuelled in its
   origin by a transfer of sacrality. Third, I will address an aspect that
   has led some theorists to view religion and nationalism as analogous
   phenomena, in which nationalism is construed as a religion of blood
   sacrifice. Fourth, I will examine another aspect that leads to this view
   of religion and nationalism as analogous phenomena, as the latter also
   provides a framework of transcendent meaning through an imaginary of
   continuity between the different generations. The article concludes with
   a series of general considerations on the relations between nationalism,
   secularisation and religion.},

Abstract = {Theories of coalition politics in parliamentary democracies have
   suggested that government formation and survival are jointly determined
   outcomes. An important empirical implication of these theories is that
   the sample of observed governments analyzed in studies of government
   survival may be nonrandomly selected from the population of potential
   governments. This can lead to serious inferential problems.
   Unfortunately, current empirical models of government survival are
   unable to account for the possible biases arising from nonrandom
   selection. In this study, we use a copula-based framework to assess, and
   correct for, the dependence between the processes of government
   formation and survival. Our results suggest that existing studies of
   government survival, by ignoring the selection problem, overstate the
   substantive importance of several covariates commonly included in
   empirical models.},

Abstract = {Why do only some social conflicts lead to party-system change? In
   Bolivia, the recent politicization of the regional autonomy movement
   represented a stark difference with how conflicts had affected
   party-system dynamics in the past. This study argues that social
   conflicts led to party-system change in Bolivia thanks largely to the
   strategies of ruling party elites. Motivated to preserve their position
   in power, elites had a menu of strategic options at their disposal to
   integrate, defer, or disregard demands from below. The study situates
   the recent regional conflict in Bolivia within the country's longer
   history of mobilizational politics. It finds that ruling elites utilized
   different strategies of exclusion and inclusion to neutralize social
   conflict and preserve the status quo party system. They appropriated the
   regional autonomy demands as a last-ditch effort to remain electorally
   relevant in the face of successful party competition. In so doing, they
   helped transform the party system. Even from a position of electoral
   weakness and in the face of overwhelming demands from below, Bolivia's
   elites shaped the transformative impact of those demands. This study
   relies upon a least-likely case design to highlight the impact elite
   agency can have in making or breaking politics under democracy.},

Abstract = {In much of the world, those who do not perform mainstream'
   understandings of gender and sexuality find themselves on the
   peripheries': these individuals and groups are often located outside of
   institutionalized power, beyond state power structures and often lack
   the power of representation vis-a-vis those who wield discursive
   authority (actors such as the state and mainstream media). The power
   relations that underscore the production of knowledge and identities in
   this way are discursive, functioning to normalize and naturalize them.
   This article examines how some representations of gender and sexuality
   are privileged over others in both western and MENA mainstream
   discourses relating to the Arab Spring'; how those whose voices have
   been underrepresented in the mainstream attempt to represent themselves;
   and how this impacts on the political activities of women and LGBT
   groups in the MENA.},

Abstract = {Rating scales are used extensively in surveys. One design feature of a
   rating scale that remains understudied is its direction. A rating scale
   can run from zero to 10, or from ``strongly agree{''} to ``strongly
   disagree.{''} It can also run from 10 to zero, or ``strongly
   disagree{''} to ``strongly agree.{''} For rating scales with the same
   number of scale points, the same numerical and verbal labels, the key
   research question is whether varying the direction of the scale would
   affect survey responses, and if yes, in what way. Drawing on data from
   an experiment that varies the direction of an 11-point end-labeled
   unipolar scale, we find that the direction of the rating scale
   significantly affects respondents' ratings of countries that received
   high ratings. Specifically, ratings for those countries are higher when
   the scale starts with a high number than when the scale begins with a
   low number. We also find evidence indicating that the scale-direction
   effects are due to respondents' use of anchoring-and-adjustment
   heuristics instead of satisficing. Implications of these results are
   discussed.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {120-140},
Abstract = {International sanctions against Iran and Syria have been tightened to
   unprecedented levels since 2012, particularly in the case of the
   European Union's (EU's) restrictions on the countries' energy and
   finance sectors. Marking a departure from the EU's carefully targeted
   sanctions policies of recent decades, they represent de facto
   comprehensive measures widely associated with negative humanitarian
   impacts. This paper analyses semi-structured interviews, official
   discourse and case studies to explore early reports of negative impacts
   on the health of ordinary citizens in Iran and Syria and examines
   associated policy responses, particularly in the EU context. The author
   outlines why a shift towards broader-based sanctions could be
   problematic for the EU and outlines constraints currently preventing
   more efficient risk mitigation. This paper suggests ways that sanctions,
   representing an increasingly vital, albeit contested, tool of EU foreign
   and security policy, could be used in a more prudent manner if a
   worsening humanitarian situation is to be avoided.},

   perspective},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Pages = {491-508},
Abstract = {This article will work towards a multi-level collective action approach
   for understanding the deployment of Common Security and Defence Policy
   (CSDP) military operations. It is multi-level because it uses three
   levels of analysis: firstly, the international level, where events that
   create threats to certain values catalyze the process leading to the
   deployment of an operation; secondly, the national level, where EU
   governments formulate their national preferences towards prospective
   deployments based on utility expectations; and thirdly, the EU level,
   where EU member states negotiate and seek compromises to accommodate
   their different national preferences. The strength of the model will be
   demonstrated through empirical case studies on the deployment processes
   of EUFOR Althea in Bosnia and Herzegovina and EU NAVFOR Atalanta off the
   coast of Somalia. The article will also provide an overview of the
   existing theoretical literature on the deployment of CSDP military
   operations.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {77-100},
Abstract = {This article explores the claims of Russian officials that US
   assessments of economic and political developments in Russia,
   particularly those of Freedom House (FH), are excessively critical and
   often used to justify global dominance. To assess the validity of such
   claims, three different influences are considered: culture, power, and
   special interests. The article finds that all three, each with roots in
   the cold war, play a role in shaping assessments of Russia and help to
   explain why FH's analysis of Russia is more critical than the analysis
   of other organizations. The politics of special interests is found to be
   particularly influential and reflects the interests of US national
   security policies and priorities. Such priorities are also linked to a
   politics of memory derived from the cold war, which often influences
   perceptions of Russia as a threat rather than as a potential partner.},

Title = {Parliaments in Disguise? How German Councillors perceive Local Councils},
Journal = {LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {183-201},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {Drawing on a survey among German local councillors, the article is
   discussing the question if German local councils do constitute
   `parliamentary' bodies. To which extent do local councillors perceive
   the council as a parliament and themselves as members of a parliament?
   This question is especially interesting in Germany, where the public
   largely associates terms like `parliament' with the local council and
   `government' with the mayor and the executive officers, even if local
   institutions by law all belong to the executive branch. Despite the
   institutional setup, I claim that councillors perceive themselves as
   `local MPs'. By using the concept of parliamentarism, this article
   analyses the self-assessments of nearly 900 German local councillors.
   The article shows that German local councillors act in a
   quasi-parliamentarian style by controlling the executive, but take
   important decisions within the frame of `local laws' and seek to
   implement their party's programme. Councillors, representing their
   respective party in the council, also negotiate coalitions and divide
   themselves into `majority' and `minority' benches, resembling the setup
   of a `real' parliament.},

Title = {Income Inequality and Redistributive Spending: Evidence from Panel Data
   of Texas Counties},
Journal = {LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {41},
Number = {5},
Pages = {735-754},
Abstract = {The relationship between redistributive spending and income inequality
   has been of interest to researchers for several decades. Existing
   literature has largely focused on country-level studies and may be
   broadly divided into two groups: studies that find a positive
   relationship between the two and studies that find a negative
   relationship. The positive association is usually explained through the
   median voter theory and the negative association through the social
   insurance theory.
   This study offers a test of the median voter and social insurance
   hypotheses by examining the relationship between economic inequality,
   voter turnout and redistributive spending at the sub-national level
   among the 50 largest counties in Texas over years 2006 to 2012. One of
   the advantages of using a regional sample is that counties are
   relatively more homogeneous and allow for the collection of better
   records across time. Random effects models suggest that income
   inequality is positively associated with redistributive spending. The
   study improves our understanding of the patterns of redistribution at
   the sub-national level and highlights the importance of careful
   inter-temporal modelling of relationships between redistributive
   spending and inequality.},

Abstract = {This paper highlights campaigns for national rights among two
   non-titular communities in the Soviet Union and places them in local
   historical contexts. Drawing on archival sources and oral history
   interviews, the author not only delves into the campaigns themselves,
   but also explores broader debates about the nature of Khrushchev's Thaw
   and Soviet citizenship, which was far from an empty concept in the
   Khrushchev era. Petitioners invoked discourses that indicate both an
   awareness of national rights and an expectation of the state's
   obligation to protect them. Oral history interviews with surviving
   petitioners and community members support the notion that petition
   language can serve as a reflection of how petitioners viewed their place
   in Soviet society and interpreted the Soviet citizen contract.},

Abstract = {This article examines the reverberations in Russia of the Euromaidan
   protests and the fall of the Yanukovych regime in Ukraine. It shows how
   the events in Kyiv provoked a major crisis in the Russian nationalist
   movement, which was riven by vituperative denunciations, the ostracism
   of prominent activists, the breakdown of friendships, the rupture of
   alliances, and schisms within organizations. Focusing on pro-Kremlin
   nationalists and several tendencies of opposition nationalists, it
   argues that this turmoil was shaped by three factors. First, the
   Euromaidan provoked clashes between pro-Kremlin nationalists, who became
   standard-bearers of official anti-Euromaidan propaganda, and anti-Putin
   nationalists, who extolled the Euromaidan as a model for a revolution in
   Russia itself. Second, the events in Ukraine provoked ideological
   contention around issues of particular sensitivity to Russian
   nationalists, such as the competing claims of imperialism and ethnic
   homogeneity, and of Soviet nationalism and Russian traditionalism. And
   third, many nationalists were unprepared for the pace of events, which
   shifted rapidly from an anti-oligarchic uprising in Kyiv to a push for
   the self-determination of ethnic Russians in Crimean and southeast
   Ukraine. As a result, they were left in the uncomfortable position of
   appearing to collaborate with the oppressors of their compatriots.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the October 1905 pogroms in the Russian Empire. It
   explores the reasons for the pogroms, the perpetrators, the victims, and
   the consequences for the Jewish population. The article shows the
   differences and peculiarities of the pogroms, which occurred in the
   cities and shtetls, rural areas, on the railroads, and in the ports. The
   article also explores the attitude and involvement of the higher and
   local authorities, police, and troops in the pogroms. Historians
   continue to debate whether these pogroms occurred spontaneously or were
   organized by the Tsarist authorities. This article provides considerable
   evidence that the October 1905 pogroms were not a spontaneous reaction
   of conservatives to the revolutionary events, but rather was the policy
   of the Russian government directed toward the suppression of the
   revolutionary movement.},

Abstract = {The disintegration of the former Yugoslavia posed challenges for the
   universal concept of the Yugoslav Muslim nation for which several
   development paths were imaginable under the new circumstances. The
   concept of Bosniakdom, which was initially developed to address the
   Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina, gradually grew to become a new and
   coherent national program to include all the Muslims of former
   Yugoslavia, primarily due to its new pan-Bosniak orientation. The
   present article traces the conceptual history of the national ideas of
   Muslimdom versus Bosniakdom within the former Yugoslav states, as well
   as the conceptual and institutional history of the pan-Bosniak idea and
   movement during the 1990s and 2000s. It does this by emphasizing the
   decisive role the Official Muslim Community in Bosnia and Herzegovina
   played in their development and divulgence. This article claims that,
   contrary to some expectations, the strategy of internationalization and
   universalization of the hitherto territorial concept of Bosniakdom
   toward Muslims in neighboring countries during the second half of 1990s
   and 2000s was closely linked to the idea of the construction of the
   Bosniak national state. It also proposes that the evolution of
   Bosniakdom into pan-Bosniakdom during that time primarily followed
   concerns related to that goal.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes initiatives of Gerald Ford's presidential
   administration toward nationalities or the so-called white ethnics
   against the backdrop of the legacy of Richard Nixon and the Republican
   Party's ethnic politics of the 1960s. Using archival and interview
   materials, it demonstrates that Gerald Ford intended to improve the
   relationship between the President's office and the ethnics who were
   involved in the Republican Party's structures. He consciously tried to
   respond to ethnics' political concerns and even created a special
   position on his staff for working with the nationalities. While in
   office and during the election campaign of 1976, Ford succeeded in
   engaging the ethnics and in demonstrating his will to address their
   needs on the domestic ``front.{''} He failed, however, to fully
   appreciate the importance of foreign policy to the nationalities. The
   article proposes that today, as in the 1970s, the American political
   establishment would benefit from recognizing international issues as
   crucial elements of white ethnics' or nationalities' political behavior.},

Abstract = {This article adds to current literature on municipal competitiveness by
   examining the positioning strategies of Norwegian municipalities.
   Norwegian municipalities are faced with strong similarity pressures from
   both central government and regional peers, but are also expected to
   differentiate and tailor services to local needs. Following the
   introduction of reputation management, differentiation pressures grow
   stronger. This study shows how concerns of reputation, differentiation
   and municipal competitiveness are connected and integrated into
   strategic thinking, but also that similarity concerns and pressures
   influence the level of differentiation. The article discusses the
   general implications of these findings for our understanding of the
   tension between similarity and difference in a local government context
   as it relates to reputation management work at the municipal level of
   government.},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of nationalism theory, and specifically
   the theory of national awakening, on Kurdish historiography. Kurdish
   experts cite several famous nationalism theorists, but seem most
   impressed by Anthony Smith's model of a singular transformation in which
   a not-yet-national community becomes a proper nation. Kurdish experts do
   not always use Smith's terminology, however, and often invoke other
   scholars in support of the singular transformation model. Kurdish
   historiography disagrees what the singular transformation entails, and
   different thresholds of nationalism imply wildly different dates for the
   birth of Kurdish nationalism. Stage theories of national awakening have
   had little impact, and ought to be reconsidered.},

Abstract = {This introduction to the symposium sets out the context for local
   government in the United Kingdom at the current time. It outlines the
   scale of the reductions in funding since 2010, showing how uneven these
   cuts have been across the country and the reasons for this. It also
   describes the increased exposure to risk of both local government and of
   the citizens and communities it serves. The central question for the
   papers which follow is how local government is responding to these twin
   challenges. The papers provide insights from a number of detailed
   studies of individual authorities, exploring the strategies adopted to
   manage in response. The analyses focus on the distributive consequences
   for individuals and communities, but they also reflect on the wider
   consequences for local government itself. A particular concern is
   whether local responses are changing as austerity moves from its initial
   to its later phase.},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {It is becoming difficult to maintain consensus in a period of economic
   austerity, and this possibly challenges the ability of democratic
   institutions to take decisions on tough economic questions. In order to
   find out how political consensus influences fiscal outcomes, this
   article sets out to analyse the association between political consensus
   and public expenditure growth. The results show that political consensus
   is positively associated with both budgeted and actual expenditure
   growth, but also negatively associated with budget overruns. This
   indicates that political consensus comes at a cost, while at the same
   time politicians may be better at sticking to budgets if political
   consensus exists. The analysis is based on a pooled regression analysis
   of the local governments in Denmark in the years 2008 and 2009 using a
   data set combining survey data with administrative data on the local
   governments.},

   Politicians' Online Communication Activities in Germany},
Journal = {LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {41},
Number = {5},
Pages = {755-773},
Abstract = {How extensively local politicians use online media to communicate with
   others and the factors that influence their online activities have
   rarely been examined. In particular, it is unknown whether local
   politicians use online media more extensively when they believe that
   online media has a strong political influence on others. To examine
   this, a standardised survey among German local politicians was conducted
   (n = 608). The results showed the following: The stronger the
   politicians perceive the influence of facebook and Twitter on
   journalists to be, the more extensively they spread information via
   these social media networks. However, the presumed influences on the
   public or on other politicians do not affect those online activities.
   Thus, local politicians apparently do not pursue a disintermediation
   strategy - they do not try to bypass journalism by directly addressing
   the public. Rather, journalists seem to be an important target group for
   local politicians' online communication efforts.},

Abstract = {The scale of the cuts to local government finance, coupled with
   increasing demand for services, has led to unprecedented `budget gaps'
   in council budgets. Arguably, two competing narratives of the trajectory
   of local government have emerged in which contrasting futures are
   imagined for the sector - a positive story of adaptation and survival
   and more negative one of residualisation and marginalisation. Drawing on
   case study evidence from three English local authorities, the paper
   distinguishes and provides examples of three strategic approaches to
   managing austerity - efficiency, retrenchment and investment. It
   demonstrates how and why the balance of these strategies has shifted
   between the early and later phases of austerity and considers the extent
   to which the evidence of the case studies provide support for either the
   survival or marginalisation narrative. The paper concludes by arguing
   that a third narrative - responsibilisation - captures more fully the
   trajectory of local government in England.},

Journal = {LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-19},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {The overarching objective of this article is to stimulate debate about
   how local authorities could and should manage their austerity measures
   because the speed, scale and aggregation of the UK public spending cuts
   risk adversely affecting already disadvantaged and vulnerable groups,
   exacerbating social exclusion and leading to higher costs for councils
   in the future. It presents the results of research conducted during
   2011-2012 focusing on if and how five Scottish case study councils
   attempted to mitigate social risks. It found that they were using
   equalities impact assessment (EIA) procedures in their decision-making.
   However, EIAs are not fit for purpose as a risk mitigation tool and fail
   to take account of all groups which may also be adversely affected by
   service cuts. Hence, this article recommends a more innovative approach
   in local decision-making processes based on a social risk impact
   assessment (SRIA) model within a preventative approach to social policy.},

Abstract = {Using memories of and interviews with Soviet soldiers, the article
   discusses their experience of combat and physical violence during the
   Soviet War in Afghanistan (1979-1989). With Afghan statehood rapidly
   dissolving and little interest on the side of the Soviet military to
   enforce international law, Afghanistan quickly turned into a space where
   violence became the most important social resource. The soldiers and
   other Soviet personnel had to adapt to these conditions, which differed
   immensely from the late socialist society in the USSR. The article
   traces their immersion into the violent space and discusses their
   behavior while in Afghanistan. It points to the brutality of
   counterinsurgency combat and to the atrocities committed by both sides.
   In addition, it sheds light on the experience of serving in the Soviet
   Army during the last decade of the USSR. Many of the dysfunctions of the
   late socialist society were also prevalent - even amplified - while
   serving in the Soviet Army in Afghanistan. These problems were often
   exacerbated during the war and impeded the abilities of the Soviet Army.
   Upon their return from Afghanistan, many veterans found it difficult to
   return to civilian life in the USSR. Their immersion into the violent
   space was more rapid and formative than their return to socialist
   ``normality.{''}},

Pages = {248-266},
Abstract = {According to theories of nonviolent resistance, violence is
   counterproductive and undermines the ability of a movement to achieve
   mass support. At the same time, studies of ethnic insurgencies suggest
   that violence is the only available method of mobilization in political
   systems characterized by entrenched ethnic hierarchies. Engaging with
   these arguments, this article addresses a historical puzzle: What
   factors explain the timing and ability of the PKK's (Partiye Karker (e)
   over capn Kurdistan) rise as the hegemonic Kurdish nationalist
   organization in Turkey between the late 1970s and 1990? The article
   argues that studies that identify Kurdish nationalism as a reaction to
   repressive policies of the Turkish state without paying attention to
   prevailing social conditions and oppositional strategies fail to provide
   a satisfactory response. It argues that the rise of the PKK was
   primarily a function of its ability to gain support among the peasantry
   in deeply unequal rural areas through its strategic employment of
   violence. It also identifies four causal mechanisms of PKK recruitment
   based on rich archival and field research: credibility, revenge, social
   mobility, and gender emancipation.},

Abstract = {This article explores the tensions inherent in how Kyrgyzstan's
   nationhood and statehood have been imagined and practised via an
   analysis of local reactions to the findings of the Kyrgyzstan Inquiry
   Commission's (KIC) investigation into the 2010 Osh violence and in
   particular the threat narrative that developed in opposition to the
   investigation. In the wake of the clashes that erupted in Osh in June
   2010, a recurrent theme was calls from the international community for
   an independent investigation. Within Kyrgyzstan, however, some
   politicians argued that investigations violated the republic's
   sovereignty. Despite local reluctance, a number of investigations did
   subsequently take place. Yet the reports of the respective
   investigations did little to quell controversy, with the KIC report
   being strongly criticized and declared a threat to national security.
   The strength of feeling demonstrated by this reaction was indicative of
   long-standing and unresolved tensions in Kyrgyzstan between
   international and local imaginings of nationhood and statehood. The
   article concludes by arguing that nationhood and statehood need to be
   reimagined to focus on reestablishing state-society relations by both
   local and international actors in order for Kyrgyzstan to begin
   repairing the already fragile sociopolitical relationships that were
   grievously damaged by the violence and the subsequent investigations.},

Journal = {LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUDIES},

Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {The relative complexity of procurement under public-private partnership
   (PPP) means that tendering periods can be longer compared to traditional
   procurement models. Reducing the tendering period is therefore an
   important challenge if PPP is to deliver infrastructure on time and
   within budget. Using data from 59 PPP projects in Ireland we find that
   the average tendering period has been 34 months. Analysis using duration
   analysis shows that tendering periods have fallen over time and are
   positively but not strongly associated with the capital value of
   projects. Tendering periods are longer for projects that do not involve
   private finance with the majority of such projects procured by local
   authorities. We use two case studies of PPP procurement to explore these
   issues further. Both cases highlight the complex array of factors that
   can impact on tendering periods some of which are outside the control of
   the procurement authority.},

Abstract = {The government of Bangladesh has introduced several initiatives seeking
   to develop participatory governance at the local level in order to
   maximise the outcomes of aid-assisted development projects. This article
   examines the impact of these initiatives and demonstrates that
   participatory local governance faces a number of challenges in
   Bangladesh, in particular, absence of democratic culture and tradition
   and disengagement of citizens, asymmetric distribution of patronage and
   weak institutions. In theory, political elites and bureaucrats in
   Bangladesh advocate democracy, accountability and local-level
   participation, but in practice, they have an affinity for power and
   centralised authority. Their reform initiatives seem half-hearted and
   disjointed restricting the growth of democratic culture and
   participatory local governance at the local level in Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the 15-point agreement on normalization of relations
   between Kosovo and Serbia. Two mainstream discourses have prevailed
   since the agreement was ratified by both countries: on one hand, the
   Government of Kosovo has branded this agreement as historic, given the
   fact that in the last century no agreement has ever been reached between
   Kosovo and Serbia. On the other hand, Kosovo's political opposition has
   critiqued this agreement stressing that the 15-point agreement
   devastates Kosovo's statehood. Beyond both extreme stances, we argue
   that an enhanced autonomy for four northern Serb municipalities ought to
   be seen as a tool for integration, rather than disintegration of Kosovo
   statehood. This paper concludes that the dialogue between Kosovo and
   Serbia as a top-down arrangement lacks transparency, and this might
   jeopardize the achievements reached through this process. Moreover, the
   EU position should be clearly articulated that redrawing and rearranging
   the borders of Kosovo and Serbia might overturn the EU's and USA's
   immense investments in stability, peace, and prosperity in the Western
   Balkans.},

Title = {Between ``ethnocide{''} and ``genocide{''}: violence and Otherness in
   the coverage of the Afghanistan and Chechnya wars},

Abstract = {The Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the two Russian wars in
   Chechnya were the longest, most protracted conflicts of the USSR and
   Russia after WWII. Both were conducted under conditions of unprecedented
   violence in peripheral territories. Despite their distance in time and
   space, both wars are closely linked to each other on the level of
   cultural representations in contemporary Russia. This paper analyses how
   the conflicts were represented in a key Soviet and Russian newspaper as
   the wars unfolded. It analyses the textual and visual coverage of the
   wars in the Krasnaia zvezda (1980-1986; 2000-2003), in order to disclose
   changing interpretations of violence and the Other. The paper argues,
   first, that Krasnaia zvezda told the story of two different types of
   violence prevailing in each conflict. The Afghan case was presented as
   one that put the social and cultural transformation of the population at
   the center of its attention - violence was hence not only physical and
   excessive but also cultural, as it aimed at the social fabric of
   society. The Chechen case focused on the recapture of territory and the
   restoration of sovereignty. Therefore, physical violence appeared more
   bluntly in the coverage of the conflict. Second, the paper shows that
   these two different types of violence implied two different visions of
   the Other. In Afghanistan, the Other was represented as becoming more
   and more similar to the socialist Self. This dynamic is visually
   underscored by numerous images of Afghans who have embarked on the path
   to Soviet modernity. In Chechnya, in contrast, the Other was presented
   as traditional, backward, and immutable. The Other was usually reduced
   to complete cultural difference and depicted a dehumanized fashion. This
   orientalization of the Other was a precondition for the use of excessive
   physical violence.},

Abstract = {This article examines the concept of sovereignty in elite and popular
   affection during the violent and turbulent events from April to October
   2010 in the Kyrgyz Republic. Nationalist leaders promoted Kyrgyz ethnic
   values and ideals as the center of sovereignty held by some to be under
   threat. These events exemplify what we describe as the affective
   politics of sovereignty. We explore how emotion, in particular, serves
   as an important component of the constitution of sovereignty as both an
   international and popular institution. We explore how Kyrgyz identity
   has become intertwined with the sovereignty of Kyrgyzstan and clashes
   with Western multi-ethnic conceptions and practices.},

Abstract = {The 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement in Bosnia and Herzegovina instituted
   ethnic quotas between Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats: the three
   ``constituent peoples.{''} This institutionalization of ethnicity,
   criticized by some contemporary authors, is often seen as a creation of
   the peace agreement. Interestingly, several scholars deem such
   proportional representation a legacy from socialist times. But the
   existing literature lacks a historical perspective on the question of
   ethnic quotas. In addressing this issue, this paper reminds one of the
   existence of ethnic quotas, called the ``national key,{''} during
   socialist times. A deeper analysis of the ``national key{''} in the
   Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the ethnic quotas in
   the last two decades shows, interestingly, more differences than
   continuity. The article concludes that few similarities and more
   differences can be observed between the two periods, especially
   regarding the legal aspects of the ``national key,{''} in ideological
   justification and in the conceptions based on parity or proportional
   representation.},

Abstract = {A key feature of the rise of neoliberal politics and policy has been the
   progressive shift of risk from corporations and national states to the
   local government, individuals and households. In this article, we argue
   that, in the UK, `great risk shift' has not only been intensified by
   recession and austerity but has also been marked by the unevenness of
   the redistribution of risk and insecurity across scales and places, and
   between different types of household. In order to capture the
   differentiated nature of experiences and impacts of recession, risk and
   insecurity, this article first considers the spatial and temporal
   dynamics of recession and the great risk shift. It then goes on to
   localise and embed these dynamics within the city regions and local
   authorities of Bristol and Liverpool, drawing on a quantitative survey
   of 1,013 households, across a range of different household types. The
   survey was segmented geographically and by ten different household types
   using Ipsos-MORI's (ACORN) classification of residential neighbourhoods.
   Whilst the evolving crisis and subsequent austerity measure have been a
   `moving target' for cities, the local government and households, the
   household survey was undertaken in the two city regions in the winter of
   2011 and explored experiences and impacts since 2008. It will seek to
   demonstrate the nature, impact and `lived experience' of the `risk
   shift' during this period and consider the ongoing and broader
   implications for households, and national and local policymakers.},

Abstract = {This article addresses committee scrutiny undertaken through the three
   main UK devolved institutions (the Scottish Parliament, the National
   Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly). This is
   undertaken using a framework derived from scholarship about House of
   Commons select committees and a substantive comparative literature.
   Devolved committee scrutiny is thus compared and contrasted in relation
   to a three-phase analysis in terms of selection, evaluative and output
   elements.
   The findings are also discussed in relation to core elements of
   institutional theory - institutional path dependency, ideational path
   dependency, the logic of appropriateness and the logic of consequence.
   This connection is used to develop several testable theoretical
   propositions concerning committee scrutiny. Findings about UK devolved
   committee scrutiny (and also scrutiny undertaken through House of
   Commons select committees) are also related to scholarship about local
   government scrutiny in Britain and contrasts and similarities specified.
   Furthermore, some testable theoretical propositions are applied to
   British local scrutiny.},

Abstract = {In 2011, an amendment was introduced to the Swedish constitution to
   provide stronger protection for local self-government. This article
   seeks to explain this amendment in the light of the development of
   central-local relations towards multi-level governance (MLG). It
   explores the adaptation hypothesis, i.e. the developments in MLG are
   followed by an adjustment in constitutional policy that is influenced by
   subnational actors, through an empirical study of the most prominent
   Swedish subnational actor - the Swedish Association of Local Authorities
   and Regions (SALAR). The research showed that SALAR developed an agenda
   for the regulation of central-local relations in the constitution. SALAR
   was able to exert influence with this agenda by participating in the
   policy-making process prior to the amendment of the constitution. The
   research findings underscore that even though MLG per se has little to
   do with constitutional policy, it has consequences for such policy due
   to the role played by subnational actors.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the early stage of the Ukrainian ``sixtiers{''}
   movement as a semi-autonomous space of cultural expression that was
   tolerated by the authorities and defined, developed, and inhabited by
   young Ukrainian intellectuals. In contrast to present-day Ukrainian
   representations of the sixtiers as a force acting in opposition to the
   Soviet regime, the spatial angle employed here reveals an ambiguous
   relationship with official institutions. The Ukrainian Komsomol
   organization in particular appears to be both a controlling and an
   enabling agent that, together with the Writers' Union, provided meeting
   venues for the sixtiers until the mid-1960s. This complex symbiotic
   relationship continued even after some creative youth pioneered the
   first attempts to claim public space for cultural events without the
   authorities' permission. The cultural terrain inhabited by young
   Ukrainian intellectuals was not fully separate from mainstream Soviet
   Ukrainian culture or in opposition to it, although their vibrant
   cultural space also reached into a world of non-conformist culture
   unregulated by the state. A series of government crackdowns beginning in
   the mid-1960s dramatically shrank this open, ambivalent space of
   semi-free cultural expression, imposing firm boundaries and forcing
   intellectuals to make political choices.},

Abstract = {This article aims to analyse the extent to which metropolitan and
   provincial municipalities in Turkey take advantage of the opportunities
   offered by information and communications technologies to strengthen
   democracy and to evaluate the factors affecting the e-democracy adoption
   of municipalities in Turkey within the framework of spatial data
   analysis. In this context, this study tries to contribute distinctively
   to the local e-democracy literature by focusing on the investigation of
   whether there are any spatial effects on e-democracy adoption of
   municipalities in Turkey. The findings of our analysis show that while
   being the members of the same political party and geographical
   contiguity do not have any impact, the variables of size, status, budget
   and Internet penetration have impacts on the level of e-democracy
   adoption of municipalities in Turkey.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes inter-cohort differences and intra-cohort changes
   in language proficiencies, use patterns and attitudes in a society
   undergoing a radical political and cultural transformation. My analysis
   focuses on Ukraine, a country with an asymmetrical bilingualism where
   the new independent state mildly promotes the titular language but the
   formerly dominant Russian maintains an active presence in most social
   domains and individual repertoires. While confirming earlier findings on
   the small scale of age differences, this study detects the end of the
   inter-cohort shift toward Russian. Another important finding is that the
   apparent continuity with a slow drift toward the titular language in
   Ukraine as a whole conceals two radically different developments in the
   two geographical ``halves{''} of the country. The study demonstrates an
   advantage of combining a synchronic analysis of inter-cohort differences
   with a diachronic analysis of intra-cohort changes.},

Abstract = {The paper examines how the tiny ethno-cultural group of Setos constructs
   its identity in the multicultural context. The study examines the
   validity of three acculturation models and tests earlier findings on the
   relationship between identity and well-being. The results suggest that
   Setos have clearly adopted a multicultural identity strategy while not
   merging different identities, and that they have managed to separate the
   material wellbeing from the pride of their identity. Despite its small
   size and peripheral location, the Setos' way to preserve their identity
   in a constantly changing context is an interesting lesson for other
   indigenous groups, and also for bigger neighbors.},

Title = {The Flypaper Effect: Do Political Institutions Affect Danish Local
   Governments' Response to Intergovernmental Grants?},

Number = {4},
Pages = {534-552},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {Despite a large number of empirical studies on the flypaper effect, it
   remains disputed whether the effect exists and to what extent it is
   asymmetrical. The flypaper effect suggests that intergovernmental grants
   tend to result in higher increases in public expenditures than a similar
   increase in citizens' private income would have led to. An asymmetrical
   effect exists when the fiscal response differs depending on whether
   grants are increased or decreased. By considering political institutions
   that moderate the effect of intergovernmental grants, this article
   offers a theoretical explanation that accounts for the mixed empirical
   evidence. The local response to intergovernmental grants is tested using
   a reform of the Danish intergovernmental grant scheme in 2007. In line
   with the expectation, the article finds a strong asymmetrical effect,
   but more surprisingly, this effect is found both when subnational budget
   institutions are centralised and when they are fragmented.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is twofold: to provide a critical account of
   the Pitesti experiment and its significance within the history of
   Romanian Communism and to examine current public disputes relative to
   memorializing the Pitesi experiment that concern issues of legitimacy,
   collective memory, and identity construction. The main argument pursued
   here is that within the recent postcommunist politics of memory, one
   major prevailing trend is to reincorporate a nationalist ideology within
   a postcommunist rhetoric. This leads to the conclusion that such
   mnemonic practices indicate a strong relationship between collective
   memory and political culture.},

Abstract = {The article explores the development of football in interwar Romania,
   stressing its role in the dissemination and grounding of Romanian
   nationalism. I show how, due to its modular form, the game of football
   was deeply involved in the efforts of centralizing, territorializing and
   naturalizing the Romanian nation-state of the interwar period. The
   founding of the leading Romanian sports club at the University of Cluj
   and the selection of the national representative for the Paris Olympics
   of 1924, in conjunction with the institutional infrastructure developed
   to nationally regulate and control the game, are used to present the
   acute tensions between local/regional and national aspirations and
   projects, with a strong ethnic component, that have shaped the history
   of the game in Romania. I argue that the increasing calls for the full
   Romanianization of football in the 1930s have their immediate roots in
   these tensions and frictions.},

Abstract = {Nation-building is a process which is often contested, not just among
   different ethnicities within a nation-state, but also among the titular
   ethnic majority. This article explores the contested nature of the
   nation-building process in post-Soviet Kazakhstan through examining
   cinematic works. Utilizing a post-modern perspective which views nations
   and national identity as invented, imagined and ambivalent it identifies
   four discursive strands within recent post-Soviet Kazakh cinema
   pertaining to nationhood and national identity (ethno-centric, civic,
   religious and socioeconomic). Rather than viewing government-sponsored
   efforts of identity formation in cinema as a top-down process in which
   the regime transmits its version of nationhood and identity, the
   discursive strands revealed in this article illustrate there are varying
   understandings of what constitutes the nation and national identity in
   Kazakh cinematic works. Furthermore, the strand which focuses on the
   socioeconomic tensions of modern nation-building in Kazakhstan uncovers
   how film is used as a site for dissent and social critique of
   Kazakhstan's modern political condition. What the article illuminates is
   how discourses related to nation-building can be both competing and
   complementary and that nation-building is a fluid and transgressive
   process in which among the titular majority there is no fixed
   unambiguous understanding of nationhood and national identity.},

Abstract = {Ruling elites can use the symbolism of major dams to gain legitimacy and
   bolster a sense of national identity and patriotism. The Rogun Dam in
   Tajikistan is a gigantic hydraulic infrastructure that if and when
   finished will be the tallest in the world, allowing the country to gain
   energy self-sufficiency. Furthermore, by projecting an image of progress
   and success, such a structure can contribute to creating and
   strengthening a nationalistic discourse even before its completion. This
   paper begins by introducing the concept of nation-building in relation
   to the Central Asian setting and then connects it with the literature
   exploring the interplay between water and power. Subsequently, the focus
   moves to the Rogun project, illustrating the main traits of the Rogun
   ideology and outlining the rhetorical legitimation strategies used by
   the Tajik government to frame the dam as a nationally cohesive and
   patriotic project.},

Abstract = {In China, `the centre decides and the local pays' means the central
   government decides on policies but requires its local subordinates to
   provide the financial resources. The politics of this practice implies
   that local government has to take different strategies to cope with the
   unfunded mandates with various consequences. As an empirical study
   framed by Niskanen's rational choice theory and Dunleavy's
   `bureau-shaping' model, this paper examines how the unfunded mandates
   impact local government behaviour. Its main focus is the question of how
   the local officials respond, the extent to which they comply or resist
   and the techniques they use to adapt to these mandates. This paper finds
   when deciding how to pay the bill for the centre, local officials have
   to take a number of principles into consideration. They need to stick to
   the people-orientated principle and to finance money for salaries and
   operation to the extent that they can; they also have to see if the
   mandates are strictly implemented or popular among local people.},

Abstract = {A framework to assess the financial performance of local governments is
   presented in this paper. The framework adapts and extends an earlier
   methodology and includes new financial performance measures reflecting
   considerations in the literature of appropriate financial performance
   measures for local government units. Using 14 indicators, five broad
   financial performance measures are employed, assessing liquidity,
   autonomy, operating performance, collection efficiency and solvency. We
   apply this numerical and narrative analysis of key financial performance
   indicators to Ireland's primary local authorities during the recent boom
   and bust period. Through application of this financial performance
   measurement framework using a benchmarking methodology, we identify
   relatively strong and weak local authority financial performance. We
   recommend the adoption of this framework as an extension to the annual
   financial statements of local authorities to help users more easily
   assess financial performance and to distinguish between relatively
   well-performing councils and those showing signs of financial trouble,
   with a view to early identification of councils in financial difficulty.},

Abstract = {This article examines the divide between national and local collective
   memory in Poland and investigates the role of ``memory activists{''} in
   mediating and exploiting this divide. It narrows its focus to the ethnic
   cleansing of Poles by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) from 1943 to
   1944 and the forced relocation of Ukrainians in Poland, Operation
   Vistula, in 1947. It surveys local and national newspapers to understand
   competing interpretations and analyzes what incidents (e.g. protests,
   disputes, commemorations, reenactments, etc.) related to these events
   take place in local communities. It highlights the many actors, ``memory
   activists,{''} and associations involved in pushing specific, often
   ahistorical, interpretations of these events motivated by political
   gain, careerism, or personal conviction. It uses the theoretical works
   of Maurice Halbwachs and Karl Mannheim to effectively distinguish
   between local and national phenomenon and to elucidate the various
   nuances of collective memory.},

Abstract = {In 1946, in the Southern Urals, construction of the Union of Soviet
   Socialist Republics first plutonium plant fell to the GULAG-Narodnyi
   Komissariat Vnutrennikh Del (NKVD). The chief officers in charge of the
   program - Lavrentii Beria, Sergei Kruglov, and Ivan Tkachenko - had been
   pivotal figures in the deportation and political and ethnic cleansing of
   territories retaken from Axis forces during WWII. These men were charged
   with building a nuclear weapons complex to defend the Soviet Union from
   the American nuclear monopoly. In part thanks to the criminalization and
   deportation of ethnic minorities, Gulag territories grew crowded with
   foreign nationals and ethnic minorities in the postwar years. The NKVD
   generals were appalled to find that masses of forced laborers employed
   at the plutonium construction site were members of enemy nations. Beria
   issued orders to cleanse the ranks of foreign enemies, but construction
   managers could not spare a single healthy body as they raced to complete
   their deadlines. To solve this problem, they created two zones: an
   interior, affluent zone for plutonium workers made up almost exclusively
   of Russians; and anterior zones of prisoners, soldiers, ex-cons, and
   local farmers, many of whom were non-Russian. The selective quality of
   Soviet ``nuclearity{''} meant that many people who were exposed to the
   plant's secret plutonium disasters were ethnic minorities, people whose
   exposures went unrecorded or under-recorded because of their
   invisibility and low social value.},

Abstract = {Focusing on the development of travel between the borderlands of Ukraine
   and Soviet satellite states in Eastern Europe, this article explores
   what it meant to be Soviet outside the Russian core of the USSR between
   the mid-1950s and the mid-1980s. The cautious opening of the Soviet
   border was part of a larger attempt to find fresh sources of popular
   support and enthusiasm for the regime's ``communist{''} project. Before
   the Prague Spring of 1968 in particular, official policies and
   narratives of travel thus praised local inhabitants who crossed the
   Soviet border for supposedly overcoming age-old hatreds to build a
   brighter future in Eastern Europe. By the 1970s, however, smuggling and
   cultural consumption discredited the idea of ``internationalist
   friendship.{''} This encouraged residents of Ukraine to speak and write
   about the continuing importance of the Soviet border. The very idea of
   Sovietness was defined in national terms, as narratives of travel
   emphasized that Soviet citizens were inherently different from
   ethno-national groups in the people's democracies. Eastern Europe thus
   emerged as an ``other{''} that highlighted the Soviet character of
   territories incorporated into the USSR after 1939, helping to obscure
   western Ukraine's troubled past and leading to the emergence of new
   social hierarchies in the region.},

Abstract = {Partnerships in public service delivery have received attention from
   researchers and policy-makers since the late 1990s. However, there has
   been less research on one critical mechanism to aide partnership
   processes: multi-agency protocols. The study investigated the role of
   protocols in the creation of multi-agency partnerships in transition
   support services for young people with intellectual disabilities. We
   found that protocols can clarify roles for multi-agency partnerships and
   may assist in clearly allocating tasks and responsibilities to
   individual agencies. They can be useful for services insofar as they
   identify clear procedures and practices for each organisation. Early
   involvement in protocol formulation may, for example, lead to better
   working knowledge of protocol contents amongst staff. However, in our
   case, respondents were disappointed that formulating and implementing
   partnership protocols failed to overcome entrenched professional
   divisions, or to address the exclusion of some important stakeholders.},

Title = {A tale of two statues in Astana: the fuzzy process of nationalistic city
   making},
Journal = {NATIONALITIES PAPERS-THE JOURNAL OF NATIONALISM AND ETHNICITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {383-398},
Abstract = {In the summer of 2009, statues stood leaning in a yard, beyond
   Independence Square in Astana. The situation was incongruous and
   constituted an enigma: Why were these monuments left alone in shambles?
   This paper argues that nationalistic city making is more of a resource
   for people involved in patron/client relationships and a contingent
   outcome, rather than a planned strategy. This case study, drawing on
   evidence gathered through qualitative methods with artists and
   urban-planners, hence reveals a paradox: in Kazakhstan, there surely is
   a state incentive to produce nationalistic symbols, but in the absence
   of a mid-term strategy, city-planners and the people they work with
   improvise in order to answer local authorities' demands, and use this
   opportunity to advance their own interests. Hence, the political
   production of space is considered a fuzzy process, contingent on the
   agency of multiple subjects, and treated as an outcome of Foucauldian
   ``micro-physics of power.{''} But even though it is erratic, it still
   creates the built environment which will be reacted upon by citizens.
   Finally, this sociopolitical perspective on nationalistic urbanism
   demonstrates that Astana's scenery is a fuzzy ``landscape of power{''}
   instituting an erratic Kazakhstani regime, based on the political
   economy of symbolic goods.},

Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {After two decades of public sector outsourcing, debates for
   reintegration of services back into the public sector have emerged.
   However, so far outsourcing remains prevalent and reintegration is
   sparsely utilised. An in-depth analysis of the reorganisation of public
   transport in a Norwegian county, Sor-Trondelag, provides three key
   reasons as to why there is an `outsourcing upside'. Firstly, existing
   structures limit available alternatives for legislators, thereby making
   reintegration of public services back into public hands difficult.
   Secondly, under certain conditions competitive tendering may enhance
   political steering and thus make outsourcing politically desirable.
   Thirdly, the establishment of a quasi-autonomous agency allows the
   opportunity for economies of scale through cooperation with other
   counties and cities, thereby improving co-ordination in the public
   transport system.},

Abstract = {The Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) was created for strengthening the
   development of a European soul. But generally speaking, one can say it
   has been used as a tool for nation-branding, and as a means for Central
   and Eastern countries to ``return{''} to Europe, in particular after the
   fall of their Communist regimes. In the difficult social, economic,
   political, and historical context of the Republic of Moldova nowadays,
   the ESC furthermore allows the discursive construction of the nation and
   the building of a particular self. Accordingly, based on a method
   inspired by the Critical Discourse Analysis methodology applied to three
   local newspapers, the research demonstrates how the ESC acts as a sound
   box when building the Moldovan self. The Moldovan identity that emerges
   from the articles seems to be an identity in crisis which proves much
   different from the usual political constructions of the nation. This
   bottom-up identity put forward by journalists has indeed to be related
   to the twofold crisis in which Moldova is at the moment: social and
   economic, on the one hand, and linked to a permanent struggle between a
   separate Moldovan or an integrated Romanian identity, on the other.},

Abstract = {This article considers the role the Soviet Union's western borderlands
   annexed during World War II played in the evolution of Soviet politics
   of empire. Using the Baltic Republics and Western Ukraine as case
   studies, it argues that Sovietization had a profound impact on these
   borderlands, integrating them into a larger Soviet polity. However,
   guerrilla warfare and Soviet policy-making indirectly led to these
   regions becoming perceived as more Western and nationalist than other
   parts of the Soviet Union. The Baltic Republics and Western Ukraine
   differed in their engagement with the Western capitalist world.
   Different experiences of World War II and late Stalinism and contacts

Journal = {NATIONALITIES PAPERS-THE JOURNAL OF NATIONALISM AND ETHNICITY},

Abstract = {How effective is Russian state television in framing the conflict in
   Ukraine that began with the Euromaidan protests and what is its impact
   on Russian Internet users? We carried out a content analysis of Dmitrii
   Kiselev's ``News of the Week{''} show, which allowed us to identify the
   two key frames he used to explain the conflict - World War II-era
   fascism and anti-Americanism. Since Kiselev often reduces these frames
   to buzzwords, we were able to track the impact of these words on
   Internet users by examining search query histories on Yandex and Google
   and by developing quantitative data to complement our qualitative
   analysis. Our findings show that much of what state media produces is
   not effective, but that the ``fascist{''} and antiAmerican frames have
   had lasting impacts on Russian Internet users. We argue that it does not
   make sense to speak of competition between a ``television party{''} and
   an ``Internet party{''} in Russia since state television has a strong
   impact in setting the agenda for the Internet and society as a whole.
   Ultimately, the relationship between television and the Internet in
   Russia is a continual loop, with each affecting the other.},

Abstract = {The striking affinities that have developed between radical-conservative
   movements in Western Europe and Russia since the end of the Cold War
   have been widely noted. This essay considers these affinities through
   the example of the Soviet historian and geographer Lev Nikolaevich
   Gumilev (1912-1992). It argues that Gumilev and the European New Right
   developed perspectives that were highly comparable, founded on similar
   principles, and articulated through similar images and allusions. Yet
   despite the powerful resonances in terms of basic concepts and
   theoretical orientation, there were nonetheless deep differences in
   terms of the conclusions regarding the practical implications for their
   respective societies that Gumilev and the Europeans deduced from these
   principles.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes violent practices - dedovshchina - among the
   recruits of the Soviet Armed Forces, which became commonplace during the
   late socialist period, but were not publicly discussed until the advent
   of glasnost'. By focusing on individual men's testimonies, it intends to
   capture male experiences and interpretations of this phenomenon as well
   as the significance and value they attached to it in the context of
   their individual life scripts. The study is based on 20 theme-oriented
   interviews with young, recently demobilized men conducted in the
   framework of a sociological project in 1988/1989. They are interpreted
   with the help of a narrative analysis. Having experienced various forms
   of violence as army soldiers, the young men's narratives embraced
   dedovshchina as a functional tool of self-organization within the
   otherwise dysfunctional military institution and stressed the values of
   endurance and maturation central to male identity. Considering the
   unprecedented concurrent discussion of dedovshchina in the Soviet media,
   which scandalized the phenomenon and raised moral and political
   questions concerning the state's failure to secure the physical
   wellbeing of its soldiers, these testimonies attain additional
   significance. They demonstrate attempts to contest the stories and
   interpretation generated by the media and to reassert individual
   morality in the face of personal involvement in practices now condemned
   as wrong.},

Abstract = {The Northern Way (NW) was a pan-regional, multi-level initiative between
   three English northern regions, set up to promote economic growth and
   close a 30 pound billion output gap. Some limited research on progress
   prior to 2006 exists, but hardly anything about achievements between
   2008 and closure in 2011. This paper redresses the limitations with data
   from existing evaluations and key stakeholder interviews. Findings
   reveal that partners developed good collaborative working, gathered
   robust data on critical economic and social issues, and learnt much
   during 2004-2008. Between 2008 and 2011, activities were refocused on a
   narrower set of critical priorities and partners developed real policy
   learning and became a credible voice for the Northern regions. After
   closure, it became evident that NW left a `vacuum' as an effective
   coordinator of evidence and views from three Northern regions. Many
   issues that it sought to address remain as critical today as they did
   when it was created.},

Abstract = {Northern Ireland is emerging from violence but still living with
   conflict. The recent flags protests in Belfast represent a challenge to
   public administration to transcend the contested politics of local
   government in Northern Ireland and to navigate a way through a symbolic
   legacy issue. This article draws on a longitudinal hermeneutic analysis
   of empirical research conducted on Northern Ireland local government
   over a decade, where these concerns dominated much debate. Additional
   analysis of the research findings reveals broader problems applicable to
   any public administration faced with managing situations in which good
   governance in public participation and procedural correctness operates
   alongside fundamental political disagreement and distrust. These
   conclusions are particularly pertinent for local administrations in
   societies transitioning from conflict.},

Title = {Biased Budgeting in the Public Sector: Evidence from Italian Local
   Governments},
Journal = {LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {41},
Number = {6},
Pages = {819-840},
Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to analyse, in terms of presence,
   determinants and purposes, the misrepresentation of expected revenues
   during budget formulation and the misrepresentation of actual revenues
   during budget execution. To this end, we use sixyear panel data from
   Italian municipalities with populations above 15,000. Our results
   suggest that overestimations of current revenues are more frequent than
   underestimations, during both budget formulation and budget execution.
   In terms of determinants, our results highlight the impact on revenue
   misrepresentation of both political orientation and fiscal stress.
   Finally, in terms of purposes, we show that revenue underestimation
   during budget formulation and revenue overestimation during budget
   execution may contribute to the formation of surpluses. The former, in
   particular, may allow mayors to create a `war chest' in non-election
   years, which can then be used to increase net borrowing on the eve of
   elections.},

Journal = {LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUDIES},

Volume = {41},
Number = {5},
Pages = {695-712},
Abstract = {Proponents of Gov2.0 claim that it offers the potential to improve the
   relationship between the citizen and state. Whether this potential can
   be realised depends in part on how new web-based technologies are
   implemented. Local government officials and politicians are important
   actors in this process, yet we know little about how they view Gov2.0.
   This paper applies Q-methodology to a sample of English local government
   actors to generate new data and fill this gap in our knowledge. Four
   frames of reference within this population are revealed: Sunlight on
   Government, Cautious Crowdsourcers, Gov1.0 and Platform Providers. The
   paper concludes that while there is general agreement that technology
   will be a driver of change, and that local government should adapt,
   there is no clear agreement as to the nature of reform.},

Abstract = {Compared with other service areas, spending on local government has
   suffered particularly large cuts under the austerity measures of the
   Coalition government in England since 2010. This article provides
   detailed evidence from three London boroughs as to the impacts of these
   cuts. Following an analysis of the scale and distribution of the cuts,
   we describe how local authorities have responded, utilising categories
   of efficiencies, reinvestment and retrenchment. We then address the
   extent to which these responses demonstrate local authority resilience.
   We find that the boroughs have demonstrated, in the period covered, a
   capacity to `bounce forward' from the external shock of the cuts,
   corresponding to a concept of `resilience as transformation'. However,
   we conclude that a broader notion of resilience is also needed, taking
   into account not only the nature of organisational responses but also
   the extent of their capacity to support the needs of residents, which a
   focus on transformation may too easily obscure.},

Abstract = {The transformative potential that has come to be associated with
   networking in all areas of social, economic and political life, not
   least initiatives designed to tackle urban deprivation, is premised upon
   the idea that better outcomes prevail when state, market and civil
   society actors work together in partnership to agree and implement
   change. Such a perspective is informed by two underlying and related
   assumptions; first, an understanding of democracy as being essentially
   deliberative in nature; second, an understanding of social and political
   change as being essentially consensus based. An agonistic model and
   alternative explanation questioning these assumptions and the
   `transformative' claims made on behalf of partnership is presented in
   this article. In contrast to what is termed a `neo-liberal orthodox'
   approach an alternative interpretation of regeneration located within a
   radical conceptualisation of civil society is proposed. Regeneration, it
   is argued, is better conceptualised in terms of contestation between
   state, market and third-sector interests with better outcomes for
   communities prevailing when third-sector actors develop the legitimacy
   and power to engage politically within the context of a contested public
   sphere.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the effect of campaign spending on the individual
   result of party candidates in the Belgian local elections. An analysis
   of data concerning the 2012 local elections in the Flemish region shows
   that candidates who spend more in absolute terms or outspend their
   rivals (at the list and the municipality level) obtain a better result,
   even though the size of the effect is small. Contrary to what was found
   for national elections, there are indications that spending affects the

Abstract = {an imagined democracy more important than actual democracy for
   nation-building purposes? After 20 years of independence, Central Asian
   countries present a mixed bag of strong and weak states, consolidated
   and fragmented nations. The equation of nation and state and the
   construction of genuine nation states remains an elusive goal in all of
   post-Soviet Central Asia. This paper examines the role that electoral
   politics has played in nation-state formation. We argue that electoral
   processes have been central to attempted nation-state building processes
   as part of efforts to legitimize authoritarian regimes; paradoxically in
   those few countries where (for brief periods) partial democratization
   actually occurred, elections contributed, at least in the short term, to
   nation-state fragmentation.},

Abstract = {The development of the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine, located in
   Mongolia's South Gobi province, promises to rebuild the nation after two
   decades of economic and social instabilities following the 1990
   revolution. While the company promotes the mine as the teleological
   solution to Mongolia's development, the state and public remain
   ambivalent, as concerns about a resource curse and Dutch Disease loom.
   In this paper, I argue that Oyu Tolgoi remains contested due to tensions
   between corporate and state actors as well as public concerns about the
   potential negative political, economic, and environmental effects of
   mining. Debates over the Oyu Tolgoi investment agreement negotiations
   and the immediate repercussions of the agreement signing reveal how the
   dual teleologies of building mineral nations crystallize in the
   neologism ``Mine-golia.{''} This paper begins to fill a gap in the
   literature on mineral nations which privileges the role of the state,
   leaving how corporations engage in nation-building underexamined.},

Abstract = {As the Soviet Union disintegrated and eventually dissolved in 1991, many
   of its peoples, both so-called titular nationalities and national
   minorities, put forth demands for independence or, at the very least,
   self-rule for territories that were said to represent the national
   patrimony. Among the many peoples who put forward such demands were
   Carpatho-Rusyns, who, together with fellow citizens of other national
   backgrounds, demanded autonomy or self-rule for the region (oblast) of
   Transcarpathia in far western Ukraine. This essay examines from a
   historical perspective the question of autonomy or self-rule for
   Carpatho-Rusyns and for all or part of the territory they inhabit,
   historic Carpathian Rus'. The autonomy question in Carpathian Rus' is
   hardly new, but one that goes as far back as 1848.},

Abstract = {The time investment in council duties and the roles adopted by local
   councillors in Britain have been studied extensively but rarely has
   research incorporated information about the type of area represented.
   This article combines individual-level survey responses from councillors
   with aggregate-level data that describe characteristics of the wards
   that elect each councillor. The survey data report each councillor's
   social and political characteristics, the average hours per week
   performing council duties and the range and frequency of activities
   undertaken. The ward-level data include a measure of relative social
   deprivation, electoral competitiveness and other features. The analysis
   shows that councillors representing relatively deprived areas spend more
   time on council activities than do councillors representing more
   affluent areas. The activities that councillors pursue, especially
   whether they are proactive or reactive towards constituents, relate to
   the ward context. Women and people that are retired from work also
   invest relatively more time in their work as councillors. These findings
   establish that assessments of what councillors do and the roles that
   they might adopt should take account of the types of ward being
   represented.},

Abstract = {This article traces the gradual accommodation of early socialists in
   Romania with the predicament of nationalism in the period between 1880
   and 1914. The attitudes of Romanian socialists evolved from initial
   ambivalence toward nationalism to staunch commitment to internationalism
   in the 1890s, and an inadvertent but unmistakable growing engagement
   with nationalism after the turn of the century. Locating socialism in
   the broader political and cultural debates of the time, this article
   argues that belonging to the Romanian public arena forced socialists to
   become increasingly more sensitive to the challenges of nationalism.
   Especially after 1900, the rise of very influential competing
   nationalist ideologies, as well as the necessity to address the Jewish
   question and the problem of ethnic Romanians living abroad, turned
   Romanian socialists into opponents but also implicit partners of
   dialogue in debates on nationalism. In the long run, however, socialists
   failed to find a persuasive alternative to nationalism and eventually
   resorted to the same language, concepts, and imagery they were so
   vocally dismissing. Engaging the popular nationalist trends of the time
   required socialists to reevaluate their own theoretical tenets and to
   put forward different, but essentially no less nationalistic, projects
   for the future.},

Abstract = {A defining characteristic of second-order elections is that voters base
   their decision on considerations that were developed for a different
   policy level. Therefore, this kind of elections does not contribute to
   the quality of democratic representation. Municipal elections are often
   considered as second-order elections. In this article, we use data from
   an exit poll (n = 4,591) held during the 2012 municipal elections in
   Belgium. Results suggest that although voters predominantly invoke local
   aspects as determining their vote choice, still three-quarters votes for
   the same party locally as for federal elections. Among voters who
   deviate from their federal party preference, knowing local candidates
   and concern about local policy issues are the main sources of deviation.
   The conclusion therefore is that local candidates do make a difference
   and contribute strongly to the salience of electoral decisions on the
   local level.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the importance of grass-root emergency response
   groups in emergency preparedness. Consistent with the Institutional
   Collective Action framework, we highlight key constraints associated
   with local government strategies of mutual resource exchange and
   barriers to intergovernmental collaboration. We examine local
   governments' emergency preparedness using survey data collected in the
   North Central Texas region. We employed a simple OLS analysis to
   determine mutual exchange and Poisson estimations on the likelihood of
   local governments receiving and providing external assistance. Findings
   showed that the presence of grass-root organisations in a jurisdiction
   is associated with emergency preparedness, highlighting the importance
   of norms of volunteerism. Local political institutions and participation
   in federally funded programmes also have an effect on local government
   decisions.},

Abstract = {This article endeavors to open a new critical space for Soviet studies
   and for nationalities studies more generally. Through analyses of recent
   trends in Soviet studies, the article dismantles the frequently used
   opposition between subjective and objective approaches to Soviet empire
   and suggests instead that truths and categories, whether considered
   ``subjective{''} or ``objective,{''} are constructed discursively,
   through legitimizing certain interpretive models over the others. The
   article also argues against disciplinary avoidance of ``what is{''}
   questions (e.g. ``what is a nation?{''}) and claims that an excessive
   concern for (re) producing essentialism should not hinder scholarly
   inquiry. Several new lines of inquiry for the study of the Soviet empire
   are suggested and also applicable in nationalities studies more
   generally: research on the role of symbolic violence in manufacturing
   consent and research concerning the role of affect in producing linkages
   between the performative life of a singular human being and the
   pedagogical discourse of a nation or empire. The article also offers an
   analysis of the Soviet Union as an empire in becoming and it advocates
   for postcolonial approaches within Soviet studies. The practical
   dimensions of Soviet rule are exemplified with data from the Baltic
   borderlands in the postwar years.},
