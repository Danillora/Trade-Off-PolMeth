Title = {CREATIVE SOCIALIST-FEMINIST SPACE: CREATING MOMENTS OF AGENCY AND

Abstract = {This article argues that creative socialist-feminist spaces, where
   art-based knowledge is created, can provide opportunities for creating
   new knowledge with emancipatory moments for those who are marginalized
   and have had marginalizing experiences. In so doing, commodified
   existence (Hennessey 2002) becomes disrupted through the emergence of
   new knowledge entwined with emotion. The outcome of this kind of
   endeavor includes transformational knowledge of self, relations of
   power, and a vision of alternative possibilities in relation to that
   knowledge. A relational aesthetic emerges where meaning for political
   change is co-created through the exploration of personal experience
   using an arts-based medium that itself creates community and political
   vision. These claims are made based on personal experience creating a
   digital-story exploring the first memories of having a racialized body
   constituted by racist slurs and from a discourse that disidentifies one
   from Canadian citizenship and belonging.},

Abstract = {Recently, there has been an increase in the number of scholars focusing
   on why voters around the world differ in their evaluations of electoral
   integrity. One group of scholars contends that perceived electoral
   integrity is determined by partisan status according to election
   results. Another group claims that individual perception of election
   quality is influenced by such political cues as institutional support
   for election management bodies. Although the two groups have developed
   this subject differently, they both underestimate the degree to which
   the election process affects electoral integrity. Based on the theory of
   procedural justice, this study argues that the more problems citizens
   see in the electoral process, the more negatively they tend to rate
   elections. An analysis of a public opinion survey conducted immediately
   after the December 2012 presidential election in South Korea provides
   credible evidence for our theoretical expectations and presents an
   important implication for elections of new democracies in a comparative
   perspective.},

Abstract = {This article argues for a reframing of the curriculum within the academy
   in order to make the academy more inclusive and more accessible to a
   diverse student body. Reframing the curriculum is seen as an aspect of
   decolonizing the university. Many questions emerge from this argument to
   include the following: What curriculum informs the education
   contemporary learners receive and how do they apply this to their
   academic and work lives? How do educators re-fashion their work as
   educators and also as learners to create more relevant understandings of
   what it means to be human and to determine what is human work? What are
   the limits and possibilities of visions of and counter and anti-visions
   to contemporary education? How do educators and learners challenge
   colonizing and imperializing relations within the academy and that
   influence the academy and its learners? How does curriculum become
   inclusive through teaching, research and graduate training and how does
   it make space for Indigeneity and multi-centric ways of knowing? How do
   we frame an inclusive, anti-racist, and anti-colonial global future and
   what is the work that is required to collectively arrive at that future?
   These complex questions, stimulated by my decolonizing curriculum work
   and experience, are engaged through the body of this article.},

Abstract = {This study explores the development and influence of visual media on
   social movement activism in Slovenia in the 1980s and in the new
   millennium. Because of the changes in the political context during these
   decades, we aimed to determine whether there were differences between
   the political posters displayed by selected Slovenian social movements
   during the 1980s and those in the new millennium. Acknowledging the
   shift in the type of regime, as well as the transition to democracy, we
   observed major milestones in the poster campaigns of social movements
   and the forces that influenced them. We identified four modes of protest
   in these poster campaigns among which the avant-gardist rationale in the
   1980s significantly influenced those in the new millennium. In addition
   to that, we found that the introduction of the principles of political
   marketing and political pluralism influenced the protest poster
   campaigns when the hiring of campaign professionals became affordable.
   Our findings indicate that contemporary modes of poster campaigns rely
   on financial and organisational resources, and they are characterized by
   the search for an ideological enemy of the state. Our findings are based
   on a content analysis of 116 protest posters that were collected using a
   purposive sampling of critical cases. The findings of this study offer
   original insights into the poster campaigns of social movements in the
   context of the transition from propaganda to political communication in
   a democratic society. The form of visual analysis applied in the study
   is original because it is conventionally employed in textual, and not
   visual analysis.},

Abstract = {Transnational actors (TNAs) are a part of the global social policy
   process. But questions of their roles and involvement in the process
   remain unanswered. Using a qualitative research to study Ghana's
   adoption of the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP), this
   article brings new evidence to light on how TNAs influence social
   policies in developing countries. Contrary to arguments that stress
   imposition as the main policy diffusion mechanism, it is shown here that
   TNAs combine multiple strategies including ideational, institutional,
   and material incentives to influence social policies in particular
   countries. As idea purveyors at the transnational level, TNAs are linked
   to the national policy process through their connections with
   policymakers and, more specifically, through policy discussions at
   regular sector working group meetings. From this perspective, ideas are
   shared and availability of support toward policy development is
   communicated.},

Abstract = {The award committee has chosen Paul Collier as the winner of the 2016
   Lewis Fry Richardson Award in particular in recognition of his
   contributions to the study of civil war. His famous paper on ``Greed and
   grievance in civil war{''} published with Anke Hoeffler in 2004, but
   circulating in draft form since the late 1990s-has been cited over 1000
   times in the Web of Science as of mid-July 2016, and has over 5000
   citations in Google Scholar. The jury also highlighted the key role of
   Collier's work reviving academic research on civil war in the late

Abstract = {This article offers an exploration of what it meant to move under
   ``cramped conditions{''} for African Americans and their compatriots
   during an era of often violent racial discrimination and segregation in
   the 1950s and 1960s in the USA. As the example of the Freedom Rides
   shows, these conditions included both moments of closure and entrapment
   determined by the rule of law as well as acts of resistance resulting
   from a century-long legacy of resistances. Particularly, I try to
   understand the complex ``constellations of mobility{''} as a fragile
   entanglement of the politics of movement, representations of movement,
   and the embodied practices of movement. This paper proposes an approach
   to mobility that takes both historical forms of mobilities and
   immobilities seriously. On the one hand, my analysis relates to
   regulatory power and technologies used by state and non-state actors in
   order to retain white privilege over issues of mobility during the
   period preceding and accompanying the Freedom Rides. On the other hand,
   I argue along the lines of ``mobility as resistance{''} by showing the
   strategies used to transgress written and unwritten laws and normative
   standards of the Jim Crow era.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to provide a platform to converse on
   barriers and challenges faced by three marginalised groups - women,
   blackminority ethnic (BME) groups, and students living with a disability
   - throughout the course of doctoral study in political science in the
   United Kingdom. Much of the literature devoted to inequalities in
   academia tends to focus on established academics already in a post; the
   experiences of PhD researchers as the future of the profession have
   largely been neglected. However, in order to understand the
   underrepresentation of structurally disadvantaged groups, more insight
   into what is taking place earlier in the career pipeline is necessary.
   Based on an online surveyand a small number of qualitative interviews,
   the article's findings are split into seven different themes, reflecting
   both challenges that are faced by all PhD researchers, such as financial
   pressures, as well as those such as isolation, institutional support,
   and perceptions of disadvantage, that were found to be much more
   pronounced among minority groups. The article is a preliminary
   reflective discussion that aims to start a broader conversation about
   equality and diversity experiences among PhD researchers across the
   discipline, not just in the UK but on a global scale.},

Title = {A difference of perspective? Maori Members of Parliament and te ao Maori
   in Parliament},

Abstract = {This article will aim to determine the form and place of te ao Maori in
   the New Zealand Parliament. The article will analyse the maiden speeches
   of 12 Maori Members of Parliament from across the political spectrum and
   from different Parliaments since the adoption of Mixed Member
   Proportional Electoral Systemin 1996, and will investigate their
   commitment to te ao Maori based on deductive and inductive discourse
   analysis. It seeks to determine the presence of Maori identity
   indicators, as well as to determine themes unique to the Maori political
   context. The election of the 51st New Zealand Parliament was noted as
   having the greatest representation of Maori of any parliament in New
   Zealand history. Of the 121 Members of Parliament, 26 identify as Maori
   or as having Maori heritage. However, while the number of Maori Members
   of Parliament has increased, this does not provide the full picture of
   Maori representation in Parliament. This article will ask `How do Maori
   Members of Parliament best represent te ao Maori in the New Zealand
   Parliament?'. The research considers how Maori Members of Parliament
   `represent' Maori in the debating chamber in Parliament, specifically,
   to what extent these Members of Parliament represent te ao Maori. This
   research also asks whether substantive representation of te ao Maori
   varies across the electorate types, Maori, general and list seats. The
   research seeks to provide qualitative analysis of the presence of te ao
   Maori in Parliament and which Members of Parliament most often represent
   a Maori worldview. Both descriptive and substantive representation
   provide the means for a minority perspective to be present within a
   parliament.},

Title = {Perceived electoral malfeasance and resentment over the election of
   Barack Obama},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {44},
Pages = {35-45},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Controversies over voting outcomes, and subsequent laws to seemingly
   curb irregularities, have led to increased scrutiny over the process of
   voting day activities. While studies find evidence that majorities
   perceive rampant fraud, the explanations for these opinions have mainly
   pointed to political predispositions, largely ignoring the influence of
   racial attitudes. We propose that contemporary opinions on electoral
   malfeasance are shaped by the context of a popularly elected African
   American president, Barack Obama, and subsequent racial resentments.
   Analyses of data from the 2010 Cooperative Congressional Election Study
   reveals that racial resentment significantly predicts higher perceiver
   electoral malfeasance, even after controlling for political
   predispositions. Surprisingly, significant racial resentment effects
   exist among both Obama and McCain supporters, and these effects are
   strongest among those who perceived Obama won because of his race. Our
   results highlight the hyper racialized spill-over effects into
   judgements about the political system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {As a concept, identity and security are deeply intertwined on many
   different levels. The relationship between identity and security evokes
   structural correlation and identity necessitates security. In this
   context, both the security of identity and the identity of the security
   are explored. The constructivist approach, which attaches significance
   to ``social construction{''} and ``interaction{''} in International
   Politics, claims that the meanings that are given by the traditional
   theories to the concepts of security and foreign policy must be
   reconsidered. This paper is an attempt to interpret the effect of
   identity perceptions on security as a means to avert conflicts and
   security threats. The aim is to provide an identity based explanation to
   security problems. In the study, Macedonia and Kosovo are chosen as case
   studies. The findings propose improved solutions to security problems
   and contribute knowledge applicable to other similar security threats.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We conduct a theoretical and empirical re-evaluation of move-the-median
   (MTM) models of Supreme Court nominations - the one theory of
   appointment politics that connects presidential selection and senatorial
   confirmation decisions. We develop a theoretical framework that
   encompasses the major extant models, formalizing the tradeoff between
   concerns about the location of the new median justice versus concerns
   about the ideology of the nominee herself We then use advances in
   measurement and scaling to place presidents, senators, justices, and
   nominees on the same scale, allowing us to test predictions that hold
   across all model variants. We find very little support for MTM theory.
   Senators have been much more accommodating of the president's nominees
   than MTM theory would suggest-many have been confirmed when the theory
   predicted they should have been rejected. These errors have been
   consequential. presidents have selected many nominees who are much more
   extreme than MTM theory would predict. These results raise serious
   questions about the adequacy of MTM theory for explaining confirmation
   politics and have important implications for assessing the ideological
   composition of the Court.},

Abstract = {The Republic's noble lie is widely read as an endorsement of political
   difference that opposes the democratic ideals of its Athenian setting.
   Once the text's exclusionary political realities and rhetorical
   structure are attended to, however, the passages no longer appear as the
   template for an essentialist politics or the act of political deception
   they are typically taken to be. What they do is lay bare the `artifice'
   (mechane) by which regimes - including classical Athens - produce
   membership status as a `natural' category. Plato presents the regulatory
   fiction that one's political `kind' (genos) expresses a pre given status
   as an open secret. Given the privileged awareness he affords the reader,
   the noble lie may be fruitfully read as revealing - not concealing -
   that the `natural' distinctions of an exclusionary citizenship politics
   are the effects of willful political power. This narrative strategy
   takes on specific significance in the context of the blood-based
   membership politics of Athens, which had its own noble lie. Accordingly,
   Plato's text is shown to provoke insights into questions of democratic
   difference usually assumed beyond its purview. The Republic is read as
   exposing the workings of an essentialist politics it is typically
   thought instead to originate and prescribe.},

Abstract = {The article explores the relationships between the political status of
   coordinating structures of participatory budgeting (PB) and the
   associative profile of civil society representatives in four Brazilian
   experiences. Our focus is to take into consideration the location of the
   coordination office of PB within the municipal government, the
   characteristics of the PB Council and the party affiliation of civil
   society councilors. The results show that the higher political status of
   PB at local government the more the council will be fought over and
   occupied by representatives affiliated to the incumbent political party.
   That is to say, a conflict occurs where the most organized groups
   channel their strategies to occupy the political space towards the PB.},

Abstract = {This article highlights a gap between a great deal of constitutional
   theory and a great deal of the practice of democratic
   constitution-making. Drawing on data from democratic national and state
   constitutions, we challenge the consensus among constitutional theorists
   that a central purpose of constitutionalism is the entrenchment (the
   fortification against future change) of broad principles. The empirical
   reality is that the majority of democratic constitutions today are
   subject to frequent revision, and are therefore ill-equipped to
   facilitate the entrenchment of their contents. To explore the logic of
   these unentrenched documents, we identify the historical periods in
   which different geographic regions moved away from highly entrenched
   constitutions, and we examine the political contexts of these
   transformations. We find that, in each context, constitution-makers were
   attempting to limit the discretion of constitutional interpreters and
   implementers by drafting highly specific texts and by updating them in
   response to continually changing circumstances.},

Abstract = {Does supranational identity have an independent effect on individuals'
   beliefs about culturally contested issues in their national systems?
   This article demonstrates that self-categorization in the supranational
   realm - a seemingly unrelated category to domestic value cleavages - has
   implications for individuals' views on cultural issues. Traditional
   theories of international norm diffusion focus almost exclusively on
   state-level interactions, but our findings provide further evidence to
   the existence of a more direct mechanism through which norms reach some
   citizens. A sense of identification with a supranational entity such as
   Europe makes citizens more likely to espouse the views and opinions
   promoted by supranational organizations. We use the European Values
   Study to examine whether supranational identity is associated with
   socially liberal preferences. Results from the multi-level models
   indicate that supranational identity exerts a systematic effect on
   attitudes toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights and
   gender equality. Additionally, while these effects are more consistent
   in EU member states, supranational identity exhibits a similar impact on
   social attitudes in non-EU countries such as those in the former Soviet
   Union.},

Abstract = {The jurisprudence position difference in common law systems and the
   written law among the sources of law requires the study of the
   jurisprudence role in the interpretation of the law, and its adaptation
   to the realities of society. In Iranian law, jurisprudence means
   identical judgments of prosecutors from additional resources and
   commentary, and accepting the fact that, it could create a legal rule
   seems unlikely. In France, with the approval of the separation of powers
   and criticizing the classical doctrine, it seemed unlikely, the
   jurisprudence has a legislative role, however, such an idea has been
   expanded with all law branches and it seems to be a balance between
   resources related to legislate on the one hand and jurisprudence, on the
   other hand. Since, the rules express the general rules and it is
   impossible to predict the detail in the legislative practically, it is
   jurisprudence that could provide interpretations consistent with
   realities and social requirements of the law, in a complementary and
   commentary role. In this paper, the relationship between jurisprudence
   and interpretation of the law, especially in cases where we face with
   the need to interpret the law and the effectiveness of position on the
   interpretation of the law and its adaptation with the realities of
   society by jurisprudence will be discussed. These matters are examined
   with the descriptive analysis method that shows the importance of them
   in highlighting the role of jurisprudence in the legal system.},

   the argument that MHP has always been a political party defending

   anti-political establishment party after June 2015 parliamentary
   elections due to the party's radical right ideology based on a strong

Abstract = {In spite of the importance of revolutionary sindicalism in the urban
   working-class world in Argentina and Brasil during the first decades of
   the 20th century, there are few studies focusing on this subject. Not
   surprisingly, one of his cardinal figures, Julio Arraga, has received
   even less attention. This article aims at exploring the production, life
   and work of Arraga, who had a central role in the expansion of
   revolutionary sindicalism in the Rio de La Plata, through the
   construction of a political biography based on his writings.},

Abstract = {In recent decades East Asia has become the center of global economic
   dynamism. Despite this, the region is home to a significant number of
   unresolved territorial disputes that threaten to undermine peace and
   stability. This article aims to synthesize the concepts of role-power
   gaps from Power Cycle Theory (PCT) and patterns of amity and enmity from
   Regional Security Complex Theory in an effort to increase their
   respective ability to determine the likelihood of peaceful transitions
   and stable relations in the region. The first section presents the main
   principles of PCT and how amenable the theory is to a synthesis with
   Regional Security Complex Theory. The second section assesses critical
   points in which the United States, Japan, China, and South Korea find
   themselves and how these can influence policymaking. The third section
   provides a brief overview of patterns of amity and enmity that
   characterize the relationship between these states. The fourth section
   synthesizes the critical points.},

Abstract = {A myriad of new tools have been integrated into participatory action
   research (PAR). This article reviews the role and effectiveness of
   Photovoice and Participatory Videos as tools for conducting PAR.
   Advocating for experimentation and innovation in research, the authors
   discuss the process of adapting new media and creative techniques to
   PAR. Although integrating new tools provides a big opportunity in PAR,
   the authors suggest that it is important not to get carried away by the
   tools, but rather maintain focus on the ethos and intention of PAR, and
   use any tool towards a more inclusive and profound way of understanding
   `research'.},

Abstract = {Studies on ``size and democracy{''} argue that smaller political units
   should exhibit higher voter turnout rates. Empirical tests largely
   confirm this assumption. In contrast, more complex analyses that
   integrate individual and contextual data arrive at inconclusive results
   with regard to Switzerland, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands. In
   order to reevaluate the relationship between municipality size and
   turnout, this article uses a pooled time series analysis to study seven
   local elections in all municipalities of the Austrian state of Salzburg
   (excluding the city of Salzburg) between 1979 and 2009. The multi-level
   analysis (non-hierarchical cross-classified model) that accounts for
   context effects provides new evidence that the size of the municipality
   has a negative impact on turnout rates. Above all, the interaction
   between the size of the municipalities and the degree of societal
   fractionalization appears to be a decisive factor.},

Abstract = {While the party decides theory explains the outcomes of past nomination
   battles for president, this year in the Republican presidential contest
   party insiders failed to anoint a standard bearer. Who decides when the
   party elites don't? In 2016, it was America's authoritarian voters. And
   their candidate of choice, Donald Trump, is anathema to party leaders. I
   argue that Trump's rise is in part the result of authoritarian voters'
   response to his unvarnished, us-versus-them rhetoric. The failure of
   Republican Party insiders to coalesce behind one candidate opened the
   door for Trump. Authoritarian-driven partisan polarization (Hetherington
   and Weiler 2009), increasing fear of real and imagined threats, and
   terrorist incidents abroad and at home provided the fuel for Trump's
   campaign. And Trump's message and manner ignited that fuel, propelling
   him to the Republican nomination for president.},

Abstract = {Does the inclusion of rebel parties into the post-conflict political
   process help contribute to peace after the end of conflict? In this
   article we examine whether the transformation of rebel groups into
   political parties actually leads to the development of a durable peace
   after a civil war. Examining the likelihood of recurrence of civil wars
   in a country and recurrence of conflict in government-rebel group dyads
   after a settlement, we find that the inclusion and participation of
   former rebel parties in national government has an important impact on
   the likelihood of a durable post-settlement peace. Most importantly, not
   excluding major rebel parties from access to governing institutions is
   the most important factor in promoting post-conflict peace.},

Abstract = {This article explores recent proposals to deal with the past in Northern
   Ireland. Focusing, in particular, on the 2014 Stormont House Agreement,
   I argue that it is possible to begin to discern a movement within policy
   design to respond proactively to what I term a new politics of
   storytelling. This consists of an emphasis on testimony-work as a means
   of dealing with unresolved legacies relating to the Troubles. I suggest
   that that new politics lies at the centre of the proposed legislation
   but that it could give rise to a range of potential unintended
   consequences. An alternative to dealing with the past is also contained
   in the legislation based on historical and forensic methodologies that
   could act as a counterweight to those problems that I associate with the
   storytelling approach.},

Abstract = {Few empirical studies suggest that fictional stories can influence
   political opinions. Nonetheless, in this study I demonstrate the
   relevance of Harry Potter consumption to oppositional attitudes toward
   Donald Trump and his worldview. Using multivariate observational models
   and panel data from 2014 to 2016, results suggest that the lessons of
   the Harry Potter series have influenced levels of opposition to punitive
   policies and support for tolerance of groups considered outside the
   American mainstream. Further, they predict public reactions to Donald
   Trump above and beyond their influence on policies consistent with his
   views.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the history of a Chilean coastal community's
   organizing to prevent the construction of a sewage pipe to dump
   industrial cellulous waste into the sea. This sewage pipe would be
   constructed by one of the largest cellulose producers in the world, and
   one of the most powerful economic groups in Chile (ARAUCO-Angelini). I
   analyze the strategies of resistance developed by the Mapuche-Lafkenche
   in opposition to the aggression of extractive capitalism, which in the
   current process of neoliberal globalization, revives historic patterns
   of racial dispossession against indigenous peoples. I argue that one of
   the main effects of the dispute has been the resurgence of new Mapuche
   political identities, which develop concepts of autonomy as daily
   construction, confronting the new forms of regulation of indigenous
   populations deployed by the state and capital.},

Abstract = {DThis article deals with the reaction of the Geisel administration to
   the nuclear nonproliferation policy of the Gerald Ford presidency
   (1974-1977). The Ford administration was forced, due to changes in the
   international conjuncture (first oil shock and Indian nuclear test of
   1974) and the internal pressure he faced (from the Congress and civil
   society), to revise the US non-proliferation policy from a lenient
   position towards a posture of confrontation and friction. This change of
   stance affected the relationship with Brazil, because the Brazilian
   Military Dictatorship considered this new posture as an American
   interference. Besides, this changing US position came at a delicate
   moment when Brazil had just signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with
   West Germany in 1975. The Government Ford showed his suspicions towards
   this deal, because it could represent a risk of nuclear proliferation
   since Brazil would have access to advanced nuclear technology, though
   still an experimental one. Firstly, there will be a digression on the
   origins of the Brazilian nuclear program and the political situation in
   Brazil during that period. Subsequently, using sources (chiefly
   diplomatic) of American and Brazilian archives we expected to track the
   relationship between Brazil and the United States during that period,
   demonstrating the changing attitude of the United States and identifying
   what was the Brazilian reaction to it. Finally, we conclude that the
   changing nuclear non-proliferation policy of the Ford administration
   anticipated some of the features that would be characteristic of its
   successor, Jimmy Carter, whose nonproliferation policy was a factor of
   friction and disagreement between Brazil and United States, more intense
   than had been during the Ford administration. Moreover, the US
   non-proliferation policy at that time may had been a preponderant factor
   for the Brazilian Government decision in 1979 to start a parallel and
   nuclear program conducted by the military.},

Abstract = {This article challenges the narrowly founded but untroubled consensus
   about the alleged benefits of the Conservative government's devolution
   programme. It suggests that too much attention has been paid to
   purported benefits and too little regard to the potential risks, and
   draws attention to international evidence that suggests that the
   distribution of the benefits of devolution is crucially dependent on its
   design. It critically examines the case for the currently offered model
   of devolution and finds the underpinning economic model and limited
   forms of democratic accountability are likely to produce regressive
   social outcomes and the reinforcement of existing local elites. It calls
   for a wider public debate and fuller democratic scrutiny of the model of
   devolution on offer.},

Title = {We are all denizens now: on the erosion of citizenship},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {20},
Number = {6-7},
Pages = {679-692},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article makes a contribution to the general theory of citizenship.
   It argues that there is a need for a supplementary concept of
   denizenship' to illustrate changes to and erosion of postwar social
   citizenship as famously described by T H Marshall. The first aim is to
   construct a more theoretically developed idea of what the concept of a
   denizen' means in sociological terms. In its conventional meaning, this
   term describes a group of people permanently resident in a foreign
   country, but only enjoying limited partial rights of citizenship. I
   label this Denizenship Type 1. By contrast, Denizenship Type 2 refers to
   the erosion of social citizenship as citizens begin to resemble denizens
   or strangers in their own societies. The argument then is that there is
   a general convergence between citizenship and denizenship. As such,
   Denizenship Type 2 provides a possible supplement to the various terms
   that have recently been proposed, such as flexible citizenship,
   semi-citizenship, or precariat to describe the attenuated social and
   economic status of citizens under regimes of austerity and diminished
   rights and opportunities. As the life chances of citizens decline, they
   come to resemble denizens. One illustration of this basic transition is
   to be found in the changing nature of taxation. This observation also
   allows me simply to observe that the political economy of taxation has
   been somewhat neglected in the recent literature on citizenship where
   questions about identity and subjectivity have become more dominant. As
   a result of these socio-economic changes, the modern citizen is
   increasingly merely a denizen with thin, fragmented, and fragile social
   bonds to the public world. The corrosion of the social, economic,
   political, and legal framework of citizenship offers a new slogan: we
   are all denizens now.'},

Abstract = {Maps of electoral results across the Federal Republic of Germany show
   remarkable stability over the postwar period. While historical social
   cleavages are the foundation of western Germany's stable electoral
   geography, in the five eastern states crucial events in 1989 and 1990,
   largely independent of social structural factors, established particular
   trajectories of party formation that shaped parties' electoral success.
   Drawing on interviews with political elites and archival documents, I
   use a critical juncture analysis approach to explain the temporally and
   spatially contingent nature of party formation processes in eastern
   Germany after 1989. This analysis shifts debates about party formation
   from the questions of when and why, to how and where parties form, while
   also explaining the origin and persistence of territorialized party
   systems.},

Abstract = {Resume Cet article suggere de saisir les politiques publiques comme le
   fruit de phenomenes hegemoniques. Cette perspective apprehende la
   transmission des cadres d'interpretation comme etant un phenomene
   intrinsequement conflictuel. Ce faisant, nous esperons depasser une
   difficulte commune aux etudes qui mettent l'accent sur les idees et les
   discours : le fait de negliger les luttes cognitives et symboliques que
   livrent des acteurs aux positions asymetriques, donc les conflits qui
   les opposent. Nous suggerons de penser l'hegemonie a la lumiere des
   debats sur les affaires publiques, apres quoi nous illustrons cette
   perspective a partir de l'exemple des politiques agro-environnementales
   anglaise, francaise et hongroise. La perspective proposee dans cet
   article permet, de maniere generale, de jeter un regard original sur la
   production de l'ordre politique.
   Abstract This paper proposes the analysis of policies as the result of
   hegemonic phenomena. This perspective understands the diffusion of
   frames of reference as a phenomenon that is intrinsically conflictual.
   In so doing, our aim is to work around one of the main problems in the
   existing literature focused on the role of ideas and discourses: it
   tends to neglect the cognitive and symbolic struggles in which agents,
   who possess unequal resources, are engaged. We suggest analyzing the
   organization of a hegemonic phenomenon by focusing on the debates
   related to agri-environmental policies in England, France and Hungary.
   Generally, this article contributes an original outlook on the
   production of political order.},

Abstract = {In his near quarter century on the Court, Justice Clarence Thomas has
   written extensively on significant issues such as equal protection,
   religion, and federalism. But in the Court's spring 2015 term, Thomas
   for the first time wrote substantively on the constitutional separation
   of powers. For Thomas, the Constitution understood government to possess
   three distinct types of powerlegislative, executive, and judicialand
   then constructed the three branches to each exercise its vested power
   type. I consider how Thomas defined the three powers, as well as how he
   saw the Constitution creating each branch with the qualities needed to
   exercise the power given it. All along, I show how Thomas connected
   separation of powers to the Constitution's larger goal: protecting
   individual liberty. I then conclude with limitations to Thomas's view
   and how it, while not achieving total victory, may aid in increasing the
   Court's fidelity to constitutional norms.},

Title = {Quick counts in the Mexican presidential elections: A Bayesian approach},

Volume = {43},

Abstract = {In all democracies, anticipating the final results of a national
   election the same day the voters go to the polling stations is a matter
   of interest, for television stations and some civil rights
   organizations, for example. The most reliable option is a quick count, a
   statistical procedure that consists in selecting a random sample of
   polling stations and analysing their final counts to forecast the
   election results. In Mexico, a particularly important quick count is
   organized by the electoral authority. The importance of its results
   requires this exercise to be designed and executed with specially high
   standards far beyond those used in commercial studies of this type. In
   this paper, the model and the Bayesian analysis of the quick counts
   conducted by the Mexican authority, during the presidential elections in
   2006 and 2012, are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {``Causation{''} possesses a considerable place in tort law of Iran and
   England particularly in the field of Negligence law. Existing
   differences in legal systems of Iran (as a Civil Law system) and England
   (as a Common Law system) make find a common perspective difficult to
   study causation but possible. This research focuses to compare causation
   in cases where more than one tortfeasors is involved in inflicting
   damage by negligence. This study also attempts to recognize differences
   and similarities between Iran and England in order to resolve
   ambiguities in Iran legal system through England legal system. The study
   was conducted in three sections including tortfeasors' indenpendancy,
   tortfeasors' contribution, and tortfeasors' separate impact. This paper
   reports respectively: in case of tortfeasor independency, Iran law
   admits jointly and severally liability while England law offers a
   variety of approaches in various cases; in case of tortfeasors'
   contribution, each tortfeasor is liable according to its effect on
   causing damage with few exceptions; and in case of tortfeasors' separate
   impact, per tortfeasor is liable for inflicted damage which is only from
   oneself side. The results show England law can be considered to filling
   legal gap of Iran law regarding present identified differences and
   similarities.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the socially engaged art project Nine Urban Biotopes
   (9UB), an international exchange between European and South African
   cultural organisations. Two artist residencies offer case studies of
   collaborative arts and research practice. The ways that these case
   studies are read as `failures' and `successes' illustrate the
   complexities of North-South collaborations. This project, the
   partnership that sustained it and the residencies that were central to
   it, exemplify, in modest ways, how public sociology can be realised in
   modest ways in a global context. This paper shows, with examples, that
   whilst partnership and collaboration are emphasised in institutional and
   policy discourse, in practice these arrangements are filled with tension
   and unequal power relations between partners. An evaluative methodology
   premised on sociological practice allows the tensions that are inherent
   in partnership and collaboration to be recognised and productively
   interrogated. It also allows us to reimagine what `success' and
   `failure' looks like in research partnerships by working with the
   antagonisms that are integral to collaboration.},

Abstract = {Debates on the system of government have been on the political agenda in
   Turkey since the 1960s, gaining momentum in recent years. Disengagement
   from the parliamentary system began with the election of the 12th
   President of Turkey by popular vote in 2014. To this end, the ruling AK
   Party and the MHP submitted a proposal to Parliament on December 10,
   2016 to amend the Constitution. This article aims to discuss the
   advantages and disadvantages of a presidential system for Turkey. As the
   debate unfolds, examining fully the pros and cons of a presidential
   system is vitally important.},

Abstract = {The way political scientists engage with China has been more or less a
   one-way epistemological traffic-scholars study ideas, concepts, theories
   of political science, and go to China and examine the China case.
   Concepts or theories developed out of China studies are unlikely to
   become part of the standard political science lexicon. Due to the rich
   complexities made possible by the rise of China, this paper examines a
   few examples to show the promises China holds for the comparative
   politics field. With some fundamental changes in the field's
   intellectual and conceptual approaches, concepts and ideas derived from
   the political entity and the ongoing experience that is called China are
   likely to expand and revise the commonly accepted lexicon of the field.
   The forming of a new landscape in the field, however, will remain a
   process of conceptual, intellectual, and ideological contests in the
   decades to come.},

Abstract = {Why do people call for states' rights and the devolution of national
   authority? Are they driven by partisan motives, where they like
   devolution the most when the President is of the opposing party? Or are
   calls to shift the balance of federal power rooted in sincere support
   for decentralized political authority? Using survey data from 1987 to
   2012, I explore how support for devolution varies across time and
   individuals. I find that people are not strictly partisan in how they
   think about devolution. While people are more likely to favor
   decentralization when the President is of the opposing party, they are
   no more likely to want devolution when their own party controls state
   government. Substantive considerations are also important, where those
   who support limited government increasingly favor the devolution of
   central authority as the size of the national government increases
   relative to the size of state and local government.},

Volume = {9},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {An important aspect is fundamental in criminal law, and jurisprudence
   arguments would be a judicial conflict in proving the crime. During the
   procedure of a murder case, it is possible the conflicts arise between
   the evidence of confession and religious testimony as a proof to prove
   the murder crime to specify the murderer; such that any of the argument
   suggests the particular person's culpability. Because of the various
   case, determining the probative value of each of them would have a
   significant impact on such conflict to resolve, regarding jurisprudence
   and legal. Therefore, the legislator in Article 213 of the Penal Code of
   Islam, adopted in 2013, has made it clear the probative value of any
   argues, prioritizing any evidence of confession than that of religious
   statement while conflicting with each other. If the legislator takes
   precedence of the evidence of faith over the religious testimony
   provided that assessing both things of evidence by the adjudicating
   authority and s/he does waive to apply the phrase to the text of
   Article, the discovery of the truth and identifying the actual
   perpetrator with justice-based purpose will be more compatible.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},

Volume = {55},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Most accounts of electoral system change tend to consider it as being
   driven by purely partisan interests. Political parties are expected to
   change the electoral rules as a way to maximise gains or minimise
   losses. However, little work has been done on the question of why
   electoral reforms are so scarce in spite of these potential benefits. In
   this study, a wide range of both factors that may foster ('catalysts')
   and ones that may hinder ('barriers') the change of electoral
   institutions are investigated. A statistical analysis is performed of 16
   West European countries from 1975 to 2005, covering 23 reforms of the
   proportionality of their electoral systems. It is found that procedural
   barriers are more effective for explaining the likelihood of electoral
   reforms than (most of) the catalysts. Additionally, there are
   indications that courts may play a more active role in triggering reform
   than previously thought.},

Abstract = {The food supply has been a formative space in the creation and exercise
   of centralized governing authority in Western Europe. Similar to
   warmaking, bureaucratization or market integration, governing
   agriculture has had a constitutive importance to modern European
   politics. One goal of this essay is to elucidate the often forgotten
   agrarian underpinnings of European modernity. A concurrent goal is to
   investigate, through a set of detailed empirical cases, some of the
   decisive strategic configurations through which `the agrarian' and `the
   political' have been conjoined across a history that spans a period of
   time from the Absolutist State to the European Union. Specifically, the
   essay interrogates how the management of the food supply and agrarian
   life were central to the projects of state formation, urban policing,
   imperial geopolitics, and Europe's postwar reconstruction.},

Abstract = {We know that most House seats remain within the same party over the
   course of a redistricting decade. For example, over 75\% did so in the
   last decade. This gives rise to the question: Why do some seats change
   hands and others not? We seek to go beneath the standard answers (such
   as extent of electoral vulnerability as indicated by the previous
   victory margin, challenger qualifications, relative spending of
   challenger and incumbent, midterm loss affecting districts newly won by
   the president's party, realignment effects that made Democrats in the
   South vulnerable) to examine the conditions of ideological competition
   that affect each of these factors and the concomitant probability of
   electoral defeat. We offer a general model of unidimensional party
   competition across multiple constituencies, where a party chases the
   outliers of the other party that are closest to its own ideological
   mean, thus eliminating anomalous districts which should be vulnerable to
   change in party control, and we test that model with data from the U.S.
   House of Representatives 1980-2006. Over time, Democrats capture liberal
   and moderately liberal districts held by Republicans, while Republicans
   capture conservative and moderately conservative districts held by
   Democrats. In a neo-Downsian world where candidates do not locate at the
   preferences of the median voter in the district but, rather, are shifted
   in the direction of their own party mean, we show that this
   outlier-chasing dynamic can be expected, in the long run, to empty out
   the center. This results in an equilibrium of ideologically distinct
   parties and a high level of polarization, involving a self-reinforcing
   dynamic in which the seats that become vulnerable change as the parties
   become more distinct. Indeed, rather than puzzling about why so much
   polarization exists, our work suggests that the real puzzle is why it
   has taken so long to get to the level of polarization we presently
   enjoy. We suggest that the combination of incumbency advantage, and
   multidimensionality of political competition might be the answer, with
   the Civil War role of race as an independent dimension slowly wearing
   off.},

Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research paper is to prove that China's policy
   towards the South China Sea represents a preemptive measure based on
   reducing China's energetic security threat concerning a potential
   blockade of the Malacca Strait by the US or India, in case of conflict
   escalation. By proving so, researchers will better understand the issues
   concerning the South China Sea and give insight into a perspective that
   is not largely debated. The strategy that was approached in this
   research and the methodology used was descriptive, analytical deductive.
   We followed to analyze a wide range of books and articles that are
   references in the domain. The results seem to prove that China's policy
   towards the South China Sea is directed towards multiple goals, such as
   avoiding containment, fighting for resources, protection of its energy
   security in the Malacca Strait and establishing itself as hegemon in the
   region. In those aspects, China's action in the South China Sea can be
   explained on the basis of achieving the means of attaining those certain
   goals. The hypothesis seems to stand to the degree in which a warwould
   break out. Achieving sovereignty over the region, would endanger the
   passage of essential energetic inputs for relevant regionals actors and
   for the US, and can be used as a back-up plan of blackmailing those
   actors in the situation in which China's oil ship imports would be
   blocked in the Malacca Strait. Until then, China's actions in the South
   China Sea can be seen as the necessary steps to achieve this leverage in
   their position with the US and other regional powers. Therefore, we can
   state that China's policy towards the South China Sea can represent a
   preemptive measure based on reducing China's energetic security threat
   concerning a potential blockade of the Malacca Strait by the US or
   India, in case of conflict escalation.},

Title = {Measuring the effects of publication bias in political science},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2016},

Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Prior research finds that statistically significant results are
   overrepresented in scientific publications. If significant results are
   consistently favored in the review process, published results could
   systematically overstate the magnitude of their findings even under
   ideal conditions. In this paper, we measure the impact of this
   publication bias on political science using a new data set of published
   quantitative results. Although any measurement of publication bias
   depends on the prior distribution of empirical relationships, we
   determine that published estimates in political science are on average
   substantially larger than their true value under a variety of reasonable
   choices for this prior. We also find that many published estimates have
   a false positive probability substantially greater than the conventional
   alpha = 0.05 threshold for statistical significance if the prior
   probability of a null relationship exceeds 50\%. Finally, although the
   proportion of published false positives would be reduced if significance
   tests used a smaller a, this change would not solve the problem of
   upward bias in the magnitude of published results.},

   expropriation comparative study of Brazil and Portugal},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to comparatively analyze compulsory
   acquisition in Brazil and in Portugal, taking into account the grand
   scope of the matter. The subject in question is presented to the reader
   starting with the examination of property law as a fundamental and
   constitutional right and with the necessity of making it compatible with
   the power of expropriation under the Democratic State of Law. The
   authors admit that there is a need of converting the unilateral and
   authoritarian Public Administration into a dialogic and democratic one,
   using the administrative process and its principles of due process and
   adversarial principle as an ideal starting point for solving the
   consensual conflict. Furthermore, the authors criticize the outdated
   Brazilian expropriation legislation (Decreto-lei 3.365/41) emended
   during the authoritarian period of the Vargas Government, offering an
   interpretation according to the Constitution in order to value
   democracy, legal principles and consensus. The analysis of Portuguese
   legislation (Lei 168/99) demonstrates that there is progress in respect
   to Portugal, however, in Brazil, there are conflicts regarding fair
   compensation and indemnity for expropriated property. Portuguese methods
   of extrajudicial conflict solutions deserve praise. In conclusion, the
   exchange between International Community Law and National Law is also
   contemplated in this article, be it on the analysis of the Perdigao vs.
   Portugal case decided by the European Court of Human Rights (Portugal),
   or through the Supranational perspective of provisions of the Pact of
   San Jose, Costa Rica (Brazil).},

Year = {2016},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the citizenship courses and exams recently
   introduced in Europe. Does the manner in which each country understands
   nationhood and citizenship determine the content of these programmes or
   are there similarities, regardless of the country's conception of
   nationhood? How can we explain these similarities and differences? Do
   these programmes reflect an idea of belonging based on a commitment to
   civic values that are inclusionary and universalist rather than on
   shared cultural traditions that are exclusionary and particularist? Or
   are there tensions between the normative proposal of liberal
   universalism and its realization in certain policies of integration?
   To answer these questions, I propose an analytical framework that
   enables a normative evaluation of civic integration programmes in France
   and Germany. I, thus, carry out an in-depth analysis of the programmes,
   in order to explain their similarities and differences, both from a
   theoretical perspective and in relation to the political life in each
   country. Although these countries represent divergent conceptions of
   nationhood and citizenship, the analysis of their respective programmes
   reveals many similarities. However, in spite of what one might expect,
   both bring to light certain paradoxes regarding the liberal and
   universalist ideal that inspires them, which expose the possible
   exclusionary consequences of this type of measure, which are hard to
   reconcile with the liberal democratic values they are trying to protect.},

Abstract = {Drawing from several original longitudinal surveys of the Mexican
   immigrant population in Texas and Indiana, we examine the course of the
   immigrant rights movement in the wake of the historic mobilization in
   the spring of 2006. We find that from 2007 to 2015, the number of
   participants in demonstrations, rallies, and marches to support
   immigrant rights dropped substantially, though protesting remains a
   fairly prevalent activity. The Mexicans taking part in protest events
   today, however, have higher levels of education and are older compared
   to 8 years ago, and they are not primarily driven by personal
   grievances. This change in the activist base suggests that the immigrant
   rights movement is following a trajectory that is common among protest
   movements across many democratic systems. What began as an expression of
   profound discontent has become a somewhat more conventional mode of
   involvement.},

Abstract = {During the last two decades Mexico and Venezuela have confronted similar
   challenges in matters of international migration. Mexico is (a) a place
   where millions of people have left their country to work and live in the
   United States, (b) a path for transmigrants, (c) has temporary
   immigration from Central America in the south of its territory, and (d)
   faces the return of its nationals due to the restrictive immigration
   policies in the United States and because the US economy remains
   sluggish. On the Venezuelan side, emigration to foreign countries has
   grown in the last fifteen years due to political and economic
   instabilities. However, the country is also dealing with the necessity
   to change internal rules in order to guarantee a series of social and
   labor rights to South American immigrants because Venezuela is now a
   member of Mercosur. This paper describes the most important migratory
   patterns that the two countries currently face and analyzes the
   different responses that both Mexican and Venezuelan governments have
   given to similar international migration processes: emigration of its
   nationals and intraregional immigration.},

Title = {What's information got to do with it? Third-party voting in plurality
   systems},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Although strategic voting theory predicts that the number of parties
   will not exceed two in single-member district plurality systems, the
   observed number of parties often does. Previous research suggests that
   the reason why people vote for third parties is that they possess
   inaccurate information about the parties' relative chances of winning.
   However, research has yet to determine whether third-party voting
   persists under conditions of accurate information. In this article, we
   examine whether possessing accurate information prevents individuals
   from voting for third-placed parties in the 2005 and 2010 British
   elections. We find that possessing accurate information does not prevent
   most individuals from voting for third-placed parties and that many
   voters possess reasonably accurate information regarding the viability
   of the parties in their constituencies. These findings suggest that
   arguments emphasizing levels of voter information as a major explanation
   for why multiparty systems often emerge in plurality systems are
   exaggerated.},

Title = {A new `Europe from below'? Cosmopolitan citizenship, digital media and
   the indignados social movement},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {14},

Pages = {435-457},

Abstract = {This article asks whether the Indignados social movement can be seen as
   a counterpublic that is capable of fostering genuine forms of
   cosmopolitan citizenship. It is argued that via the artful use of the
   possibilities of digital media (for example, social networking Websites,
   live video, blogs), the Indignados social movement goes on to devise new
   forms of public discourse and organized protest, as well as shared ways
   of thinking and acting that are capable of fuelling cosmopolitan
   solidarity. It is suggested that the movement serves as a springboard to
   analyse how new forms of public communication can foster both a shared
   sense of European solidarity and cosmopolitan publics. Looking at
   examples of protest camps in various European settings and their public
   communication, the article puts forward the claim that the movement's
   self-definition as leaderless, global, inclusive and non-hierarchical
   owes much to its performative dimension. This latter dimension is
   visible, for instance, in the theatricality of the protest camps, ludic
   forms of protest (for example, the carnivalesque use of the V for
   Vendetta Guy Fawkes' mask), and forms of public debate and decision
   making that are underpinned by embodied practices (for example, silent
   gestures) as much as by the procedural legitimacy of rational-critical
   discourse. In targeting the political and financial elites (including
   those associated to the EU), the performance of protest offers new
   insights on what it means to be a European citizen against the backdrop
   of the EU debt crisis, the emergence of unelected governments in Italy
   and Greece, and the so-called `dictatorship of the markets'. We will see
   that this transnational movement goes on to engender radical modes of
   citizen participation that while locally rooted are also powerfully
   shaped and informed by the creative appropriation and reinvention of a
   shared repertoire of European symbols, meanings and values.},

Abstract = {According to Iranian legislation, the family is the basic unit and all
   the codes and rules must be enacted to support and protect it. This
   article discusses the known crimes and penalties that support the family
   institution according to Iran's penal code. The method used in this
   article is library-descriptive and it is done in content-analysis style.
   In this paper, based on the latest Family Protection Code, we analyzed
   the criminalized behaviors and actions that damage the family. The
   investigation concludes that some actions and behaviors are correctly
   criminalized while some others can receive more suitable responses
   through non-criminal measures such as psychological and counseling
   systems. In some cases the legislator has imposed sever response against
   criminal actions. Besides, it is found that measures preventing
   criminalization may preclude secondary victimization.},

   Missed Opportunities},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {701-717},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In international disputes, forgone settlement offers are frequently
   lamented, but their impact on the dynamics of ongoing negotiations is
   largely overlooked. In the psychological literature, however, the
   consequences of missing an advantageous action opportunity have been
   studied extensively in the context of the inaction inertia phenomenon.
   According to this literature, forgoing attractive action opportunities
   renders decision makers susceptible to regret and increases the
   likelihood that subsequent opportunities will also be missed. This
   article explores the explanatory potential of the inaction inertia
   effect in the context of international negotiations. Findings based on
   laboratory experiments and analysis of the negotiations between Israel
   and Hamas over the release of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit strongly
   suggest that the concept of inaction inertia can enrich the
   understanding of failures and deadlocks in international negotiations.
   The article defines the conditions that are instrumental in identifying
   inertia-induced deadlocks and discusses factors that encourage the
   termination of inaction inertia and promote dispute settlement.},

Abstract = {This article argues that in order to understand how international human
   rights agreements (HRAs) work, scholars need to turn their attention to
   rights that are not definitional to democracy. When rights practices
   diverge from treaty rules, but the domestic enforcement mechanisms that
   give such agreements their bite are robust, how do governments behave?
   The study explores this question by examining a core treaty that
   prohibits child labor. When domestic enforcement is likely, states where
   many children work are often deterred from ratifying. Nevertheless,
   those that do ratify experience significant child labor improvements. By
   contrast, in non-democracies, ratification is a promise that is easily
   made but seldom kept.},

Title = {Detecting manipulation in authoritarian elections: Survey-based methods
   in Zimbabwe},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {10-21},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper explores the feasibility of using social surveys to detect
   electoral manipulation in authoritarian regimes. It compares official
   results from the July 2013 elections in Zimbabwe with findings from a
   nationally representative pre-election survey. The comparison confirms
   that the dominant incumbent party won the elections but by far smaller
   margins than officially reported. This discrepancy provides analytic
   leverage to identify the possible presence of coercive mobilization and
   vote suppression and to pinpoint their geographic location. The election
   results are re-estimated using a set of voting simulations based on
   novel proxy indicators and an original list experiment designed to
   reveal the political preferences of fearful voters. The paper concludes
   by discussing why autocrats manipulate elections and whether or not they
   succeed in their objectives. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article examines the usefulness of the theory of clientelism for
   understanding the politics of Andhra Pradesh (AP), where pressures to
   secure election funds as populations became more mobile led political
   leaders to seek centralized control over state resources and access to
   private funds. Innovative chief ministers sought new ways of relating to
   voters that undercut local leaders, leading to populist politics and a
   shift towards programmatic politics that provided individual benefits
   rather than collective benefits as under the prior system of patronage
   politics. These changes created a system that was more amenable to
   individual leadership but also more vulnerable when the leadership
   collapsed. The theory of clientelism provides a useful guide to the
   political and economic costs of this system, including the democratic
   deficit, but does not provide for voters' innovative responses. The
   theory's emphasis on transactional politics does not adequately address
   the continuing role of social groupings such as caste nor does it
   acknowledge the critical role of leadership in building and sustaining
   the system.},

Abstract = {Chief judges often strive to promote consensus in their courts to
   promote public confidence, durable precedents, and intracourt
   collegiality; yet, some chiefs succeed, whereas others fail. In this
   article, we identify institutional factors that facilitate and hinder
   the chief's ability to promote consensus by examining dissent rates in
   every state court of last resort from 1995 to 2004. Consistent with
   prior work, we find that consensus is partially driven by the chief
   judge's formal powers and the institutional resources available to court
   members. However, we also find that member resources moderate the
   chief's influence. The chief's formal powers are associated with lower
   dissent rates in courts that lack time, staff, docket control, and
   insulation from the electorate. In contrast, judges who possess greater
   resources are highly resistant to the chief's influence. Our findings
   suggest a fundamental dynamic of political leadership that may operate
   across institutional contexts.},

Abstract = {Openness is central to scientific enquiry and can enable faster and more
   effective return on investment in research. Open access is linked to
   innovation in research communication and can help increase the
   reliability and reproducibility of published research. Growth of open
   access journal publishing in the social sciences and humanities is
   second only to life sciences. Surveys show researchers are interested in
   open access publishing, but some researchers perceive that there is a
   lack of quality journals offering open access. However, a number of
   established publishers have recently launched fully open access journals
   for political and social scientists, such as Palgrave Communications and
   Research \& Politics. Open access journals often operate an article
   processing charge (APC) or `author pays' business model, to support
   making articles freely available without charging readers. The APC model
   could provide financial benefits to society in the long term, but can
   present challenges for researchers without access to grant funding in
   the short term.},

Abstract = {Previous research has shown that presidents have a powerful influence on
   their party's popularity, reputation for competence, perceived
   ideological leanings, attractiveness as an object of personal
   identification, and electoral fortunes. Drawing on data from multiple
   Gallup Polls covering presidential candidates from Eisenhower and
   Stevenson through George H. W. Bush; the Annenberg surveys for 2000,
   2004, and 2008; the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2009-2009
   panel study; and ANES time series studies from 1978 through 2012, this
   article examines how the reciprocal relationship between affective
   reactions to presidential candidates/presidents and their parties
   evolves prior to and during campaigns, over presidencies, and after
   presidents or former candidates are no longer in office or on the
   ballot.},

Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {1},
Number = {2},
Pages = {122-134},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Korea's political science has been initiated and developed under the
   influence of the United States. It is related to the intention of the US
   to build a liberal democratic state in the southern part of the Korean
   peninsula against the Soviet Union-styled communism. However, as the
   bitter experience of the Korean War created a very narrow ideological
   space in Korean politics, there were considerable ideological
   constraints. Moreover, the authoritarian military regime, often took
   advantage of anti-communism ideology as a cause to justify their rules.
   All these served as a set of constraints imposed on the study of
   political science. Korea's political scientists tried to respond to the
   political demands of the day despite the politically oppressive
   atmosphere. Democratization and the end of the Cold War provided
   political scientists a very favorable condition. Political scientists
   did not need to fear about visible and invisible obstacles on their
   research any longer. That is, a `normal' situation has finally come to
   Korea's political studies. Under such political circumstances, political
   science could widen its scope. Studies of politics became more
   institutionalized and diversified. Political science in
   post-democratization era deals with not only political institutions,
   political processes, and political ideology, but also newly emerging
   political phenomena such as Internet politics, immigration, ethnic
   minorities, welfare reform, globalization and social harmony, etc. Based
   on such academic achievement, it is time that Korea's political science
   has the task to make theoretical contributions to outside world from the
   Korea's own experiences.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {44},
Number = {4},
Pages = {710-733},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The writing of a majority opinion is the most important task for judges
   and justices on collegial courts because they must be able to explain
   and justify the court's decision in a way that will be understood by
   other legal and political actors. For state supreme court justices, we
   argue that the opinion-writing process is driven by the information the
   opinion author has as well as internal institutional constraints. In
   this article, we examine the length of opinions produced by state
   supreme courts to determine whether there are differences in the
   opinion-writing process between elected and appointed courts. Using an
   original dataset comprising all education cases decided by state supreme
   courts from 1995 to 2005, we find, consistent with our expectations,
   that elected justices appear to be more concerned with audiences
   external to the court in writing opinions, whereas appointed justices
   are more likely to respond to internal constraints and conditions.},

Abstract = {This article appraises the role of the Communist Party of India
   (Marxist) (CPM) in West Bengal, where the CPM-led Left Front formed
   government uninterruptedly between 1977 and 2011. It identifies four
   phases of Left politics in West Bengal: the period during which
   communists built support for a programme of radical transformation; the
   post-1977 years when the Left Front introduced land reform and effective
   local government that produced a `party society' in rural areas; a third
   stage when popular support was subverted through clientelism tinged with
   coercion and petty corruption; and the 1990s, when growth in
   agricultural output petered out, the proportion of landless labourers
   increased and employment in manufacturing stagnated. The Left had also
   not delivered significant progress in social policy. The CPM turned to
   corporate investments and special economic zones. This trajectory points
   to problems of party ideology and the imperative of renewal to devise an
   anti-capitalist strategy.},

Abstract = {Despite its extreme fragility, the ceasefire in place in Syria since
   February 2016 has afforded the opportunity to assess the options for a
   set of interim governance and transitional justice arrangements. These
   could establish the foundations for a transition following the
   conclusion of the Syrian civil war, regardless of its endpoint. Drawing
   on the specifics of the Syrian case and wider studies of interventions
   in, and transitions from, civil war, Scott Lucas, Christalla Yakinthou
   and Stefan Wolff consider the challenges of peace- and state-building,
   identifying both risks and mitigating actions. The article argues that
   risk mitigation is possible and should begin now. These efforts need to
   be supported by the international community in order to lay the
   foundations for a credible and sustainable post-civil war transition in
   Syria.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Many journalists, political reformers and social scientists assume that
   electorates in open versus closed primaries are distinctive, especially
   in terms of their ideological orientations. Because voting in closed
   primaries is restricted to registered partisans, voters in this setting
   are assumed to be more ideologically extreme. Independents voting in
   open primaries are seen as moderating the ideological orientation of
   these primary electorates. However, our research demonstrates that the
   ideological orientations of voters in these two primary settings are
   quite similar. Prior research demonstrates the influence of primary laws
   on voters' self-identifications as partisans or independents. We expand
   upon this research to show how this influences the number and
   ideological positions of partisans and independents as they vote in
   presidential primaries held under differing participation rules. (c)

Abstract = {Can foreign aid be used to promote democracy in Asia? Because
   liberalization is costly for the autocratic recipients, they can be
   expected to resist donor pressure to reform politically. The recipients
   who have the strategic and commercial attributes that donors value
   should have an easier time getting aid offers and hence leverage against
   donors who seek liberalization. By contrast, the recipients who lack
   such attributes have less leverage. This group of ``secondary{''}
   recipients can be nudged towards political liberalization. I test this
   argument using foreign aid from AidData and regime-type information from
   Polity IV. The evidence bares out the argument even after correcting for
   the threat of reverse causality. I conclude with policy prescriptions
   for effective aid allocation.},

Abstract = {Using political claims analysis on 1,000 articles from five national
   newspapers (Daily Mail, The Sun, The Times, The Guardian, and Daily
   Mirror), this article demonstrates that press coverage of the financial
   crisis, recession, and austerity in the United Kingdom between 2007-14
   drew heavily on a neoliberal discourse. Political, market, and civil
   society actors discussed the impact of hard times on people using a
   reductionist neoliberal narrative, framing people as economic actors and
   consistently underplaying any social or political traits. By examining
   communicative, rather than coordinative, discourse this research expands
   the focus of previous studies which have examined the embeddedness of
   ideology in society, and highlights potential links to studies of
   citizen participation and mobilization.},

Abstract = {While many contributions on legislative politics in the European
   Parliament rely on recorded votes, the motivations behind the decision
   to record a vote remain somewhat arcane. This article frames roll-call
   vote requests as a minority right which offers party groups an
   opportunity to shape the voting agenda and signal commitment to a policy
   proposal. The analysis adds to our understanding of legislative behavior
   by linking the committee stage to the plenary stage. Party groups which
   do not support a floor proposal drafted by the lead committee are found
   to be more likely to request a roll-call vote in plenary. The
   quantitative evidence is supplemented by interview data which shed light
   both on the actors' motivations and the internal decision-making
   processes preceding the decision to go on record.},

   with the law of some countries in the world in order to point out the

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {110},
Number = {2},
Pages = {382-396},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A representation is always a selective and limited reproduction of the
   thing represented, an idea captured in the metaphor of a map. What is
   left out of a representation is as important as what is included. A
   specifically political conception of representation implies limits to
   the scope of that conception, the nature and character of the
   represented constituency, and the relationship between constituent and
   representative, irrespective of variations in institutional design and
   practice. The limits of political representation reflect normative
   commitments; consequently, a focus on those limits is central to an
   evaluation of representative practices. While it is important to look
   beyond familiar institutional forms, excessively inclusive descriptions
   of representative, constituency, or representation deprive those
   conceptions of their substantive content. The limits of political
   representation are not defects to be overcome by an ever-expanding
   definition of representation, they are an essential focus in the
   normative or empirical analysis of representative institutions and
   practices.},

Abstract = {Why do ordinary people take extraordinary risks and join an ethnic armed
   rebellion? This article tests a series of well-established hypotheses
   about selfish and identity based motivations and a new hypothesis based
   on prospect theory. It then employs a unique multimethod research
   strategy combining one of the most comprehensive datasets on insurgent
   recruitment that contains biographical information about 8,266 Kurdish
   militants with extensive fieldwork involving in-depth interviews with
   relatives of the militants to test these hypotheses. The findings show
   the decision to rebel is as much political as economic and social. While
   security concerns and expectations of benefits affect the decision to
   rebel, social commitments, identities radicalized by state repression,
   and collective threat perceptions among efficacious individuals
   generated by political mobilization, rather than preexisting ethnic
   cleavages, also lead to participation in an ethnic insurgency. The
   latter findings explain the durability of insurgencies with limited
   economic resources and their ability to attract educated fighters.},

Abstract = {How does a change from a compulsory voting system to a voluntary one
   affect election turnout? It is often argued that an electoral regime
   under which voting is voluntary reproduces class bias or, in other
   words, that the rich vote more than the poor. This bias is corrected
   either by the introduction of compulsory voting or the existence of
   strong left-wing parties and trade unions able to mobilize poorer
   segments of the population. In this article, we put forward an
   alternative argument. We assert that when voting is voluntary, class
   bias can disappear if an election is very competitive since this affects
   both turnout and its socio-economic composition. To evaluate this
   argument, we examine the case of Chile's 2012 municipal election when
   voting was voluntary for the first time, instead of compulsory.},

Abstract = {This work explores how women's nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have
   contributed to the policy-making process in former Soviet republics.
   This work uses logistic regression to explore how women's NGOs have
   affected the passage of violence against women and human trafficking
   measures in the post-Soviet states of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and
   Moldova from 1993 to 2008. The results indicate that women's groups
   influence the policy process beyond agenda setting and bill introduction
   and play an important role in the passage of violence against women and
   human trafficking statutes. This article adds to the literature on
   organized interests and the policy process in the post-Soviet region and
   in newly democratizing countries.},

Abstract = {This article critically evaluates explanatory theories about how
   representatives, and more specifically members of parliament (MPs),
   connect with interest groups. Central to this are the crucial questions
   of whether these contacts are party-based or identity-based. Our
   analysis includes five kinds of groups: two traditional cleavage-based
   groups (blue-collar workers and employers) with well-established
   contacts between parties (respectively, social-democratic and
   conservative parties) and interest groups (trade unions and employers'
   organisations) on the one hand, and three newer groups in society
   (women, young people and the elderly), on the other hand. Our analysis
   is based on the data Partirep MP Survey, which contains information
   about characteristics, attitudes and behaviour of regional and federal
   MPs in 15 European countries.},

Abstract = {Covert action can be an important weapon in a state's arsenal. It is,
   however, inherently controversial and risky. Rory Cormac, Michael S
   Goodman and Tom Holman argue that when considering covert action,
   Whitehall should look to lessons from the recent past. The UK has long
   used covert action, and how best to manage and co-ordinate such
   sensitive activity was for many decades a key preoccupation of its
   policy-makers and politicians. Given the secrecy involved, these
   lessons, and the machinery created, have been lost to history. Yet with
   covert action seemingly now back on the agenda, previous experience and
   hard-learnt lessons have assumed renewed importance.},

Abstract = {This essay examines the concept of ``Indian nullification{''} in the
   political writings of William Apess by situating his defense of native
   self-determination in the context of debates about the legitimacy of
   nullification in U.S. constitutionalism. It illustrates how Indian
   nullification operates, not as a feature of constitutional design
   asserting minority rights over the tyranny of the majority, but rather
   as a rhetorical form of political contestation exposing the constitutive
   exclusions of American settler democracy. Apess illuminates how
   constitutional ideals of popular sovereignty cohere around regimes of
   settler colonialism and indigenous dispossession, highlighting the
   paradox of settler sovereignty that provides the basis for American
   democracy. Indian nullification is not a simple demand that the
   boundaries of liberal citizenship be expanded to include Indians. It is
   a way of narrating and rhetorically representing the forms of settler
   conquest that establish the material and conceptual foundation of
   popular self-rule for white settlers.},

Abstract = {There has been a significant increase in funding for health programmes
   in development over the last two decades, partly due to the formation of
   public-private partnerships. This article examines the impact of
   public-private partnerships from the perspective of women's health, asks
   whether the current culture of funding has led to an increased
   instrumentalism in women's health programming and what effects this has
   on how women's health is addressed at the level of practice. The article
   is based on research carried out with UK-based non-governmental
   organisations (NGOs), and its conclusions raise further challenges for
   improving women's health policies and programmes in development.},

Abstract = {In the gnostic literature of Iran and in the Islamic Gnosis, gnosis has
   been interpreted as an effort to save the individual by accessing to the
   real unity.
   The unity, mystical journey (conduct) and the relation of God with
   creature are considered as three main axes under the theme of unity or
   the gnostic unity until before the pantheistic gnosis of Ibn Arabi, the
   concept's explanation and the definition of unity in terminological and
   lexical terms, expression of unity concept in the non-Islamic gnosis,
   explanation of unity concept in the Iranian-Islamic gnosis until the
   period of Ibn Arabi, expression of the way of mystical journey,
   explanation of mystics' attitude on the subject of mystic unity based on
   the belief of Gnostics of Khorasan school, expression of God's relation
   with creature in the Iranian and Ibn Arabi's gnosis are considered as
   the most fundamental under considering instances of this research work;
   in addition, a brief explanation on pantheism of Ibn Arabi is also under
   consideration. The theoretical pillars of exalted unity from the
   perspective of Ibn Arabi, are existence, entity and manifestation; Ibn
   Arabi, contrary to his preceding Gnostics doesn't consider the creatures
   mirageor hallucination. This view is somewhat different from the views
   of mystics of Khorasan, and Gnosis of Khorasan, the differences that
   have led to two ways of Conduct (Mystical journey) in gnosis. The scope
   of this research begins from the third century AD and continues by the
   end of the seventh century that is the rise of theoretical gnosis based
   on the Ibn Arabi's pantheistic opinions.},

Abstract = {With numerous recent incidents in which law-enforcement officers played
   a role in the deaths of citizens, there is a renewed focus on cops and
   their actions. Part of that discussion is related to the nation's
   preconceived notions of cops and where those ideas might originate.
   Popular culture contributes to those images; this study explores one
   source of those images: film. More specifically, it investigates the
   image of law enforcement on the silver screen from 1984 through 2014.
   With a sample of 34 films and more than 200 cop characters, this study
   finds a mixed general depiction of law enforcement in movies but a
   positive depiction of individual cop characters. The prevalent
   descriptor of those characters was good, hard-working, and competent
   law-enforcement officers. This exploratory study informs broader
   discussions about the images of cops found in popular culture.},

Abstract = {Can campaign communications credibly transmit information about
   candidates' policy intentions? To answer this question, I develop and
   analyze a game-theoretic model of campaign communication in a
   two-candidate majority rule election with multidimensional policies.
   Candidate and voter preferences are private information, and campaigns
   consist of both candidates sending cheap talk messages in order to
   communicate information about their preferences. The game possesses
   equilibria involving informative campaign messages that reveal
   information about the directions of the candidates' ideal points from
   the center of the policy space but leave the voters uncertain about
   which candidate is more extreme.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {48},
Number = {3},
Pages = {413+},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In January 2007, Mexicans filled the Zocalo in Mexico City to express
   opposition to rising corn prices and corn imports. Consumers and
   producers, middle class and campesinos united in the streets to demand
   access to affordable, explicitly Mexican corn. This article explains the
   cooperation across class and sectoral lines in the Mexican tortillazo
   protests by focusing on the meanings corn takes on in the Mexican
   context. When individuals imagined that they or other Mexicans might not
   be able to consume a good at the center of daily life and imaginings of
   nation, they reached across established divides and took to the streets.
   These insights suggest that to understand responses to markets we need
   to incorporate the meanings that marketization takes on in our analyses.},

Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {This study explores whether black and/or Latino respondents are more
   likely to over-report voting in districts with US House candidates of
   the same race/ethnicity and whether the overstating of political
   participation is contingent on shared partisanship between the candidate
   and the respondent. We test these relationships using vote-validated
   data from the 2006 and 2010 Cooperative Congressional Election Study. We
   find that blacks and Latinos are not more likely to over-report voting
   in districts with descriptive candidates regardless of whether the
   candidate and respondent share the same party identification or not. The
   results of this study provide support for previous and future studies
   linking descriptive representation to higher levels of black and Latino
   turnout using non-voter validated data.},

Abstract = {Why do dictators sometimes prefer incompetent subordinates? I explore
   this question using a formal model. In each period of a dynamic game, a
   subordinate chooses his level of loyalty, which determines the
   dictator's survival probability. He also performs another task-such as
   carrying out economic policy. The dictator's decision each period is
   whether to hire a subordinate who is competent or incompetent at that
   task. An unemployed subordinate may be hired in the future, when the
   current dictator is removed from office. I show that less competent
   subordinates will be more loyal. As a result, dictators who value
   performance at economic tasks will hire more competent subordinates and
   will have shorter tenures. Incompetent subordinates will be hired more
   often if the dictators discount future payoffs less heavily or if the
   payoff from competence is smaller. The results show that, consistent
   with observation, longer tenures will not be associated with better
   economic performance.},

Abstract = {Edward Said is viewed as the creator of the academic development of
   post-colonialism, largely with his transmission of the concept
   ``Orientalism.{''} Orientalism is considered his magnum opus. He is a
   forerunner in the deconstruction of the so-called `Western' forms of
   hegemony that not only subverts the traditional understandings of
   `Occident' and `Orient', but also the ``East-West,{''} as being
   simplistic, binary oppositional platforms, divorced from the necessary
   divergent ontological framework for understanding the reality of the
   current-day. Yet, these false and simplified platforms are continuing in
   the common worldviews, at the expense of losing a clearer understanding
   of our conditions.},

Abstract = {Using an agent-based simulation of electoral participation, this paper
   examines the second order or cascade effects of an exogenous increase in
   turnout. Unlike most previous applications of agent-based modelling in
   political science, we adopt a descriptively complex rather than a simple
   model of behaviour. Experimenting with different levels of mobilisation
   allows estimation of the extent to which mobilisation spreads beyond the
   primary mobilisation target across the population as well as whether or
   not it survives over time. We argue that in a complex world cascade
   effects are smaller than previously thought. However, mobilisation
   effects can create secondary effects through habitual voting and
   increases in political interest and party affiliation, which reverberate
   over time, creating long-term spillover effects.},

Abstract = {We extend Bednar's theory of a robust federation to examine the factors
   and institutions influencing the effectiveness of transboundary water
   governance in an international river basin. We examine the evolution and
   performance of drought adaptation in the Rio Grande/Bravo river basin of
   the United States and Mexico-two federal countries. Droughts and water
   shortages since 1990 have triggered opportunistic behavior by resource
   users and their governments. Analysis of case studies in three nested
   geographic contexts (internationally, interstate United States and
   interstate Mexico) generates evidence of opportunistic behavior and
   either limited or disputed compliance both internationally and within
   each country. Structural safeguards have stipulated powers and functions
   for water allocation and conflict resolution in all three settings, but
   roles and responsibilities are not clear during droughts. The
   limitations of structural, popular, and judicial safeguards have
   elevated the importance of joint monitoring, which we identify as a
   vital new form of safeguard.},

Abstract = {In the history of Republic of Turkey, transition to democracy was
   experienced twice in 1930 and 1946 at a period described as
   ``single-party era{''}. In both periods, despite the establishment of
   various political parties, two parties came to the foreground more than
   others and have had a greater say in the political arena. These two
   opposition parties are, SCF which was founded in August 1930 and DP that
   was established in January of 1946. The issue that needs to be mentioned
   before examination by comparison of conditions and periods is that SCF
   was being the first opposition party to be established in 1930 democracy
   experiment whereas DP is the second political party emerged in the
   transition to democracy in 1945. However, in a short period of time both
   opposition parties were met with great enthusiasm throughout the
   country. Both parties that are seen as alternatives to the ruling party
   CHF by the voter groups, as of the period they are established, they
   came to the political scene under the influence of internal and external
   conditions. Although there are some similarities when the two parties
   were established, important differences are also observed. Primarily,
   the first similarity that needs to be emphasized is both SCF and DP is
   basically founded by people from the CHP origin. In this study, internal
   and external factors that were effective in the emergence of both
   parties, the attitude of the ruling party in the establishment phase of
   both parties and the similarities and differences will be revealed by
   examining the programs of both parties.},

Abstract = {The traditional Party and state leadership system refers to the highly
   centralized Party and state leadership system which was created after
   the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 and was
   eventually established after the completion of the socialist
   transformation of private ownership of the means of production and the
   collectivization of the agricultural sector, as well as the
   establishment of a highly centralized planned economic system in the
   mid-1950s. The traditional Party and state leadership system is the
   source and foundation of the current Party and state leadership system.
   Though the centralized leadership with party control all enjoys some
   advantages, this kind of leadership system weakened the state and
   society, made party organizations bureaucratic and party cadres a
   special group with privileges. Mao Zedong tried to use the logic and
   method of revolution to improve this kind of leadership system but
   failed. This shows that the logic of revolution was unable to solve the
   drawbacks of traditional party and state leadership system under the
   ruling condition.},

Abstract = {How does the threat of terrorism affect evaluations of female (vs. male)
   political leaders, and do these effects vary by the politician's
   partisanship? Using two national surveys, we document a propensity for
   the U.S. public to prefer male Republican leadership the most in times
   of security threat, and female Democratic leadership the least. We
   theorize a causal process by which terrorist threat influences the
   effect of stereotypes on candidate evaluations conditional on politician
   partisanship. We test this framework with an original experiment: a
   nationally representative sample was presented with a mock election that
   varied the threat context and the gender and partisanship of the
   candidates. We find that masculine stereotypes have a negative influence
   on both male and female Democratic candidates in good times (thus
   reaffirming the primacy of party stereotypes), but only on the female
   Democratic candidate when terror threat is primed. Republican
   candidates-both male and female-are unaffected by masculine stereotypes,
   regardless of the threat environment.},

Abstract = {Despite all the intellectual energy devoted to understanding ``what ISIS
   really is,{''} the group remains unpredictable and inexplicable for two
   main reasons. First, the existing frameworks are not appropriate for a
   holistic assessment of the organization, prompting analysts to mistake
   ISIS' tactics or propaganda for its political objectives. Second, an
   almost exclusive emphasis on ISIS per se distracts from the symbiotic
   and complex relationship between ISIS and the bigger regional crisis.
   This article draws attention to three interrelated dynamics. First, ISIS
   is best seen as a ``process,{''} not as a static ``thing{''} that can be
   easily identified. Second, ISIS' successes and failures cannot be
   divorced from the multi-dimensional crisis in the region. Third, it is
   necessary to consider the groups' impacts on the greater Middle East
   with respect to two interrelated dimensions: sectarian tensions and
   existing ethnic relations.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {41},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper develops a votes-to-seats nowcast model using individual
   level data from the British Election Study Internet panel to model the
   flow of the vote between 2010 and 2015. Transition matrices for each
   constituency are calculated using multinomial models of flows between
   2010 origins and 2015 destinations. Respondents are reweighted to the
   polling average for England, Scotland and Wales and are further
   reweighted using predicted turnout to downweight respondents who are
   less likely to vote. The forecast performed poorly in 2015 because of
   polling errors and because the ``Ashcroft{''} constituency vote
   intention question overestimated the Liberal Democrat incumbency effect.
   Without these errors, the forecast would have come much closer to the
   result but would still have underestimated the Conservatives' seats. (C)

Year = {2016},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Pages = {134-148},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Objectives and Design One theme in the political thinking of the Warring
   States era was whether political action and human action generally were
   and should be governed by considerations of abstract morality or by
   expediency. This study explores how this dialectic played itself out in
   the Confucian, Mohist, Taoist, and Legalist traditions.
   Materials and Methods The study examines the original texts, as they
   have come down to us, of the major Warring States traditions, critically
   comparing them and the ideas they articulate against each other, against
   later Chinese thinking, and against certain trends of contemporary
   political thinking.
   Conclusions The Confucian tradition, reacting against what was perceived
   as the social and political deterioration of contemporary society,
   attempted to restore order on the basis of a universal set of
   objectively valid moral principles that included the satisfaction of
   human needs and interests, but was in itself independent of particular
   interests or desires. The circumstances of the times, however,
   undermined the credibility of such universal moral claims, and rival
   interpretations, when they did attempt to ground morality, fell back
   upon loosely utilitarian principles. But this morality void of objective
   grounding also failed to provide a convincing principle of order. With
   the Legalist school order came to be based on moral principles, but on
   individual will and the ability to impose that will on others.},

Abstract = {Who do you think will win in your constituency? Most citizens correctly
   answer this question, and groups are even better at answering it.
   Combining individual forecasts results in the `wisdom of crowds'
   explained by Condorcet's jury theorem. This paper demonstrates the
   accuracy of citizen forecasts in seven British General Elections between
   1964 and 2010, and reports what citizens interviewed in February and
   March forecasted for the election in May 2015. `Citizen forecasting'
   predicts vote shares and winners in constituency elections, and seat
   numbers and governments in national elections. The paper also introduces
   a new method for predicting vote shares from citizen forecasts. Citizen
   forecasts are direct, accurate, and comprehensible. Pollsters should
   collect them and communicate their results more often. (C) 2015

Abstract = {Committees play an important role in the democratic system of government
   in providing opportunities for groups and individuals to engage with
   Parliament. Committees have traditionally provided opportunities for
   community engagement through submissions and public hearings. However,
   this has been dominated by key stakeholder groups, academics, government
   agencies and interest groups, all of whom can be collectively known as
   the `usual suspects'.
   With the changing face of technology, the new forms of participatory
   democracy and the rise of social change movements the article examines
   if this movement has had an influence on participation in committee
   inquiries. Movements such as Change. Org and Get Up have had success in
   bringing about policy change through direct petitioning of governments.
   But the mass petitioning of a committee inquiry presents challenges both
   procedurally and administratively. The article examines if this new

Abstract = {The current study presents evidence that partisan campaign strategies in
   US presidential elections have shifted in recent years to reflect a
   growing emphasis on base mobilization compared to persuading
   independent, undecided or swing voters. Pursuing reliable supporters
   appears to be increasingly desirable for political campaigns, especially
   since 2000, relative to the risky and uncertain prospects of targeting
   less reliable supporters. I speculate this shift is attributable, at
   least in part, to changes in the context in which contemporary campaigns
   operate, coinciding with the 2000 presidential election; advances in
   microtargeting, particularly through new e-campaigning and
   e-mobilization technologies, and behavioral science related to voter
   mobilization represent two of the most potent developments. By contrast,
   persuasion is a far more difficult and risky approach. I conclude that
   growing emphasis on base mobilization in elections has likely
   contributed to intensifying partisan polarization in America.},

Abstract = {Arguably, negotiations for a settlement of the Cyprus issue are
   currently in their most critical and advanced phase in history,
   prompting euphoria. Considerable progress has been achieved, but serious
   thorns and obstacles remain. At the same time, the prospects of a
   solution of the Cyprus issue are inextricably linked to regional and
   international developments, including strategic alignments and
   alliances, economic realities, political developments, and energy
   issues. This article comprises a pragmatic account of the current state
   of affairs in the Cyprus issue, including an update on the negotiations,
   regional developments, and energy matters. It argues that present
   circumstances are more conducive to a solution than ever before and that
   the opportunity should be seized. It also argues the sense of urgency
   and the need for realism in doing so.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2016},

Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {283-303},

Abstract = {This article considers Hungary's political system from 2010 to 2014 with
   Fidesz in power and domestic and international actors' responses to the
   challenge of populists-in-government. The article argues that domestic
   responses were weakened by Fidesz' use of its supermajority for a
   partisan redrafting of the country's constitutional order, but also by
   its mainstream competitors' failure to offer a contrasting yet positive
   vision for the electorate. External actors, and the European Union (EU)
   in particular, may therefore have emerged as the main bulwark against
   the effects of populists-in-government. However, the EU was relatively
   ill-equipped to deal with systemic violations of the common values of
   the Union with respect to its member states, and arguably even the
   available measures were not used to their full potential. The main
   explanation for this lies in Fidesz' origins: rather than starting its
   life on the fringes of the electoral space, the party had been the
   major, mainstream centre-right alternative. This position in Hungary's
   party system had in turn endowed Fidesz with strong transnational links
   which outlasted the party's own transformation and continued to act to
   dampen EU action.},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {The relation between face-to-face and online communication and its
   impact on collective identity processes is understudied. In this article
   I draw on two case studies conducted during a 3-year ethnographic study
   of the Global Justice Movement network in Madrid, Spain, from 2002 to
   2005 to explore the unintended impact of e-mail on the sustainability,
   internal dynamics, and collective identity of two groups committed to
   participatory and deliberative practices as key features of their
   collective identity. I found that despite an explicit commitment to
   horizontalism' the use of e-mail in these two groups increased existing
   hierarchies, hindered consensus, decreased participation, and worked
   towards marginalization of group members. In addition, the negative and
   unintended consequences of e-mail use affected both groups,
   independently of activists' evaluation of their experience in their
   face-to-face assemblies (one of which was overwhelmingly perceived as
   positive and one of which was perceived as negative). The article draws
   on e-mail research in organizations, online political deliberation
   research, and existing studies of e-mail use in social movement groups
   to analyse these findings.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the current situation of the left in Spain
   (excluding traditional social democracy) and its future prospects. Since
   the so-called 15-M movement of May 2011 and the subsequent creation of
   Podemos ('We Can'), there has been a perceived possibility of the
   overcoming the neoliberal offensive and the so-called regime of 1978,
   the political structure of the last decades. However, it is argued here
   that the rise of this `new left' does not necessarily imply a
   strengthening of the subject of transformation, the labour movement, nor
   the political framework for achieving social rights in the future.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {It has been argued that political parties are in decline. While they
   used to be responsible for connecting citizens to the state by
   translating their preferences into policies, they have increasingly
   become part of the state, acting as governors instead. While this
   perspective emphasises parties' representative function, it is less
   clear what their role is in a more direct democratic context. Parties
   may gain support due to such context, but they may also be seen
   increasingly redundant in a situation where citizens can co-decide
   directly. Focusing on party membership, this study tests these rival
   expectations on a panel of 16 West European democracies over the period
   1980-2008 and finds that parties tend to have higher levels of party
   membership in a direct democratic context. The usage of referendums,
   however, does not contribute to this effect.},

Abstract = {We outline a comprehensive research program on institutional reforms in
   European parliaments. Original data show that parliamentary rules in
   Western European parliaments have been changed frequently and massively
   during the period from 1945 to 2010 suggesting that actors use
   institutional reforms as a distinct strategy to pursue their substantive
   goals. We discuss how institutional instability affects existing
   theoretical and empirical arguments about institutional effects.
   Furthermore, we present four ideal-typical approaches to analyzing rule
   changes, present new software tools for identifying and coding changes
   in large text corpora, and demonstrate their usefulness for valid
   measurement of the overall change between subsequent text versions.},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {This article addresses the politicisation of European tax governance in
   mass media. Although taxation is commonly assumed to remain a national
   prerogative, European institutions have extended their reach far into
   national tax regimes. Whether this expansion of EU authority towards one
   of the core functions of the nation state is accompanied by
   politicisation is the question to be addressed in this article. To
   analyse the causal nexus between growing EU authority - measured in
   terms of formal authority and tax legislation - and the politicisation
   of EU tax governance, the paper compares public debates in Germany,
   Ireland and Switzerland over a time period of 30 years between 1981 and
   2011. Based on a newspaper content analysis, the empirical results
   demonstrate that EU tax governance is increasingly politicised in all
   three countries. Varying levels and content of politicisation across
   time and space are explained by national economic and socio-cultural
   conditions.},

Abstract = {Since mid-2013 AMISOM has undergone a series of strategic reviews aimed
   at strengthening the mission, and since early 2014 it has conducted four
   major operations aimed at taking the fight to Al-Shabaab. Although these
   operations have enjoyed some successes, AMISOM continued to confront
   four major challenges that badly hindered its ability to achieve its
   mandated tasks. Paul D Williams explores these challenges - both
   internal and external to AMISOM - and argues that AMISOM cannot be
   expected to implement a successful exit strategy unless these issues are
   addressed.},

Abstract = {The dominant thought forces us to accept as impossible an economy
   without growth that does not massively exploit its natural resources. To
   achieve progress it is repeated that the only way out is thru economic
   growth, which demands a group of countries extracting increasingly
   higher volumes of natural resources to sustain the growing demand from
   other countries. At the same time, that effort, leveraged by an
   increasing extractivism, would ensure the income for the global South;
   classical provider of such products; to overcome its
   ``underdevelopment{''}. However, as it is analyzed in this article,
   prepared as of thoughts and academic research by the author and from his
   direct experience in different functions in the world of mining
   activities, reality demands that we overcome these visions, not only due
   to ecologic and social arguments, but also for economic reasons. This
   text approaches the main limitations (pathologies) of extractivism.
   Then, some elements are proposed to think of alternatives around the two
   trends that are becoming strong in the international debate: contraction
   and post-extractivism, looking at the same time for new civilizing
   horizons such as Good Living.},

   We propose a mechanism how solution to the sovereign debt crisis that
   the Eurozone countries suffering under the global financial crisis. This
   mechanism involves a restructuring process combined with the creation of
   a common system of issuance of sovereign debt in the Eurozone, commonly
   referred to as Eurobonds. Therefore, the objective of this research is
   to provide analytical information necessary to understand the possible
   solutions to the problems of public debt.},

Abstract = {This paper explores Internet tools used for consensus building during
   the 2010 Italian regional elections, especially focusing on the use of
   the Internet to involve the electorate in a background of political
   disaffection. Previous experience from the United States and European
   countries suggests that the Internet is an interesting tool for the
   creation and development of consensus and shows an increasing use of
   Internet-based communication for elections. In this context, the
   research has two objectives. The first is to measure the degree of use
   of Internet tools by the main candidates to develop participation in
   several local areas, more limited than those traditionally investigated
   in the literature. To this end, we used the technique of analysis of
   site functionality, properly integrated to make it suitable for
   measuring the use of tools for participation, to compute for each
   candidate a reliable index of participation. Second, the work aims to
   understand how different contexts of electoral competition may encourage
   or lessen the inclination to use Internet communication tools in a
   participative sense. The analysis reveals a positive correlation between
   the affiliation of the candidate for the ruling party and the tendency
   for this candidate to use tools of participation more than the
   competitor.},

Abstract = {In places where human rights will be constantly be under threat, for
   instance in vulnerable, off-Earth communities living in extreme
   environments in the future, will art have the potential to support us to
   break out or withstand? How will it enable us to share alternatives that
   challenge or disrupt those who subdue us? Drawing upon a fleeting,
   firsthand experience of art making, one that leads from the field of
   astronomy beyond art to a moment of political change, art in this
   context is situated as highly adaptive and evolving, as one node of
   political reality that shapes and is shaped by its social and political
   conditions. As I experiment to take the contingent qualities of a poetic
   experience of drawing in the dark into prose, this paper explores how
   art connects to the politics that surround it-how art has the capacity
   to change us.},

Abstract = {We examine whether circuit court judges sacrifice policy purity for
   career goals. We compare the behavior of contender judges-those most
   likely to be elevated to the Supreme Court-during vacancy periods with
   their behavior outside vacancy periods. We also examine the behavior of
   noncontender judges during those same times. The data show that during
   vacancy periods, contender judges are more likely to vote consistently
   with the president's preferences, to rule in favor of the United States,
   and to write dissenting opinions. Noncontender judges fail to evidence
   such behavior. These findings provide empirical support for the argument
   that federal judges adapt their behavior to specific audiences, and
   provide new avenues for research into judges' goals and the role of
   audiences in judicial decision making.},

Year = {2016},
Number = {1},
Pages = {104-120},
Abstract = {According to the author of the article, the personalisation of politics
   by the mass media, and an increased focus on the leaders of the major
   parties in parliamentary democracies, especially on whoever is prime
   minister, leads to an exaggeration of the contribution of the top leader
   to the policy process and to unrealistic expectations of the role this
   leader can play across the entire policy spectrum. It is also linked to
   a naive and unsubstantiated belief that a `strong leader', in the sense
   of one who maximises his or her personal power, dominates his or her
   Cabinet and political party, and attempts to take all the big decisions
   in different areas of policy, constitutes the most admirable and
   successful type of leadership. In reality, insists Professor Brown,
   effective leadership is more often than not collective and collegial.
   While it is clear that groups and governments, even within democracies,
   are also not immune from making foolish, damaging and sometimes
   arbitrary decisions, the likelihood of this happening is substantially
   greater under unconstrained, or only weakly constrained, personal rule.
   When a leader can carry the day through the exercise of individual
   power, by pulling rank - rather than through a process of persuasion of
   colleagues of independent standing who are not afraid to provide
   counter-arguments and to question the conclusions of the top leader -
   then the incidence of mistakes with tragic consequences will mount. It
   is time to take a fresh look at the advantages of collective and
   collegial leadership and to appreciate the value to be derived from the
   talents, diversity of experience and political insights of a larger and
   more representative group than that which typically surrounds the top
   leader.},

Journal = {CANADIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {56-71},
Abstract = {Survey-based evidence gathered over the past several decades suggests
   that substantial minorities of the Canadian public associate immigrants
   with crime and crime with immigrants. In this note, we ask whether the
   myth of immigrant criminality imputed to the public is not itself a
   myth. We question whether the connection is a salient and enduring part
   of the public's mindset or whether it is largely an artifact of the
   closed-ended items employed to explore the topic. We argue that
   responses to closed-ended questions on this topic are affected by a
   ``halo effect{''} response bias - a tendency to associated positive
   attributes with positively evaluated targets and negative attributes to
   negatively evaluated targets. In support, we show (1) that responses to
   open-ended questions tell a very different story, (2) that attitudes
   toward immigrants strongly predict the likelihood of making the
   immigrant-crime connection when closed-ended items are used, and (3)
   that priming a possible immigrant-criminal linkage in a survey enhances
   this likelihood for subsequent items.},

Journal = {OSTEUROPA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {66},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {177+},
Abstract = {The domestic political changes under the government of the Law and
   Justice party has caused certitudes about Poland's role in the European
   Union to totter. Yesterday's model pupil is now creating serious
   problems. This is proven by the launching of rule of law proceedings
   against Poland over its Constitutional Court Law. The refugee crisis
   shows that European solidarity no longer works. This has led to
   disillusionment in Brussels and Berlin. But in energy, neighbourhood,
   and Russia policy, as well as in the controversy surrounding the gas
   pipeline Nord Stream 2, Poland needs precisely these two partners.
   Poland is at risk of structural marginalisation within the EU, because
   it is withdrawing from central fields of policy, such as the euro,
   Schengen border agreement, and asylum policy. The Law and Justice camp
   is increasingly calling into question EU mechanisms of functioning.
   Simultaneously, Europe's positive image in society is eroding. Poland's
   European calling faces a historic test.},

Title = {Patriotism, black politics and racial justice in America},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {371-389},
Abstract = {Recent decades have seen an upsurge in interest in patriotism among
   progressive intellectuals and within progressive politics, while recent
   manifestations of black politics in the era of President Barack Obama
   have utilized patriotic narratives. We question this turn to patriotism
   on the grounds that it is a questionable manner in which to pursue
   racial justice in our post-Civil Rights political landscape. Patriotic
   appeals to civic virtue always invoke or imply the anti-patriot who
   lacks that virtue and is therefore less capable of exercising exemplary
   citizenship. This idea of the anti-patriot, however, easily coalesces
   with and buttresses the language of cultural pathology used historically
   to argue that African-Americans are deficient in civic virtue and key
   for reproducing racial inequality. The idea of the anti-patriot could
   thus provide another vocabulary for displacing responsibility for
   addressing racial inequality away from white Americans and onto black
   Americans. After illuminating this dynamic at work in some of the most
   successful African-American patriotic thinkers-Frederick Douglass,
   Martin Luther King, Jr., and Barack Obama-we conclude by arguing that
   those concerned with racial justice should reject patriotism in favor of
   three alternative traditions in African-American political thought:
   self-examination, prophecy, and rage.},

Pages = {265-286},
Abstract = {Current measures of political knowledge have limited construct validity,
   severely restricting our ability to draw from them either empirical or
   normative conclusions about the public's level of political knowledge.
   Using a unique survey, I show that respondents' level of political
   knowledge relative to their knowledge of other subjects is very
   sensitive to question choice. Indeed, an individual researcher's
   selection of questions will change the normative implications of the
   results. The lack of construct validity for measures of political
   knowledge-one of the foundational pillars of research on political
   behavior-suggests a desperate need for new, reliable measures of
   knowledge that fairly assess voter knowledge and, by extension,
   competence.},

Abstract = {The article looks at the current restructuring of Italian Welfare
   putting it into perspective with both the structural contradictions of
   contemporary capitalism and the more contingent and specific conditions
   of contemporary Italy. Relying on the approach taken by the political
   economy of the Welfare State, the variegated neoliberalization studies
   and the concept of referentiel, the process is considered and analysed
   both in its semiotic and material elements. Looking at the
   transformations of the key-actors in the pre-crisis Welfare Mix
   arrangement, an on-going entrepreneurial and financial change is
   identified, opening the door to two, complementary, scenarios: a
   smart-utopia private Welfare one for those able to pay and a repressive
   residual Welfare state for the poor.},

   Court in 2014-15 in relation with the secessionist process started in
   Catalonia in 2012. Most of the cases follow the procedure of section
   161.2 Spanish Constitution and Title V of the Organic Law of the
   Constitutional Court. They are focused on i) the constitutionality of
   two resolutions passed by the Catalan Parliament on the right to decide,
   the sovereignty of Catalan people and the beginning of the political and
   constituent processes and ii) the regulation and exercise of the
   instruments to reach the secessionist process followed until now: a
   so-called popular consultation without referendum and a participatory
   process. The rulings take into account the contradiction of the norms
   and acts contested with the Constitution, in both substantive and
   allocation of powers perspectives. For the Court the constitutional
   amendment is ineluctable to confront the secessionist process. We
   conclude that the Constitutional Court assumes in the different rulings
   differently the obligations of a pluralist and of a constitutional
   democracy.},

Abstract = {Family is the private institution par excellence; however, it is subject
   to political intervention. In this article, we reflect on the
   ideological components that underlie public policies affecting the
   family and what they mean in the context in which they are activated. We
   analyze the Plan Integral de Apoyo a la Familia 20152017, drawn up by
   the Spanish government. In the current phase of reactivation of
   neoliberal policies, the family is intended to strengthen its functions
   of protection and care of its members, in line with the gradual
   reduction of public responsibilities by the state. In this context,
   maternity protection is essential, since it focuses the role of women as
   mothers and caregivers. Thus, changes in the agenda of the family
   correspond to changes in the equality agenda.},

   in a peaceful direction by facilitating a Pan-European dialogue during
   the second half of the Cold War -(1972-1990), and what lessons we can
   learn from it today in terms of dialogue facilitation, so as to raise
   the profile of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
   and reduce international tensions. It is based on the hypothesis that
   the csce facilitated the `multilateralisation of European security'
   through dialogue, and stabilised European relations by turning security
   into a joint venture. This article concludes with ten recommendations
   for facilitating dialogue through the osce so as to multilateralise
   European security again today.},

   which have been occurring in countries where governments have been
   unable to prevent human rights violations or have not the intention to
   do it. The method used is the speech analysis and the research technic
   is bibliographic, recognizing that intervention is efficient if used
   exclusively in the humanitarian rationale and when the States do not
   perform any abuse. The idea is exemplified by the conflicts in Southern
   Sudan, where, although an armistice was signed, a tragic result was
   left, since thousands of people were killed or became homeless, among
   other cases of intervention in the States' territories. Finally, the
   international community assessment, regarding meddling, facilitates
   acting in crises circumstances and prevents the usage of this mechanism
   for purely selfish reasons justified by humanitarian arguments, which
   represents an unacceptable attack on the sovereignty.},

Abstract = {What does it mean today to talk about intersectionality or, better,
   about intersectional approaches within the vast and fragmented field of
   Feminist Studies? And how can intersectionality help to understand the
   development of transnational feminism, and viceversa? By offering a
   brief critical genealogy of the notion of intersectionality, from the
   systemic to the anti -categorical positions that have characterized the
   debate on this notion, the essay tries to present a reading of the main
   questions that stemmed from thinking the interaction of the many power
   differentials and identity markers (gender, race, class, age,
   disabilities, etc.) that constitute regional, national and transnational
   subjectivities. In adopting an anti-categorical stance, this work
   attempts at showing how feminism has changed thanks to different, yet
   complementary, perspectives on the positioning and the intersectional
   formations of the subject, and thanks to the relational and
   transnational struggles that have been imagined in order to redefine a
   feminist gaze be it theoretical, methodological or epistemological at
   every level of social, cultural and political life.},

Abstract = {This chapter provides an analysis on how the protection-obedience
   relationship between states and contemporary citizens has transformed.
   It discusses the hypothesis that contemporary politics in liberal states
   has led to a reshaping of liberalism as an ideological system, which has
   involved the establishment of new antagonisms with foundations distant
   from the rational use of power and closer to justifications from
   theology. One of the important inputs of the chapter is the explanation
   offered on the exercise of sovereignty in contemporary liberal states;
   the social contract is currently represented in the irrational and
   violent act of sacrifice of liberties in the name of an ``idea of
   freedom.{''} The argumentative strategy employed in the chapter involves
   a relationship between two temporarily distant authors, but close in
   their stand against liberalism: Carl Schmitt and Slavoj Zizek. The
   chapter concludes stating that the 21st century liberalism is
   characterized by the defense of authoritarian relations between state
   and citizen, contrary to the principles that, in the very heart of
   liberalism, have given rise to state and citizenship. In liberalism, the
   sacrifice of practices of freedom is justifiable to strengthen the
   ideological subjection of citizens to this doctrine in the
   theoretical-ideological level.},

Abstract = {Whiteley et al. criticize our re-analysis of the valence model of party
   choice. In reply, we argue that they are mistaken with regard to their
   understanding of some of the claims made in our paper and, in one
   instance, the variables included in the analysis. We also point to flaws
   in their interpretation of the distinction between weak and
   contemporaneous endogeneity and the assumptions of their vector error
   correction model. Their argument privileging aggregate analysis
   introduces predictable inferential problems and also, it might be
   suggested, potentially casts doubt on their own research, which uses
   individual-level analysis to make the case for the valence model. For
   these reasons, we see no reason to moderate the negative implications of
   our analysis for the validity of the model.},

Abstract = {Numerous studies conclude that countries in which citizens express
   higher levels of satisfaction with democracy also tend to display higher
   levels of voter turnout in national elections. Yet it is difficult to
   draw causal inferences from this positive cross-sectional relationship,
   because democracies feature many historical, cultural, and institutional
   differences that are not easily controlled for in cross-sectional
   comparisons. We apply an alternative, temporal approach to this issue by
   asking the question: Are over-time declines (increases) in aggregate
   levels of satisfaction within democracies associated with increases
   (declines) in levels of voter turnout within these democracies? Our
   temporal analysis of this relationship in 12 democracies over the period
   1976-2011 reveals a pattern that is the opposite of that suggested by
   previous cross-sectional studies: namely, we find that over-time
   increases in citizens' satisfaction with democracy are associated with
   significant decreases in voter turnout in national elections in these
   countries.},

Abstract = {Transnational media corporations now wield enormous power and influence.
   Never has this been displayed so starkly and so shockingly as in the
   revelations that emerged during the Leveson Inquiry into the culture and
   ethics of the press in the UK. This paper considers the implications of
   the relationship between media elites and political elites for
   democratic culture and media reform. The paper argues that the culture
   of press-politician mutual interest in which media executives and party
   leaders collude will continue as long as the solutions proffered focus

Volume = {45},

Pages = {1-12},
Abstract = {The political science literature distinguishes two basic types of
   research designs: x- and y-centered. The article argues for the
   distinction of a third basic type: the ``contrastive{''} design. The
   three designs differ in the number of relevant theories and in whether
   they see theories as competing or complementary. The typological
   differentiation of the contrastive research design helps to clarify the
   pros and cons of x- and y-centered designs. The article uses exemplary
   studies (experimental and observational, quantitative and qualitative)
   to illustrate the characteristics of the three designs as well as the
   possibilities of combining them. The contrastive design also constitutes
   a common element of the quantitative and qualitative research,
   ``cultures{''}.},

Abstract = {This chapter aims to restore, from solidarity, liberal socialism, which
   seeks to guarantee the ultimate goal of human rights and freedom of
   individuals through society. After some theoretical failed attempts due
   to the absence of a real action that urges people to contribute to the
   collective interests, a redesign of liberal socialism is justified for
   its effectiveness and practice. After tracing the origin and presenting
   the foundation of liberal socialism, this work seeks to integrate
   solidarity to its theoretical and procedural basis to guide human social
   relations, trying to obtain the desired practical effects of achieving
   freedom through society. In conclusion, it is demonstrated how
   solidarity would fulfill the purpose of liberal socialism and, thus, its
   restoration.},

Abstract = {What is a duty of justice? And how is it different from a duty of
   beneficence? We need a clear account of the contrast. Unfortunately,
   there is no consensus in the philosophical literature as to how to
   characterize it. Different articulations of it have been provided, but
   it is hard to identify a common core that is invariant across them. In
   this paper, I propose an account of how to understand duties of justice,
   explain how it contrasts with several proposals as to how to distinguish
   justice and beneficence, respond to some objections, and suggest further
   elaborations of it. The conceptual exploration pursued in this paper has
   practical stakes. A central aim is to propose and defend a capacious
   concept of justice that makes a direct discussion of important demands
   of justice (domestic and global) possible. Duties of justice can be
   positive besides negative, they can be imperfect as well as perfect,
   they can range over personal besides institutional contexts, they can
   include multiple associative reasons such us non-domination,
   non-exploitation, and reciprocity, and they can even go beyond existing
   national, political, and economic associative frameworks to embrace
   strictly universal humanist concerns. We should reject ideological
   abridgments of the concept of justice that render these possibilities,
   and the important human interests and claims they may foster, invisible.},

Abstract = {The World Health Organization (WHO) formally seeks so ambiguous goals
   that make it difficult to design mechanisms to achieve them. A review of
   the regulations and the budget of the WHO leads to the following
   assumptions about the ambiguity that it faces: 1) finally, the WHO focus
   in pursuing more practical goals that can be addressed with the
   instruments it have; 2) the most practical goals are not defined by a
   single actor, they are the result of the interaction between the members
   of the Concrete Action System of the WHO, that are its bureaucratic
   apparatus, private companies and donor country representatives; 3) the
   WHO bureaucracy has a tendency to concentrate on more practical goals,
   such as combating communicable diseases, for which it have effective
   instruments; 4) for the national representatives it is preferable to
   concentrate on communicable diseases because they can take advantage of
   developments in vaccines in other countries or firms; and 5) private
   donor companies also prefer to concentrate efforts on communicable
   diseases so they can contribute giving what they already produce, such
   as vaccines. Deviating from ambiguous goals to concentrate on more
   practical issues is the result of strategic processes in which the
   actors face the ambiguity while pursuing their own interests, but also
   achieve, in part, the formal goals of the organization.},

Journal = {AUSTRIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Pages = {51-64},
Abstract = {Equality of opportunity and meritocracy are common catchwords of the
   legitimation of educational reforms. In the 20th century, a
   comprehensive school reform was one major reform project that was
   expected to reduce educational inequalities. Yet, very different
   concepts of equality, merit and achievement dominated the heated debates
   over a comprehensive school which remain controversial until today.
   Drawing on the example of Luxembourg, the article analyses main
   political arguments for and against a comprehensive school reform. Based
   on expert interviews and historical documents, the authors show how
   different political approaches to equality are connected with specific
   concepts of merit as well as the social reproduction of national elites.},

Abstract = {Scholars agree that international law works in part by empowering
   activists and have elaborated activist-focused theories particularly in
   the domains of environment and human rights. Some theories emphasize
   accountability-that law helps activists coerce, punish, and deter
   offenders. Others emphasize that law helps to foster dialogue that leads
   to the acceptance of norms, trust, and capacity to foster compliance.
   Possibly, law does both. We assess these views with a pair of survey
   experiments applied to 243 highly experienced NGO professionals who have
   firsthand experience in either environment or human rights. Activists
   believe that NGOs would be less effective at reducing emissions of
   greenhouse gases or violations of core human rights in the absence of
   international law. They see the chief value of law arising through
   accountability politics rather than by fostering dialogue or capacity.
   However, the two communities have different views about whether binding
   or nonbinding agreements work best in their domain.},

Abstract = {This article argues that it is no longer tenable to qualify the Court's
   non-discrimination jurisprudence overall as `poor'. Indeed, a different
   speed of development is noted for the ` prohibition of invidious
   discrimination' track and the ` duties of differential treatment' track.
   In cases concerning invidious discrimination, the Court tends to engage
   explicitly with the complaint in terms of the prohibition of
   discrimination, while adopting high levels of scrutiny in regard to
   differentiations on the basis of ethnicity and religion. Admittedly,
   there are ongoing flaws in the jurisprudence on the allocation of the
   burden of proof, and particularly the identification of a prima facie
   case of direct discrimination. Nevertheless, the Court seems to be
   willing to test the boundaries. A markedly different picture emerges
   concerning duties of differential treatment. The analysis of the
   selected case law confirms that the Court avoids as much as possible
   nondiscrimination analysis in cases on claims to official recognition of
   separate identities and ways of life of ethnic and religious minorities.
   The Court prefers to conduct its analysis of the related complaints
   about a lack of accommodation in terms of articles 8 and 9 of the ECHR
   respectively.
   Arguably, demands for reasonable accommodation of different ethnic and
   religious identities are on the rise in the current era of
   globalisation. While the Court is not supposed to impose uniform
   standards, it remains important that it provides guidance about the
   benchmarks that contracting states need to take into account when
   developing policies, legislation, and practices, in order to live up to
   their commitment to respect fundamental rights. Consequently, the Court
   is urged to engage more explicitly and properly in non-discrimination
   analysis, also in relation to complaints about a lack of differential
   treatment (accommodation), while identifying and weighing the respective
   interests.},

Abstract = {In some areas in Europe and Sweden, it is possible to find institutional
   deficits, that is, areas wherein the welfare state has more or less
   withdrawn its institutions. In parallel with this development, greater
   interest has shifted towards social work already being conducted by
   volunteers and non-profit organizations. How this social work could take
   on more responsibility for the social well-being of society is a key
   question. By applying the theory of `production of projects', this
   article examines 13 projects conducted by civil society organizations in
   Sweden and how they could relate to the civil sector becoming a
   complement or even an alternative to the state welfare sector. In terms
   of competition for funding, the projects need to be able to package
   their ideas well and manage relationships with the beneficiaries. The
   lack of long-term alternatives and the demand for innovative ideas
   influence the civil sector's ability to take more responsibility for the
   social well-being of society and make political influence more
   difficult.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a historical overview of the emerging post-Islamist
   phenomenon in the Muslim world and discusses the scope for sustainable
   democratic politics in Bangladesh. In the process, a model is proposed
   that purports to exhibit a level of compatibility with the perceived
   political landscape in Bangladesh. The model adopts a version of the
   Hotelling-Downs principle of democracy and sets it within the
   `post-Islamist' paradigm in such a way that, if it can be implemented,
   even if only partially, may lead to the sustained political stability of
   Bangladesh. The paper highlights illiberal and undemocratic practices of
   the two dominant Bangladeshi political parties as a major feature of the
   present status quo. These practices dominate Bangladeshi politics
   through the continuous attempts of their exponents to impose
   monopolistic views on the various symbols of national identity, despite
   the multi-racial, multi-religious nature of Bangladesh society. The
   paper concludes that a democratic system of politics, which accommodates
   aspects of secularism, language, Muslim identity and post-Islamist
   `Islamic ethical-moral-legal codes', remains the feasible political
   discourse for forming and consolidating the country's multi-racial,
   multi-religious national identity over the long run and its survival as
   a sovereign state.},

Abstract = {This is a study of Khomeini's two main pre-revolutionary political
   works: one, Islamic Government, in which he urges his audience to accept
   that Islam is a political religion and jurisprudents of Islamic law have
   a crucial role in government; and a second, The Unveiling of Secrets, of
   which only short excerpts have been translated into English and which
   has received scant attention by scholars outside of Iran. This latter
   work is crucial to study because in this work, he elaborates his view on
   democratic and constitutionalist principles, subjects he had treated
   only vaguely and briefly in Islamic Government. Contrary to much of the
   secondary literature produced on Khomeini, which claims that Khomeini's
   theory is simply a theory of guardianship, antithetical to participatory
   government, the article claims that in The Unveiling of Secrets, and
   (though more ambiguously) in Islamic Government, Khomeini appeals to
   democratic and constitutionalist principles to argue that the views of
   common citizens, and not just experts in Islamic law, must be heeded by
   an Islamic government. Recognizing the complexities and ambiguities of
   Khomeini's thought both in his earlier and later works allows us to
   understand and engage in dialogue with the scholars who inherit and
   critique his ideas today.},

Abstract = {For Platonov, soil plays a key role. In almost all his works, building
   ground or farmland is a central feature. Platonov works with
   pre-Christian and Christian themes such as the creation of man from
   clay. Soil stands for the beginning and the end, for birth and death,
   for utopia and anti-utopia. It represents the mother principle and the
   feminine and is associated with birth and protection, sex and sexual
   intercourse.},

   from the 2012 Russian presidential elections},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {191-211},
Abstract = {In authoritarian regimes, election polls can be vastly polluted by
   measurement error, namely the social desirability bias, which can
   contribute to substantial inflation in the publicized estimates of an
   autocrat's electoral support and voter turnout, seeming to validate
   falsified election outcomes that match the inflated estimates. This
   study provides an in-depth analysis of the magnitude of social
   desirability bias in polling estimates released before and after the
   2012 Russian presidential elections by focusing on the implications of
   NoelleNeumann's ``spiral of silence{''} theory. The empirical data
   analysis is based on list experiments from four data samples collected
   during the Russian presidential campaign. The estimated magnitude of the
   social desirability bias in Putin's electoral support is statistically
   significant and reaches approximately 15\%. For voter turnout, however,
   I find social desirability bias of the same order as in Western
   democracies. My main conclusions are further validated by an alternative
   urns experiment conducted by one of the national pollsters. The
   detection of significant social desirability bias in the Russian
   presidential campaign raises the issue of survey research quality in
   authoritarian regimes and its effect on election outcomes.},

Title = {Looking for the European Voter: Split-Ticket Voting in the Belgian
   Regional and European Elections of 2009 and 2014},

Abstract = {While European elections are often seen as remote from EU issues,
   considerations specifically linked to the EU came to the forefront in
   the wake of the 2014 European elections: the economic and financial
   crisis, the new process of designation of the European Commission
   President, and the alleged increase of Eurosceptic votes. This increased
   salience of political debates about the EU asks for a reconsideration of
   the `second-order nature' of European elections. In this context, as in
   2009, the Belgian electorate voted for the regional and European levels
   on the very same day. Belgian voters were thus offered the opportunity
   to split their ticket between both levels. This allows comparing the
   occurrence and determinants of these `immediate switching' behaviours in
   2014 with those of the presumably less politicized EP elections in 2009.
   We do that by employing the 2009 and 2014 PartiRep Election Study data.
   On the one hand, the article shows that split-ticket voting cannot be
   explained by economic voting, European identity, and attitudes towards
   integration in 2014. On the other hand, the unique configuration of the
   Belgian elections enables us to observe that the introduction of
   Spitzenkandidaten did enhance split-ticket voting for voters who could
   directly vote for this candidate (in Flanders), while this did not
   increase split-ticket voting among voters who could only indirectly
   support the candidate (in Wallonia).},

Abstract = {Populism has been a phenomenon with growing significance in the part
   years in both the European political systems and a political science.
   There has been a number of businessman who enter electoral politics
   directly with a new type of party projects. Projects of businessman
   cannot be analyzed simply as any other ``traditional{''} political party
   because there is a strong mobilization aspect present. Therefore, the
   main goal of this paper was to apply analytic framework of social
   movement studies. Dimensions of analysis were membership and
   recruitment, a mobilization of material resources, a mobilization of
   ideological and political resources and repertoire of action. The
   analysis was performed on three cases of the Czech entrepreneurial
   populism Andrej Babis, Tomio Okamura and Karel Janeoek. The analysis
   shows that despite quite significant differences in membership and
   recruitment dimension and a material resources mobilization there were
   found similarities in the dimension of ideological and political
   resources mobilization. This approach showed being useful in comparing
   cases that are quite different considering organizational aspect of
   them, but similar as being representatives of a broader phenomenon
   namely political projects of businessmen.},

   IMAGES OF NORTH KOREA},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Pages = {8-35},
Abstract = {The paper presents an analysis of the portrayal of North Korea in the
   contemporary discourse of the two largest Japanese newspapers: the
   conservative Yomiuri Shimbun and the more left-wing oriented Asahi
   Shimbun. Analysed patterns and discursive practices in the two major
   national media outlets attempt to construct a certain notion of national
   identity, albeit through the use of different means and key ideas.
   Drawing on a post-structuralist understanding of language and discourse
   and theory of national identity based on the relational dichotomy
   between Self and Other, this study attempts to explain the construction
   of national identity in Japanese print media discourse, demonstrating
   the link between linguistic and societal practices. While Japan is
   portrayed as organised, democratic, rational and cooperative, North
   Korea is associated with discursive practices evoking irrationality,
   unpredictability and danger, often conveniently represented directly by
   Kim Jong-un. The newspapers tend to either stress the hard security
   aspect of the current status quo or emphasise harsh criticism of North
   Korea while simultaneously posing Japan as a victim. Furthermore, the
   findings suggest that the Self as well as the Other are rather fluid and
   context dependent. Given the link between Japanese politics and media,
   outlets with a high level of trustworthiness and credibility may
   significantly influence the readers' perception of their own identity
   and security. Ultimately, this raises questions about the possibility of
   the country's normalisation of its foreign and security policies.},

   ties between distinct regions and powers within the international system

   compares existing approaches to transregionalism conceptualization,
   analyzes the differences in the use of terms, and discusses the global
   impact of transregional relations on world politics and economy. The
   author advocates a term transregionalism (instead of interregionalism,

Title = {How the CT Community Failed to Anticipate the Islamic State},
Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {199-210},
Abstract = {This article is a critique of the dominant approach within the
   counter-terrorism (CT) community that failed to analyze IS's trajectory
   as a distinct group since at least 2006. We argue that two factors
   account for this failure. The first concerns the Authorization for the
   Use of Military Force (AUMF), the law that was enacted in the wake of
   the 9/11 attacks, providing options to the U.S. President to authorize
   the use of Armed Forces ``against those responsible{''} for the 9/11
   attacks. We contend that this law served as an incentive to lump
   regional jihadi groups under the AQ umbrella instead of discerning their
   differences. The second factor concerns what we term as the ``al-Qa`ida
   fixation,{''} it has to do with a post-9/11 bias towards understanding
   the threat emanating from jihadi groups around the world through the
   lens of AQ. This translated into falsely constructing a so-called
   ``al-Qaeda Central{''} in the business of `franchising' its brand and
   cloning its violent operations by establishing regional jihadi groups
   that served as its ``affiliates{''} and carried out its orders. In the
   post-9/11 era, these two factors fed off each other. Our critique is not
   meant to suggest that the CT community is expected to predict the
   unpredictable, and we also recognize that one gains greater clarity with

Abstract = {Aristotle is undoubtedly one of the greatest philosophers of western
   culture, whose influence is current in contemporary thought. One of his
   most important works is ``Politics{''}, where it can be found examples
   of his epistemological notions associated with the Greek society and the
   city. This work also defines the parameters for the proper functioning
   of the ideal city, which finite size and structure was supposed to
   ensure self-sufficiency and well living for everyone in the community.
   From this perspective, this paper analyzes and discusses Aristotelian
   thought and epistemology, the link between the Greek ideal social order
   and its associated spaces, his vision of the ideal city and the
   historical evolution of the concept of Aristotelian infinity of space
   that always turns into the notion of limit.},

Abstract = {What is the relationship between how a war ends and the post-war
   political order? Civil wars that end in rebel victory follow distinct
   war-to-peace transitions compared to the more often analyzed cases of
   negotiated settlement and internationally supported peacebuilding. In
   the cases of Uganda, Ethiopia, and Rwanda, the insurgents used the
   war-to-peace transition to transform their military institutions into
   authoritarian political parties and to consolidate power. It is not
   surprising that the winning military party becomes the post-war ruling
   party, but it is less obvious why victorious insurgents so often become
   powerful authoritarian parties. Using the cases of Uganda, Ethiopia, and
   Rwanda, this article argues that the legacies of protracted civil war
   and the imperatives of the war-to-peace transitions following victory
   provide the mechanism that links victory by insurgents to the creation
   of strong authoritarian parties.},

Abstract = {In this article, I will examine the notion of Corporate Social
   Responsibility (CSR), which is increasingly presented as the socially
   acceptable way to deal with ethical, social and environmental issues
   stemming from economic activities. Using a public problems framework of
   analysis, I will build upon empirical work in the field of
   bio-engineering in order to argue that, on the contrary, CSR is a
   contentious notion. I will demonstrate that this is because CSR
   increases corporations' involvement in the shaping of the definitions
   and solutions to our public problems and is thus based on a distribution
   of power and responsibility which is seen as potentially securing the
   power of corporations rather than offsetting it. In addition, this
   distribution does not correspond to most social actors' representation
   of how power and responsibility should be shared in our society.},

Abstract = {The House of Commons select committees witnessed some of the most
   constructive political theatre of the 2010-2015 Parliament. Recall
   Rupert Murdoch's public contrition, Margaret Hodge's assault on MNC tax
   evasion and Keith Vaz's timely interrogations of G4S, etc. The
   committees also embraced social media and adopted public engagement as a
   key task. These developments all reflect a newly emboldened system. In
   recent months, four reports have been published which reflect on these
   developments. They also look forward to the further substantial
   development of committee activity. The system thus sets sail with an
   abundance of specific suggestions, including ideas that could have far
   wider and more far-reaching democratic implications.},

Abstract = {Received wisdom in most democracies is that voting should be seen as a
   political freedom that citizens have a right to exercise at their
   discretion. But I propose that we have a duty to vote, albeit a duty to
   vote well: with knowledge and a sense of impartiality. Fulfillment of
   this obligation would contribute to the epistemic advantages of
   democracy, and would thereby instantiate the duty to promote and support
   just institutions.},

Pages = {85-113},
Abstract = {Why do some democratic allies prematurely withdraw from ongoing military
   US-led coalition operations? Why are some democratic allies more
   reliable than others? This article proposes a multifactorial integrated
   framework consisting of several causal mechanisms drawn from
   ideological, domestic, and alliance explanations of premature defection.
   It compares and contrasts two neglected case studies, namely the
   Canadian and Dutch withdrawal of combat troops from NATO's
   counterinsurgency mission in southern Afghanistan. The comparative
   analysis finds that democratic institutional designs, parliamentary war
   powers, leadership turnover, as well alliance dependence and threat
   perceptions did not play a meaningful role in both cases of premature
   defection. It rather finds that domestic elite consensus interacted with
   electoral calculations to account for pullout choices. Right-wing
   ideological beliefs held by state executives also slowed down the
   decision to withdraw, and alliance pressures interacted with domestic
   elite consensus to account for commitment renewal into a noncombat
   mission. The article concludes with some implications for the theory of
   democratic alliance reliability.},

Abstract = {This article deals with the international fallout from Erich Honecker's
   entrance into the Chilean embassy in Moscow in 1991. This process became
   one of the most confusing episodes in the recent history of Chilean
   foreign affairs. The study analyzes the internal political effects of
   Honecker's case, focusing on two significant points of view: first, the
   conflict between the executive and legislative branches of government;
   and second, the positions adopted by political parties in response to
   the situation. The research is based on an exhaustive analysis of
   diplomatic primary sources, records from the Chamber of Deputies, and
   media archives.},

Abstract = {From the results of a multi-situated ethnographic study, this article
   describes and historicizes two processes closely associated with the
   political practices and the exercise of transnational citizenship in the
   case of the Uruguayan residents in Argentina. The first is the process
   of nationalization of the demand for the right to extraterritorial vote;
   the second is the institutionalization of management, mobilization and
   movement of the frenteamplista electorate. In this paper, both processes
   officiate as an access to a transnational political and civic practices
   that, usually, has been little explored by the specific literature:
   asymmetries and iniquities reproduced in transnational action that, in
   this case, paradoxically, the native perspective presented as a possible
   answer to the inequality generated by the absence of a regulatory
   framework to able ``remote voting{''}.},

   Many people are facing an identity crisis. Two and a half years after
   the outbreak of violence in the so-called people's republics of the
   Donetsk and Luhansk, they see that their homeland will not become a part
   of Russia. They do not wish to return to the Ukrainian state. The frozen
   conflict is reinforcing a regional sense of self-image that has
   isolationist traits. The leadership of the quasi-state entities and the
   members of the volunteer combat forces speak increasingly of a ``Donbass
   nation{''} or the ``Luhansk people{''}.},

Abstract = {Compared with the United States' much-celebrated security collaboration
   with its more formal Asian allies, it is fair to say that its security
   cooperation with Indonesia is ``still under the radar.{''} Cooperation
   is limited not only by domestic pressure in the United States with
   regard to human rights issues, but also from Indonesia's perspective
   that U.S. policy consistency is often found wanting. Bilateral security
   relations appear to be relevant in the contemporary Southeast Asian
   security environment, given increasing tensions in the South China Sea
   and emerging challenges relating to counterterrorism. This relevance is
   qualified, however, by both countries' policymakers' tendencies to be
   intermittently detached-if not actually disinterested-in each other's
   core national security objectives. This article examines the development
   of Indonesia-U.S. defense and security relations, analyzing how
   Indonesia views U.S. presence in the region, and to what degree its own
   interests and policies benefit from or are complicated by security
   cooperation with the United States.},

Title = {Measuring Political Brands: An Art and a Science of Mapping the Mind},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {70-95},
Abstract = {The field of political brands has developed a host of approaches and
   explored a variety of cases over the last years. However, less attention
   has been devoted to brand measurement- specifically efforts to construct
   a measure that attempts to explain the relationship between voters and
   parties. Against this backdrop, this article discusses how to measure a
   political brand by first selecting one part of the diverse brand concept
   for further investigation. Next, the two existing brand measures in the
   literature are evaluated, and the article proposes an alternative
   measure that underlines a stronger connection to the immense political
   science literature on voters and parties. Then, the three measures are
   compared by empirically investigating which measure is best at
   explaining voters' party sympathy. Here, it is demonstrated that the
   alternative measure seems to be the most valid and reliable construct
   when it comes to explaining voters' sympathy for a particular party.
   Finally, the proposed alternative measure is further validated in a
   representative sample ( N = 2251), establishing a preliminary
   correlation between party brand and voter sympathy.},

Abstract = {Georg Lukacs's notion of totality and its relation to the formation of
   revolutionary subjectivity has been heavily criticized by both Marxists
   and non-Marxists. Interrogating the critiques of totality elaborated by
   Lyotard, Althusser, Deleuze, and others, this essay aims to show that
   rather than constituting rejections of Lukacsian totality, these
   critiques elaborate a moment in the process of totalization as it is
   conceived by Lukacs. Contrasting these critiques to Lukacs's writing,
   the essay develops a concept of immanent totality. The concept is used
   to argue that postmodern revenge movies, from the blaxploitation films
   of the 1970s to Tarantino's films of the 2000s, unconsciously allegorize
   the totalizing process required for the production of a revolutionary
   subject. The analysis ends by suggesting that rather than trying to rid
   Marxist theorizing of a positive transcendent horizon, the challenge of
   revolutionary theory today resides in elaborating a positive
   revolutionary theory along Lukacsian lines.},

Abstract = {Gender quotas have emerged globally as a key solution for improving
   women's political representation. Yet in Britain-where they take the
   form of all-women short-lists (AWS)-they remain contentious, both within
   and outside political parties. We identify nine common criticisms of AWS
   in the British context, related to candidate recruitment and selection,
   party and voter support and the effectiveness of `quota women' as
   politicians. Using qualitative and quantitative data, we find that these
   objections do not hold when subjected to rigorous empirical analysis,
   suggesting that quotas do not pose a threat to `merit' at any stage of
   the political process.},

Abstract = {This chapter contains a critical analysis of the main proposals of
   Ernesto Laclau, who belonged to the contemporary generation of
   post-structuralist and post-Marxist philosophers that developed a
   political philosophy nurtured by French theoretical-political
   frameworks, psychoanalysis, and discourse theory. The idea of discursive
   constitution of the social, the emergence of political subjects, and the
   hegemonic operations proposed by Laclau are discussed, establishing a
   relationship with political anthropology works. The main purpose of this
   approach is to answer the common question asked to these currents on the
   abstraction of their analytical lines and the lack of more concrete
   mediations for the study of social phenomena. In this case, we will try,
   on the one hand, to identify potential interpretive frameworks based on
   the relationship between Laclausian theory and political anthropology
   and, on the other, to criticize and delve into different Laclausian
   concepts from the relationship between cultural and political dynamics.
   This analysis will help us to develop some categories that allow to
   conduct an anthropological analysis based on a post-structuralist
   political framework, as well as to do a critical rereading of the latter
   from such analytical lines, fed mainly by ethnographic works.},

Abstract = {From time immemorial myths were connected with the beginning of the
   existence of civilization. Genealogic and eschatological myths
   identified the history of humankind with chaos. Every myth is in some
   way connected with politics.
   The political myths shape the public opinion. They are means of
   ideological propaganda. While they cannot adapt rules of scientific
   explanatory rules, they adhere to the ``understanding faith{''}, exclude
   discussion and interpretation. Among the genres of political myths one
   may name: spontaneous myths, adopted by individuals and social groups,
   and myths ``consciously{''} created. They are often used in politics.
   The political stereotypes are important emotional cliches in the
   conceptual system accepted by an individual. They are also universal
   mechanisms of interpersonal communication. The contemporary myths and
   stereotypes base on emotional states immune people to truth and
   falsehood.},

Abstract = {Arrow's Impossibility Theorem and Sen's Minimal Liberalism example
   impose `impossibility' roadblocks on progress. A reinterpretation
   explained in this article exposes what causes these negative
   conclusions, which permits the development of positive resolutions that
   retain the spirit of Arrow's and Sen's assumptions. What precipitates
   difficulties is surprisingly common, and it affects most disciplines.
   This insight identifies how to analyze other puzzles such as conflicting
   laws or controversies over voting rules. An unexpected bonus is that
   this social science issue defines a research agenda to address the `dark
   matter' mystery confronting astronomers.},

Title = {From Muslims into Turks? Consensual demographic engineering between
   interwar Yugoslavia and Turkey},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {427-446},
Abstract = {This article focuses on the Yugoslav-Turkish agreement on the
   resettlement of Muslims from the Serb-dominated lands of southern
   Yugoslavia to Turkey from 1938. The agreement was part of a broader
   series of state-directed population resettlement projects in the
   interwar period that had the demographic homogenization of nation-states
   in Southeastern Europe and Turkey as their ultimate goal. This study
   examines the close cooperation of Yugoslav and Turkish state
   authorities, and depicts commonalities of both states' agents on the way
   to their bilateral agreement. The two-sidedness of this study will show
   the complexity of the applied homogenizing programme, consisting in
   equal measure of policies of exclusion and resettlement, and inclusive
   and assimilative nationalizing practices. Demographic engineering will
   be used as a conceptual framework for grasping both sides of the
   nationalizing projects. Besides resettlement, other methods of
   demographic engineering will also be taken into consideration by
   examining two key documents from each country that paved the way to the
   bilateral convention on the resettlement of Muslims from Southern Serbia
   to Turkey in 1938. The results of this juxtaposition will show how
   securitization was intermingled with concepts of national selfhood and
   otherness by classifying the population into agents and enemies of the
   state. The inclusion of ethnic criteria in this classification has had
   important implications down to the present day. Through its overarching
   regional lens, this study seeks to contribute to a growing number of
   studies on (forced) migration from Yugoslavia to Turkey by avoiding the
   shortcomings of a unilateral approach.},

Abstract = {The interpretation of the Donbass conflict is highly controversial not
   only in Ukraine, but also among external observers. Two theses are
   represented particularly prominent: First, the conflict is characterized
   as a prime example of a ``hybrid war{''}; secondly, based on the
   perspective of geopolitics, the war is interpreted as the result of
   competitive, hegemonic claims of the West and Russia. However, both
   theories operate with a steering and control imperative which reduces
   the role of local actors and their agendas to dependent variables of
   great powers. By contrast, the article advocates for a
   conflict-sociological approach which clearly shows that external actors
   to a much greater extent are driven by local conflict dynamics than both
   theses would admit.},

Abstract = {In 2012, the Dutch National Coordinator for Security and
   Counterterrorism and the Dutch Probation Service launched a
   reintegration project for offenders on probation or parole who were
   (suspected to be) involved in jihadist extremism or terrorism. The
   initiative's primary goal was to reduce the chance of recidivism among
   this target group. This article presents the results of a one-year
   evaluation study (2013-2014) that assessed this initiative's underlying
   assumptions and practical implementation. A preliminary look at the
   project's effectiveness is also provided. The Dutch re-integration
   initiative was found to be based on largely realistic assumptions on how
   to successfully reintegrate terrorists and extremists, as reflected in
   an approach that encompassed both disengagement and deradicalization.
   Nevertheless, the program's first year saw mixed results, in part
   because of various obstacles encountered during its organizational
   implementation. These and other findings can serve as lessons learned
   for those interested in establishing similar programs.},

Abstract = {In the previous decade, the literature on ``relational approach{''} has
   burgeoned in the social sciences. Recently, a ``relational turn{''} in
   political science was called for in a symposium in this journal (McClurg
   and Young, 2011). The participants perceived a promising path for such a
   ``turn{''} by introducing social network analysis (SNA) into political
   science. This call is informed by a conviction that the central concept
   of political science-that is, power-is relational. Considering this
   viewpoint, this article argues that there are two different
   understandings of the connection between the qualifier ``relational{''}
   and the concept of power, referred to as the ``Anglo-American{''} and
   the ``Continental{''} perspectives. I contend that symposium
   participants conceived of the connection from only the Anglo-American
   perspective and that the Continental understanding would add extra value
   for political science.},

Abstract = {We consider the impact of the Second Reform Act, and the doubling of the
   electorate it delivered, on the linguistic complexity of speeches made
   by members of parliament in Britain. Noting that the new voters were
   generally poorer and less educated than those who already enjoyed the
   suffrage, we hypothesize that cabinet ministers had strong
   incentives-relative to other members-to appeal to these new electors
   with simpler statements during parliamentary debates. We assess this
   claim with a data set of over half a million speeches for the period
   between the Great Reform Act and Great War, along with methods for
   measuring the comprehensibility of texts-which we validate in some
   detail. The theorized relationship holds: ministers become statistically
   significantly easier to understand (on average) relative to
   backbenchers, and this effect occurs almost immediately after the 1868
   election. We show that this result is not an artifact of new personnel
   in the House of Commons.},

Abstract = {Some perceive notions of historical and political responsibility as
   synonyms, while others interpret them as independent concepts. As a
   consequence, there are numerous speculations on this matter that only
   further clouds thinking. The article explores under what conditions
   historic responsibility functions as political responsibility, when
   their problematique overlaps, and reveals how both types of
   responsibility depend on the identification of the subject of
   responsibility. On the example of the phenomenon of political
   forgiveness the author demonstrates that the idea of a homogeneous
   collective subject is mistaken and that historical responsibility,
   embodied in the various practices of political responsibility, can be
   addressed both to the past and the future.},

Title = {Is the Alternative for Germany Really Right-Wing Populist?},
Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Number = {2},
Pages = {149-163},
Abstract = {Although the Alternative for Germany (AfD) is one of the most discussed
   parties in Germany at the moment, neither journalists nor politicians
   are sure whether it should be classified as conservative, right-wing
   extremist or right-wing populist. The existing attempts at a scientific
   classification, all varying in approach and results, share a lack of
   methodological basis. Therefore, this paper classifies the AfD according
   to four different definitions by analyzing both primary and secondary
   sources in a qualitative way. While three of these approaches are rather
   common models of the right-wing spectrum, one is a new approach,
   covering only the (right-wing) populist spectrum. Therefore, the
   criteria of these four different attempts at structuring the right-wing
   party spectrum are operationalized and both party platforms and
   scientific papers on the AfD are dissected.},

Abstract = {The study analyses the political and economic relations between
   Czechoslovakia and Argentina during the military junta of 1976-1983.
   Taking into account the specific situation surrounding Czechoslovak
   foreign policy, attention is also paid to the position of the Soviet
   Union which had at that time a key influence on the policy of Prague.
   The main source consists of documents from Czech archives. They clearly
   show that the countries of the Eastern Bloc took a benevolent, even
   friendly attitude towards the Argentine military junta. This manifested
   itself for example, during the Falkland War with Great Britain, when
   Czechoslovakia, like other Eastern Bloc states, stood on the side of
   Argentina. The reason for this policy, which was in great contrast with
   the attitude towards the dictatorship in neighbouring Chile, was mainly
   the economic potential of the South American country. At that time
   Argentina became the largest economic partner of Czechoslovakia in Latin
   America. The majority of Czechoslovak exports consisted of machinery.
   One of the greatest achievements was the installation of several thermal
   and hydroelectric power plants. The present analysis of the contacts
   between Czechoslovakia and Argentina in the years 1976-1983 will
   contribute to the hitherto little examined issues of foreign policy of
   communist Czechoslovakia. At the same time, the study should help to
   create an understanding of the complexity of the relations between the
   Eastern Bloc and Latin America during the Cold War.},

Abstract = {We present theoretical and empirical analyses of candidates' platforms
   in the 2003 and 2009 Japanese House of Representatives elections, in an
   effort to understand candidates' strategic decisions to emphasize policy
   debates and to highlight their character-based qualities. Our study
   highlights the significance of comparative electoral advantages that
   motivate differing strategies between candidates from different parties,
   between candidates competing in rural versus urban districts, and
   between candidates contesting the 2003 versus the 2009 elections. Our
   study contributes to the growing literature that jointly analyzes
   politicians' policy-based vote-seeking strategies versus electoral
   appeals based on valence-related attributes such as competence,
   integrity, and leadership ability, that may appeal to voters because
   they enhance winning candidates' performance in office. (C) 2016

Abstract = {This contribution aims to present the general issue of integrating North
   Korean (NK) migrants living in South Korea into jobs and society, the
   main characteristics of the social enterprise scheme set up in South
   Korea, and a few examples of social enterprises engaged in NKs migrants'
   work integration. It stresses that the process of integrating NK
   migrants through the social enterprise model leads to apprehend this
   question, not in the traditional framework of policies specific to NK
   migrants, but in a broader framework to address a more comprehensive
   issue of the integration of vulnerable populations. This is an
   orientation that breaks with the previous public-policy framework
   towards NK migrants without real counterpart benefits. This approach
   also supplements governmental policies that have been developed since
   2005 to encourage NK migrants to engage in skills training and support
   programmes in employment coaching. By adding case studies that assess
   the effectiveness of NK migrants' work integration based on the criteria
   of job creation, job skills enhancement, and normal job sustenance, this
   study examines whether the European-originated work integration social
   enterprise model works for a particular social enterprise type
   benefiting NK migrants in South Korea.},

Abstract = {Using close election outcomes, we identify a personal effect of
   incumbency on the probability of seeking election, and seeking and
   winning office in subsequent elections for elected officials in an Open
   List Proportional System. In many cases Danish local elections creates
   an as-if random distribution of candidates that are elected or not,
   which is an ideal setting for a Regression Discontinuity design. The
   incumbency advantage has been studied to a great extent, though
   primarily in pluralistic electoral systems, while more recent studies
   have extended the scope to Proportional Representation systems. This
   study adds to this budding literature by showing an advantage in a new
   context and focusing on candidate level electoral returns under
   conditions where candidates are arguably least likely to benefit from
   incumbency. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), economic development and
   infrastructure recovery expanded at a monumental pace over the last
   decade. However, the economic boom also had negative aftershocks,
   including a significant rise in housing costs, local workers struggling
   to find employment with foreign companies, and the difficulties faced by
   the local private sector trying to operate in an emerging economy
   dominated by the public and oil sectors. In this article, the author
   argues that ensuring Turkish companies hire a minimum percentage of
   local employees, provide training opportunities as well as a minimum and
   fair wage, safe working environments, and make a social contribution in
   exchange for the rent-free use of land and access to sell products and
   services could enhance human security in the KRI.},

Abstract = {Samuel Huntington once remarked that authoritarian societies are unable
   to produce great political scientists, that political science is closely
   linked to democracy, and that political scientists have a moral duty to
   promote political reform. Huntington did not, however, discuss in detail
   why authoritarianism cannot produce great political scientists. He also
   overlooked a number of other issues with regard to the relationship
   between regimes and political science. Through an examination of the
   case of China, this article confirms the main finding of Huntington's
   thesis through a discussion of why democracy is associated with
   political science and why authoritarianism does not produce great
   political scientists. The article, however, also points out the problems
   associated with Huntington's thesis on connections between regimes and
   political science. The article offers a number of causal mechanisms and
   constructive criticisms of Huntington's thesis.},

Abstract = {Municipal council and administration are essential for local politics.
   Increasingly, however, governance problems and societal changes are
   challenging their legitimacy. Citizens in particular are demanding to
   have a greater say in local planning and decision-making processes. As a
   result, many municipalities are trying out alternative means of civic
   engagement. At the same time, it is these established authorities who
   are in charge of conducting these processes and are responsible for
   implementing their outcomes. Thus, their attitudes and behavior are
   crucial for the proper functioning of civic engagement. This article
   therefore examines the attitudes of local councilors (N = 587) towards
   direct democracy and deliberative civic engagement in 27 German
   municipalities. On the one hand, it is argued that local councilors'
   party affiliation affects their attitudes. On the other hand, their
   attitudes are also assumed to result from strategic considerations
   related to the respective local councilor's membership in the majority
   or minority party within the council. As this study shows, first of all,
   the councilors' attitude towards direct democracy ranges from neutral to
   moderately positive and their attitude towards deliberative civic
   engagement is positive. At the same time, there is great variance within
   and between the individual municipalities. Second, membership in the
   left party block (SPD, Green Party, Left Party) is positively correlated
   with councilors' attitudes towards both kinds of civic engagement
   whereas membership in the relative council majority is negatively
   correlated with their attitudes towards citizen participation. When
   controlling for both variables simultaneously, the effect of the party
   variable predominates. With regard to attitudes towards direct
   democracy, there is a notable interaction between party affiliation and
   majority status. Left councilors whose party is in the majority have a
   comparatively more positive attitude towards direct democracy. No such
   interaction effect applies to deliberative civic engagement. Third,
   municipalities' political characteristics have no effect on councilors'
   attitudes. Nevertheless, as population size increases, councilors'
   attitudes towards both dimensions of civic engagement become
   increasingly negative. In the Eastern federal states, councilors have a
   slightly more positive attitude towards direct democracy.},

Title = {From ideology to performance: Austerity and government defection in the
   2014 European Parliament elections},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {44},
Pages = {492-503},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The notion that domestic responses to financial crises are constrained
   in a way that limits the options available to national governments is
   not new. However, the last term of the European Parliament was a period
   when this reality was brought home to European electorates with
   previously unseen potency. This study explores the implications of this
   for the logic of voting in the 2014 European elections. Defection from
   government parties in EP elections is known to result from a combination
   of sincere/ideological and performance/protest voting logics. However,
   this study argues that fiscal tightening policies functioned, in the
   most affected countries, as a signal leading voters to discount the
   ideological positions of parties and to behave mostly under a pure
   protest logic. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Concerned by the proliferation of idiosyncratic prescriptive case
   studies in the nascent subfield of policy studies, Richard Simeon, in
   his seminal 1976 article, asked scholars to produce more comparative
   policy research that aimed at explaining general events and contributing
   to theory building. The extent to which Simeon's vision materialized
   remains debated. With a view to informing this debate, we conducted a
   systematic content analysis of the articles published in five major
   generalist public policy journals from 1980 to 2015. The analysis
   reveals that Canadian policy scholars took a comparative turn,
   publishing more territorial, sector and time comparisons than in the
   past. We also found evidence that theoretical knowledge accumulation is
   more important today for Canadian authors than it was when Simeon wrote
   his article.},

Abstract = {Although American Jews are often perceived as extremely active if not
   hyperpolitical, scholars have seldom studied the degree to which Jews in
   the US actually participate in public life. In a statistical sense, Jews
   are overrepresented in some domains that tend to favor groups with
   substantial socioeconomic resources (although these participation
   differences tend to disappear or diminish in multivariate models). This
   paper examines another major form of participation - civic activism -
   that research has suggested is less responsive to socioeconomic
   resources and thus might provide a more neutral venue to assess
   comparative Jewish engagement in the public square. Using Roper surveys
   from 1989-1992 with a sample of Jews and a comparison sample of non-Jews
   selected by propensity matching, I find that Jews are less likely to
   engage in civic activities than comparable non-Jews, suggesting that the
   reputation of Jews for political hyperactivity is considerably
   over-stated.},

Abstract = {The dominant political science explanations of the causes of
   individual-level political participation converge on three sets of
   antecedentsresources/skills, recruitment, and political engagement.
   However, the overwhelming majority of the empirical tests of these
   antecedents rely on cross-sectional data, obscuring the fact that
   micro-level participation in the United States is more accurately
   characterized by instability rather than by stability. Using the
   American National Election Study and Jennings time-series data, we for
   the first time demonstrate the inability of traditionally examined
   antecedents to explain individual-level variation in political behavior
   over time. Finding extant theory inadequate in this regard, we propose a
   modification of participation theories that puts the concept of
   motivation in the foreground. We argue that a model that includes
   motivation may both pave the way for a better understanding of the
   variation in participation over time and suggest possible prescriptions
   to help alleviate representational biases at the individual level.},

Title = {THE SANDF AS A HUMAN SECURITY INSTRUMENT POST-1994},
Journal = {STRATEGIC REVIEW FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {28-52},

Abstract = {South Africa adopted a human security orientation at the start of its
   democratic epoch in 1994, but its operationalisation by the South
   African National Defence Force (SANDF) proved difficult to implement.
   Human security is an approach to security which prioritises the
   protection of the people over security of the state. One of its central
   tenets is that security is best achieved through development as opposed
   to arms. Against this backdrop, the principal objective of this article
   is to critically analyse and understand South Africa's official human
   security orientation. Two indicators, the functions performed by the
   SANDF as well as South Africa's strategic defence posture, were assessed
   to achieve the objective. The securitisation model associated with Barry
   Buzan and Ole Waever was used as a theoretical framework to understand
   South Africa's official conception and utilisation of human security.
   It was found that the SANDF's operational functioning was compromised by
   having to perform its primary responsibilities along with secondary
   developmental tasks demanded by the broad mandate of human security.
   Furthermore, while South Africa lexically took human security and state
   security to be equally important, in practice the SANDF tended to
   prioritise state security ahead of human security both at home and
   abroad. Some analysts detected lack of strategic coherence in South
   Africa's security engagements in Africa while ignoring extensive efforts
   of the SANDF to bring peace, and not destabilisation, on the continent
   as part of the strategic defence posture. Ultimately, this article
   argues that the competency with which the SANDF ensures state security
   must be cascaded down to the human level by taking up more secondary
   functions with some provisos. Alignment of defence policy and adequate
   resources as well as the involvement of the people will be indispensable
   towards realisation of true human security.},

Abstract = {There are already a number of good accounts of the impact of the recent
   2008-2014 economic crisis on European democracies. However, no
   systematic assessments of how it has affected specific aspects of
   democracy have so far been carried out. We explore its impact on
   European democracies in several areas by adopting the quality of
   democracy' framework. Our analysis shows that the measures we employ
   capture the variation in quality during this troubled' period. The
   empirical analysis suggests that a shrinking of private and public
   resources due to an economic downturn prompts three reactions: (a) a
   general deterioration of the rule of law; (b) citizens become more
   sensitive about what governments deliver; and (c) detachment from the
   institutional channels of representation along with a choice to protest.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {517-546},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In spite of the recent increase in dual citizenship, there are
   widespread fears that this double status undermines loyalty towards the
   state, understood as identification with and political participation in
   the country of residence. We analyze whether there are systematic
   differences between dual citizens, mono citizens, and foreign residents
   in this respect, based on data from a 2013 survey of dual citizens in
   Switzerland with very different migration backgrounds. The results
   reveal that controlling for migration-related and socio-demographic
   factors, dual citizens are more loyal in many respects than foreign
   residents, but there are no significant differences between dual
   citizens and mono citizens in their level of identification with
   Switzerland and political participation there. They are even more likely
   than mono citizens to participate in serving its interests. In addition,
   there is no trade-off between these forms of loyalty to the country of
   residence and identification and political participation in the country
   of descent. On the contrary, they are positively related. Transnational
   loyalties seem to co-exist or even to be mutually reinforcing. Thus,
   dual citizenship does not seem to diminish loyalty to the country of
   residence and countries therefore do not stand to lose anything by
   allowing it.},

Abstract = {Protection of the Environment nowadays is the top Priority on the Agenda
   of the International Community of Decision-Makers. The increasing
   Importance of the Issue Is Due To The Fact That Minor National
   Environmental Crises Have Developed into Major International ones.
   Surely Sustainability in Development and Environmental Protectiondoes
   not occur without Serious Regional Interactions And International
   Cooperation. Hence, Despite the Improved International Relations And
   Capacities As Well As The Existing Mechanisms, Inter Alia, The
   International Rules, The Global Community should attempt Towards
   Interactions To Protect The Global Security against Major Challenges and
   Keep Global Peace in a stable process. Hence, Environmental Diplomacy Is
   a Major Issue that is Efficient in the Interactions among Countries and,
   Ultimately, Citizens, Adding to the Depth of Peace and Security. In This
   Direction, Constructive Interactions on a National Scale As well As
   Effective Interactions on Regional and International Scales form An
   Effective Strategy to encounrer Increasing Environmental Threats. The
   Aim of This Study Is discussion And An Exploration of Environmental
   Diplomacy In Light Of International Interactions And Cooperation.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2016},

Number = {4},

Abstract = {The concepts of politicisation' and depoliticisation' have become
   increasingly used by political scientists over the last decade, in light
   of the presumed triumph' of neoliberal ideology in the 1990s, and its
   subsequent challenge (re-politicisation') by the 2008 financial crisis.
   Debate has emerged in the literature, however, over what conceptual
   strategy is best for critically analysing depoliticisation - broad' or
   narrow'. This article argues for attempting to find common ground among
   competing' definitions, by viewing politicisation and depoliticisation
   as multilevel' concepts, with theoretical, analytical and empirical
   purchase. The uniting theme, it is argued, is a critical analysis of the
   dynamics of neoliberalism as a paradigm of political thought, and how
   that paradigm allegedly leads to the rise of anti-politics'. Thinking
   about (de)politicisation in this way helps avoid facile conceptual
   reinvention and stimulates a coherent yet pluralistic research agenda
   focused on translating insights and criticism across macro, meso and
   micro levels.},

Abstract = {Was there really a debt-fuelled `liberal growth model' that preceded the
   2008 financial crisis? The accepted narrative about the pre-crisis boom
   is that some liberal countries relied on domestic consumption to fuel
   economic growth, and on household debt to fuel this consumption. In
   this, they contrasted with coordinated economies. While eventually
   unsustainable, the growth strategy was politically necessary to maintain
   middle-class living standards in the context of increasing income
   inequality. In this article, I take these contentions to the data.
   Economic evidence from 1995-2007 and political data from the Comparative
   Manifesto Project Database undermine this received wisdom: while
   household debt increased in the liberal countries, it does not
   differentiate this particular growth model. Further, there is no
   evidence that politicians in liberal countries advocate different
   economic policies, including those concerning borrowing, to claim credit
   and stay in power. Differences in the importance of finance between
   countries, however, suggest a more elite-driven divergence.},

Abstract = {After winning the 2006 Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) elections
   and subsequently taking control of the Gaza Strip in the summer of 2007,
   the Palestinian Hamas - a hybrid political, social and military actor -
   undertook a complex process to ascertain authority and control over
   Gaza. The article focuses on understanding Hamas's performance as a
   political party and a rebel government as well as the impact of this
   newly acquired role on the group's strategy. Relying on primary sources,
   field-work and interviews with members of the Hamas government and its
   security sector, the study looks at Hamas's role as a security provider
   and analyses the complex relationship between the institutionalized
   security sector and the group's insurgent armed wing. Examining Hamas's
   logic as a security provider and exploring the inherent tensions between
   political and insurgent logics allows for a better understanding of both
   the rebel group's role as a political actor and the broader challenges
   behind the successful rebel-to-political transformations of non-state
   armed organizations. In doing so it contributes to the emerging
   literature on non-state actors' shifts between ballots and bullets and
   on their potential role as alternative governance providers.},

Abstract = {The present article concerns Estonian e-government, that is, the
   digitalization of government and public administration, and the way
   e-government produces a moral citizen. Although several case studies on
   e-government exist, they have seldom been sensitive to the local
   conditions shaping the functions and social meaning of digitalization.
   E-government involves producing knowledge, and the present article draws
   on a theoretical perspective that stresses the tight relationship
   between knowledge and power. In Estonia, the power-knowledge regime is
   characterized by centralization. Centralization is the condition for a
   firm national e-government policy, and within this policy, an image of
   the unique Estonian citizenry is produced. The Estonian moral citizen
   who emerges out of e-government is de-politicized and detached from a
   social context, on the one hand, and strongly politicized and attached
   to a specific ethno-national community, on the other.},

Abstract = {Scholars of coalition politics have increasingly begun to focus on
   conflict within coalitions. Here we examine the role of coalition
   agreements in managing intracoalitional conflict. We argue that there is
   a trade-off between making policy agreements at the coalition's
   formation (e.g., by making very detailed policy platforms) and
   postponing the issue's resolution by creating procedures for settling
   policy disputes. We argue that the trade-off is increasingly likely to
   be resolved in favor of relying on a formal dispute resolution mechanism
   when coalitions are ideologically heterogeneous and the coalition
   parties differ in size. We test our theory using data from the German
   Lander between 1990 and 2013. These data allow us to isolate the effects
   of the bargaining situation and ideology while holding the institutional
   context constant. The empirical results support our main argument: When
   intracoalition conflict is high, parties write shorter coalition
   contracts but are more likely to adopt procedures for conflict
   resolution.},

Abstract = {A crisis of legitimacy concerning the mechanism of political
   representation justifies a critical analysis regarding the unsustainable
   superiority of political representation over the real and effective
   participation of citizens in State decision-making institutions. The
   current paper provides an analysis of the role and normative strength of
   political participation, within the context of the different democratic
   theoretical models developed by Political Science. The paper pursues two
   related goals: (a) to highlight the inadequacy of political
   representation as the unique motor of democratic systems; and (b) to
   justify the benefits - based on the different theories comprising
   participatory democratic theory - of reinforcing political participation
   of citizens within the State's decision-making processes and
   institutions.},

Abstract = {Does a positive association between democracy and economic growth around
   the world encourage the spread of democracy? Although this intuitive
   relationship has been linked to the global ebb and flow of fascism and
   Communism, no study has empirically tested this question. I argue that
   democracy's relative economic success in the world influences
   perceptions of its domestic advantages and thereby shifts popular and
   elite preferences in favor of democracy. Looking at 172 countries from
   18202010, I show that the world-level correlation between democracy and
   economic growth robustly predicts the spread of democracy and represents
   a major source of its historical advance. The results provide new
   insights into the foreign influences on democratization, China's
   challenge to the liberal democratic order, and the political legacy of
   the global financial crisis.},

Abstract = {Entrepreneurs translate different and creative ideas into products and
   services for meeting customers demands or creating new demands through
   information and communication technologies as being independent of
   geographic distance. At the information age, entrepreneurs are combining
   the atomic world and the bits world on the basis of digitalization while
   creating new ideas or products. Therefore developments in the
   information and communication technologies and globalization are
   changing entrepreneur profile. The study will examine how globalization,
   developments of information technologies, virtuality and digitalization
   affect entrepreneur profile in the information age.},

Abstract = {Do non-graded, one-time, short presentations by a panel of professors on
   foreign policy issues affect voting behavior among students? Did the
   panel itself contribute to students' understanding of the importance of
   foreign policy in evaluating candidates? Did presentations lead to
   changes in students' candidate preferences? And, finally, did the event
   lead to sustained changes in students' preferences? We find that even
   though issues of foreign policy tend not to be front and center in
   American elections, when young voters are presented with information
   about candidate's foreign policy positions, as we did in this study, it
   does seem to have an impact on which candidate they plan on voting for.},

Abstract = {I develop a theory of strategic voting that captures an endogenous link
   between the costly decision to vote and the costly decision to become
   politically informed. I then use the theoretical model to study the
   effects of different public policy instruments on the incentives of
   voters to cast informed votes. I show that policies that directly target
   the cost of political engagement, by influencing either the cost of
   information acquisition or the cost associated with casting a vote, have
   an ambiguous effect on the overall level of informed voting, and thus
   have unclear welfare implications. I also show that compulsory voting
   provides an incentive for voters to acquire political information so as
   to ensure that the vote they are compelled to cast actually benefits
   them, which overall, increases the level of informed voting.},

Abstract = {The publication of The American Voter in 1960 revolutionized the study
   of American voting behavior. Its University of Michigan authors, Angus
   Campbell, Philip E. Converse, Warren E. Miller, and Donald E. Stokes,
   were to share thousands of citations, but they were four different
   people, with different backgrounds, different personalities, and
   different career trajectories afterwards. This paper presents a
   chronological biography of The American Voter, from assembling the
   research team, through writing the book, to its aftermath, and ending
   with brief perspectives on each author.},

Abstract = {Despite the low probability of such an event, a serious nuclear power
   plant incident in northern Taiwan would create a multidimensional
   security challenge, in terms of both traditional and non-traditional
   security when factors such as high population density and geopolitical
   significance of the island are considered. Dealing with nuclear
   contamination, including evacuation, medical treatment and resettlement,
   would severely affect human, environmental and other categories of
   non-traditional security. Taiwan's insufficient level of preparation
   would make external disaster relief crucial. Since military units are
   likely to be deployed by assisting countries to respond to a nuclear
   event, consequent Sino-US interactions in humanitarian aid and disaster
   relief (HADR) could be either cooperative or competitive.},

Abstract = {A great amount of information is accumulated by public authorities. The
   preservation or disposal of such information is regularly the subject of
   disputes. This paper addresses the Articles of the Public Archives Act
   No. 77/2014 that specify what records should be preserved by authorities
   subject to an obligation of transfer and the subsequent transfer of
   these records to public archives at a later stage, as well as which
   authority controls the transfer. The main conclusions are: Firstly, all
   records produced by and associated with the operation of entities
   subject to the obligation of transfer fall within the scope of the Act
   irrespective of their form or how they are produced unless special Acts
   lead to different conclusions. Secondly, all records should be preserved
   unless prescriptions and authorizations by the National Archives of
   Iceland or special Acts lead to different conclusions with respect to
   the preservation or disposal of the records. Thirdly, The National
   Archives of Iceland supervises compliance with the Act.},

Abstract = {Scholars are increasingly interested in how partisan conflict in
   Congress affects public evaluations of institutional performance. Yet,
   existing research overlooks how the public responds to one of the most
   widely discussed consequences of partisan conflict: legislative
   gridlock. We develop expectations about how partisan conflict resulting
   in partisan wins, losses, and gridlock will affect evaluations of
   Congress, and how these relationships will differ across consensus and
   non-consensus issues. Results from two survey experiments indicate that
   partisan conflict resulting in a victory for one's own party boosts
   approval relative to compromise, but conflict resulting in gridlock
   substantially damages approval. However, the degree to which gridlock
   decreases approval hinges on the type of policy under consideration. On
   consensus issues, citizens reward legislative action by either
   partytheir party or the opposing partyover gridlock.},

Abstract = {Zusammenfassung Politische Partizipation wird von Kontextfaktoren
   mitbestimmt. Die ideologische Polarisierung ist ein solcher Faktor.
   Wahrend sich die Wahlforschung mit dem Einfluss von Elitenpolarisierung
   auf das individuelle Wahlverhalten beschaftigt, ist bislang nichts uber
   den Einfluss der ideologischen Polarisierung der Bevolkerung auf das
   nicht-elektorale Partizipationsverhalten der Burger bekannt. In diesem
   Beitrag wird daher danach gefragt, in welchem Zusammenhang die
   nicht-elektorale Partizipation von Individuen mit dem Ausma ss an
   ideologischer Polarisierung ihrer regionalen sozialen Umwelt steht.
   Vermutet wird, dass wachsende ideologische Polarisierung die Burger
   mobilisiert. Mit Daten des European Social Survey (2002-2012) lasst sich
   ein solcher Effekt zeigen. Dabei werden zwei neue Vorschlage zur Messung
   ideologischer Polarisierung gemacht. Anschlie ss end wird die allgemeine
   Annahme spezifiziert und die These aufgestellt, dass ideologische
   Polarisierung besonders auf politisch bereits sensibilisierte
   Bevolkerungsgruppen wie ein Mobilisierungsverstarker wirkt. Zum Teil
   bestatigen die folgenden Analysen diese Annahme. Insgesamt legen die
   Ergebnisse die Schlussfolgerung nahe, dass sich das Ausma ss an
   ideologischer Polarisierung auf das Partizipationsverhalten der
   Individuen ungleich auswirkt.},

Abstract = {Since the creation of monetary union, European governments have received
   loans from the international financial markets at low interest rates.
   The recent sovereign debt crisis has, however, once more revealed the
   structural dependence of capitalist governments on the capital markets.
   Countries such as Spain and Greece are charged unsustainable interest
   rates and their policy decisions have come under scrutiny by
   international bond holders who fear losing their investments. Based on a
   unique dataset of European tax policy decisions from 2008 to 2010, we
   show that financial market pressure, in the form of rising bond yields,
   has forced European governments to raise their taxes, especially in the
   more regressive field of indirect taxes. The findings suggest that
   capitalist democracies have little political room to maneuver and to
   conduct redistributive politics at times of high fiscal stress.},

Abstract = {We exploit the act of the conservative Greek government (2004-2009) to
   fiddle the books as a natural experiment in order to document a causal
   link between government spending and electoral fragmentation and
   identify the mechanism via which it operates. The retrospective revision
   of Greece's deficit figures just before the 2010 regional elections
   constituted an information shock, which generated expectations for
   reduced pork-barrel spending. We decompose the resulting effect and
   uncover the main mechanism taking place: rent-seeking voting and
   patronage (client-voters abandoning the dominant parties due to less
   expected rents). We find that expected spending cuts caused a steep
   decline (increase) in the electoral support for dominant parties
   (fragmentation). This effect is significantly more pronounced in
   patronage-intense regions. Using the size of public sector as a proxy
   for patronage (Hicken 2011), we find that support for dominant parties
   declined differentially by 5 percentage points more on those regions.
   That is, at least one in six voters that abandoned the big parties did
   so out of purely opportunistic motivations. Overall, our work highlights
   the importance of institutional constraints in affecting electoral and
   political power-sharing.},

Abstract = {This article attempts to reflect on the so-called European refugee
   crisis, with a focus on the impact of the closure of the Western Balkan
   route and the subsequent creation of a number of national refugee
   crises. One consequence has been the Greek crisis, which was
   ``solved{''} at its initial stages by the creation of informal refugee
   camps. The article focuses on the Port of Piraeus camp in Athens and the
   rise of a transnational civil society to cater to the needs of the
   people who settled there. Last but not least, a number of insights are
   shared on the nature of the interrupted journeys of these people.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the impact of electoral institutions on the
   re-election campaigning and outreach strategies of Members of the
   European Parliament on the Twitter social media platform. Social media
   offers politicians a means to contact voters remotely and at low cost.
   We test the effect of diverse national proportional representation
   electoral institutions in European elections on a possible online
   electoral connection. We draw upon an original dataset of Members of the
   European Parliament Twitter activity before, during, and after the 2014
   European elections. Our results confirm that variation in electoral
   institutions leads to meaningful differentiation in representatives'
   social media campaigning, which is further affected by national party,
   voter and legislator characteristics. Representatives make constructive
   use of Twitter, but there is no sustained online electoral connection.},

Abstract = {Taking as its starting point the debate about the ``book{''} or
   ``theory{''} of wage labor of Marx, this paper seeks to shed light on
   the subject - apparently a marxologic one- with the purpose of a
   critical approach to the problem of revolutionary potential of the
   working class, to advance in its scientific comprehension. Following the
   proposal of Marx and Juan Inigo Carrera, we hope to show the limits and
   implications of the two lines identified as dominant regarding the
   specified topic, to discover its purely ideological character in order
   to advance in an alternative solution to the problem.},

Title = {Explaining gender equality difference in a devolved system: The case of
   abortion law in Northern Ireland},
Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {371-388},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Northern Ireland is the only region of the United Kingdom (UK) in which
   the Abortion Act of 1967 does not apply. Since the Abortion Act, little
   action has been taken from national government to address this
   discrepancy in the province. Furthermore, as the constitutional makeup
   of the UK has evolved in the wake of devolution, Northern Irish
   exceptionalism with regard to abortion has only increased. While
   abortion legislation was retained at Westminster for Wales and Scotland,
   Northern Ireland was allowed to remain exempt from the 1967 Act and to
   legislate on termination of pregnancy at the devolved level. Working
   within a feminist institutionalist framework, this article asks why this
   remains the case and considers Northern Ireland's limited place in
   national political discussion at Westminster since devolution. As such,
   it draws on and contributes to the developing literature on gender,
   devolution and multi-level governance. It argues that abortion in
   Northern Ireland has largely been understood at Westminster as a
   regional, devolved issue rather than an issue of women's rights, and
   that the multiple political spaces now offered via devolution have not
   provided a greater number of venues for the promotion of more liberal
   abortion laws.},

Abstract = {Numerous studies have shown that Australians have little confidence in
   their political parties. This article presents the results of a study
   investigating whether the responsiveness of Australian parties to what
   their voters want drives this lack of confidence. It analyses two
   aspects of party responsiveness: programmatic responsiveness in
   electoral manifestos and perceived responsiveness that centres on
   Australian voters' assessment of how well their parties meet their
   demands. The analysis finds that programmatic responsiveness has no
   significant influence. Instead, how Australians perceive their parties
   to be responsive has a modest effect on their confidence in those
   parties. The study suggests that, however, it is incumbency which has
   the most powerful effect on voter confidence.},

Abstract = {Following the result of the Scottish Referendum in September 2014, Peter
   Hennessy thought that the English Question would become the
   weather-maker in contemporary British politics. It is important,
   however, to avoid overemphasis on the novelty of this matter. There is a
   compelling argument to bring current debates about Englishness into
   fruitful dialogue with historical perspectives because this may yield
   more nuanced understandings of the relationship between political
   argument and enduring expressions of Englishness. This article considers
   first a tradition of institutional thinking and how that thinking helped
   to define English national self-understanding, what Sir Ernest Barker
   once described as never reflective, because it is so simply and
   obviously a fact'. The article explores the erosion of that national
   self-understanding in recent years through a number of ironies of
   inversion', in which the previous virtues of English institutionalism
   can appear as present vices. These ironies of inversion have become
   factors of popular political grievance, especially since devolution, and
   have added to an insistent mood that the English Question must be
   addressed, even if there is no consensus about how it should be
   addressed.},

Abstract = {I propose a theory of legislator-to-constituent communication that
   describes a relationship between the types of votes a legislator reveals
   and the partisan composition of her constituency. To test this theory, I
   use an original data set of 40,000 official communications containing
   30,000 vote revelations from the 111th Congress. I find evidence
   substantiating this theory; the extent to which a legislator endeavors
   to appear more ideologically extreme in communications varies
   systematically with the relative amounts of different types of voters in
   her district. This result is contrasted with an analysis of voting
   extremism where I find that the ideological preferences of donors better
   explain voting patterns.},

Title = {Diverse parties, diverse agendas? Female politicians and the
   parliamentary party's role in platform formation},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {55},
Number = {3},
Pages = {435-453},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Parties' parliamentary delegations contain a multitude of interests.
   While scholars suspect that this variation affects party behaviour, most
   work on parties' policy statements treats parties as unitary actors.
   This reflects the absence of strong expectations concerning when (and
   how) the parliamentary caucus matters for platform construction, as well
   as the difficulties inherent in testing such claims. Drawing on the
   literature on women's descriptive representation, this article argues
   that the makeup of the parliamentary party likely has important
   consequences for issue entrepreneurship, the scope of issues represented
   on the manifesto and even the left-right position of election platforms.
   With the most comprehensive party-level study of women's representation
   ever conducted, three diversity hypotheses are tested using data on the
   gender makeup of parties' parliamentary delegations and the content of
   their manifestos for 110 parties in 20 democracies between 1952 and
   2011. The analyses show that as the percentage of women in the
   parliamentary party increases, parties address a greater diversity of
   issues in their election campaigns. Women's presence is also associated
   with more left-leaning manifestos, even when controlling for parties'
   prior ideological positions. Together, these findings illustrate a
   previously overlooked consequence of descriptive representation and
   provide a framework for understanding when and why the parliamentary
   party influences manifesto formation. They show that diversity - or lack
   thereof - has important consequences for parties' policy statements, and
   thus the overall quality of representation.},

Abstract = {This article is based on a selection of the findings and insights
   emerging from ``DIVERSE,{''} diversity improvement as a viable
   enrichment resource for society and economy, a research-project realized
   with the aim of contributing to ``reinvent{''} the European migrants'
   integration model, in order to sustain both the positive interethnic
   coexistence and the long-term development of European societies.
   Implemented from January 2014 to June 2015 in 10 EU countries Estonia,
   Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal,
   Spain, and Sweden -, characterized by very different migration
   experiences, the project had identified three major levers to maximize
   migrants' potential contribution: (1) enhancing the recognition of
   migrants' skills, knowledge and competences (here after: SKC); (2)
   promoting the awareness of the advantages provided by the implementation
   of diversity management (here after DM) practices; (3) improving
   migrants' civic and voluntary involvement. After a presentation of the
   theoretical premises on which the project was based (Sections 1-2) and
   the description of the project activities (Section 3), the article will
   focus on both the major impacts and the critical insights emerged in
   relation of each lever (Section 4); finally, it will develop some policy
   implications in order to make these levers crucial components of a wider
   strategy aimed at benefiting from immigrationrelated `` diversity,{''}
   reinforcing both the economic competitiveness and the social cohesion of
   European society (Section 5).},

   scenarios that the more they can contribute to the achievement and

   It was built under the conception that the only way to peace is the
   recognition of conflict as an inherent element of human relations, in
   which the subject is difference and positioned opposite each other. It
   shows how the school from its function as a mechanism of historical
   tuning of the subject and dissemination of nonnative parameters of
   society, as scientists and academics of humanity achievements, you can
   get to claim the difference and to defend it as a focus of building
   indeed, to avoid reducing it to a single universal truth, which
   historically have derived the greatest conflicts in society.},

Number = {16},
Pages = {17-45},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Perhaps only in the time of the crusades the Western rhetoric has been
   more concerned with the people of Muslim origin. With the Middle East
   turned into a warring zone by various factions, and the Western world
   scared of the menace Islamic extremists present, the subject discussed
   in our paper is very timely. Thousands of people have fled to fight
   alongside extremist organizations such as ISIS, European far-right
   parties are on the rise and refugees are washing off the shores of the
   Mediterranean Sea. But no Western country is under greater distress than
   France with its nation troubled by terrorist attacks and by the latest
   outburst of protests. Analyzing the legal framework within which the
   French Model of integrating immigrants works, we attempted to assess its
   effectiveness and lack thereof in order to try and explain why France is
   only preceded by Russia when it comes to the number of Westerners
   joining the rows of IS IL. Our findings include clear evidence about the
   low quality of life that people of immigrant descent have, the lack of
   possibilities to overcome their condition, the lack of sustainability
   that the model exhibits and the escalating effect that the current State
   of Emergency has on it all. And since all of these constitute drivers
   for extremism, we consider France to be in urgent need of policy
   developments that would slow down and even stop the radicalizing trends
   that we believe are in motion.},

Abstract = {Understanding complex processes remains a major challenge of
   contemporary social analysis. We can only study urban processes with a
   diversified gaze that recognizes it's fragmentary and dispersed
   character. In other words, urban studies need to be ``disordered.{''}
   This article is based on an exhaustive statistical analysis of various
   georeferenced times and representations (SIG) in order to present three
   analytical stories about a Mexican megalopolis: urban centralityand its
   characteristi cs; polycentricismas an expression of its development;
   andirregularityas a contemporary marker of this urban monster of 37
   million people in 2010.
   The article concludes that understanding this Mexican megalopolis
   requires letting itsdisorderspeak and recognizing that urban development
   is non-linear and discontinuous. We still lack heuristic tools to
   understand such complexity.},

Abstract = {Why are the negative effects of social diversity more pronounced in some
   places than in others? What are the mechanisms underlying the
   relationship between diversity and discriminatory behaviors, and why do
   they vary in prevalence and strength across locations? Experimental
   research has made advances in examining these questions by testing for
   differences in behavior when interacting with individuals from different
   groups. At the same time, research in American and comparative politics
   has demonstrated that attitudes toward other groups are a function of
   context. Uniting these two lines of research, we argue that
   discriminatory behaviors should be strongly conditioned by the ways in
   which groups are organized in space, allowing us to make predictions
   about the relationship between diversity, segregation, and intergroup
   behavior. We examine this claim in the context of intra-Jewish cleavage
   in Israel, using original data compiled through multisite
   lab-in-the-field experiments and survey responses collected across 20
   locations.},

Abstract = {Since 2003 the Wounaan indigenous community located in the department of
   Choco and Valle del Cauca (Colombia) has been displaced due to the armed
   conflict in the country and the seeking of better economic conditions.
   Their way of life, the exercise of their medicine, the representations
   and practices in health have been affected by the territorial
   rootlessness and lack of natural resources. By means of the participant
   observation and interviews compiled between 2014 and 2015, this article
   describes and analyses, how the bogotano context affects Wounaan care
   system, what is the role of Wounaan medical figures within this context
   of mobility, and finally, what medical values are transformed into the
   migration.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the legal and administrative scope of Twitter as a
   mass media and institutional management tool, and how it fits in legal
   and institutional mechanisms using the case of the Republic of Ecuador.
   It is proposed that the presidential action within the social network
   has consequences in public administration such as the centralization of
   the decision-making and the political mandate. In this paper, a
   quantitative and qualitative study of the Twitter account of the
   President of the Republic of Ecuador (used as a direct management tool
   between citizens and government) was undertaken through the methodology
   of social network analysis. The data show that there is an
   administrative and legal mechanism that gives legitimacy to presidential
   actions within the social network, and that behavioral patterns of the
   presidential authority within the web 2.0. are a source of law that
   increases the perception of efficiency of the head of state's action.},

Abstract = {Despite growing interest from practitioners, politicians and the media,
   the political representation of Muslim ethnic minority women in the West
   has received scant scholarly attention. I address this gap with new data
   on the representation of Muslim ethnic minority women and men in 20
   national legislatures from 2000 to 2010. Results reveal that Muslim
   ethnic minority women are increasingly elected in countries with
   proportional representation (PR) electoral systems, whereas Muslim
   ethnic minority men have been elected across a range of electoral
   systems. The benefits of PR electoral systems to `women' apply to ethnic
   minority women from Muslim backgrounds.},

Abstract = {In the face of the contemporary so-called ``European refugee
   crisis,{''}' the dichotomies of bodies that are naturalized into
   technology usage and the bodies that remain alienated from it betray the
   geographic, racial, and gendered discriminations that digital
   technologies, despite their claims at neutrality and flatness, continue
   to espouse. This article argues that ``young electronic diasporas{''}
   (ye-diasporas) (Dona, 2014) present us with an unique view on how Europe
   is reimagined from below, as people stake out a living across
   geographies. The main premise is that young connected migrants'
   cross-border practices shows they `do family' in a way that does not
   align with the universal European, normative expectations of European
   family life. The author draws on three symptomatic accounts of young
   connected migrants that are variably situated geo-politically: 1)
   Moroccan-Dutch youth in the Netherlands; 2) stranded Somalis awaiting
   family reunification in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; and, 3) working, middle,
   and upper-class young people of various ethnic and class backgrounds
   living in London. Narratives shared by members of all three groups
   indicate meta-categories of the `migrant,' `user,' and `e-diaspora'
   urgently need to be de-flattened. To do this de-flattening work, new
   links between migrant studies, feminist and postcolonial theory and
   digital cultures are forged. In an era of increasing digital
   connectivity and mobility, transnational families are far from
   deterritorialized-boundaries and insurmountable distances are often
   forcibly and painfully felt.},

Abstract = {The present essay sets out to appraise the role that corresponds to the
   idea of patriotism in our time. This task requires to reflect, in a
   proper historical perspective, on the relationship of patriotism to
   associated concepts such as nationalism and nation-state. We hold that
   patriotism, a deep-seated and universal human attitude, has its true
   intellectual and historical-political continuity in first wave
   nationalism -in liberal nationalism and nation-state. Certainly, these
   are at present threatened in Europe and the West by multiple factors,
   whereas second and third wave nationalisms have become extremely
   powerful forces all over the world. Nevertheless, nation-states and
   patriotism are unwilling to die out, and are, if adequately understood,
   a paramount element of progress. We criticize the political correctness
   positions which either condemn patriotism or try to appropriate the term
   with a view to endowing it wih an alien content. The conclusion stresses
   the need to rethink the notion of patriotism within the framework of its
   traditional foundations.},

Abstract = {This article nuances the argument that ethnic minority women experience
   cumulative disadvantage within politics. Drawing on the French case
   study, I demonstrate a complex relationship between gender and
   ethnicity. The gender parity movement saw ethnicity as competing with
   gender and rejected claims for ethnic minority representation, but still
   drew attention to the homogeneity of French politics. Descriptive
   representation of minority women is now slowly progressing, as they
   simultaneously promote gender and ethnic diversity within politics.
   However, their inclusion is conditional on their willingness to act as
   symbols of secularity and assimilation. This particularly constrains the
   substantive representation of Muslim women.},

Abstract = {Examining the determinants of legislative success at the Philippine
   House of Representatives, this study shows empirically why continuous
   entrenchment by political families can be detrimental to political
   institutions. Using count regression models, the study analyzes the
   patterns of law production in the Philippine Lower House beginning from
   the opening of the first post-Marcos Congress (8th Congress) in 1987 to
   the adjournment of the 15th Congress in 2013. The study finds that
   successive terms in office facilitate the ability of legislators to
   engage in legislative activities but only up to a point. Neophyte
   legislators who have yet to gain a foothold in their districts appear to
   be more proactive in concretizing proposals into actual legislation, at
   least initially. Over time, when legislative districts have become
   family turfs, incumbents cease to invest in vote courting activities
   such as legislation, lending credence to the unhealthy effect of
   political persistence on accountability.},

Abstract = {The potential attack surface of a nation is large and no single source
   of cyber security data provides all the required information to
   accurately describe the cyber security readiness of a nation. There are
   a variety of specialised data sources available to assess the state of a
   nation in key areas such as botnets, spam servers and incorrectly
   configured hosts. By applying data fusion principles, the potential
   exists to provide a representative view of all combined data sources.
   This research will examine a variety of currently available Internet
   data sources and apply it to an adapted Joint Directors of Laboratories
   (JDL) data fusion model in order to illustrate the potential gains and
   current limitations. The JDL model has been adapted to suit national
   level cyber sensor data fusion with the aim to formally define and
   reduce data ambiguity and enhance fusion capability in a real world
   system. A case study highlights the results of applying available open
   source security information against the model to relate to the current
   South African cyber landscape.},

Abstract = {One of the major challenges to an organization achieving a certain level
   of preparedness to ``effectively{''} combat existing and future cyber
   threats and vulnerabilities is its ability to ensure the security and
   reliability of its networks. Most of the existing efforts are
   quantitative, by nature, and limited solely to the networks and systems
   of the organization. It would be unfair to not acknowledge that for sure
   some progress has been achieved in the way that organizations, as a
   whole, are now positioning themselves to address the threats (GAO 2012).
   Unfortunately, so have the skill sets and resource levels improved for
   attackers--they are increasingly getting better at achieving the
   unwanted access to organizations' information assets. In large part the
   authors believe that some of this is due to the failure by methods to
   assess the overall vulnerability of the networks. In addition,
   significant levels of threats and vulnerabilities beyond organizations'
   networks and systems are not being given the level of attention that is
   warranted. In this paper, the authors propose a more comprehensive
   approach that enables an organization to more realistically assess its
   ``cyber maturity{''} level in hope of better positioning itself to
   address existing and new cyber threats. The authors also propose the
   need to better understand another missing critical piece to the
   puzzle--the reliability and security of networks in terms of scientific
   risk-based metrics (e. g., the severity of individual vulnerabilities
   and overall vulnerability of the network). Their risk-based metrics
   focus on the probability of compromise due to a given vulnerability;
   employee non-adherence to company cyber-based policies; insider threats.
   They are: (1) built on the CVSS Base Score which is modified by
   developing weights derived from the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to
   make the overall score more representative of the impact the
   vulnerability has on the global infrastructure, and (2) rooted in
   repeatable quantitative characteristics (i. e., vulnerabilities) such as
   the sum of the probabilities that devices will be compromised via
   clientside or server-side attacks stemming from software or hardware
   vulnerabilities. The authors will demonstrate the feasibility of their
   method by applying their approach to a case study and highlighting the
   benefits and impediments which result.},

Abstract = {At the heart of the unexpected regime stability in post-Kim Il-sung
   Pyongyang is the expanded role of the Korean People's Army (KPA) as the
   protector of the regime and the leader, under the slogan of
   military-first (songun) politics. There is, however, a wide gap between
   the KPA's role and its limited political significance. This article
   examines how Pyongyang's political systems were designed to enable the
   leader to firmly control the military and security organizations by
   focusing on three of the most important institutions related to control
   over the KPA: the General Political Department, the Central Military
   Commission, and the National Defense Commission.},

Abstract = {Apart from the studies that focus on public attitudes toward higher
   courts in advanced democracies, we know little about the factors that
   can explain public confidence in the judiciary in a comparative setting.
   In this regard, the goal of this study is to explain whether, and to
   what extent, the country's level of democracy moderates the impact of
   political awareness on public confidence in the judiciary. This study
   uses hierarchical linear models to analyse the interaction between
   individual and country level factors by using the World Values Survey
   (2005-2009) data for 49 countries and various other data sources. Our
   empirical results show that in advanced democracies political awareness
   variables like education and political participation have a positive
   impact on public confidence in the judiciary, whereas in countries with
   weak levels of democracy higher political awareness leads to increased
   cynicism about the judiciary. These results suggest that a
   one-size-fits-all approach to explain confidence in the judiciary is not
   possible when we are dealing with a wide range of societies that vary in
   terms of many characteristics, both institutional and cultural.},

Abstract = {Much of the literature on democratic transitions and ethnic conflict
   focuses on the role of elites, whether as constructive contributors to
   ethnic harmony and pacted transitions, or as fomenters of disharmony.
   What these accounts often fail to take into account is the extent to
   which the existence of political elites is a variable in itself,
   particularly when their power bases are not organizations like an army
   but rather nations or classes. The article develops an analysis of how
   competition for scarce militants and the demands of organizing them
   shapes the power and importance of elites. It does this through a case
   study of Catalonia in the years preceding the Spanish transition. During
   those years Catalonia, both a stateless nation and a potentially divided
   society, was the site of organizing from the left and right that nearly
   monopolized militants and channelled their activity into autonomist,
   inclusive forms of nationalist mobilization that stifled attempts at
   internal polarization while creating elites who could negotiate on
   Catalonia's behalf in the transition. In other words, the ability of
   moderate Catalan nationalists to organize before the transition explains
   their ability to represent Catalonia and control its fissures later, and
   contributes to explaining the success of Catalonia as a case of peaceful
   multinational coexistence.},

Abstract = {Does the experience of living in the United States lead Chinese people
   to believe that China should pursue democracy? Our study produced mixed
   results, as we found that overseas study resulted in significant
   attitude changes by various means. Education in social sciences and
   consumption of foreign media were both associated with supportive
   attitudes toward democracy, and also led respondents to believe that
   Western liberal democracy is a good thing and to push for it.
   Conversely, living overseas had a negative effect on respondents'
   support for Chinese democratization, as the longer they had lived in the
   United States, the better they understood Western democracy and were
   suspicious about whether China should pursue immediate democratization.
   Meanwhile, we also find Chinese media has a negative impact on public
   support for democracy, both instrumental and intrinsic. Finally, factors
   associated with attitudes toward democracy, such as traditional values,
   self-expression values, and perceived performance of the Chinese
   government, were also significant.},

Abstract = {In comparing publics' ideological self-placements between established
   and new democracies, it has been observed that there is a higher
   proportion of citizens who express radical views in the latter
   countries. This is likely due to sharp differences with regard to
   evaluations of past authoritarian rule, the legitimacy of the new
   regime, or new institutional arrangements governing the distribution of
   power when countries embark on democratic transition. Studies on the
   attitudinal aspect of democratic consolidation lead one to expect a
   decrease in extreme views in new democracies with the passage of time,
   as questions of regime principles and institutions are settled, and
   citizens come to accept democracy as the ``only game in town{''}. The
   present article investigates whether this proposition is applicable to
   ``Third Wave{''} new democracies in Eastern Europe, Latin America, and
   East Asia by examining longitudinal public opinion data from 23
   countries. In addition to the length of democratic regimes, We also
   analyse the impact of economic performance, quality of governance, and
   electoral systems on the proportion of radical citizens. Results show
   that while longer democratic experience does contribute to reducing
   extremist leanings, factors such as the level of corruption, rule of
   law, and plurality electoral rules play a more substantive role.},

Abstract = {Although prior research demonstrates that strong partisans are less
   likely to cast a split-ticket, recent scholarly work hints that
   partisan-ideological sorting-the matching of an individual's partisan
   and ideological identities-may play a comparatively stronger role in
   shaping this voting behavior. Simply, if a high degree of congruence
   between identities underscores psychological orientations that prevent
   association with an out-group, then highly-sorted voters should be less
   likely to cross-party lines within the voting booth. Using the 1972-2012
   ANES Time-Series and 2010 CCES surveys, we provide evidence that
   demonstrates that a high degree of partisan-ideological sorting produces
   the strongest negative effect on split-ticket voting among a variety of
   alternative explanations at both the national and subnational levels. We
   then supplement these analyses with 1992-1996 ANES panel data to
   demonstrate how changes in sorting over time affect this voting
   behavior. Our results indicate that although an increase in partisan
   strength alone is insufficient to reduce an individual's propensity to
   cast a split-ticket, an increase in identity sorting over time has a
   strong negative effect on split-ticket voting. We conclude with a brief
   discussion about the consequences of identity convergence; namely, that
   sorting fosters a unique form of electoral ``polarization.{''}},

Abstract = {We present reasons to expect that campaigns are less negative under
   preferential voting. We then examine if preferential voting systems
   affect how people perceive the conduct of elections. This paper reports
   results from surveys designed to measure voters' perceptions of
   candidates' campaigns, comparing places with plurality elections to
   those that used preferential voting rules. Our surveys of voters
   indicate that people in cities using preferential voting were
   significantly more satisfied with the conduct of local campaigns than
   people in similar cities with plurality elections. People in cities with
   preferential voting were also less likely to view campaigns as negative,
   and less likely to respond that candidates were frequently criticizing
   each other. Results are consistent across a series of robustness checks.

Abstract = {This paper examines how Japanese leading politicians cope with the
   communication problems posed during televised political interviews.
   Based on data gathered during the year 2012-13, the paper replicates and
   modifies the Theory of Equivocation to detail the responsiveness of
   national and local level politicians (and for comparison also of
   non-politicians) to interview questions. Its main focus is on the extent
   to which Japanese politicians equivocate during televised programs, and
   the reasons underlying this equivocation. Overall, the paper aims to
   identify the motives behind interviewees' equivocation, thereby to also
   assess the significance of these talk shows in the broader context of
   political communication in Japan.},

Abstract = {Austerity policies policies of sharp reductions of a government's budget
   deficint involving spending cuts and tax increases are claimed to boost
   support for radical political parties. We argue, counter to popular
   claims, that austerity measures actually reduce support for radical and
   niche parties. Austerity policies force traditional left-right politics
   to the forefront of political debate with the traditional mainstream
   parties having a stronger ownership over those issues. We systematically
   explore the impact of austerity measures on the electoral fortunes of
   niche parties in 16 developed countries over a 35-year period, while
   controlling for a number of socio-economic variables. We find that
   austerity policies that rely on tax increases affect radical parties on
   the left and the right in different ways than fiscal adjustments based
   on spending cuts. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {At the end of its sixth legislative term the European Parliament adopted
   a rule change subjecting all final passage votes on legislative matters
   to roll call votes. Some studies use this rule change to assess whether
   roll call votes are characterized by more or less party discipline.
   Cautioning against such simple comparisons I propose to estimate in this
   article the extent to which members of the European Parliament are
   subject to party pressure. Comparing the results from the beginning of
   the sixth and seventh legislative term shows that in final passage votes
   the average party pressure has decreased considerably after the rule
   change.},

Title = {Comparing online campaigning: The evolution of interactive campaigning
   from Royal to Obama to Hollande},
Journal = {FRENCH POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {234-253},

Abstract = {Studies of election campaigning from a comparative perspective have a
   long history; this study approaches the topic through a most-similar
   regime perspective to explore the ebb and flow of innovations in digital
   campaigning between presidential campaigns in France and the United
   States. The hype surrounding the 2008 Obama campaign overshadowed
   innovations in France the previous year, while the 2011 contest gained
   little serious academic attention. Using a well-established content
   analysis methodology the research explains the strategic design of the
   digital dimension of the campaigns of the leading candidates (Sarkozy
   and Royal in 2007, Obama and McCain in 2008, Hollande and Sarkozy in
   2011, and Obama and Romney in 2012). The research then assesses the
   strategic contribution of each feature using schematics for
   understanding the flow of communication, as well as the strategy
   employed by each candidate. The key findings are that the campaigns are
   becoming more interactive, with the citizens increasingly more able to
   enter into conversations with the campaign teams, however interactivity
   when it happens is carefully controlled. Largely, however, there is a
   strong similarity masked by the sophistication of US contests. Despite
   the advances in communication technology and the social trends they have
   instigated, campaign communication remains top-down and digital
   technologies are used to gather data and push supporters towards
   activism than creating an inclusive space for the co-creation that
   cyberoptimists argued would revitalise the structures of democracy.},

Abstract = {Even though the Law has always focused on words that are offensive and
   damaging, and which convey hate or incite to violence, during the last
   few years there has been a growing preoccupation with the capacity of
   cyberspace to augment the harmful effect of some expressions or forms of
   violent communication. This paper approaches the topic beginning with
   the observation and analysis of more than 250,000 tweets published in
   Spanish after the Paris attacks that victimized those responsible for
   the satirical French weekly Charlie Hebdo and its workers. After several
   screenings and readings of the tweets, the different typologies of
   communication with violent and hate content have been identified and
   this has allowed for the construction of a Taxonomy of Violent
   Communication and Hate Speech on the Internet. Also, the results of
   prevalence studies are analysed and they demonstrate firstly that the
   nature of violent communication on the Internet is testimonial, even in
   violent events such as those analysed; secondly that the most serious
   forms are less representative than other forms of expression of bad
   taste or that impact social sensibility, and finally that hate speech
   has a relevant presence even if it does not represent the majority of
   the expressions tweeted during the event.},

Abstract = {Dominant narratives of migrant resistance focus on the massive protests
   of 2006, but migrant protest was significant well before this landmark
   event. Drawing on an original database of 222 migrant protest events,
   this paper traces the development of migrant resistance in California
   between 1990 and 2010. We argue that migrant protest may be understood
   as political `acts of citizenship', which vary as they respond to
   specific vulnerabilities and political attachments. While a non-trivial
   minority of protests exhibited a global politics, oriented towards
   migrants' home countries or other places outside of the USA, the
   overwhelming majority of protests may be understood as inclusion
   politics, which sought to counter migrant precarity by promoting the
   integration and fair treatment of migrants within the USA. Within this
   broad emphasis on inclusion, however, migrant protest in California
   alternated between a work politics focused on issues such as wages and
   unionization, a protection politics focused on public services and
   goods, and an immigration politics centered on issues of legalization
   and law enforcement. The latter became increasingly prevalent over time,
   and would come to define the contemporary immigrant rights movement.
   Taken as a whole, the evidence affirms that migrants have significant
   capacity for developing collective agency and resistance.},

Abstract = {This report provides a review of the 2014 European Parliament (EP)
   elections in Ireland. Conventional wisdom suggests attitudes to the
   incumbent government or to the candidates on offer have shaped EP
   elections in Ireland, with sentiments about the EU having little
   potency. 2014 had the potential to be different: the EU had been
   especially prominent in Ireland over the past four years since the 2010
   EU-IMF (International Monetary Fund) bailout. The introduction of
   spitzenkandidaten (The President of the Commission had previously been
   chosen by a consensus of European leaders in the European Council,
   followed by approval from the EP. But under the Lisbon Treaty, the
   European Council must take into account the results of the EP elections
   when selecting the Commission President which gave the EP the power to
   influence the next Commission President, also gave credence to the idea
   that the 2014 elections might involve a stronger European dimension.
   Using data from media sources, an exit poll, and the 2014 European
   Election Study, our objective is to establish how the campaign evolved
   and what influenced the 2014 result in Ireland. We find the 2014
   European elections for the most part were second-order', with vote
   choice mainly influenced by attitudes to the Fine-Gael/Labour coalition.
   Candidate personality also mattered. However, EU issues gained little
   traction in the campaign and opinions on the EU had minimal impact on
   party choice. Our results show that domestic politics remain key to
   understanding EP elections in Ireland.},

Abstract = {This article examines the debated relationship between
   liberal-democratic politics and states of exception in conditions of
   emergency. After Walter Benjamin and Giorgio Agamben, it is often
   maintained that today we live in a situation of perennial
   exceptionalism, where emergency measures have become a regular practice
   even by governments we name `democratic'. In these circumstances,
   exception is deemed to threaten democracy and hinder individual and
   collective political agency. Yet, such interpretation remains rigidly
   focused on the expanded governmental powers ushered by the exception.
   The article first unpacks how the relationship between exception and
   democracy has been differently addressed by juridical and biopolitical
   approaches. Then, it attempts an alternative heuristic: it discusses
   possibilities of democratic associative practices in emergency by
   looking at the notion of resistance that Michel Foucault links with
   power. This route remains unexplored in the literature on the concept of
   the exception.},

Abstract = {This article describes the effect of the relationship between Financial
   Intelligence Units of Mexico and the United States to investigate
   unusual dollar inflows in Mexico and to detect a transnational network
   of money launderers in 2012, 2013 and 2014. This impact was measured
   taking into account the evolution of cooperation between the Units
   through their annual reports and official documents together with the
   annual report of the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units. The
   process of exchange of information between the two institutions is
   analyzed and its relationship evaluated regarding the construction of
   the requires intelligence to articulate arrest warrants and money
   laundering. It is concluded that the impact has been beneficial for both
   countries, as there are successful cases of detention of criminals for
   money laundering through the joint work of the Units.},

   model. The 2008 US campaign marked a turning-point in the use made of
   the Web in politics and in campaign methods, particularly through the
   massive recruitment of supporters. This push to rationalise campaigning
   techniques was illustrated in France, during the 2012 presidential
   election campaign, with the door to door canvassing operation carried
   out by the Socialist Party (Parti Socialiste, PS). We shall see that in
   France it is not as easy to recruit volunteers to knock on doors as it
   is in the United States because these practices conflict with the
   party's traditional ways of doing things. Reference to the foreign
   context was used to enlist support for the innovation and legitimise the
   objective of effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Governments develop new strategies to `guide' citizens' behaviour.
   Simultaneously, hierarchical policy intervention is increasingly frowned
   upon. The apparent tension in contemporary social policy between the
   will to intervene, on the one hand, and the will to be equal on the
   other hand is the central problematic of this article. The Netherlands
   are a strategic context in which to investigate how egalitarianism and
   intervention are negotiated in practice, because of claims of strong
   egalitarianism and a long and heavy history of paternalism. This article
   looks at a case of paternalist intervention there: parenting guidance.
   Using ethnographic data, it argues that today's paternalism is
   distinctly egalitarian in its form. Egalitarian interactional forms such
   as debate and negotiation were produced between mothers and
   practitioners. These forms prevailed, no matter what content
   practitioners and mothers discussed. I offer the concept egalitarian
   paternalism to understand this and suggest that this concept and the
   focus on interactional forms in policy practices may give important
   clues to researchers beyond the Netherlands on reinventions of the
   relationship between the state and its citizens.},

Abstract = {Does representatives' legislative activity have any effect on their
   electoral performance? A broad theoretical literature suggests so, but
   real-world evidence is scarce as empirically, personal and party votes
   are hard to separate. In this article, we examine whether bill
   initiation actually helps MPs to attract preference votes under flexible
   list electoral systems. In these systems, voters can accept the
   party-provided rank order or vote for specific candidates, which allows
   a clear distinction between personal and party votes. The empirical
   analysis uses data on bill initiation by Belgian MPs in the period
   2003-2007 to explain their personal vote in the 2007 elections. We find
   that particularly single-authored proposals initiated shortly before the
   upcoming elections are associated with a larger personal vote.},

Abstract = {Prominent accounts of public opinion argue that citizens' preferences
   are unstable, with stated desires on policies varying wildly from survey
   to survey, and ideologically incoherent, with preferences on multiple
   policies evidencing little or no structure. In the aggregate, these
   findings suggest that many voters are not capable of fulfilling their
   normative role in the democratic system. In this article, we challenge
   this conventional view and argue that the apparent instability and
   incoherence among the public are both overstated and outdated. Using
   panel surveys from the 1970s, 1990s, and 2010s, we conduct a multi-trait
   multi-method (MTMM) confirmatory factor analysis of citizen preferences
   in multiple issue areas. Our results reveal a surprising degree of
   preference stability in all three time periods across many policy
   domains. Furthermore, our results reveal increasing levels of
   ideological thinking over time and that these patterns of stability and
   coherence hold across subpopulations defined by levels of
   sophistication.},

   might he drawn either on Machiavelli's reception in France in the 16th
   century, or on their shared endeavour to elaborate a modern political
   language, or on the analogy between their brief and sharp Humanist
   treatises, or, last but not least, on the variations of the enunciation
   by which both texts hinder any disambiguation of the authors'
   intentions. Beyond these formal convergences, Machiavelli and La Boetie
   also share a conceptual endeavour, as they try to conceive the
   plasticity of time, through the figures of for tuna (Machiavelli) and co
   u tu me (La Poetic), as a paradoxical condition of human free agency.},

Title = {Local participatory innovations and experts as political entrepreneurs:
   The case of China's democracy consultants},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {478-497},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {This study is concerned with understanding the dynamic behind
   participatory innovations in China. The case of China provides a
   contrast to the literature on participatory innovations in democracies.
   While participatory innovations in democratic countries are seen as a
   way to deepen and improve democracy, in China these innovations are to
   some extent developed in order to provide an alternative to electoral
   democracy. In this article I introduce the concept democracy consultant
   to describe expert political entrepreneurs involved in the development
   of participatory innovations. Research on local participatory innovation
   in China is abundant but the role that experts play in this process has
   previously not been analysed. Based on in-depth interviews with
   democracy consultants and local officials, the study finds that
   democracy consultants frequently act as bridges between central and
   local levels of government by providing expertise, information,
   legitimacy, and connections. This is especially true in localities where
   local leaders want to gain the attention of the central level but lack

Abstract = {There is a heated debate on whether immigration is associated with
   domestic and transnational terrorism. As of yet, however, we lacked
   rigorous evidence that could inform this debate. As a contribution to
   address this shortcoming, we report spatial-econometric analyses of
   migrant inflows and the number of terrorist attacks in 145 countries
   between 1970 and 2000. The results suggest that migrants stemming from
   terrorist-prone states moving to another country are indeed an important
   vehicle through which terrorism does diffuse. Having said that, the
   findings also highlight that migrant inflows per se actually lead to a
   lower level of terrorist attacks. This research significantly improves
   our understanding of international and domestic terrorism and has
   critical implications for the scholastic approach to terrorism, as well
   as for countries' immigration policies worldwide.},

Abstract = {Recent reports on the use of mediation in the European Union question
   the strategies adopted by the member states, insisting that the
   provisions of the Directive 2008/52/EC have not been bold and imperative
   enough, therefore conducting to the relative lethargy of mediation as an
   alternative to courts in solving disputes. This paper analyzes the
   provisions of the Directive and how they have been transposed into the
   national legislation of Romania, as a case study relevant to the
   subject. It argues that there is not enough data to claim that these
   provisions or any other would have had a different impact upon the
   recourse to mediation in the EU.},

Abstract = {The present study examines juridical aspects of principle of no loss.
   The major basis of this principle is justice. Perhaps because of this
   reason, ``principle of no loss{''} has priority over the rest of
   arguments like private and public and etc. Or it has control over
   generality and universality and applicability of arguments. And here,
   the view of jurists and lawyers is different at giving right prejudicial
   or give it to the injured party. This is the assumption that has been
   considered in most verses and hadith evidence of the principle of no
   loss. This indicates that ``the idea of changing circumstance{''} before
   known in European rights, it had known at the rights of Islamic law
   centuries ago. Regarding to the views of Sunni religious leaders and
   scholars after them-it is clear that Sunni jurisprudence has no clear
   criteria for principle of no loss. Although, in many cases, Sunni
   religious leaders have considered the nature of the harm, but because in
   practice the current principle could not solve all of the issues and
   problems, therefore, they have resort other criteria and finally they
   resort to preference and correction.},

Abstract = {The self is performed through the banal of the everyday on social media.
   The banality of the everyday constitutes an integral part of our
   communication on digital platforms. Taking this as part of our
   performative lives in the digital economy, the paper looks at ways in
   which we co-produce the self through the banality of the everyday as
   well as a wider imagination and engagement with the world. These wider
   engagements are termed as `fictive' not because they are unreal but
   through a conceptual notion of how the self is performed and imagined
   through wider world events in digital platforms and screen cultures
   where convergence of technologies allow us to be constantly consumed
   through the screen as we live out our daily lives. The narration of our
   lives through the banal and the fictive constantly co-produces the self
   through a situated domesticity of the everyday and equally through the
   eventful. In the process it reveals our ongoing relationship with the
   screen as an orifice for the production of self and the construction of
   a social reality beyond our immediate domesticity.},

Title = {The Cold War in American Neoconservatism: An Enduring Influence},
Journal = {REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS POLITICOS},

Number = {172},
Pages = {205-234},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Neoconservatism is a movement and a doctrine that has been present in
   American politics for more than forty years. Although it had its peak of
   influence a decade ago, during George W. Bush's first term, it is
   necessary to go back to its formative and development years in order to
   properly comprehend its vision of the world. This article will analyze
   how the Cold War plays a key role in understanding the origins of
   neoconservatism in late 60's and early 70's, as well as in its evolution
   up until the fall of the Berlin Wall. Thus, the idea that international
   politics and US Foreign Policy were a minor issue in the first
   neoconservative epoch will be contested. However, the Cold War is not
   only essential for understanding the past of neoconservatism but it is
   also fundamental to enlighten the study of its present. In this sense,
   nowadays neoconservatism has inherited several features of that time,
   among them a world view that remains basically rooted in the Cold War
   logic.},

Abstract = {We contribute to the growing literature on emotions and politics by
   focusing on the political relevance of disgust, a basic emotion
   characterized by visceral aversion to a potentially offensive stimulus.
   We offer a conceptual clarification of disgust's potential connection to
   politics, arguing that individual differences in sensitivity to feeling
   disgusted inform public demand for policies designed to protect citizens
   from physical, moral, or imaginary contamination. We show that disgust
   sensitivity operates independently of political ideology and informs a
   wide array of protectionist policy preferences across the ideological
   spectrum, even controlling for other relevant predispositions. Our
   analyses suggest that disgust sensitivity is distinct from simple
   out-group hostility, and the relationship between disgust sensitivity
   and opinion on policies regarding out-groups depends on the content of
   those policies. Finally, survey experimental results suggest that
   political communication can activate disgust sensitivity in public
   opinion.},

Abstract = {Studies of civil war have shown the strategic influence of geography and
   space on the occurrence of conflict. While civil wars cluster and spread
   between states in international neighborhoods, ethnic groups within
   states consider their geography and location in choosing to foment
   rebellion. In answering why some ethnic groups turn to civil war, I
   unify and build on these ideas to develop a theory that ethnic civil
   wars follow patterns of contagion within states. I contend that ongoing
   conflicts in groups' geographic proximity provides increased logistic
   and strategic opportunity for successful rebellion. Using spatially
   weighted regressions, I find evidence that ethnic civil wars are
   contagious within states and that such intrastate contagion is robust to
   other intra- and interstate neighborhood effects that may alter groups'
   calculus of rebellion. These insights consistently demonstrate that
   accounting for groups' broader strategic surroundings yields important
   implications for the study of civil war.},

   This bank has special role in international trade, financial and
   economic and monetary relations. Sepah bank by allocating the credit and
   providing the necessary resources for foreign investment and
   international trade after the Islamic Revolution in Iran and alignment
   with government policies has always had a special place in
   macroeconomic. In 1386 this Bank was sanctioned by America government,
   and since then it has been consistent with this conditions and when was
   sanctioned by United Nations as first Iranian bank because of Iran's
   nuclear program, how to comfort with this status and to fight was placed
   on the agenda. By establishing a special committee in bank based on the
   leader directions to resist economy, alternative ways to get out of the
   existing situation was carried out and Sepah bank was considered as a
   pattern for next sanctioned bank.},

Abstract = {Judges increasingly alter or veto government decisions. The aim is to
   explain this `judicialization' of British politics. Existing theories
   focus on what the judges' want for themselves, or they focus on changes
   to social attitudes. But a key variable, often omitted in research, is
   the law itself. If the meaning of law is increasingly difficult to
   determine we should expect a greater role for adjudication in politics.
   A descriptive time series analysis of 8278 sections of primary and
   secondary legislation between 1920 and 2010 demonstrates a significant
   increase in indeterminate language used by Parliament to communicate
   with government and the courts. This includes policy spaces with high
   judicialization: immigration, homelessness and anti-discrimination.},

Abstract = {The recent and still enduring global economic and financial crisis
   deeply impacted the institutional framework in Italy and Spain by
   prompting a series of reforms, which ultimately re-shaped the local
   government features. Based on a qualitative comparative analysis of
   recent reforms, the author shows that (directly and indirectly)
   crisis-driven provisions have significantly impacted the local levels
   and changed the central/local relations in both countries. During the
   years of crisis, a decrease in local discretion in its three main facets
   (fiscal, administrative, and political/functional) has taken place. This
   outcome could both allow for a better understanding of how central and
   local governments have interacted during the crisis and to contribute to
   the formulation of more general considerations on local discretion and
   central/local relations in Italy and Spain.},

Title = {Voter Buying: Shaping the Electorate through Clientelism},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {Studies of clientelism typically assume that political machines
   distribute rewards to persuade or mobilize the existing electorate. We
   argue that rewards not only influence actions of the electorate, but can
   also shape its composition. Across the world, machines employ voter
   buying to import outsiders into their districts. Voter buying
   demonstrates how clientelism can underpin electoral fraud, and it offers
   an explanation of why machines deliver rewards when they cannot monitor
   vote choices. Our analyses suggest that voter buying dramatically
   influences municipal elections in Brazil. A regression discontinuity
   design suggests that voter auditswhich undermined voter buyingdecreased
   the electorate by 12 percentage points and reduced the likelihood of
   mayoral reelection by 18 percentage points. Consistent with voter
   buying, these effects are significantly greater in municipalities with
   large voter inflows, and where neighboring municipalities had large
   voter outflows. Findings are robust to an alternative research design
   using a different data set.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {14},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {At the heart of the growing politicization of the EU lies a concern with
   how European integration potentially undermines forms of communal
   self-government linked to established political identities. This concern
   originates not from the much discussed democratic deficit of EU
   institutions but from a `democratic disconnect' between domestic
   democratic institutions and processes and the decisions made at the EU
   level by national executives and EU officials. Our contention is that
   enhancing the role of national parliaments in EU decision making offers
   a way to reconnect the integration process with the communal self-rule
   of the member states. We ground this argument in an account of the
   normative basis of the EU that we dub `republican
   inter-governmentalism'. We argue that national parliaments offer a means
   for what we term the domestication and normalization of EU policymaking
   within the democratic processes of the member states. However, these
   effects will only occur if mainstream domestic parties employ these new
   parliamentary powers to develop competing EU policies that reflect their
   core ideological positions and those of their voters. We propose the
   introduction of a Parliamentary Legislative Initiative as a mechanism to
   provide an incentive for them to do so.},

Abstract = {Many researchers find out that impacted the types of Chinese foreign
   policy starting in the mid-1990s. However, Chinese foreign policymakers
   presented ``New Grand Strategy{''} for the 21st century in the
   mid-1990s. This strategy exceptionally intended to advance and keep up
   China's image in the abroad. On the other hand, Policy observers contend
   introducing of the South Asian region that deliberately essential to
   emerging China. In addition, Chinese vicinity in Sri Lanka that
   verbalized by policy observers numerous ways. These contentions express
   that China's soft power in Sri Lanka that ought to be an extraordinary
   choice in Chinese policy arrangement. This article investigates current
   appearance of China's goodwill agenda inspecting two strains of Chinese
   policy in Sri Lanka that breaking point to observe foreign aid and the
   Confucius institute that lead the Peoples' Republic of China in 2000s.
   The paper additionally assesses the achievement of this alleged soft
   power crusade in Sri Lanka utilizing a worldwide overview to figure out

   conclusions about China. This article assesses the adequacy of these
   endeavors by breaking down public opinion survey accumulated by the
   Gallup surveying in 2011. Information utilized for this article has been
   gathered from a substantial number of books, periodicals, magazines,

Title = {Dual Language Legislation: What Can New Zealand Learn From the Canadian
   Model},
Journal = {AUSTRALASIAN PARLIAMENTARY REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {130-144},
Month = {SPR-SUM},
Abstract = {At the time of writing this paper, dual language legislation was
   becoming more common in New Zealand's House of Representatives. Despite
   this, no systems were in place to deal with drafting an entire Act in
   two languages. This paper compares how dual language drafting has
   evolved in both New Zealand and Canada and what key features of the
   Canadian model could be implemented in New Zealand. Jurilinguists and
   concurrent drafting are key features of the Canadian drafting model that
   could work well in New Zealand as they ensure consistency between the
   two language versions. But drafting all legislation in two languages
   could be problematic in New Zealand due to the costs involved, lack of
   trained drafters skilled in both English and Te Reo Maori, and because
   English is now the first language of most New Zealanders. Both languages
   having equal status within the legislation could also create
   difficulties in New Zealand if an inconsistency in meaning arose between
   the two language versions. This is more likely in New Zealand than
   Canada as Te Reo Maori and English are linguistically more different
   than English and French.},

Abstract = {This article examines sixty years of data from the American National
   Election Studies, and finds that the electorate's focus on candidate
   attributes has declined substantially. Whereas 80\% of respondents had
   mentioned personal attributes in the past, in recent elections only
   about 60\% have done so. Furthermore, such comments are now more tied to
   partisan identification and have less of an independent impact on voting
   behavior. The chances of presidential image makers successfully making a
   difference by emphasizing a president's personal character are now much
   less than in the era of Johnson, Nixon, and Reagan.},

   rights in the political view of human beings as fundamentally relational
   and human rights as fundamentally collectively enjoyed. Using girls'

Abstract = {This article considers education policy under the SNP Governments from
   2007-2016. It deals with aspects from primary, secondary and tertiary
   education. The main approach of the article is to examine the role of
   education policy within the broad context of SNP governing strategy.
   Education is treated as a key element of strategy throughout the policy
   period. The SNP's long-term strategic aim is independence for Scotland.
   The article examines ways in which governing strategy, and education
   policy in particular, were used by the SNP within the constraints of
   devolution during the period 2007-2016. The political background to that
   strategy changed significantly during the period. The article discusses
   the opportunities and challenges presented to the SNP in the context of
   diverging views on education and other elements of economic and social
   policy within the UK, particularly in the period after the 2015 General
   Election.},

Abstract = {Does the source of campaign funds influence legislative polarization? We
   develop competing theoretical expectations regarding the effects of
   publicly financed elections on legislative voting behavior. To test
   these expectations, we leverage a natural experiment in the New Jersey
   Assembly in which public financing was made available to a subset of
   members. We find that public financing exerts substantively negligible
   effects on roll-call voting. We then find a similar result in an
   examination of state legislatures. We conclude that, counter to the
   logic of the US Supreme Court, pundits, and reformers, the source of
   campaign funds exerts minimal influence on polarization.},

Abstract = {This article has two aims: First, it examines the effect of a democratic
   and non-Western regional hegemon on democratization processes in
   neighboring countries, applied to the case of South Africa and its
   influence on democratization in Lesotho. Second, it applies Levitsky and
   Way's framework to the case of Lesotho. The results of the analysis
   attenuate optimism about the potential of democratic non-Western
   regional hegemons to replace missing Western linkage and induce full
   democratization in neighboring countries. The analysis shows there is
   high linkage and leverage between South Africa and Lesotho according to
   Levitsky and Way's measurement. Yet the 2012 turnover through elections
   in Lesotho turns out to be a sign of unstable competitive
   authoritarianism, rather than an indication of an evolution towards full
   democratization, i.e. it is the result of high Western and South African
   leverage, low Western linkage, and low organizational power of the
   incumbent party. A qualitative assessment of linkage between South
   Africa and Lesotho shows that linkage between the two countries is not
   as dense as suggested by the measurement according to Levitsky and Way's
   criteria. This calls into question whether their measurement criteria
   for linkage actually reflect their own hypothesized role of linkage.},

Title = {From capacity to sovereignty: Legislative politics and differentiated
   integration in the European Union},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Pages = {100-119},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The literature suggests that legislative politics among European Union
   Member States is characterised by economic exchanges, and constrained by
   the social norms of a European community of legislators. Both views draw
   a clear line between the legislative process and the conflicts over
   sovereignty that have left their mark on treaty making and European
   public opinion since the 1990s. This article suggests revisiting this
   view, based on an analysis of why Member States have opted out of
   legislation from the 1970s to today. It argues that differentiation,
   while once a response to capacity problems of relatively poor countries,
   has recently become driven by sovereignty concerns of the Union's
   wealthy and nationally oriented Members that oppose the EU's intrusion
   into core state powers. The article presents evidence for the impact on
   legislative outcomes of factors so far thought not to matter. The
   results indicate greater European-level legislative responsiveness
   towards national sovereignty demands than previously recognised. They
   underline that the nature of European politics has been changing with
   the EU's push into core state powers.},

Abstract = {When Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 disappeared from radar screens in
   the early hours of 8 March 2014, initial reactions suggesting that it
   was just another airliner disaster proved only partially correct. This
   article offers the interpretation that the multinational search effort
   for the missing Malaysian Boeing 777-200 airliner was revelatory of an
   abridged form of security competition among the mostly Pacific Rim
   states participating in both the post mortem and the search and rescue
   (SAR) operations. Although the Asia Pacific peace has been largely
   unbroken since the end of the Cold War, security competition among great
   powers, middle powers and weak states is still ongoing. In fact, this
   security competition is taking on proxy forms given the relative
   robustness of the overlapping architecture of Pacific Rim security
   regionalism in tamping down pressures for overt armed conflict to
   advance national security interests. MH370, following in the wake of the
   destruction wrought by natural disasters since the early 2000s, has
   provoked a competition in technological prowess in SAR operations, and
   more broadly, in quasi-civilian humanitarian assistance and disaster
   relief (HADR) capabilities amongst Pacific Rim states that have
   overlapping claims on the South China Sea and with interests in revising
   existing patterns of diplomatic order.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a contractual approach to coping with difficult
   situations of intractable conflict where ordinary citizens are at the
   center of the struggle. The contractualist peacemaker challenge is to
   convert conflicting parties into a peacemaking community committed to
   resolving the conflict by peaceful means. Three main elements are
   necessary to transform conflicting groups into a peacemaking community:
   common interest: strong desire to resolve the conflict by peaceful
   means; rules: commitment to democratic principles of dialogue; and
   peacemaking institutions: an organizational device that operates and
   maintains peacemaking communities. A peacemaking institution that has
   the potential to create momentum for the establishment of a peacemaking
   community is a major public negotiating congress. An ideal congress
   invites delegations from all walks of life to negotiate solutions to the
   conflict. This vision is based on the multi-party talks of the 1990s
   that helped to create a major change in two difficult situations of
   intractable conflict: the troubles' in Northern Ireland and the battle
   against the Apartheid system in South Africa. This paper explores
   possibilities to establish a major Israeli-Palestinian public
   negotiating congress.},

Abstract = {This article aims to defend responsibility-sensitive egalitarianism by
   arguing for the rational capacities-based principle of responsibility as
   a plausible conception of an agent's responsibility for inequalities
   caused by his or her choice in responsibility-sensitive egalitarianism.
   I show that the rational capacities-based principle of responsibility is
   not only philosophically defensible as a conception of genuine choice,
   but also promising enough to ward off two common worries which cast
   doubt on responsibility-sensitive egalitarianism (qua luck
   egalitarianism): first, the rational capacities-based principle of
   responsibility allows the assignment of differential degrees of
   responsibility to rational agents in proportional terms, which may make
   it echo the adverse effects of their childhood environments. Second, its
   proportional construal essentially allows that nobody possesses a full
   degree of rational capacities. This enables responsibility-sensitive
   egalitarianism to refute the harshness objection.},

Abstract = {The modern social citizen is a dual figure: at one and the same time a
   legal-universal abstraction and a particular living being with specific
   capacities, proclivities and attitudes. The Settlement movement from the
   late nineteenth century articulated and shaped both universal and
   particular dimensions of social citizenship. It contained the imperative
   of guidance of individual conscience and the modern discourse of
   universal social rights. The article demonstrates that it is impossible
   to maintain a division between, on one side, the subject of
   individualizing pastoral care originating in religious poor relief and
   philanthropy, and, on the other side, formal rights based on
   universalism and the modern state. The Settlement movement lies at the
   pathway of belief, subjective interpretation and respect for the
   particular person and at the pathway of factual knowledge of social
   patterns and large-scale policy reforms. The focus on the particular
   person as subject was the legacy of Christian piety, whereas the concept
   of universal citizen was associated with the rise of social science at
   the University of Chicago. We explore this paradox of the particular and
   the universal through the work of Jane Addams as both sociologist and
   founder of Hull House.},

Abstract = {According to natural scientists, human colonization of nature has
   reached such degree that there are reasons to conclude that we have left
   behind the Holocene and we are entering into a new geological age
   featured by the human influence on the global planetary system: the
   Anthropocene. Far from being just a scientific curiosity, the latter
   represents an epistemological turn with deep normative consequences, as
   it does pose new challenges for the species as a whole. This paper
   explores the origins and content of the hypothesis, paying special
   attention to its effects on humanity's self-representation, as well as
   to its moral and political implications. The Anthropocene seems to be a
   promising opportunity for reframing the -increasingly
   relevant-ecological dimension of the debate on the good society and for
   reorganizing socionatural relations according to sustainable standards.},

Abstract = {The paper employs Zipf's law to examine the distribution of military
   spending across countries in the world over the period 1988-2012.
   Military spending can cautiously be treated as a crude and distant proxy
   for military capacity and strength, and hence states' hard power. The
   paper finds that the first-in-rank country (the USA) consistently spends
   more on the production of military capabilities than what is projected
   by Zipf's law to correspond to a balanced international structure. This,
   tentatively interpreted, implies the use of military strength (and the
   concomitant costs for acquiring it) as a tool of hegemonic status
   consolidation, perhaps vis-alpha- vis other rising global players. In
   turn, the countries at the lower end of the rank, although they have
   overall increased their military outlays, seem to spend less on defence
   than this is anticipated by the law. This finding may be pointing to
   free-riding on the military strength of allies and other major powers.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an approach to El fiord (1969), by the Argentinian
   author Osvaldo Lamborghini, from the contemporary perspective of the
   post-political reader. Understanding the latter concept as epistemic
   space and not as a mere political strategy, we ask: ?what remains of a
   strongly ideological text when read from a society without ideologies?
   ?{''}Can the politic content of a literary text remain current over
   time? To try to answer these questions we propose the revision of some
   important concepts such as those of ``political literature{''} or
   ``transgression{''}, in light of an organic and constantly moving theory
   of text.},

Abstract = {On 23 June 2016 the United Kingdom voted in a referendum to leave the
   European Union. As well as citizens of the UK, residents of the UK
   Overseas Territory of Gibraltar were also allowed to vote, with 96 per
   cent voting Remain. While the exact modes and timings of the UK's exit
   from the EU remain unclear, the campaign was characterised by
   increasingly heated debate and sharply contrasting visions for Britain
   and its relationship with the wider world in the twenty-first century.
   Matthew C Benwell and Alasdair Pinkerton argue that the UK's 2016 EU
   referendum campaign and the political and economic evaluations that it
   has invited have exposed a shifting relationship between the UK and its
   Overseas Territories (OTs) and demonstrate the role played by the EU in
   fostering the OTs' political, economic and regional security - a
   perspective often ignored by the OTs' so-called friends' and supporters.},

Abstract = {In this article, we present an overall picture of the inclusiveness of
   IA, based on data on over 800 IAs carried out by all DGs of the European
   Commission from 2003 to 2013. According to official guidelines, IAs can
   deliver a variety of goals, and we posit that each goal can be linked to
   a different inclusion strategy. Specifically, we consider that the goal
   of coordination requires the inclusion of Commission actors, the goal of
   collecting neutral expertise requires the involvement of working and
   expert groups, while pursuing input-legitimacy requires a large number
   of stakeholders as well as online consultation open to the general
   public to be part of the procedure. Our findings reveal that DGs tend to
   prioritise coordination over collection of expertise and input
   legitimacy and that experience in carrying out IAs favours a more
   participatory approach, meaning that the more DGs make use of IA the
   more they will tend to include stakeholders and to launch public
   consultation. On the whole, the analysis highlights the importance of
   learning to fully develop the potential of the ambitious EU IA regime.},

Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2016},
Number = {14},
Pages = {74-91},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The right to practice religion is recognised as one of the universal
   liberties transitional justice interventions are designed to defend, and
   religion is often mentioned as one of the cultural factors that impact
   on local transitional justice practices from below. Many human rights
   cases of abuse, however, are motivated by religious extremism and the
   association of religion with conflict has largely a discouraged
   reflection on its positive contribution to transitional justice. This
   field is undeveloped and the little work that elaborates its positive
   role is descriptive. This paper theorises the relationship between
   religion and transitional justice and develops a model for understanding
   its potential role that better allows an assessment of its strengths and
   weaknesses. The model is applied to original research conducted on
   ex-combatants in Northern Ireland, and concludes that only in very
   limited circumstances can religious actors make a telling contribution
   to transitional justice. Understanding what these circumstances are is
   the purpose of the model developed here.},

Abstract = {After the collapse of the non-democratic regime in the early 1990s,
   public opinion surveys became important factor in the process of
   democratic decision-making. Authors are analysing the results of public
   opinion surveys, which bring together data on the attitude of the
   general public towards democracy, (dis)satisfaction with the political
   situation and (dis) satisfaction with most important political
   institutions; special emphasis is given to the general public's (dis)
   trust toward the democratic institutions in comparative (European)
   perspective. Based on the data obtained authors allocate Slovenia's
   position compared to other established European democracies as well as
   post-communist countries from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) on the
   scale of the relationship of the dimensions of societal trust in

Title = {Explaining Japan's Revolving Door Premiership: Applying the Leadership
   Capital Index},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {36-53},
Abstract = {The tenure of Japanese prime ministers is famously short. Between 2006
   and 2012 Japan changed prime minister once a year. What factors can
   explain Japan's revolving-door premiership? To explore this puzzle, this
   article applies the Leadership Capital Index (LCI) developed by
   Bennister, `t Hart and Worthy (2015) to case studies of the nine
   Japanese prime ministers holding office between 2000 and 2015.
   Leadership capital is the aggregate of leaders' political resources:
   skills, relations and reputation. The LCI thus allows analysis of the
   interplay between individual capacities and contextual conditions in
   determining leaders' ability to gain, maintain and deploy power. The LCI
   is applied to answer two questions. Firstly, what accounts for the short
   tenure of many Japanese premiers? In which of the LCI's three leadership
   dimensions do Japanese leaders lack capital? Secondly, what forms of
   capital allow some prime ministers to retain office for longer than
   average (>2 years)? In particular, the article analyses the leadership
   of Junichiro Koizumi (2001-2006) Japan's longest serving prime minister
   since the 1970s, and incumbent Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has held
   office for three years since December 2012. As well as utilising the LCI
   to comparatively analyse the tenure of Japan's prime ministers, this
   article tests the applicability of the Index beyond Western
   parliamentary democracies.},

Abstract = {This paper argues the importance of using modern methodology of Marxist
   analysis for the study of imperialism and the so-called ``empires{''}.
   This methodology allows to show the mechanisms of economic, political,
   ideological, and other types of manipulating ``periphery{''} by capital
   and states of the ``centre{''}. On this methodological basis it is
   proved that capitals and state machines of semi-periphery countries in
   general and Russia in particular are mostly objects of imperialist
   subjugation and manipulation and only in some rare cases these countries
   and their capitals are able to be subjects of the imperialist policy.
   The authors analyze the contradictions in relations between the Russian
   Federation, Ukraine and the West, and present a system of political,
   economic and geo-political arguments proving that Russia as a rule does
   not act as a subject of imperialist policy, and only in some cases
   (generally relying on the Soviet legacy) Russia is able to withstand the
   ``rules of the game{''}, given by the imperialist powers. It is argued
   that these few cases when Russia withstands the ``rules of the game{''}
   is the main reason for the imperialist powers' diatribes against the
   ``Russian imperialism{''}.},

Abstract = {Empirical evidence suggests that non-participation underlies a variety
   of social dilemmas. In collective risk social dilemmas (CRSD),
   non-participation is viewed as strategic defectiona selfish behavior
   that increases individual utility at the cost of the group. We conducted
   a hybrid laboratory-then-online experiment to examine if
   non-participation in a CRSD may be fundamentally different from the act
   of strategic defection. We confirmed that non-participation is a problem
   in a social dilemma. When participation is required, a randomly formed
   group of subjects was virtually certain to reach the loss prevention
   threshold (0.999 probability). On the other hand, when an empirically
   realistic non-participation option was introduced, the probability of
   reaching the goal by a randomly formed group decreased to 0.599. We also
   found evidence that the profile of a typical non-participant does not
   fit the profile of a strategic defector. Non-participants in the
   experiment were highly cooperative when they had to make a contribution
   decision. Non-participants in the experiment did not try to increase
   their payoffs, including in the treatment condition when
   non-participation led to a default contribution of 100\% of the
   subject's endowment.},

Abstract = {Words such as conviviality and convivialism have recently appeared in
   the vocabulary of the social and political sciences, heralding a radical
   change of perspective about politics and economics, as a way of
   enhancing democracy and ensuring the protection of Planet Earth. But
   these words have a long history behind them, which have thickened their
   meanings, and sort of prepared them to represent those instances. At its
   very core, the idea of the social nature of human beings. Moving
   backwards, from the Convivialist Manifesto to Ivan Illich and to Jean
   Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, this essay will try to show the role played by
   this idea in these different contexts.},

Abstract = {The Swedish Model has always been the main reference for social
   democracy. In spite of it, its theoretical roots are not committed to
   the Keynesian principles, but to a peculiar version of neoclassical
   theory. By means of the so-called Rehn-Meidner and EFO Models, Swedish
   social democracy developed a solidaristic wage policy based on a
   powerful trade union movement and a centralized wage bargaining system,
   all under a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy framework. Through a
   process of wage compression and labour costs restraint, this strategy
   tried to foster productivity and ease capital centralization and
   concentration. The ultimate aim was to stimulate Swedish exports
   competitiveness as a way to ensure a proper rate of profit and a strong
   accumulation path.},

Abstract = {Since 2005, the orange-black Ribbon of St. George has been Russia's most
   important symbol for remembering victory in the Great Patriotic War. The
   colours of the ribbon go back to a ribbon on which the Order of St.
   George, first awarded in the mid-18th century, was worn in the Russian
   Empire. In the Soviet Union as well, these were, starting in 1942, the
   colours of a badge then called the Guards ribbon. During the protests
   against election fraud in winter 2011/2012, the ribbon for the first
   time became a symbol of the Putin regime's followers, who now wore it
   outside the celebrations of Victory Day on May 9. After the upheaval in
   Ukraine in February 2014, it became a symbol for the insurgents and
   separatists in the Crimea and Ukraine's east. In Russia, it is now
   omnipresent and has often become a largely meaningless symbol that is
   even used to market consumer products.},

Abstract = {Although Marx's critique of capitalism, especially his theory of
   fetishism, requires experiential knowledge (my term for
   ``spirituality{''}), his framework does not leave any conceptual room
   for such knowledge. The idea that spirituality is (perhaps the better)
   part of religion is a deeply held assumption of secular Western thought.
   Only in Michel Foucault's late lectures do we find a Western thinker
   realizing that what opposed spirituality, and subsequently suppressed
   it, is not science but religion. This essay reconstructs Foucault's
   reasons for making that startling claim and then explores how Marx's
   early insight into the secularization of European culture can be
   deepened with the help of Foucault's genealogical analysis of the
   disappearance of spiritual knowledge in the West. Equipped with a
   framework to understand the secularization of Western culture in a
   radically different way, the essay then tackles the question of
   reformulating Marx's theory of reification with the resources provided
   by experiential knowledge (spirituality).},

Title = {Continuity vs. radical break: national homogenization campaigns in the
   Greek-Bulgarian borderlands before and after the Balkan Wars},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {405-426},
Abstract = {Scholarly interpretations of the Balkan Wars and World War I frequently
   present these two conflicts as a radical break that unleashed new
   policies of national homogenization on an unprecedented scale. Instead,
   this article seeks to establish important lines of continuity between
   the nineteenth century and the interwar period by examining how
   Bulgarian and Greek national activists and officials treated nationally
   ambiguous individuals in their (aspired) territories. First, the article
   explores the dynamics of the religious controversy between the (Greek)
   Patriarchate and the (Bulgarian) Exarchate in the long nineteenth
   century to show that Bulgarian and Greek activists constantly struggled
   to determine who their supporters were in the Ottoman borderlands of
   Macedonia and Thrace. From the 1830s to the establishment of the
   Exarchate in 1870 to the Macedonian conflict in the early 1900s, the
   ambiguity of people's religious and national identities made it
   impossible to clearly distinguish who was a `Greek' and who was a
   `Bulgarian'. Next, the article studies Greek and Bulgarian minority
   policies in the 1920s and 1930s, tracing lines of continuity with the
   prewar period. The two administrations used various criteria of national
   classification-language, religion or ethnicity-to sort out their Muslim
   minorities (Turks and Pomaks) in ways that would benefit the dominant
   national community of Bulgarians or Greeks. But the frustration of
   officials who wanted to divide up their populations into discreet
   nationalities was most evident in their policies vis-a-vis the Slavic
   speakers of Macedonia in the 1930s, who were subjected to elaborate
   classification schemes that tried to fit their idiosyncratic identities
   in the `correct' national group. Altogether, the continued presence of
   people with flexible identities who defied the straightforward efforts
   of the national administrations to homogenize their territories remained
   the hallmarks of the entire period from 1870 to 1945.},

   process is considered. This ideology serves to conceal the economic
   relations of production that shape artistic labor as a producer of

   Intellectual property rights are examined from the perspective of value

   initial aim of the research was to evidence shifts in terrorist frames
   in the marketing of policing equipment before and after 9/11, our
   findings instead suggested that what we are seeing is the rise of
   marketing to police as ``vulnerable warriors{''}, law enforcement
   officers in need of military weapons both for their offensive
   capabilities and for the protection they can offer to a police force
   that is always under threat.},

Abstract = {Do voters behave strategically in local elections? Does democratic
   experience influence voters' capacity to behave strategically? Is there
   a relation between education and voters' capacity to anticipate the
   mechanical effects of electoral statutes and adapt their behaviour
   accordingly? Using an original data set covering the complete democratic
   period, this paper studies strategic voting at the local level in
   Portugal. Using an ecological inference approach, we contribute to a
   vast body of literature on strategic voting by testing whether theories
   developed for national contexts travel to local contexts. Our findings
   suggest that (1) voters consistently defect to non-viable lists to
   support viable lists; (2) democratic experience helps voters to learn
   how to maximize their utility; and (3) education is important for
   voters' ability to identify a strategic setting.},

   until the EP Election 2014},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {457-479},
Abstract = {Since the formation of the German AfD in spring 2013, political
   scientists have discussed whether the AfD can be classified as a
   populist party. Despite the split of the party in summer 2015 leading to
   this characterisation becoming uncontested, the question remains whether
   the AfD was populist from its inception. This article demonstrates that
   distinguishing between the tactical and strategic agendas of the party
   solves this conundrum. While the AfD seldom applied populist discourse
   in its official manifestos, its tactical agenda was undoubtedly framed
   by populism. Ironically, it has been the ideologically moderate
   economist wing that has applied populist discourse in combination with

   Fascism},
Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2016},
Number = {18},
Abstract = {The article examines the main categories and lines of analysis developed
   by Gramsci in his analysis of fascism. In order to fully understand
   fascism's particular characteristics, he developed a reading that
   brought into play a more general interpretation of the history of Italy
   and the processes of transformation typical of the capitalist societies
   of his time. This consisted in an analytical apparatus that evolved over
   time, with the change in Gramsci's conditions of existence and degree of
   political involvement, and with the different successive phases of the
   fascist movement and the dictatorship. The article examines his whole
   political and intellectual itinerary, with special reference to the
   reflection carried out during his detention and written down in the
   Prison Notebooks. The categories that Gramsci developed in this phase
   are grouped around three clusters of problems which in some cases take
   up again suggestions and traces of analyses sketched out previously:
   social classes and historical periods, forms of command (a subject
   connected with the reflection on ``caesarism{''}-{''}bonapartism{''} and
   on the intellectuals), and ``passive revolution{''} and the nexuses with
   the changes in capitalism and Fordist modernization.},

Pages = {467-490},
Abstract = {This article offers a complementary analysis to the prevailing
   literature on soft power by addressing the issue of multilateral soft
   power. While the prevailing literature on soft power tends to look at
   how soft power manifests itself within individual nations, this article
   attempts to analyze the manifestations of collective soft power in the
   vehicle of a multilateral organization. This can be referred to this as
   compound soft power. Such an analysis looks at a macro-level class of
   soft power. In doing so, it looks more broadly at the configuration of
   the forest, in contradistinction to the prevailing research on soft
   power, which looks predominantly at individual trees (i.e. individual
   country analysis). While this analysis of compound soft power is
   undertaken specifically within the context of the BRICS, it is intended
   to be generalized to the study of all international organizations.},

Title = {NEOLIBERALIZATION BY EVALUATION Explaining the Making of Neoliberal
   Evaluative State},
Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {495-516},
Abstract = {Starting from the late seventies neoliberalism has emerged as the new
   global hegemonic paradigm. Several studies demonstrated that different
   factors facilitated the global spread of neoliberalism, but little
   attention has been paid to the role played by evaluation both in
   legitimizing the neoliberalization of the state and in explaining the
   resilience of neoliberalism. The article argues that evaluation is a
   strategy of action which is able to emphasize the adaptive capacity of
   neoliberalism to different socio-political contexts and the neoliberal
   purpose to depoliticize public action. The contribution aims to
   illustrate how evaluation works on a twofold level. On the one hand,
   evaluation is a tool of global governance that acts normatively to
   homogenize states' action consistently with some neoliberal values, such
   as competitiveness and economic efficiency. On the other hand, to
   conform to such values, variegated forms of evaluation are implemented
   by each state in order to introduce market rationality in non-economic
   domains, such as education and health system. Referring to some
   empirical cases, these two overlapping processes are termed as the
   ``evaluated state{''} and ``evaluative state{''}. As a result,
   neoliberalization by evaluation is a process involving the elevation of
   market-based principles and techniques of evaluation to the level of
   state-endorsed norms.},

   Science Harms Democracy},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-80},
Abstract = {Critical theorists in the mid-twentieth century argued that behavioral
   social science by its nature conceptualizes knowledge as the power to
   predict and control. As such, rather than serving as a source of
   enlightenment or emancipation, social science risked functioning as a
   tool for dominating and manipulating the public. The power of this
   criticism, however, was undermined by the behavioral revolution's
   initial failure to produce theories that offered much prognostic power.
   Recent methodological and technological developments in the social
   sciences have begun to generate an impressive ability to predict human
   behavior, especially when combined with new innovations in marketing and
   computer science. Disturbingly, political campaigns and interest groups,
   especially in the US, appropriate this new knowledge to try to alter the
   beliefs and behaviors of voters. This development bodes ill for US
   democracy and other liberal democracies where the use of these
   techniques is likely to increase. It turns citizens into objects of
   manipulation and undermines the public sphere by thwarting public
   deliberation, aggravating political polarization, and facilitating the
   spread of misinformation.},

Title = {\textbackslash{} The Effect of Personal Idealism, Relativism, and
   Machiavellianism on Voting Tendency: A Turkish Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-69},
Abstract = {This study examined the relationship between Turkish voters' ethical
   characteristics and voting tendencies to the political left, right, or
   center by applying the Ethics Position Questionnaire (EPQ) and Mach IV
   to the collection of data for analysis from 500 voters in a national
   election in Turkey. The most significant finding is that there was no
   statistically meaningful relationship among levels of idealism,
   relativism, or Machiavellianism and voting tendencies to the political
   left, right, and center. However, results generated by EPQ and Mach IV
   questionnaire found that voting tendencies were affected by personal
   relativism (0.10), followed by Machiavellianism (-0.03) and idealism
   (-0.03). Results show that respondents' voting tendency was most
   affected by the level of their personal relativism, but the magnitude of
   the effect was not statistically significant. The mean scores for
   Machiavellianism and relativism attributes were on average in the
   midrange of the scale, while mean scores for idealism show that the
   participating voters agreed most strongly with the statements relating
   to the idealism and could be characterized as absolutist by their low
   relativism and high idealism. The results demonstrate a positive linear
   relationship, linking both idealism and relativism to Machiavellianism
   and indicate statistically significant positive correlations among the
   three variables.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},

Volume = {12},

Pages = {85-101},
Abstract = {Two major goals of teaching include educating students to communicate
   effectively and encouraging students to critically engage with
   information. To what extent can student blog writing help us achieve
   these goals? In this pilot study, I analyze how short ``blog-style{''}
   writing assignments compare to more traditional short research essays in
   promoting student learning and engagement with research. I compare the
   two writing styles using a basic content analysis; I then analyze
   student self-reports on their engagement with class learning goals and
   whether each assignment encouraged further interest in the topic. I also
   examine the amount of time students devote to each assignment, how many
   drafts they prepare on each assignment, and how many and what sort of
   sources they use. Despite the data-gathering limits of the pilot study,
   I find preliminary support that blogs and essays best serve as
   complementary writing assignments, as each style encourages students to
   develop different research and writing skills.},

Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2016},
Number = {51},
Pages = {167+},
Abstract = {The article examines the boundaries of democratic ideas by examining two
   competing claims on the concept of democracy from post-Soviet Russia on
   the one hand Kremlin-based ideas of a ``sovereign democracy{''}, on the
   other hand organicist notions of democracy in current Neo-Eurasianism.
   These two alternative conceptions of democracy formulated as explicit
   attacks onto Western universalism are outlined in their discursive
   manifestations and contrasted with theciretical concepts and political
   programs from the ``West{''}. On the basis of these examples, the
   article discusses the fraught relationship between theory and propaganda
   in political thought on democracy as well as the discursive
   interdepencies between ``Western{''} and ``non-Western{''} (or even
   ``anti-Western{''}) claims on democracy.},

Abstract = {One of the most serious threats to a modern country's trade, industry
   and long-term economic development is cyber espionage and insiders. The
   activities are directed against high-technological industries and
   companies with advanced basic research. The defence and telecoms sectors
   are of particular interest, just as biotechnics, medical and material
   technology. Behind this kind of espionage there may be individual states
   and security services as well as competing companies. One trend is that
   criminal players are getting involved both as thieves and fences of
   information. Computerisation and the development of the Internet
   drastically increase the possibility of procuring sensitive information
   through illegal means. This can be done in different ways. In the paper
   the convergence between industrial-and cyber espionage are discussed. A
   number of examples are provided of different kinds of espionage as well
   as some of the methods that is used to collect information over the
   Internet such as signals intelligence, monitoring of traffic,
   penetration and overtaking of computers with the aid of trojans.
   Examples are given on succesful cybertheft operations such as the
   operation Buckshot Yankee and the Chinese Ghostnet. The paper ends with
   a discussion on how to improve information security in organisations in
   order to reduce the risks for illegitimate information drainage.},

Title = {The Rhetorical Shadows of the Anti-Conversion Bill: Religious Freedom
   and Political Alliances in Sri Lanka},
Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3},
Pages = {189-202},
Abstract = {The practice of proselytisation is increasingly challenged in many parts
   of the world, especially in South Asia. Laws to prohibit ``improper' or
   `unethical' conversions are being discussed in several countries.
   International legal texts are vague and elusive when it comes to the
   practice of proselytisation, and are susceptible to different
   interpretations of how to regulate proselytism. Drawing on the argument
   that religious freedom is trapped within the antinomies of inviolability
   and regulation, I argue that anti-conversion legislation falls precisely
   into such antinomies. Hence, political actors are increasingly able to
   use such antinomies to legitimise and justify their own reading of
   international norms. A study of the policy process of the anticonversion
   bill in Sri Lanka reveals that the formation of political alliances
   between religious affiliations had a decisive impact on the outcome of
   the process. This case shows how legislative reform on religious
   practice and proselytism may be played out in a local context with
   multiple religious communities, and the importance of formulating an
   inclusive legislative proposal that speaks to all stakeholders. This
   paper looks into the politics on the ground around the anti-conversion
   bill, and how several religious organisations (Hindus, Catholics,
   Protestants, Evangelicals, and Buddhists) formed and broke up political
   alliances during the process. In addition to the core argumentation to
   support and/or oppose anti-conversion legislation, particular alliances
   and affiliations were important during the process. Why did the All
   Ceylon Hindu Congress (ACHC) initiate the anti-conversion bill proposal,
   only to oppose it later? Why were the Catholic groups an interesting
   partner for the Buddhist nationalists when they sought to create a
   compromise bill in 2006? By considering the local religious and
   political context of Sri Lanka, this paper will argue how
   anti-conversion legislation is not solely dependent on international
   norms, but also upon the partners and affiliations advocating for them
   on the ground.},

Abstract = {The starting point of the conclusions of politicians and experts was the
   recognition of the changed nature of threats to the New World Order. In
   post-Westfalia system of international relations the main actors are not
   sovereigns, but transnational actors of world politics, including
   transnational terrorist and criminal networks. In this situation, the
   support of global security threat serves the underground world
   terrorists, shady business structures, failed states. The unconventional
   nature of the threat to peace and stability of the New World Order
   requires an equally innovative response which transcends the formal
   constraints of international law and the traditional doctrine of
   deterrence. An analysis of the U.S. foreign policy concepts suggests
   that today's academic and political community has promoted consensus of
   neoliberals and neoconservatives, supporters of the institutional
   functionalism and representatives of the school of Realpolitik. This
   consensus was based on the recognition of the admissibility of
   pre-emptive strikes on the territory of failed states, sponsoring
   international terrorism, or the implementation of open interference in
   the internal affairs of ``rogue states{''} for human rights and
   democratic freedoms guarantee.},

Volume = {28},

Pages = {287-334},
Abstract = {The inherent complexity of modern financial systems, and their basis in
   human behavior, make it hard to establish unequivocally the ``who, what,
   where, when, and why{''} of the global financial crisis. However, after
   almost a decade, we know enough to discard much of what has, in the
   meantime, become folk wisdom about the causes of the debacle, including
   Wall Street bonus culture, bankers' greed, the moral hazard of ``too big
   to fail,{''} government intervention ({''}too much government{''}) and
   deregulation ({''} not enough government{''}). While each of these
   factors may have played some role, the crisis can be much more
   accurately described as one of ignorance than malevolence. The common
   thread tying the emergence of the bubble to the disastrous consequences
   of its bursting is the misunderstanding of correlation and causation
   links in three key domains: economic policy, financial modeling, and the
   regulatory framework. These misunderstandings helped fuel the housing
   bubble and introduced fragility into the system, making it vulnerable to
   the bubble's subsequent, unavoidable burst.},

Abstract = {Why has constructivism emerged as an important force in the field of
   international relations and politics in the end of the 20th century? Why
   constructivism and not any other theoretical approach? The
   constructivist perspective of international relations appeared as a
   counterbalance to rationalism that was entrenched in US Political
   Science throughout the last decades. Analyzing the contemporary state of
   world affairs through the prism of social constructivism provides us
   with a unique understanding of how intersubjective perceptions lead to
   unique epistemic interpretations of reality, which form the ideological
   framework within which social constructs are being generated.
   Constructivism succeeds not only in identifying the motives behind the
   behavior of international actors, but also in unfolding the mechanism
   through which those motives are being envisaged and accepted through the
   process of social construction - here lies the greatest value of the
   constructivist approach in IR theory. Culture formation, nation
   building, imagined communities, security complexes - the constructivist
   approach remains an invaluable tool in the arsenal of political
   analysts, seeking to understand how culture, history, social order,
   religion, and language project their influence on the international
   arena and ultimately: why international players behave the way they do?},

Abstract = {This paper is situated within the rhetorical turn in political science
   and investigates the discourses constructed by Trotskyist parties in
   order to justify the policy of electoral participation despite poor
   electoral performance. A wide range of texts are examined from eight
   organizations that contested seats in the 2010 UK General Election. The
   thrust of Trotskyist discourse downplayed dismal vote totals,
   contextualizing them by reference to pro-Labour tactical voting and
   elaborating a variety of benefits that emerged from electoral
   participation. It is argued that such analysis could usefully be
   incorporated into the study of party responses to electoral problems and
   setbacks.},

Title = {The Nationalization of Special Elections for the U.S. House of
   Representatives},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {22-39},
Abstract = {Scholars and political commentators have argued that special elections
   to the U.S. House of Representatives are national contests, serving as a
   referendum on the president's party and a predictor of future election
   outcomes (Sigelman 1981; Smith and Burnnell 2010). But the empirical
   record is mixed, with one leading study demonstrating that candidate and
   district characteristics alone explain special election outcomes
   (Gaddie, Bullock, and Buchanan 1999). We investigate this disagreement
   by comparing special election and open-seat results using new data for
   the period 1995-2014. We find that while candidate characteristics
   affect special election outcomes, presidential approval is predictive of
   special election outcomes as well. Furthermore, we find that the effect
   of presidential approval on special election outcomes has increased in
   magnitude from 1995 to 2014, with the 2002 midterm representing an
   important juncture in the nationalization of special elections. We
   conclude that special elections have developed into national contests
   since the 1970s and situate this development within broader electoral
   trends.},

Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {25-35},
Abstract = {The global system is being rocked by the dueling ambitions of two
   competing blocs, with the US and its allies fighting to reinforce their
   unipolar system while Russia and its partners struggle to forge a
   multipolar future. The rapidity and scope with which events are
   unfolding makes it overwhelming for the casual observer to make sense of
   all of the complex processes currently at play, and truth be told, it's
   understandable that all of this can appear confusing. In an attempt to
   clarify the present state of global affairs and forecast the direction
   that it's all headed in, the article begins by explaining the nature of
   chaos theory and describing how it's applicable to conceptualizing
   contemporary international relations. Afterwards, the idea of ``chaos
   sequencing{''} is proposed, which in essence is a model that can be used
   in understanding the process of chaotic change. Following that, the
   article addresses the topic of global systemic change and includes the
   most relevant examples for how this relates to the present day. Next,
   the research combines these two aforementioned elements (chaos theory
   and global systemic change) and presents a forward-looking geopolitical
   analysis that incorporates cutting-edge Hybrid War theory and aims to
   put the New Cold War into its proper perspective. Finally, the article
   ends on a suggestive note in encouraging analysts to study the authors'
   conceptualization of Hybrid War in order to better prepare themselves
   for understanding and responding to forthcoming international events.},

   Officials who had held leadership positions in authoritarian regimes are

   Soviet period and the tenure of Viktor Yanukovych (2010-2014). Some

Title = {Two concepts of liberal developmentalism},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {97-123},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {``Developmentalism'' is often regarded as the bete noire haunting
   liberal political theory, justifying modern civilizational hierarchies
   and liberal imperialism. But are all developmentalisms equally tied to
   Eurocentric, imperialist philosophies? I consider this question through
   a close reading of two of the most prominent, influential, and divisive
   modern accounts of historical development: those of Kant and J.S. Mill.
   I argue that Kant's philosophy of history is embedded in an
   Enlightenment idealism treating non-Europeans as bound to either adopt
   Western norms or fade into obscurity. Conversely, the influences of
   Romanticism and sociology led Mill to recognize cultural differences as
   indelibly affecting any society's development. Given this, I argue,
   against much of the current literature, (1) that Mill provides us with a
   significantly more capacious liberalism than Kant's; (2) that his
   developmentalism holds the conceptual resources to understand progress
   as a pluralistic and culturally differentiated process; and so, more
   broadly, (3) that not all liberal developmentalisms are equally bound to
   imperialist politics.},

Abstract = {Since democracy requires the involvement of citizens, the topic of
   political participation has attracted great attention from both
   practitioners and scholars. During the current financial and economic
   crisis, there have been various protest movements in many European
   countries. In this paper, which employs data from the European Social
   Survey and analyzes some European countries using a longitudinal study
   (2002-2012), I measure unconventional political participation
   considering three types of action - signed a petition, participated in a
   lawful demonstration and joined a boycott. By linking citizens to
   government ideology and vote for party government to political action
   through a multilevel model, this paper argues that both ideology and
   citizens' electoral choices have a bearing on unconventional political
   participation. In times of crisis, government choices do not feed the
   level of unconventional political participation. However, differences
   emerge in terms of political behavior when I consider citizens'
   ideology, loser status and government ideology.},

Abstract = {There has been considerable attention to the influence of diamond wealth
   on conflict. By examining the role of diamonds in Namibia, this research
   shows that under some conditions diamond wealth can make conflict less
   probable. It examines possible conditions that may have made Namibia the
   exception to the rule by exploring five factors: the neighborhood
   effect, political dynamics, economic institutions, grievances, and
   political geography. Given these conditions diamonds have contributed to
   the absence of conflict in Namibia for two reasons: diamonds have
   historically been mined in the desert area that makes smuggling
   difficult and the joint agreement between the government and De Beers
   has led to a taxable base, strengthening state institutions.},

Abstract = {Most research about NGOs is related to governments and international
   organizations. There is less research about how regulation constrains
   and defines the role of NGOs in the political systems where they
   operate. This article analyzes the evolution of regulations effecting
   NGOs in Spain, specifically those NGOs related to foreign aid. The goal
   is to explain how opportunities and organizational costs vary due to
   State intervention. Through the analysis of Spanish regulation it is
   shown that State intervention affects how NGOs organize and
   professionalize, and institutionalize the interaction between the two
   actors. State intervention constrains NGO's capacity to survive and to
   consolidate as major actors within the political system.},

   presidential elections},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {470-488},
Abstract = {While most of the voter turnout literature focuses on the differences
   between voters and nonvoters, scant attention has been paid to what
   separates regular voters from the ``irregular voters{''} who move in and
   out of the electorate. This article shows that citizens who regularly
   vote will be more knowledgeable and involved in the political system
   than voters who turnout irregularly. In addition, the article supports
   the existing claim that it is easier for voters to understand social
   policies than economic policies. These two principles lead to the
   hypothesis that economic and social policy preferences will predict the
   decisions of regular voters while the decisions of irregular voters will
   be predicted by social policy preferences but not economic preferences.
   American National Election Studies data from 1988 to 2008 provide
   support for these hypotheses. Though poor economic conditions may bring
   irregular voters out to the polls, their ballots are cast for candidates
   with similar social policy preferences, not necessarily similar economic
   stances.},

Title = {THE CRISIS REALITY AND PROSPECTS OF POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE
   RUSSIAN SOCIETY},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2016},
Number = {5},
Pages = {8-24},
Abstract = {On the basis of results of the sociological monitoring study held by the
   Institute of Sociology, Russian Academy of Sciences, the author analyzes
   the features of the ``new crisis reality{''} and its influence on the
   political process in contemporary Russia. The author also pays attention
   to the citizens' perception of activities of the authorities of
   different levels and of the key public agencies. It is noted in the
   article that the reorientation of the mass attention from the foreign
   policy agenda to the problems of the everyday practices substantially
   reduced the level of confidence in the majority of the state and public
   institutions to the one of the ``Crimean period{''}. At the same time,
   in accordance with the sociological data, social reaction to the crisis
   is ``childish{''}: Russian society seeks no economic or political
   changes and associates all its hopes for coming out of the crisis with
   the head of the state. In this context, the author focuses on the
   prospects for the evolution of the political regime and for the possible
   reaction of the Russian society to one or another way of this evolution.
   The author particularly tries to answer the question whether there are
   social preconditions for the rebirth of the ``super-presidential
   republic{''} to an authoritarian personalized regime. Building his
   analysis on the sociological data, the author gives a negative answer to
   this question, noting that most Russians associate the future of their
   state with the type of organization of public life that ensures human
   rights, freedom of expression of the individual, i.e. with democracy.
   They do it even in spite of the critical attitude to the ``Russian
   version{''} of democracy. It is also noted in the article that one can
   observe contours of a future coalition that is interested in the
   ``Russian version{''} of democracy. This coalition of the so-called
   ``self-sufficient Russians{''}, on the one hand, focuses on stability
   and on constructive dialogue with the authorities, and on the other
   hand, these ``self-sufficient Russians{''} do not need government
   patronage.},

Number = {51},
Pages = {318+},
Abstract = {Democracy is a much-examined concept that combines several supposedly
   well-known characteiistics of a political system. Macro-concepts largely
   serve to identify the quality of democracy. Micro-concepts were
   previously known from research on political culture. The European Social
   Survey 2012 module `Europeans' understandings and evaluations of
   democracy' derives various items from these macro concepts and surveys
   citizens from 27 European countries. The frequency distributions of
   central concept variables suggest that understandings of democracy vary
   in respect to liberal and social-liberal characteristics of political
   systems. The divide between different understandings runs along
   differences in the economic situations and in the degree and extent of
   previous experience with democratic procedures.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the institutional crisis prevailing in the
   Dominican Republic as a result of the high levels of administrative
   corruption of the official Dominican Liberation Party (PLD) that the
   author identifies as a cartel party following Katz and Mair's model
   (1995, 1996, 2002, 2004, 2009). It is examined the relation between
   corruption, macroeconomic growth and poverty, the cartel party model,
   the electoral and governmental practice of the PLD as a cartel party and
   factual cases of corruption involving PLD officials from Leonel
   Fernandez and Danilo Medina's administrations, including ex-president
   Fernandez. It emphasizes the country's prevailing impunity of corruption
   cases sustained by the neo-corporatist character of the political system
   through the enthronement of PLD as a party/State organization that
   controls all the strata of public function. The author points out that
   this allows the impunity of corruption acts and the transference to
   other administrative functions of officials implicated in corruption
   activities versus a dysfunctional judicial system, a prevalent breach of
   trust and prebends, and a captive electorate sustained through
   supernumerary appointments and state subventions of popular and
   patronizing character.},

Abstract = {The economic doctrine over the last years has identified a number of
   factors that indicate the success or not for the state in an
   international context. There are theories like Mariana Mazzucato about
   innovation, Thomas Piketty and the issue of distribution of wealth, Luis
   Carlos Bresser-Pereira with new developmentalism, the fourth revolution
   of John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge, among others. Each of them,
   to his credit, although the solutions indicated by them do not represent
   all the complexity of today's world, it's necessary to look if Brazil is
   concerning, even minimally, to the specialized doctrine. The focus of
   the analysis of each theory, in comparison with the socioeconomic data,
   unfortunately show that the country has not yet woken up to the need to
   plan and adopt policies aimed at economic development.},

   Social Movements},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {206-225},
Abstract = {This article explores the growing use of mind/body practices such as
   meditation and yoga in Left social movements. The analysis is rooted in
   interviews with activists participating in the transformative
   movement-building current: the growing number of organizations
   integrating subjective and social transformation practices. William
   Connolly's work on micropolitics is put into conversation with the
   transformative movement-building current. The epistemological assumption
   undergirding this article is that textual political theory, and the
   knowledge being produced by activists, can benefit from dynamic
   exchange. My argument is that Connolly's post-Nietzschean political
   theory offers a powerful justification for the political importance of
   mind/body practices, one that adds to activist justifications. I also
   argue that transformative movement-building contributes to recent
   theoretical debates by concretely demonstrating the integral importance
   of micropolitics for successful macromovements.},

   blurry as in any fictional work. The testimonial strength of this story
   becomes extraordinarily powerful thanks to historical and political
   implications and notions like memory, violence and silence help to
   support a verbal work of art which is able to disturb the reader with
   distressing past images that become present during a political time
   subordinated to the artistic creation itself.},

Pages = {249-268},
Abstract = {Transparency is both a powerful idea and a technology of power
   associated with accountability, justice and democracy, which opposes the
   secretive and shadowy power of surveillance wielded by states and
   corporations. This article examines surveillance and transparency not as
   a dichotomy but as a constitutive relation in the field of academia,
   focusing specifically on ranking and rivalry in the context of
   competitive performance. Transparency-as-openness (open access
   platforms) is enmeshed in enclosures assembled from (self-)
   surveillance, personal data, public institutions and private enterprise.
   The analysis pays particular attention to how altmetrics and credibility
   metrics -used to enhance personal prestige and professional standing
   reinforce the neo-liberalisation of higher education. The article
   concludes by engaging critically with the politics and poetics of open
   enclosures with a view to re-imagining the practice of academic freedom.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the work of the playwright Carlos Somigliana
   (1932-1987), one of the most prominent figures of the Argentine scene of
   the 20th century. With a production marked by the socio-political
   instability in the country, the article explores the texts he wrote
   during the last Argentine military dictatorship, the self-styled
   national reorganization (1976-1983) process. This article examines
   Somigliana's produciton for the festival Teatro Abierto, a theatrical
   event against the dictatorship, the playwright's aesthetics - pervaded
   by satire, irony and parody - and the political nature of the text. To
   do so, the focus is on the plays El Nuevo Mundo (1981), El oficial
   primero (1982) and La democracia en el tocador (1984).},

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Controversies in global economic governance are strongly shaped by
   domestic societal forces. In some instances, however, governmental
   positions reflect domestic interests, while ideas influence positions in
   other instances. Under which conditions do ideas prevail over interests
   and vice versa? How do they interact with each other and with domestic
   institutions? I argue that governmental positions predominantly follow
   interests if the governance issue at stake impacts the cost-benefit
   calculations of specific sectors, while ideas dominate when sectoral
   interests are affected in a diffuse way and fundamental questions on the
   role of politics in steering the economy are at stake. Furthermore,
   governmental positions tend to be consistent with national institutions,
   when the global governance issue concerned refers to questions related
   to domestic patterns of socio-economic regulation. In enhancing the
   societal approach to international political economy (IPE), the article
   exemplifies the relevance of these arguments in case studies on the G20
   and the International Monetary Fund.},

Title = {Does Contemporary Critical Theory Need a Social Ontology, and Vice
   Versa?},
Journal = {POLITICA \& SOCIETA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {47-72},
Month = {JAN-APR},
Abstract = {I argue that contemporary critical theory needs the conceptual tools of
   social ontology in order to make its own ontological commitments
   explicit and strengthen its interdisciplinary approach. On the other
   hand, contemporary analytic social ontology needs critical theory in
   order to be able to focus on the role that social change, power, and
   historicity play in the constitution of social facts, and to see the
   shortcomings of an agential and intentionalist approach to social facts.
   My thesis is strengthened by a historical reconstruction of the presence
   of two different approaches in the original program of the family of
   critical theory apparently most hostile to social ontology, (the
   Frankfurt School), namely Horkheimer's program of a critical social
   philosophy which includes a social ontology, and Adorno's negative
   attitude towards it, epitomized by the paradoxical notion of ``ontology
   of the false state{''}. Adorno's negative attitude was later inherited
   by Habermas and Honneth, whose work I show to be nevertheless deeply
   laden with ontological commitments. I then argue that, if one accepts
   the socio-ontological redefinition of critical theory, then the
   post-metaphysical paradigm adopted by Habermas should be revised and a
   certain conception of the linguistic turn in the understanding of social
   action abandoned. On the side of contemporary social ontology, the
   impulse coming from critical theory should allow us to distinguish
   between forms of ``traditional social ontology{''}, that simply apply
   ready-made general metaphysical concepts to social reality, and a
   ``critical social ontology{''}, oriented to socializing ontology and
   critically transforming metaphysical categories.},

Title = {The Federal Features of the EU: Lessons from Canada},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},

Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Pages = {100-110},
Abstract = {There has been a rise and fall in interest in federalism in the context
   of European integration. This article assesses the federal nature of the
   EU. It draws in particular on the work of Michael Burgess who has been
   one of the key thinkers on this issue. Because there are many types of
   `federalisms' available across the globe, it is helpful to make a
   comparison with another political system to offer a base line. In this
   article I explore to what extent the EU already has federal features.
   With the help of the work of Burgess I seek to look beyond the specific
   characteristics of the EU and reflect on how a comparison with this
   other polity can offer us insights into what is going on within the EU
   political system. Drawing on the comparison with Canada, I seek to
   identify the characteristics of the EU that are already those of a
   federation. Therefore, the guiding question of this article is: compared
   to Canada, what particular features does the EU have that reminds us of
   a federation and what features is it still lacking? It finds that the EU
   has a considerable amount of federal features (federation), but that a
   federal tradition, a federal ideology and advocacy to a federal goal
   (federalism) are mostly absent.},

Abstract = {This article brings feminist literature on anxiety and wellness to bear
   on the responsibilities of mothers as they are represented in a series
   of popular editorial publications. It seeks to deepen the
   interdisciplinary dialogue between these theories of affect and theories
   of care work by examining how popular representations of maternal
   responsibility reflect a contemporary ``affect of motherhood{''} and
   indicate specifically that mothers might be ``coming undone{''} under
   the weight of a shared, political anxiety that they are encouraged to
   feel individually. It is argued that the newly complex and competing
   labours of mothers, and mothers' complicity in and resistance to these
   labours, can only be understood in the context of public anxiety. It
   asks what is at stake for the most disenfranchised women when it comes
   to recognizing and resisting today's intensified forms of maternal
   responsibility.},

Title = {The critical role of friends in networks for countering violent
   extremism: toward a theory of vicarious help-seeking},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-65},
Abstract = {Who would be the first to notice, and able to intervene, with
   individuals considering acts of violent extremism? Study 1 found
   evidence that those best positioned to notice early signs of individuals
   considering acts of violent extremism might be those individuals'
   friends: perhaps more so than school counselors, clergy, or family
   members. Furthermore, participants indicated that the predominant reason
   underlying individuals' reluctance to reach out to countering violent
   extremism (CVE)-relevant service providers was fear of the potential
   repercussions for such actions. Additionally, that fear generalized not
   only to a reluctance to reach out to law enforcement agencies, but also
   to others within prospective CVE-relevant networks (i.e. religious
   officials, or family members). An option for addressing such reluctance
   (via an evidence-based, anonymous, texting-oriented crisis hotline for
   associate-gatekeepers) is discussed. Given that reluctance, what factors
   might affect individuals' willingness to intervene in CVE contexts?
   Study 2 revealed two extensions to the bystander intervention model
   {[}Darley, J., \& Latane, B. (1968). Bystander intervention in
   emergencies: Diffusion of responsibility. Journal of Personality and
   Social Psychology, 8(4), 377-383], necessary for it to be applied more
   accurately, and usefully, to CVE contexts. Specifically, individuals'
   reluctance to dissuade their friends or family members from committing
   violence appeared to be moderated by their level of fear that doing so
   might damage their relationships with them. Furthermore, there was
   evidence that individuals' level of personal identification with friends
   or family members might reduce both their willingness to intervene, and
   their ability to recognize violent extremism in the making.},

Abstract = {This article examines the ethics of crowdsourcing in social science
   research, with reference to my own experience using Amazon's Mechanical
   Turk. As these types of research tools become more common in scholarly
   work, we must acknowledge that many participants are not one-time
   respondents or even hobbyists. Many people work long hours completing
   surveys and other tasks for very low wages, relying on those incomes to
   meet their basic needs. I present my own experience of interviewing
   Mechanical Turk participants about their sources of income, and I off er
   recommendations to individual researchers, social science departments,
   and journal editors regarding the more ethical use of crowdsourcing.},

Abstract = {The conventional understanding of the contemporary US as a polyarchy,
   considered as rule by multiple minorities, is not now supportable. It
   relies upon the salience of pluralism over political inequality, but
   these conditions are now inverted. The current salience of political
   inequality is the chief characteristic of unequalocracy, a political
   system type intermediate between polyarchy and plutocracy. Contrary to
   Gilens and Bartels, the US has not been demonstrated to have enough
   representational inequality to be a plutocracy. Using an alternative
   conception of what constitutes preference differences between high-and
   lowincome groups, and applying it to Gilens' own data, I find too few
   preference differences to show plutocracy exits in the US.},

Abstract = {Parliamentary party groups typically comprise members of parliament
   (MPs) with diverse preferences and different personal issue emphases. At
   the same time, speaking in plenary debates is a scarce resource
   controlled and allocated by parliamentary party group leaders. This has
   led recent research to investigate how speakers for plenary debates are
   selected. This contribution connects with this literature by asking
   whether MPs' personal issue emphases deviate from their parliamentary
   party groups' issue emphases. In order to answer this question, the
   issue emphases which individual MPs devote to a set of issues in an open
   access parliamentary instrument is measured and compared to the emphases
   MPs devote to these issues in speeches. The results for the 2005-9
   legislative period of the Norwegian Storting indicate that MPs differ in
   how closely aligned their issue emphases are in these two instruments
   and that these differences vary in a way consistent with theories on
   candidate selection and individualized MP behaviour.},

Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},

Abstract = {There is a substantial body of scholarship on the role of discourses in
   producing the neoliberal politics of austerity, but this has tended to
   leave untouched the question of how the household might be implicated in
   such discourses. This article argues that the introduction of various
   austerity programmes in the aftermath of the financial upheavals of
   2008-2009 has produced a new normalisation of the British household, and
   that much of this centres on particular narratives surrounding the
   concept of waste. Offering a genealogy of waste, we contend that the
   language and very politics of austerity are in part made possible
   through longstanding, historic discourses of household waste, and yet
   the concept of waste is in itself being reconfigured and reimagined in
   and through the language of austerity. We argue that such discourses
   serve to naturalise the systemic inequalities and structural violences
   of neoliberal capitalism, for they render the poor both individually
   culpable for their own poverty and collectively culpable for Britain's
   economic and social crisis.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article was to investigate the district work of members
   of the French National Assembly (MPs), namely their contacts with
   citizens and other kinds of actors on the ground. Based on original
   data, our results show that the MPs' constituency work is somewhat
   disconnected from the national political debate. They are close to their
   constituents and meet them regularly in surgeries or during local
   celebrations and events. Issues discussed are mainly oriented towards
   individual and local needs (housing, employment, etc.). A multivariate
   analysis highlights the different patterns of district work. Overall,
   this article suggests that district features and the MPs' individual
   characteristics shape their behaviour in their constituency. By
   exploring the concrete practices of French MPs at home, this article
   offers new insights into parliamentary representation and into the
   different logics that underlie district work.},

   tendency for citizens who supported a winning candidate or party to be
   more supportive of the democratic system and more trusting of government
   than supporters of the losers has been well documented. I test the
   extent to which individual-level investment in a presidential election
   campaign amplifies effects of winning or losing using the online
   component of the 2008 NAES to track the same individuals' from
   pre-election to post-election. The analysis provides strong evidence of
   amplifying effects of investment on the relationship between winning or
   losing and perceptions of electoral legitimacy. Certain types of
   investment policy agreement and participation appear to hold significant
   implications only for losers and not winners. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The financial crisis subjected the EU to its first truly serious stress
   test. A majority of citizens is now opposed to further integration. But
   party systems have barely adjusted, instead perpetuating traditional
   patterns of an evasive mainstream with Euroskeptic fringes. To explain
   this unexpected outcome we draw on issue yield (De Sio and Weber, 2014),
   a general model of political competition that unites public opinion,
   party unity and electoral support. Issue yield highlights how the crisis
   affected risks and opportunities differently for pro-and
   anti-integration parties. For such an asymmetric constellation, the
   model predicts the muffled choices supplied by most parties on EU
   matters. We use the European Election Studies 2009/2014 and the Chapel
   Hill Expert Surveys 2010/2014 to document these patterns. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Over the past two decades, communitarian criticisms of the lack of
   public engagement and a sense of local belonging have inspired extensive
   debates across Western Europe on how best to govern deprived urban
   neighbourhoods. One governmental strategy has been to engineer
   neighbourhood communities as localised, collective spheres of belonging.
   In this article, we show how governing through affect' has been part of
   Dutch neighbourhood policy since the turn of the millennium. Through an
   in-depth study of a community participation programme in a deprived
   Amsterdam neighbourhood, we analyse how policy practitioners use
   sensitising policy techniques' to enhance social cohesion and encourage
   communitarian citizenship among neighbourhood residents. Although
   governments often speak of communities' as self-evident entities, we
   argue that communities are better understood as enactments where
   discourses of neighbourliness, proximity, intimacy and familiarity
   encourage a localised, collective sense of belonging - a governmental
   strategy that mimics the pre-figurative' politics of radical social
   movements.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes an analytical distinction between modes of
   valorising and modes of valuing social reproduction to suggest that a
   conflict between these two opposing modes lies at the heart of an
   on-going crisis of social reproduction in the face of purported economic
   recovery, where unpaid reproductive labour constitutes a source of
   surplus value. A systemic imperative to expand markets in the pursuit of
   profitability goes hand in hand with a devaluation of social
   reproduction, either by making this work invisible or by externalising
   its cost. This article analyses the specificities of this process in the
   context of contemporary Britain and investigates the role of the state,
   focusing on volunteering and new forms of `affective remuneration'
   linked to financialisation and the connection between social
   reproduction and wealth extraction. In conclusion, the paper outlines
   the contours of possible counter-practices informed by a feminist
   politics.},

Abstract = {Post-revolution Iran is uniquely based upon the contradictory principles
   of divine and popular sovereignty but with ultimate authority delegated
   to jurists. At the same time, the theocratic basis of clerical dominance
   is rooted within a pluralistic and decentralised theological tradition
   peculiar to the Shiite establishment. Despite the tutelary institutional
   arrangements engineered by the ruling clergy, elections have generated
   unexpected outcomes and unleashed power and policy shifts. Emphasising
   the political dynamic generated by elections, this paper examines the
   uncertainties stemming from electoral processes that have been
   constructed by conflicting electoral and theocratic principles. In
   developing the concept of electoral theocracy, the paper highlights the
   paradoxes underpinning the hybridity of Iran's clerical and electoral
   authoritarian system of governance. These hybrid features have remained
   largely neglected in the literature on electoral authoritarian regimes.},

Abstract = {This article examines the effects of global capitalism and state
   coordination on the financial behaviour of chaebol (business
   conglomerates) in South Korea. This study focuses on the evolution from
   controller to coordinator in the post-developmental South Korean state.
   In recent times, the Korean government has been studied as the exemplar
   of the Asian newly industrializing economies (NIEs) based on its ability
   to control economic development. As civil society pressures outgrew
   government control in the 1990s, the government's mission shifted from
   control to coordination - the state sought to accommodate newly emerging
   or enlarged bargaining domains of key political-economic actors.
   However, the emergent post-developmental state is buffeted by the
   growing strength of the private sector, domestically and
   transnationally. While civil society strived to mobilize mass movements
   to further social democracy, the neoliberal evolution of capitalist
   class interests generated institutional configurations favouring the
   hegemony of finance capital.},

Number = {1},

Abstract = {As Islamophobia is on the rise in German society it also reaches into
   public institutions like schools. Not only students are influenced by
   the bad image of Islam being reflected by many media reports and public
   debates, teaching staff are also not immune to the effect of hostile
   attitudes towards Islam and Muslims. However, the stigmatization of
   certain groups is especially problematic, given the hierarchical
   relationship between teachers and students. The following article
   presents some of the findings of an ongoing research project about the
   reactions of Muslim students to Islamophobia in German schools. It looks
   at Muslim religiosity as a kind of stigma in German society and
   evaluates the possible ways in which students who belong to the
   stigmatized group can react to and manage to cope with these attitudes.
   It also discusses the possible empowering role that religion can play
   for some of the students.},

Abstract = {Citizenship rights is an obvious issue and one must defend the rights of
   citizens; but at the same time, we must consider the social realities of
   a society. When one speaks of the rights of citizens in a society, it
   does not mean to abide it and this right must be respected especially by
   government officials. To achieve this objective, the emphasis on
   understanding, implementation, and observance of citizenship rights
   should become as a culture and the government should do its supportive
   measures and efforts fairly and accurately so that social anomalies that
   are rooted in the lack of abiding citizenship rights, do not spread in
   the society. Therefore, it should be said that citizens, society, and
   the government are the three vertices if citizenship rights triangle, as
   the existence of all vertices is necessary. In this article, we discuss
   the concepts of citizenship rights and evaluate and assess the
   supporting principles of the individual and society which are considered
   as the government's duties. The reason for studying this issue is to
   find out why to support individual and society rights? Is this support a
   citizenship right? The aim of this study is to review citizenship rights
   including socio-political rights, economic rights and social welfare,
   judicial and cultural rights as well as supporting principles of the
   individual and society. To do this study, articles, and various books
   were studied and fundamentals of supporting the individual and society
   were developed and extracted. This review showed that supporting
   individual and community are including citizenship rights, and has been
   emphasized in all laws and international conventions.},

   the underlying doctrine of crime prevention and its impact on the social
   capital of urban neighborhood spaces, all framed in a context of
   adaptation of security policies with the intention of improving trust
   with citizens and the communities. Community security is therefore
   addressed as a system of action in relation to the dynamics of social
   capital in these urban spaces. It seeks to question and demonstrate the
   logic of courses of action and crime prevention practices, on the
   condition that community security is a preventive criminal policy that
   is based on the need to create informal social control and strengthen a
   social capital through the accountability of individuals in security

Abstract = {This introduction to the Special Issue presents research on austerity in
   British Politics. The work we showcase employs broadly understood gender
   analysis from different theoretical and disciplinary perspectives to
   broaden and deepen our understanding of austerity in the United Kingdom.
   In doing so, it brings to the forefront the meaning of austerity that
   cannot be deduced from national statistics and mainstream economic
   accounts: the costs of austerity for British households in their
   everyday and intergenerational social reproduction. Building upon
   innovative theoretical work and current empirical research, the
   contributors interrogate the conflicted rationalities of austerity as a
   moral and disciplinary form of governance that, ultimately, imposes
   suffering and inequality especially on the poor.},

Abstract = {The changing trust that Chinese students who study in Taiwan exhibit
   toward the Chinese government is a critical, but rarely explored topic,
   which is crucial for maintaining the sovereignty of Taiwan. I conducted
   a panel study and adopted a political socialization approach, proposing
   and verifying five hypotheses based on the theories of cognitive
   dissonance, assimilation, social contact, and social identity. The
   results indicate that compared with the average score for political
   trust that Chinese students exhibit at the time of arrival in Taiwan,
   the scores obtained four months later significantly declined by 0.09.
   Specifically, 50\% of students exhibited a decreased level of political
   trust, whereas 33\% exhibited an increased level of trust. The
   regression model developed in this study explains 23.6\% of the variance
   in the changes in the political trust of Chinese students studying in
   Taiwan. In addition, five hypotheses were empirically supported.},

   status and the development trend of the research paper output of NWPU
   (Northwestern Polytechnical University) based on the Incites database
   from 1981 to 2014. The result shows that the research publications have
   increased notablely. Whereas, there still has some problems need to be
   solved, such as low quality and non-widely distributed subject areas.
   This paper hereby proposes some advice that NWPU should, starting with
   perfecting the research evaluation mechanism, improve the
   internationalization level and international influence while encourage
   the coordinated development of new-rising subjects and interdisciplines.},

Abstract = {Stories of Africans displaced by war taking high risks to get to an
   often inhospitable Western Europe are frequently in the news. But
   sub-Saharan Africa is the region which hosts the largest population of
   refugees in the world. Refugees who flee to sub-Saharan African
   countries are also frequently subjected to xenophobic exclusion and
   violence by people who sometimes claim to be defending rights and
   privileges associated with national belonging. My aims are to point out
   new avenues for novel insights into the interrelations between
   xenophobia, disruption and nation by giving attractive detail and depth
   to the discussion using Director Akin Omotoso's Man on Ground (2011);
   putting forward arguments against xenophobic stereotypes and violence;
   pointing out some pitfalls of nation-building; and by finding and
   imagining human ground amidst disruptive nationhood. What is offered is
   a new synthesis of philosophical insights that defies distinctions
   between African and Western philosophy. Going beyond nativism and
   xenophobia, this synthesis speaks of the need and possibility to craft
   common human ground that enables people to become the most they can be.},

Abstract = {Existing research on congressional parties tends to focus almost
   exclusively on the majority party. I argue that the inattention to the
   House minority party hampers our understanding of the construction of
   the roll-call record and, consequently, our understanding of the sources
   of polarization in congressional voting. Employing an original data set
   of House members' requests for recorded votes between 1995 and 2010, I
   demonstrate that votes demanded by the minority party are
   disproportionately divisive and partisan and make Congress appear
   considerably more polarized based on commonly used measures. Moreover,
   minority-requested votes make vulnerable members of the majority appear
   more partisan and ideologically extreme.},

Abstract = {This paper will explore matters of alienation in personal mobility. It
   begins by outlining the present car system that dominates and has led to
   transport becoming an increasingly large issue in terms of
   sustainability. The car system will then be located within the process
   of reification, an approach to alienation that identifies the car as a
   capitalist commodity pushed onto ordinary people. The paper will go on
   to explore the legacy that these developments have had on the 21st
   century landscape with cities made for cars and a countryside rendered
   car dependent. Possible alternatives to overcome the current car system
   will be identified, paying specific regard to schemes in Finland and
   Wales. The paper suggests that mobility should be construed as a common
   right and that there is a need to see past the current car system.},

Abstract = {The concept of good governance is analyzed with particular emphasis on
   reasons that contributed to its development, main characteristics and
   possible impact on reform approaches which aim at achieving quality of
   contemporary governance. Different conceptions and developmental
   characteristics of governance are firstly examined, concluding with
   contemporary conceptualization that tends to widely engage citizens and
   civil society in the decision-making process, and at the same time
   accomplish greater effectiveness of public services as a precondition to
   economic and social development. According to findings presented in this
   article, this modern approach to the study of governance is in close
   connection with the effects of managerial reforms and the globalization
   process. Good governance principles introduced in the European
   Commission's document ``European Governance - A White Paper{''} are
   especially focused on. The research's starting assumption was that those
   principles derive from the so-called Copenhagen criteria, or political,
   economic and institutional conditions for membership in the European
   Union. The article identifies three main characteristics of different
   approaches to the concept of good governance: strengthening of
   administrative capacities, determination of principles which should
   contribute to the quality of contemporary governance assessment, and
   wider engagement of and consultation with the civil society.},

Title = {Maximizing the Reliability of Cross-National Measures of Presidential

Abstract = {This article aims to maximize the reliability of presidential power
   scores for a larger number of countries and time periods than currently
   exists for any single measure, and in a way that is replicable and easy
   to update. It begins by identifying all of the studies that have
   estimated the effect of a presidential power variable, clarifying what
   scholars have attempted to capture when they have operationalized the
   concept of presidential power. It then identifies all the measures of
   presidential power that have been proposed over the years, noting the
   problems associated with each. To generate the new set of presidential
   power scores, the study draws upon the comparative and local knowledge
   embedded in existing measures of presidential power. Employing principal
   component analysis, together with the expectation maximization algorithm
   and maximum likelihood estimation, a set of presidential power scores is
   generated for a larger set of countries and country time periods than
   currently exists, reporting 95 per cent confidence intervals and
   standard errors for the scores. Finally, the implications of the new set
   of scores for future studies of presidential power is discussed.},

Abstract = {Democratization originally inspired hope that new regimes would
   privilege human rights. However, progressive reforms to the criminal
   code have been insufficient to stem dramatic increases in incarceration
   rates, and developing democracies have made little headway reforming
   their ineffective police forces. How can we explain the stability and
   enforcement of punitive criminal justice policies and the erosion of
   police reforms? We offer a novel theoretical explanation of these
   contrasting patterns through a comparison of these two policy areas in
   Buenos Aires, Argentina. Incentives to avoid blame for salient crimes
   discourage politicians from repealing punitive criminal justice policies
   and incentivize judges to enforce them. Responsibility for failed police
   reforms, however, is harder to assign, giving the police and their
   allies opportunities to undermine them.},

Abstract = {In Canada, the Standing Committee on the Status of Women (SCSW) was
   established in the House of Commons in 2004 to report on relevant issues
   on the status of women. Adopting a feminist-institutional perspective,
   this article explores three dimensions of the work of the SCS Wover the
   period 2004-2015: analysis and research, executive scrutiny and the
   participation of women's groups. The findings suggest that while the
   Committee contributed a gender presence and feminist voice, its
   inability to compel the government to act on recommendations rendered it
   a policy advocate rather than a catalyst for institutional innovation
   and gender mainstreaming.},

Abstract = {Most Americans support liberal policies on the social welfare agenda,
   the dominant policy cleavage in American politics. Yet a striking
   feature of the US party system is its tendency to equilibrium. How,
   then, does the Republican Party minimize defection on the social welfare
   agenda? The results of this study illustrate a deep ideological
   asymmetry between the parties. Republican identifiers are ideologically
   aware and oriented to a degree that far exceeds their Democratic
   counterparts. Our investigation, which utilizes cross-sectional,
   longitudinal and experimental data, demonstrates the role of ideological
   awareness and involvement in the Republicans' ability to maintain the
   backing of their supporters even on issues on which the position of the
   Democratic Party is widely popular. It also exposes two mechanisms,
   party branding and the use of the status quo as a focal point, that
   Democrats use to retain or rally support for issues on the social
   welfare agenda on which the Republican Party's position is widely
   popular.},

Abstract = {In this paper we address the relationship between labor unrest and
   economic performance of the telecommunications sector during the
   post-convertibility period in Argentina. Thus we see that in this
   sector, the conflict has two distinct sub-periods, both in quantitative
   and qualitative terms. In the first, 2006-2010, the conflict is less
   intense and mainly driven by wage causes, while between 2010 and 2015,
   the conflict intensifies, the protests radicalized and their causes are
   changed, gaining prominence disputes by working conditions, particularly
   conflicts outsourcing.},

   Party Insurance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Pages = {109-118},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Body Damage Compensation Fund subject to Article ten of Law for
   Responsibility of Owners of Motor Vehicles is relatively a new
   legislative installation in Iran; it has been effective since 1968 in
   relation to victims under Article ten of the Law. Up to 2008, the Fund
   had not a significant role in due to lack of sufficient resources the
   subjects' compensation. With the replacement of Amendment to Law on
   Third Party Insurance in 2008, the legislators have increased the amount
   of commitments in addition to paying a particular attention to Fund's
   sources of income under Article 4 of this law. It resulted in gradual
   increase in the effective role of the Fund among other installations
   such as Public Treasury Fund. Despite the passage of about 40 years from
   the installations of this fund in Iran, the legal community,
   particularly judges and lawyers and legal experts are still unfamiliar
   with nature, role, and tasks of the Fund. The legal nature of the fund
   has not been discussed yet and its position has not been compared to
   other resources. Due to poor structure, insufficient financial
   resources, limited obligations, and lack of covering all damaged
   persons, the compensation fund had not been effectiveness until 2008.
   Its explanation is not only useful for juridical system and important
   for issuance of sentences but also it is helpful in the recognition of
   the obligations. In addition to taking into account the definition of
   the fund, this article ties to compare the Iranian version to one of the
   most developed systems in the world, New Zealand. It will show that the
   fund is responsible for the damages and it is regarded as a
   complementary means for compensating the damages having been imposed on
   innocent victims while its place is clear among other institutions.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Scholars have spent a great deal of effort examining the effects of
   negative advertising on citizens' perceptions of candidates. Much of
   this work has used experimental designs and has produced mixed findings
   supporting one of two competing theories. First, negative ads may harm
   candidates who sponsor them because citizens tend to dislike negativity.
   Second, negativity may drive down citizens' support for the targeted
   candidate because the attacks give people reasons to reject the target.
   We argue that the mixed findings produced by prior research may be
   driven by a disregard for campaign dynamics. We present a critical test
   of these two theories using data drawn from 80 statewide elections-37
   gubernatorial and 43 U.S. Senate contests-from three election years and
   public opinion polling collected during the last 12 weeks of each
   campaign. We find that a candidate's support declines as her advertising
   strategy includes a higher proportion of negative ads relative to her
   opponent and that this process unfolds slowly over the course of the
   campaign.},

Abstract = {In this study we provide new evidence on the much-discussed effect of
   education on political participation by utilizing the quasi-experiment
   of twinning. By looking at the relationship between education and
   participation within monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs we are able to
   circumvent traditional sources of confounding of the relationship rooted
   in genes and early life family environment because MZ twins share both.
   The results of within-twin pair analyses based on surveys from the
   United States, Denmark and Sweden show that while the relationship
   between education and political participation is highly confounded by
   genes and/or familial environment in all three countries, a positive
   impact remains of years of education in the US and of high school
   completion in Denmark. No effect is found in Sweden. Robustness checks
   suggest that the observed effect is not confounded by within-twin pair
   differences in prenatal environment nor differential treatment during
   childhood, and, if anything, that it most likely constitutes a lower
   bound estimate.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this special issue is to examine the international
   dimension of the Ukraine crisis. The focus is on Moscow's actions
   towards Ukraine, and what they imply for European security and
   Russia-Western relations more generally. This introductory article takes
   stock of the current debate. Three major positions are identified, here
   labelled revisionist Russia' (Perspective I), victim Russia'
   (Perspective II), and troublemaker Russia' (Perspective III). The first
   sees Russia as an aggressive, neo-imperialist power that wants to
   overturn Europe's post-Cold War order. The second holds that Russia is a
   status-quo power that defends its geopolitical interests and honour
   against Western encroachments. The third views Russia as a
   mischief-maker, whose ruling elite purposefully creates external
   conflicts, such as the one in Ukraine, to divert attention from internal
   problems. This article presents the arguments of each perspective.
   Moreover, it discusses gaps and limitations of the existing positions
   along with some policy tradeoffs. Finally, it provides an overview of
   the entire special issue and lays out how the individual contributions
   that follow address the identified shortcomings.},

Abstract = {Employing the notion of ontological security', this study situates the
   West' within the contemporary Russian identity debate. It argues that
   opposition to an allegedly hostile West has cemented a collective
   Russian understanding of Russianness' which emphasises so-called
   traditional values and norms, all of which are said to be under pressure
   from the West. This process, so the article, is fuelled partly by
   endogenous preferences found within the Russian electorate, partly by
   political engineering and manipulation. The outcome is a more
   conflictual relationship between Russia and the West but also greater
   ontological security on part of the Russian population.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Scholars overlook that Locke has two distinct concepts of equality
   entrenched in his political theory. By recovering the centrality of
   natural law in Locke, these two concepts of equality can be easily
   identified. The first I call natural equality, which includes every
   human being regardless of rational capacity, each possessing rights to
   life, liberty, and property. The second is law-abiding equality, which
   includes the subset of people who adequately recognize the dictates of
   natural law. This distinction is significant because it helps overcome
   the conflict in liberalism between universal dignity and the necessarily
   exclusionary character of citizenship.},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact and significance of the
   Crimea-Ukraine-Russia and the eurozone crises on relations among and
   between the EU's three biggest member states - Britain, France and
   Germany - as well as their individual influence and roles within the EU.
   The Ukraine and eurozone crises have revealed and intensified three
   longer-term developments in contemporary European politics: Germany's
   rise as the EU's most powerful member state and its role as Europe's
   indispensable policy broker; the resilience and centrality of
   Franco-German bilateralism, despite the growing power imbalance
   separating the two; and Britain's diminished and diminishing role in EU
   affairs. To put the current period of turmoil in perspective, this
   article also aims to contribute to a better understanding of the
   operating logic of crisis, continuity and change in the relations of the
   EU's big three member states.},

Title = {Ideological justifications for restrictive immigration policies: An
   analysis of parliamentary discourses on immigration in France and Canada
   (2006-2013)},
Journal = {FRENCH POLITICS},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {In this paper, I analyze the parliamentary discourses on immigration in
   France and Canada from January 2006 to December 2013 in order to answer
   the question: What arguments are put forward in parliamentary arenas in
   order to justify more restrictive immigration policies? Despite their
   different models of integration and citizenship, France and Canada are
   facing very similar discussions, involving the same arguments and the
   same theoretical reflections. Critical discourse analysis shows that
   immigration is an extremely divisive issue in the political landscape:
   in both countries, right-wing political parties try to restrict in the
   name of economic imperatives, while left-wing political parties seek to
   establish more liberal policies. This finding goes against some studies,
   which argue that right-wing political parties, influenced by the
   neoliberal ideology, call for more open borders to immigration. Within
   the debates, references to national histories, models of integration,
   and civic values are not especially prominent, especially when compared
   with the omnipresent discourses of economics. The justifications for
   more restrictive immigration policies often reveal the dominant position
   of a global ideology prioritizing values of competitiveness and
   cost-effectiveness in an era of post-Fordist capitalism. The treatment
   of refugees, asylum seekers, and illegal immigrants is a paradigmatic
   example of the trends I have identified. These kinds of immigrants are
   often at the heart of justifications for implementing restrictive
   measures. Our empirical material shows that Roma people are particularly
   targeted by these restrictions in both countries.},

Abstract = {During the democratic awakening in Iceland during and after the
   financial crisis of 2008 it was evident that different groups based
   their demands for more or deeper democracy on different conceptions of
   democracy. Yet their demands had a common core: more democracy meant
   greater public influence on policy- and decision-making. Thus public
   discussion insisted on a conception of democracy according to which
   public consultation is a necessary part of democratic governance. This
   paper discusses different kinds of consultation depending on the
   particular demands in each case with particular emphasis on epistemic
   democracy. I argue that even though it can hardly be said that epistemic
   democracy is based on much empirical evidence yet, its approach is the
   most promising way to think about future democratic},

Abstract = {The City of Reykjavik took the lead in promoting equality and human
   rights in Iceland when the City Council adopted the first human rights
   policy in 2006. The policy is based on international human rights law
   and principles of equality and non-discrimination. A questionnaire for
   the city's managers and administrators, enquiring about their experience
   of the human rights policy, prejudice and the status of marginalized
   groups, demonstrated various challenges in implementing and promoting
   the policy. This is due, not the least, to the fact that the national
   legislation on ban on discrimination is limited to gender equality, thus
   halting further development in the field of human rights. The human
   rights policy is fairly well known by the city's managers and
   administrators. They apply the policy in their different and demanding
   jobs especially in human resource management but to a limited extent in
   finance management. The policy has thus proven to be a valuable
   instrument to bring about changes. The City of Reykjavik aims to achieve
   equality for all and to work against multiple discrimination. However,
   some of the marginalized groups seem more vulnerable to discrimination
   and marginalization than other groups, notably immigrants, people with
   disabilities and people with long-term health issues.},

Abstract = {The effects of electoral rules on party systems have been well known
   since Duverger first proposed his famous law. Often considered second
   order' in terms of issues and voting behaviour, many European Parliament
   elections are held under different electoral rules to national
   elections. This article examines the consequences of these differences
   and hypothesizes that where a more permissive electoral system is used
   for European Parliament elections, the size of the party system at
   European Parliament elections will grow towards what we would expect
   from the European Parliament electoral rules in isolation, and that this
   will lead to a subsequent growth in the size of the national party
   system. Using multi-level mixed-effect growth curve modelling support is
   found for both these hypotheses.},

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {This article explores the politics and ethics of scale in reading
   women's movements in the Global South-how they have always been
   simultaneousy regional, national and transnational in scale (materially
   if not imaginatively) and read through the twin lens of the global and
   the local. The first part of the essay underscores the constitutive
   internationalism in the history of feminism. From the `second wave' of
   the women's liberation movement, attempts at recognizing the
   internationalism in `global feminism' have poorly served feminists in
   the `third world'. In more recent times, transnationalization has become
   the dominant signifier of women's movements with renewed attempts at
   capturing the shifting scales of feminist politics in `transnational
   feminism'. Recent processes of transnationalization and NGOization
   bespeak an ontology of relatedness and a scalar epistemology as has been
   mobilized in recent writings in postcolonial sociology. The second part
   of the essay uses the mass protests around the rape and murder of a
   young woman in Delhi in 2012 as a way of thinking through the changing
   scales and sites of contemporary feminist protest in the Global South. I
   use the spatial concept of the assemblage to emphasize the multi-scalar
   dimensions of this protest especially through the determining influence
   of the media. Such a `protest assemblage' produced endless possibilities
   of mobilization in the name of women but not always in clearly
   recognizable `feminist' ways.},

Abstract = {Crime prevention is crucial to social life which necessitates the need
   for conducting criminology studies to identify the causes of the crime.
   In this paper, we focus on money laundering crime. First we discuss
   about money laundering crime in Iran's penal system, and after
   presenting its criminological characteristics (transnational, organized
   and victimless), we review Iran's legal system and the international
   conventions about this crime. Then, since major situational prevention
   measures against money laundering are related to the banks and financial
   institutions, we proposed some measures for financial institutions such
   as staff training, adjusting banking secrecy laws, monitoring money
   transfer, reporting large cash transactions, and reporting suspicious
   transactions. Results showed that Iran's anti money laundering laws are
   in accordance with Merida convention, for example, in terms of
   identification, record-keeping and the reporting, but do not obligate
   the identification of customer when there is criminal evidence.},

Abstract = {The Union has for over a century been one of the cornerstones of
   Conservative politics, but with the changes to the old union state in
   the last 20years, its value has been increasingly questioned. While the
   Conservative Party remains committed to maintaining the Union, a new
   English Toryism is emerging, which has a strong continuity with an older
   English Toryism which was partially buried by the ascendancy of
   Unionism. English Tories have always considered the Union to be
   desirable, but it comes second in their thinking to the need to protect
   the sovereignty of the British state, the core of which is England and
   its traditional institutions. What is new about the contemporary
   Conservative Party is that there is within it the revival of an English
   Toryism which is happy to discard the older clothes of Empire and Union
   once so important to Conservative identity and which is unabashedly
   English in its focus. For an increasing number of contemporary
   Conservatives, there no longer seems to be any passion about defending
   the Union or even of continuing to think about the United Kingdom in
   Unionist terms.},

Abstract = {There is a growing interest in wildlife crime and security issues, which
   is inspired by the popular but problematic poacher-as-terrorist
   narrative. As poaching has been integral to the creation of enclosures,
   the question of how it becomes a national and global security issue is
   pertinent to analyses of the poaching-security linkages. I engage this
   question by tracing changing meanings of the poacher and their relations
   to security during the Cold War and in post-apartheid South(ern) Africa.
   These historical moments reveal, first, the relevance of the regional
   context to discussions on the intersection between poaching and security
   in South(ern) Africa. Second, they shed light on the evolution of
   poaching as a security code. Third, they show that the discursive
   poaching-security link takes place at various levels across time. I
   argue that this link does not cohere in South(ern) Africa in part
   because of shifts in the meanings of the poacher.},

Abstract = {We examine data from the World Values Survey regarding the existence of
   two consistent orientations in mass values, traditional versus
   secular/rational and survival versus self-expression. We also evaluate
   the empirical validity of Welzel's revised value orientations: secular
   and emancipative. Over the years, a large body of work has presumed the
   stability and comparability of these value orientations across time and
   space. Our findings uncover little evidence of the existence of
   traditional-secular/rational or survival-self-expression values.
   Welzel's two dimensions of value orientationssecular and
   emancipativeseem more reflective of latent value orientations in mass
   publics but are still imperfectly capturing these orientations. More
   importantly, these value orientations do not seem very comparable except
   among a small number of advanced post-industrial democracies. We call
   attention to the use of value measurements to explain important
   macro-level phenomena.},

Abstract = {Journalistic and academic accounts of Congress suggest that important
   committee positions allow members to procure more federal funds for
   their constituents, but existing evidence on this topic is limited in
   scope and has failed to distinguish the effects of committee membership
   from selection onto committees. We bring together decades of data on
   federal outlays and congressional committee and subcommittee assignments
   to provide a comprehensive analysis of committee positions and
   distributive politics across all policy domains. Using a within-member
   research design, we find that seats on key committees produce little
   additional spending. The chairs of the Appropriations subcommittees-the
   so called ``cardinals{''} of Congress-are an exception to the rule.
   These leadership positions do generate more funding for constituents,
   but only from programs under the jurisdiction of their subcommittee. Our
   results paint a new picture of distributive politics and call for a
   reexamination of its canonical theories.},

Abstract = {The massive use of electronic communications by citizens, along with
   many other changes, has facilitated both interpersonal communication and
   participation in the public debate. As a result, diversity has
   undoubtedly been enriched, along with access to information and thus the
   possibility of being an active member of the political community. Other
   consequences of this transformation, however, present some risks and
   potential downsides. The extension of the domain of communicative public
   space has also limited citizens' privacy, reducing those areas in which,
   historically, the expression of all kinds of ideas and opinions was
   possible. Social networks amplify this effect and, therefore, it is
   necessary to understand how the classic limits to expression are applied
   in this new environment, which blurs the public and private spheres of
   communication. This is the main objective of this paper, which also
   studies conflicts related to privacy issues and the circulation of
   statements intended to incite violence, discrimination or hatred that
   have appeared in recent years. The paper thus reflects on the struggles
   of Law to balance the complex relationship between the individual right
   to freedom of speech and the social expression of limits to this right.},

Abstract = {This article develops a theory of presidential unilateralism in which
   both ideological divergence with Congress and legislative capacity
   influence the president's use of executive orders. We argue that when
   Congress is less capable of constraining the executive, the president
   will issue more executive orders during periods of divided government.
   Conversely, in periods of high legislative capacity, the president is
   less likely to issue executive orders when faced with an opposed
   Congress. Based on an examination of institutional changes, we identify
   years prior to the mid-1940s as characterized by low congressional
   capacity and the subsequent period as characterized by high capacity.
   Testing the theory between 1905 and 2013, we find strong support for
   these predictions and demonstrate that legislative capacity conditions
   the role of ideological disagreement in shaping presidential action.
   Overall, this article deepens our current understanding of the dynamics
   of separation-of-powers politics and the limits of executive power.},

Abstract = {This paper attempts to examine the provisions of the Convention on
   Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business
   Contracts, Europe Union Convention on Combating Corruption and also the
   analysis of the actions of the Council of Europe in implementation of
   the convention on criminal law, Additional Protocol to the Criminal Law
   Convention on Corruption and the Convention relating to anti-corruption
   civil law, in order to describes different ways to combat corruption and
   provide a suitable solution to combat corruption in the country.
   Reviewing the standards and regulations in EU in the executive and
   legislative sector and inspection system and the Member States known as
   GRECO, it is concluded that the EU has been trying to implement
   effective measures by increasing the thematic range and personal
   inclusion of provisions to combat corruption and strengthen the
   regulatory system of GRECO; and the success of the EU in this field is
   largely due to these actions so that it is known as the leader in the
   fight against corruption according to reports and statistics compiled by
   Transparency International Organization.
   The Europe Union has achieved such success considering appropriate
   social fields among member states and national and international
   regulatory systems. Accordingly, generalization of EU pattern to other
   regional or global institutions involved in the fight against corruption
   seems somewhat unlikely, but the experience of EU in this area can be
   partially passed on to others. Meanwhile, the regulatory and coping
   patterns of the EU and its member states can also be used for the
   Islamic Republic of Iran.},

Abstract = {Given that the geography of modern times was one of the most important
   factors affecting the relations between Iran and Iraq, in this article
   we have tried to examine the influence of Iraq's new political geography
   variable factors on the national security of the Islamic Republic of
   Iran. For this purpose, regardless of the security implications of
   Iraq's geopolitical constant factors, with placing three variable
   factors in the political geography means population, natural resources
   and socio-political institutions in the form of five security variables
   for Lee Norji. Martin, meaning the political legitimacy, civil rights
   and ethnic and minorities, military strength, the strength of economic
   management and natural resources, fifteen areas will be formed (in the
   annexes, these fifteen areas are in the table). The question that arises
   here is that what is the impact of Iraq's new political geography on the
   national security of Iran? The hypothesis that we are looking to review
   it is that changes in some areas of geopolitical of Iraq, after the
   United States invaded Iraq, made threats to the national security of
   Iran. The main objective of this paper is to study Iranian security
   changes in the first ten areas and to present solutions. Since the Iraq
   has not achieved stability yet, next five areas need further research
   and in this article do not occur.},

Abstract = {Recent global developments, including the feminization of parliaments
   and the rise of gender quotas, have transformed the ways in which
   parties and legislatures operate. This introduction to the special issue
   `Candidate Selection: Parties and Legislatures in a New Era' puts these
   recent developments in context, making the case for revisiting the
   `secret garden' of candidate selection in light of this `new era' in
   politics. It sets out a critical dialogue between party politics and
   gender politics scholarship and points to the need for more research on
   how political parties facilitate or block women's access to political
   office. Building on the burgeoning research on gender and political
   recruitment, it outlines how a gendered and institutional approach
   allows us to retheorize candidate selection processes and opens up new
   avenues for empirically examining the pathways prior to election. The
   article then introduces the papers in this special issue and concludes
   by evaluating the main implications of gendering analyses of candidate
   selection and party politics more broadly.},

Abstract = {To better understand what issues today's technologies raise in relation
   to political liberty, understood as self-determination, attention should
   shift from the level of contents of the Internet to its more basic
   architecture and governance (critical internet resources {[}CIR],
   protocols, governance ecology, etc.). Mainstream political science has
   for a long time eschewed the field of Internet governance. There is
   nonetheless an interesting debate on how we should handle this new world
   we have in common that is constituted by the infosphere. The paper shows
   why the debate on the control of the Internet is often misleading: too
   much attention on traditional institutional actors has obscured the fact
   that the << seats of power >> are now elsewhere. In order to move within
   the private ordering that currently characterizes Internet governance,
   in a way that is respectful of fundamental rights, we need to rethink
   the relationships between social powers.},

Abstract = {Law is, including its logic and its scientific standards, a work of
   culture, and, as so, structured by it and only explainable, knowable and
   coherent if comprehended starting from it. Therefore, only the
   construction of a dialectics of the movement of culture allows a
   non-reductionist philosophy of Law. This preoccupation is at the
   grounding of Brazilian juridical culturalism, which had actualized in
   Brazil its juridical thinking, through a reconciliation of the
   Kantian-Hegelian matrix with its philosophy of law. Among its authors,
   Djacir Menezes stands out as his though are fundamentally centered in
   the overcoming of Kantian metaphysics, by means of a non-mystifying
   interpretation of the Hegelian philosophy. Consequently, it is possible
   to identify Law as a complex cultural phenomenon, impossible of being
   treated only by operative sciences (of knowledge), as it demands a
   treatment, insofar a work of human culture constituting an specific
   dominion of reality, in the plane of a knowing that cannot forsake of
   being speculative also, that is, philosophical.},

Abstract = {Some researchers indicated that the presence of more women in the public
   sector could be a possible solution to the problem of corruption.
   Moreover, the most recent works of Organizations and International NGOs
   argue that the effects of corruption are different among men and women,
   the latter being those who suffer the worst consequences. Therefore, the
   aim of this paper is to explore how the approach to this topic has been
   made by contrasting it with the Mexican case in order to determine, if
   indeed, women in Mexico perceive and suffer differently the effects of
   this crime. The conclusion was that if mexican women do not perceive
   corruption in a different way, they are exposed to suffering, as well
   also, to the high level of impunity that is present in the Mexican
   territory.},
