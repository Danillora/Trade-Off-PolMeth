Abstract = {This article examines China's respective roles as a suspect, victim, and
   stakeholder in countering international economic cyber espionage (ECE)
   activities. Refuting the widespread evidence and cases that have
   misguided those with interests or concerns in cyber security issues, the
   author underscores the cognitive defects and logical fallacies in the
   prevailing suspicion and accusations against China. Not only is China
   among the victims of ECE activities, it will face even more ECE threats
   in the future. With growing cyber capacity, however, China has been
   determined to develop into a strong cyber power while playing a more
   active role as a key stakeholder in containing ECE activities. To
   maintain a secure and favorable cyberspace, the international community
   must join hands in working out a common code of conduct in cyberspace,
   acknowledging China's strenuous efforts and indispensable role in
   international cyberspace governance. The United States, in particular,
   needs to adopt a legal approach in seeking to settle ECE disputes with
   China while making more commitments to their bilateral cooperation
   against economic cybercrime.},

Abstract = {To understand why some former adversaries have achieved deeper
   reconciliation than others, this article conducts an empirical study on
   five cases of reconciliation and peace building in the post-World War II
   era: the Franco-German relations, the Polish-German relations, the
   Polish-Soviet (Russian) relations, the South Korean-Japanese relations,
   and the Sino-Japanese relations. We distinguish between reconciliation
   and peace building and propose a series of factors including postwar
   political arrangements, regime change for perpetrator, alliance, regime
   type, and regional institutions to explain the variations among the
   cases in the degree of reconciliation and the degree of peace. It is
   argued that these factors have impacts on the degree of reconciliation,
   and that together with the latter, they also affect the degree of peace.
   It is also argued that there have been structural and historical reasons
   for the underdevelopment of reconciliation in Northeast Asia.},

Abstract = {How the recent creation, re-invention or reinforcement of regional
   levels of political decision making across Europe compounds political
   representation is one of the key issues of contemporary democratic
   government. Despite growing scholarly interest, the critical question as
   to whether the regional institutional setting has brought about distinct
   representational roles among sub-state legislators has yet to be
   addressed. To advance research in this field, this study bridges the
   literature on multilevel politics and legislative studies that to date
   have developed in isolation. Using innovative survey data from 14
   statewide and 56 regional legislatures across Europe, it provides the
   first comprehensive test of how the state structure affects a
   legislator's views on representation. The results highlight that,
   relative to legislators in unitary states and national legislators in
   multilevel states, legislators at the regional level are more
   constituency-oriented. Moreover, this heightened responsiveness to
   constituents at the regional level is not offset by weaker collective
   representation operating through political parties. Beyond these
   findings' immediate relevance to scholars of federalism/regionalisation
   and parliaments, they also speak to the wider normative debate about the
   quality of political representation and public policy.},

Abstract = {The shock waves of the UK's EU referendum outcome reverberate in a
   Divided Kingdom, with huge implications for Scotland and Northern
   Ireland, and across Europe, where populists of all political shades take
   succour from the UK electorate's decision (51.9\% for Leave, 48.1\%
   Remain) to end the country's 43-year membership of the European project.
   The campaign was dominated by hyperbole and outright lies, with racist
   and xenophobic undertones, the result quite apparently unexpected, the
   aftermath chaotic, and it remains to be seen what the long-term impact
   on the UK-EU relationship, on the UK constitution, on `Scotland's place
   in Europe', and on the future of the European Union will be.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the work of Nietzsche with a twofold aim: first, to
   determine to what extent he could be deemed a ``psychologist{''};
   second, to rediscover Freud's readings of his texts. To this end, we
   first assess whether canonical interpretations of Nietzsche have
   acknowledged the ``psychological{''} dimensions of his work. Then,
   through a hermeneutical exegetical method, we explore how Nietzsche
   sought self-understanding from a psychological stance, and how he framed
   his objects of reflection as psychological problems. Where necessary, we
   provide explicit ties to psychoanalytical notions. Finally, we summarize
   our findings to show which aspects of psychoanalysis are part of
   Nietzsche's legacy, and why he can be considered the first
   (proto)psychoanalyst.},

Abstract = {South Africa has often been lauded as an influential and pivotal actor
   in peace and security affairs on the evolving African peace and security
   architecture. The centrality of Africa in South Africa's foreign policy
   has driven its exercise of peace diplomacy in a significant number of
   conflicts in Africa; where its mode of engagement has ranged from
   mediation to peacekeeping and post-conflict reconstruction and
   development assistance. Concomitant to its peace actor profile, South
   Africa's repertoire as an emerging development partner also forms a
   large part of its African agenda. The embedding of sustainable peace as
   a goal in the post-2015 development agenda and the enduring relevance of
   the security-development nexus continue to exert profound influence on
   the parameters and conduct of South Africa's foreign policy and its
   pointedly Afro-centric agenda. This article argues for greater
   integration and harmonisation between South Africa's peace diplomacy and
   its development partnership agenda through the formulation of a
   peacebuilding and stabilisation strategy.},

Abstract = {In this article I claim that Walter Benjamin's work is important for
   thinking our way toward revolutionary politics from a
   linguistic-cultural perspective. I do so by bringing Franz Borkenau's
   work on what he calls the `I-form' of speech into contact with
   Benjamin's figure of `the storeyteller.' I thus argue that Benjamin's
   figure of the storeyteller is important for thinking through Franz
   Borkenau's account of the emergence of the `I-form' of speech. Moreover,
   if we read Borkenau's linguistic account of the emergence of western
   individualism under the rubric of alienation, then via Benjamin we begin
   to see the outlines of a political return from the alienated political
   subject of Western modernity.},

Abstract = {The balance between majority rule and minority rights is a central issue
   in the design and operation of democratic institutions and remains a
   contested issue in debates of policy-making processes. Remarkably,
   public attitudes about this balance are not subjected to scholarly
   investigation. In this article, we report the findings of the first
   survey experiment in which the American public's attitudes about
   majority rule and minority rights in legislative bodies are explored. We
   find robust support for both majority rule and minority rights, discover
   that only a few Americans distinguish between the US House of
   Representatives and Senate in the application of these principles, and
   demonstrate that views of majority rule and minority rights can be moved
   once we introduce respondents to the partisan implications of procedural
   rules. Moreover, with conflicting theoretical expectations about the
   effect of political sophistication on attitudes about majority rule and
   minority rights, we find that higher levels of political sophistication
   are associated with stronger partisan effects on attitudes about the
   balance between majority rule and minority rights in Congress.},

Abstract = {New indices measuring the quality of democracy constitute a significant
   innovation in comparative political science. They might, however,
   provide a biased perspective because they largely focus on macro-level
   criteria. Thus, the question is whether the measurement of the quality
   of democracy can be improved by complementing the evaluations of these
   indices with assessments based on individual-level survey data. Using
   data from 20 established democracies in the European Social Survey 2012
   and the Democracy Barometer, we compare the understandings and
   evaluations of the quality of democracy underlying these two measurement
   approaches. We demonstrate that while the results coincide to a certain
   extent, individual-level data provide an important complementary
   perspective that adds to the validity of the measurement of the quality
   of democracy.},

Abstract = {What characterises social media radicals? And why some people become
   attracted to radicalisation? To explore answers to these questions, a
   number of tweets posted by a group of suspected radicals tweeting in
   Arabic were analysed using social network analysis and machine learning.
   The study revealed that these suspected radicals' networks showed
   significant interaction with others; but this interactivity is only
   significant quantitatively as the interaction is not reciprocated. With
   regards to why these suspected radicals became attracted to
   radicalisation, Topic Modelling revealed these suspected radicals'
   tweets underpinned a perceived injustice that they believed the Secret
   Police and the Government inflicted upon them. Overall, the study has
   shown that data science tools have the potential to inform our
   understanding of online radicalisation. It is hoped this exploratory
   study will be the basis for a future study in which the research
   questions will be answered using a larger sample.},

Abstract = {We explore the implications of sequential presidential primary elections
   for turnout in selecting the presidential party nominees. Drawing from a
   micro-level theory of participation in sequential elections, we develop
   a set of aggregate-level hypotheses that tease out different ways that
   candidate mobilization efforts as well as the legal and institutional
   structures within a sequential contest influence turnout in presidential
   nomination contests. Using data from all state primary elections from
   1972-2016, we find that electorates facing winnowed candidate pools, and
   those with contests after the effective endings to presidential contests
   have substantially reduced turnout that effectively disenfranchises
   voters in many states. Sequenced primary elections lead to lower overall
   turnout and less meaningful participation for many voters during
   presidential nominations contests.},

Abstract = {Regret is a basic affect associated with individual choice. While much
   research in organizational science and consumer behavior has assessed
   the precedents and consequents of regret, little attention has been paid
   to regret in political science. The present study assesses the
   relationship between one of the most democratically consequential forms
   of political behaviorvotingand feelings of regret. We examine the extent
   to which citizens regret how they voted after doing so and the factors
   that might lead one individual to be more regretful than another.
   Relying on surveys in five different countries after 11 regional and
   national elections, we find not only that political information leads to
   a decrease in post-election regret, but also that having voted
   correctly, or having voted in accordance with one's underlying
   preferences regardless of information, similarly mitigates regret. The
   effect of correct voting on regret is greater among the least informed.},

Volume = {46},

Abstract = {In response to growing economic and political interdependence at the
   international level, contemporary theories of justice have debated
   whether the demands of distributive justice extend beyond the
   nation-state. This article addresses the reverse question: whether and
   how the demands of justice arise below the state, at the level of civil
   society associations. This question becomes pressing in light of the
   increasing fragmentation of national governance, and the resulting
   institutional interdependence between political institutions and private
   associations. The article argues that the extent to which these
   associations are directly bound by egalitarian principles depends on a
   complex set of factors, including their structure and size, their role
   in the social provision of important goods, and their institutional
   relation with political institutions.},

Volume = {51},

Abstract = {A widespread strategy to enhance political control over permanent
   bureaucracy consists of the politicization of personnel policy through
   the appointment of ministerial advisers. This study sets out to
   investigate the appointment of ministerial advisers from an historical
   institutionalist perspective emphasizing the influence of institutional
   legacies on current empirical patterns. Drawing on this perspective, it
   identifies three patterns of institutional stability, radical, and
   gradual change in terms of ministerial advisers' policy competence and
   political loyalty, which guide the empirical analysis. Empirical
   patterns are illustrated with data collected in Italy, based on an
   analysis of a combination of career pathways and expert interviews. The
   Italian case is noteworthy since it experienced an abrupt party system
   breakdown in the early 1990s. Yet, the empirical analysis reveals that
   the massive re-alignment of the party system has not implied a pattern
   of radical change in Italy. The legacy of stable administrative
   structures has only left room for gradual change to occur on the
   dimensions of ministerial advisers' policy competence and political
   loyalty.},

Abstract = {The article intends to analyze the closely correlated concepts of
   trademark exhaustion and parallel imports. The growing importance of
   these concepts in the current world, especially in the European Union,
   makes it an interesting research topic, even though the concepts are
   complicated due to their nature and different actors involved. The
   authors use comparative approach, concentrating on two world leaders in
   the field, in order to discover what is the approach of the EU as well
   as the approach of the USA to the concepts of trademark exhaustion and
   parallel imports, what are the benefits and weaknesses of these
   approaches, and analyze why these markets have arrived at certain
   conclusions.},

Volume = {69},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article provides an analysis of the leadership selection methods
   adopted by Northern Ireland's five main parties. Drawing on data from
   interviews with party elites and internal party documents, it sheds
   light on an important element of intra-party organisation in the region
   and constitutes a rare case-study of leadership selection in a
   consociational democracy. By accounting for instances of organisational
   reform, this article also reveals the extent to which Northern Ireland's
   parties align with the wider comparative trend of leadership
   `democratisation'. In terms of `who' selects party leaders, the analysis
   finds a substantial degree of organisational heterogeneity and a
   reasonably high rate of democratisation. Northern Ireland's parties also
   prove rather exceptional in their universal adoption of short fixed
   terms for party leaders and, in the case of three of the parties, their
   preference for high candidacy thresholds.},

Abstract = {What are the effects of economic mobility and macroeconomic cycles on
   redistributive preferences? These questions have gained more prominence
   in recent years, yet our main theoretical frameworks often provide
   conflicting predictions and empirical evidence has been contradictory.
   We argue that this confusion is mostly due to the crucial distinction
   between absolute and relative income shifts, both of which are produced
   during economic cycles yet are rarely separated conceptually or
   empirically. After relative income shifts, differences are made salient,
   resulting in more self-interested behavior. Conversely, after absolute
   income shifts, similarities become more apparent, resulting in more
   group-driven behavior. We demonstrate this experimentally, using a novel
   redistribution game. The results indicate that expected shifts in
   absolute and relative income have mostly opposite effects on
   preferences, highlighting the importance of carefully conceptualizing
   and measuring the effects of income shifts. This has implications for
   how we think about economic perceptions and evaluations.},

Abstract = {This article considers the devolution deal signed by Cornwall and the
   Isles of Scilly in the summer of 2015. It asks if the deal constitutes a
   more sustainable approach to governance, concluding that while there are
   some factors that help to enhance sustainability, other areas urgently
   require more attention. These claims are made through an analysis of a
   model of sustainability which emphasises the importance of networks and
   feedback loops envisaging civil society as an adaptive organism. This
   helps to show that although power is significantly dispersed in some
   aspects of the Cornwall Deal', this latter does little to alter the
   highly centralised nature of governance across England, or provide
   spaces where local actors can feed back into central policy.},

Abstract = {In 2015, UN Security Council Resolution 2242 advocated deliberate
   outreach to women when devising counterterrorism projects. This is based
   on assumptions of the need to empower women, as well as their particular
   ability to exert benign influence over young people and stop
   radicalisation to violence. The approach has been particularly prevalent
   in Western Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) projects aimed at
   preventing homegrown Islamist radicalisation. On the basis of fieldwork
   with Muslim communities in five countries - Canada, the UK, Germany,
   France and The Netherlands - Emily Winterbotham and Elizabeth Pearson
   challenge the underlying assumptions of such an approach, and suggest
   aspects of women's CVE projects may exacerbate existing community
   tensions, and do not reflect the changing norms of Muslim communities in
   the West. Alternative modes of engagement could improve the efficacy of
   CVE and enable it to better appeal to those it is intended to help.},

   of the detente, since the origin of the most important Pan-European
   Conference of the contemporary time, analyzing some limitations that did
   not allow it implement its legacy in a most complete way in the early
   XXI century. While emphasizing the relevance of the principles of
   European security, established in the Helsinki Final Act, the article
   points to the difference between the exercise the diplomacy of detente
   in Europe, in the context of the Conference on Security and Cooperation
   in Europe, and the international politics in a post-Cold War Europe,
   characterized by multidimensional dynamic changes and by the competition
   among international institutions, while resulting in a weakening of the

Abstract = {This article discusses the ways in which eyewitness accounts about the
   Assyrian Genocide have been transmitted in writing and orally,
   reconstructed across generations, and how these accounts have been
   expressed in lamentations, poetry, and songs in the diaspora, after
   large numbers of Assyrians settled in Western states beginning in the
   1960s. The study of poetry and songs is not only important for reasons
   of literary analysis, but more so because of the relatively few written
   primary sources about the Assyrian Genocide. The production of poetry
   and songs has partly been instrumental in avoiding censorship and
   renewed persecution, but in recent years has additional value as a
   medium to call for future action in preventing violence and transmiting
   memories of the past. The article also highlights culturally specific
   forms of coping with trauma and transmitting memory. It is based on the
   analysis of Sayfo lamentations and poetry produced in the homeland, 21
   Sayfo songs and poems produced in the Western diaspora, and some recent
   interviews with the writers of these songs.},

Abstract = {Americans expect the president to lead Congress, but Congress's partisan
   divide typically widens on presidential priorities. More often,
   presidents are reduced to leading their copartisans rather than Congress
   as a whole, but why? In this paper, I argue that competition for White
   House control creates incentives for parties to disagree on presidents'
   policy agendas, regardless of the contents of those agendas. I use an
   original data set of members' roll-call vote decisions on presidents'
   agendas between 1971 and 2010 to show that partisan polarization is
   larger on presidents' priorities and largest on their top priorities,
   above and beyond what we would expect from members' ideologies and
   standard party effects. These findings persist over time and under a
   wide range of alternative model specifications, bringing us closer to
   understanding the partisan conflict so prevalent in today's politics.},

Abstract = {How is electoral support for incumbent candidates shaped by natural
   disasters? Do voters in districts newly recovering from a national
   disaster punish or reward incumbents for their response to the disaster
   when compared to their counterparts in unaffected districts? The City of
   Calgary is used here as a case study. On 20 June 2013, the Bow and Elbow
   rivers flooded in the Calgary, devastating 26 neighborhoods and
   displacing approximately 75,000 people, or 7 per cent of the city's
   population. Four months later, a municipal election was held. When
   analyzed as a natural experiment, results suggest that support for the
   incumbent mayor increased city-wide between the 2010 and the 2013
   elections, but at a lower rate in areas that experienced residential
   flooding. However, the flood did not produce equivalent treatment and
   control groups, as flooded areas differ systematically from areas that
   were not flooded in ways key to the election outcome. When analyzed more
   conservatively, results show that the flood had no effect on incumbent
   support or voter turnout. Thus, this disaster introduces a note of
   caution into the literature examining the effects of natural disasters
   on electoral behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Do superdelegates heed public opinion in deciding whom to support in
   nomination contests or do they follow their own conscience? We examine
   both individual and environmental factors peculiar to superdelegate
   decision making to ascertain whether and how they integrate populist
   considerations into their nomination choices. Via a survey of
   superdelegates in the 2008 presidential nomination contest, we analyze
   both the timing of a superdelegate's decision as well as any change in
   their candidate preference. Superdelegates who prioritize constituent
   concerns endorse earlier but are no more or less likely to switch their
   candidate preference during the campaign.},

Title = {Measuring corruption: whose perceptions should we rely on? Evidence from
   Iceland},

Abstract = {The extent of corruption in Iceland is highly contested. International
   corruption measures indicate a relatively small amount of corruption
   while domestic public opinion suggest a serious corruption problem.
   Thus, uncertainty prevails about the actual extent of corruption and
   whose perceptions to rely on. This problem is relevant for corruption
   research in general. Perceptions are increasingly used as proxies for
   the actual levels of corruption in comparative research. But we still do
   not know enough about the accuracy of these proxies or the criteria they
   must meet in order to give dependable results. In fact, radical
   differences exist concerning evaluations of perceptions between those
   who believe in unbiased learning and those believing perceptual bias to
   be widespread. The purpose of this article is, therefore, to attempt to
   gauge which factors may influence how perceptions of corruption are
   shaped and why differences in corruption perceptions between different
   groups may be so pronounced. We present findings from original survey
   data from three parallel surveys - among the `public', experts, and
   `municipal practitioners' - conducted in Iceland in 2014. Expectations
   based on the perceptual bias approach are tested, indicating that
   perceptions may be affected by (1) information factors, (2) direct
   experience of corruption and (3) emotive factors. The validity of
   perception measures should be considered with this in mind. Domestic
   experts are likely to be well informed and avoid perceptual bias to a
   greater extent than other groups. Our examination of the Icelandic case
   suggests that the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) tends to
   underestimate corruption problems in `mature welfare states', such as
   Iceland, whilst the general public tends to overestimate it.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {69},
Number = {3},
Pages = {571-582},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article examines how Western foreign policy opinion reacts to the
   perceived Islamic character of foreign actors. Studies show that the
   target actor's dominant religion is a key ingredient in foreign policy
   opinion: Western audiences react more hostilely to Muslim than Christian
   targets. Yet, actors differ not only in which world religion they belong
   to but also how that religion is politicized by themselves and by
   others. We argue that Islam can be politicized in three major waysvia
   Islamic rhetoric, policies, and labelsthat shape foreign policy
   attitudes. To examine our claims, we field a survey experiment in which
   we attach common Islamic rhetoric (Allahu Akbar), policies (Shari'a
   law), and/or labels (Islamist) to a foreign actor in the context of the
   Syrian civil conflict. We find that these cues strongly harm attitudes
   toward the actor, and the results vary widely by type. Indeed, the
   Shari'a policy cue does the most damage to attitudes, emotions, and
   preferences toward the actor. Moreover, the Islamic cues reinforce each
   other in fueling these fearful reactions and are particularly potent on
   conservative citizens. These results paint a richer picture of how
   out-group religious cues influence foreign policy attitudes.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the centrality of the single market to the EU. Its
   main conclusion is that the single market will remain central to the
   Union in future and that although it is not immune to crises, because it
   is the Union's hard core and has powerful governance, serious erosion is
   unlikely. The paper examines the centrality of the single market by
   analysing in-depth the functional logic of market integration and the
   progress and deficits that characterise the Union's market regime. The
   paper then explores the meaning of the internal market for EMU and
   argues that the single market is the E' in EMU. The issue of the euro
   ins' and outs' is addressed. The paper ends by asking if the single
   market is resilient against crises and concludes in the affirmative.},

Abstract = {Liberal education is in crisis as neoliberal logics continue to shape
   the purpose and practice of higher education. But despite invocations of
   its contemporary `global' context, very few commentators engage the
   current crisis through the provocations of postcolonial studies. A key
   element of postcolonial critique draws attention to the ways in which
   the modern humanities and social sciences are colonially inflected
   traditions of knowledge production. Taking this critique as a point of
   departure, I aim to show that the critical response to the crisis
   prompted by the neoliberal agenda is inadequate in so far as there has
   been insufficient acknowledgement that modern liberal education wishes
   to suture and save a public culture that is racially exclusionary. To
   open up this space of inquiry, I focus on the thought and practice of
   Edward Blyden. Born in St Thomas, Danish West Indies, Blyden migrates to
   Liberia. A prolific writer and educator, Blyden delivers, in 1881, his
   inaugural address as President of Liberia College entitled `The Aims and
   Methods of a Liberal Education for Africans'. What lessons for the
   present crisis might we draw from a nineteenth century Pan-Africanist
   advocate of liberal education?},

Abstract = {This research seeks to explain a landmark change in the provision of
   public services for people with disabilities in Iceland. Public policy
   has for long been characterized by incremental changes. Every now and
   then, major policy changes take place and longstanding policy objectives
   pushed by interest groups come through. Agenda-setting theories seek to
   explain major policy changes by focusing on how and why a policy issue
   gets on governments' agenda at a given point in time. The American
   political scientist, John W. Kingdon, presented his theory of three
   streams and the window of opportunity some 30 years ago. European
   scientists maintain in their recent research that Kingdon's approach is
   helpful in shedding light on how the political system in which public
   policy-making takes place operates and how behaviour and strategies of
   those participating in the process influence the outcome. This
   qualitative research examines how the idea about user-driven personal
   assistance came to fruition in Iceland. The study is based on existing
   data and interviews with key people involved in the policy development
   leading to the decision to implement the programme of user-driven
   personal assistance. The research describes how and why this idea
   reached the government agenda and came to be implemented by Icelandic
   authorities. The conclusions show how the process of decentralisation
   opened opportunities for a new ideology which benefitted service users,
   and business as well as political interests. The conclusions indicate
   that not only was there a right man at the right place at the right
   time, but it provides theoretical explanations about what characterises
   policy entrepreneurs and how and why their activities matter in times of
   uncertainty.},

Abstract = {Do policymakers under financial and political distress make undesirable
   policy choices? This paper attempts to answer this question by studying
   the relationship between democratization and currency devaluation under
   speculative pressures. The central argument is that young democracies
   exhibit relatively high probabilities of succumbing to speculative
   attacks, as the political cost of economic adjustment needed for defense
   is relatively high for these nascent regimes. The paper further contends
   that this relationship is stronger when the regime can mobilize fewer
   resources to defend their currencies. To test these arguments, this
   paper uses monthly data for 117 countries from 1975 to 2008. The results
   from statistical analysis provide corroborative evidence for these
   arguments.},

Abstract = {Existing research has shown that highly diverse countries tend to
   provide less public goods. This article argues, by contrast, that the
   relationship is spurious: both contemporary ethnic heterogeneity and low
   public goods provision represent legacies of a weakly developed state
   capacity inherited from the past. Classical theories of state formation
   are then tested to show that favorable topography and climate, high
   population densities, as well as a history of warfare are conducive to
   state formation. Using an instrumental variable approach, I show that
   previous ethnic diversity is not consistently an impediment to the
   formation of indigenous states and thus to contemporary public goods
   provision. Empirically, this article uses three different measurements
   of public goods provision and data on pre-colonial levels of state
   formation in Asia and Africa to test these various hypotheses.},

Abstract = {Some observers argue that excessive veneration of the U.S. Constitution
   has blinded Americans to its flaws and made them reluctant to consider
   necessary reforms. In this paper, we test the assumptions that underlie
   these claims. We report the results of two survey experiments that
   examine the existence and effects of constitutional status quo bias at
   both the state and federal levels. Our findings support the notion that
   a proposed policy involving constitutional change imbues the
   constitutional status quo with normative value and, in turn, disposes
   individuals to resist the proposal. These results hold even at the state
   level. In addition to the institutional obstacles to constitutional
   amendment, therefore, we find evidence of another, psychological barrier
   to constitutional change that is based specifically in a sense of
   constitutional attachment.},

Abstract = {The Refugee Protest Camp Vienna started in 2012 as a protest against the
   living conditions found within the biggest reception centre in Austria,
   and turned into a highly visible protest movement organized by asylum
   seekers and activists. In this paper, I investigate how and to what
   extent this protest movement, through a form of contentious politics,
   succeeded in challenging exclusionary policies and improving asylum
   seekers' rights and living conditions. By moving from socially and
   spatially isolated locations into the centre of the city, setting up a
   protest camp in a park, and by seeking shelter in a church, the protest
   movement generated different modes of resistance, forms of mobilization
   and collective action. In exploring the connection between spatial
   strategies of the protest movement and relational ties within the
   movement, I contribute to debates within Critical Citizenship Studies.
   Specifically, I emphasize the relevance of place for creating alliances
   and networks and for making citizens.},

Abstract = {The early elite of the African National Congress (ANC) embraced values
   of moral improvement, individual responsibility and a sense of social
   consciousness. The ANC now governs South Africa, but with what appears
   to be a different set of principles. The current scourge of corruption,
   increasing state control, coupled with a general lack of service
   delivery point to behaviour of the ruling party which is inward-looking,
   self-seeking and self-preserving. Arguing that political culture and its
   accompanying values and attitudes is a prime motivator of behaviour, the
   paper seeks to understand the changing political culture of the dominant
   party. To understand the political culture of the ANC we use interviews
   with ANC parliamentarians and ANC supporters conducted in 2006-2007 and
   2013 as well as an analysis of the ANC's Strategy and Tactics policy
   documents. We contend that the liberal values of the early elites were
   never fully embedded, but in their stead is a liberationist culture,
   where the state is normatively understood to be extensive and embodying
   the will of the people. We argue, that through the resulting centralized
   determination of the interests of the people, patronage networks, and
   diminishing of accountability, a system conducive to corruption and the
   pursuit of personal interest is created.},

Abstract = {African elephants are being poached at a rate that threatens their
   minimum viable population. Some economists have argued that flooding the
   market with a legal supply of ivory will drive prices downward, eroding
   the incentive for poaching. They suggest that the current international
   ban on trading ivory is to blame for creating an artificially high
   price. This paper interrogates these arguments, suggesting that they are
   inadequate and entail implausible assumptions. The dynamics of supply
   and demand probably work differently to how pro-trade economists
   typically argue they work. The paper concludes that the major risk
   entailed in creating a legal market for ivory is that it may well fail
   to reduce the price of ivory. Any attempts to legalise the trade
   therefore risk undermining the efficacy of demand reduction campaigns,
   in addition to sending confusing signals to the market as to whether
   trade will again become legitimate.},

Abstract = {The existence of political responsiveness in multi-level systems like
   the EU remains an open question despite significant recent research on
   the topic. This article studies whether the European Council responds to
   the shifting policy priorities of European citizens. More specifically,
   it explores the synchronic and diachronic associations between what
   people consider to be the most important problems and the political
   attention devoted to these issues from 2003 to 2014. The economic crisis
   after 2008 appears to have made the ranking of public concerns and the
   European Council agenda more alike. However, a detailed examination of
   the shifts in prioritisation of single issues over time reveals little
   evidence for dynamic issue responsiveness. Recently the European Council
   has paid more attention to the issues that the public considered the
   most pressing problems but the convergence could possibly be driven by
   the intensity of the underlying policy problems.},

   constitutional reform of the year 1994},
Journal = {PROVINCIA},
Year = {2016},
Number = {36},
Pages = {45-66},
Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {The main purpose of this work is to analyse the context and the main
   debates that gave framework to the last constitutional reform carried
   out in Argentina in 1994, with special emphasis on the analysis of the
   federal redesign that emerges from it.
   The new Argentine federalism is still an unfinished proposal, since many
   of the institutional mechanisms foreseen in the reform have not been
   implemented or show partial advances.
   Along with a critique of this delicate situation, the article proposes a
   series of actions and strategies tending to launch the federal chapter
   of the reform and to consolidate a multilevel system of modern and
   vigorous government.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {60},
Number = {3},
Pages = {590-606},

Abstract = {This study applies insights from principal-agent models to examine
   whether and how the language assistance provisions of the Voting Rights
   Act, Sections 203 and 4(f)(4), affect Latino representation. Using panel
   data from 1984-2012, we estimate two-stage models that consider the
   likelihood and extent of Latino board representation for a sample of
   1,661 school districts. In addition, we examine how policy design as
   well as federal oversight and enforcement shape implementation and
   compliance with the language assistance provisions. Our findings not
   only provide the first systemic evidence that the language assistance
   provisions have a direct effect on Latino representation, but also link
   the efficacy of the language assistance provisions to the duration and
   consistency of coverage and the presence of federal elections observers.
   Overall, our study underscores the continued need for federal government
   involvement in protecting the voting rights of underrepresented groups,
   in this case, language minority citizens.},

Abstract = {The article aims to contribute to the developing of a Theory of Foreign
   Policy for Venezuela that is recurring in nature, with higher levels of
   generalization, and capable of producing causal statements. In order to
   achieve such a purpose the following questions are considered: How
   important is oil and its market for domestic affairs and international
   relations that, in turn, affect Venezuelan Foreign Policy? How variation
   in international oil prices has affected the historical evolution of
   Venezuelan Foreign Policy? It is argued that continuities and
   discontinuities in the activity of Venezuelan Foreign Policy might be
   framed within a recurring pattern that depends on oil market and,
   particularly, on international oil prices.},

Abstract = {Industrial control systems (ICS) or supervisory, control, and data
   acquisition (SCADA) systems drive many key components of the national
   infrastructure. It makes these control systems targets for cyber-attacks
   by terrorists and nation-states who wish to damage their target
   economically and socially, and cyber-criminals who blackmail the
   companies operating the infrastructure. Despite the high risk of leaving
   these systems exposed, providing adequate cyber-security is often
   challenging. The Stuxnet worm illustrated how vulnerable control systems
   potentially are when it bypassed a number of security mechanisms to
   cause physical damage to an Iranian nuclear facility. The article
   focuses on ICS/SCADA in South Africa discussing the unique challenges
   and legislation relate to securing control system in the South Africa. A
   governance and security framework for overcoming these challenges are
   proposed.},

Abstract = {This article provides a reinterpretation of Michael Walzer's argument
   that theories of justice should interpret the shared understandings of
   particular societies. It dubs his method ``ethical anthropology{''}
   because his most important contribution is to problematize our
   understanding of goods, treating them as cultural products that acquire
   whatever meaning they have via social construction and so must be
   interpreted. This suggests that political theorists must base their
   arguments for distributive principles on contestable social inquiry into
   meaning. In demonstrating this, the paper argues that critics have
   blurred Walzer's claim that societies share an understanding of the
   meaning of particular goods with the argument that social meaning should
   determine distribution. It concludes that Walzer's method is a powerful
   challenge to universalistic theories of justice and to analytic
   political theory more broadly.},

Abstract = {The prevailing theory on racial priming argues that counterstereotypic
   images of African Americans neutralize racial resentment. This study
   challenges previous findings, arguing that counterstereotypic images may
   not be as innocuous as they seem. Using an experiment conducted on a
   diverse sample of 357 white Americans, I investigate the confluence of
   racial and partisan cues, which very few studies have done. I
   empirically demonstrate that white Democratic candidates are penalized
   for associating with blacks, even if blacks are portrayed in a positive
   manner. However, since most studies of racial priming examine the impact
   of racial cues absent partisan information, to date we have been unaware
   of the differential effects of racial cues for white Democratic
   candidates as compared to their Republican counterparts. Racial
   resentment was primed such that white Democratic candidates associated
   with blacks were perceived as less fair, less likely to reduce crime,
   and less likely to receive vote support.},

Volume = {39},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {A longstanding but contested hypothesis in political science suggests
   that proportional (rather than majoritarian) electoral systems tend to
   increase the share of legislative seats held by women. While scholars
   have used a variety of empirical methodologies to test this hypothesis,
   they have mostly neglected legislatures where different parts of the
   country use different electoral systems. This note looks at women's
   election to the longest-established legislative body using such a mixed
   electoral system: the upper house of the French parliament, the Senat,
   where high-population constituencies use proportional elections but
   low-population constituencies use a majoritarian system. Among elections
   to the Senat from 1959 to 2014, regression estimates indicate that
   women's share of seats is approximately 10 percentage points higher in
   proportionally allocated elections, all else being equal. This finding
   both contributes to the literature linking gender to electoral systems
   and shows the potential value of considering understudied institutions.},

Abstract = {The article is framed within the strategic studies of Political Science,
   Criminal Law and Critical Criminology from the perspective of Power
   Analysis and its application to trials through mass media and modelling
   of public opinion. The purpose of the article is to evidence how the use
   of that power leads to the performance of parallel trials that make
   impossible the acquittal of the suspect. It also shows how judicial
   errors are made, as well as the manner in which verdicts are conducted
   and justice is imparted in Colombia. It is also exposed how opinion
   journalism, investigative journalism, the power of public opinion, and
   the mediatization of trials have become an epicenter of pressure that
   force authorities of States to dismiss public servants, begin trials or
   establish research commissions that facilitate the access to justice for
   citizens and reduce impunity in cases that would not have legal
   consequences. It is concluded, that such a power leads sometimes to the
   performance of parallel trials that make impossible the application of
   the principle of presumption of innocence and the democratization of the
   trial.},

Title = {National Action Plans as an obstacle to meaningful local ownership of

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {390-403},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {National Action Plans (NAPs) have been hailed as the preferential mode
   of implementing United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325
   at a national level. In recent years, member states, especially
   post-conflict member states, have been heeding the calls of the United
   Nations to develop their own National Action Plans. However, there has
   been limited assessment of whether or not National Action Plans are
   beneficial to women in post-conflict states. Using evidence from field
   research in Liberia and Sierra Leone, this article argues that, despite
   the intent to increase national ownership of 1325 in post-conflict
   states, National Action Plans are ineffective at creating meaningful
   local ownership because they are driven by a bureaucratic approach to
   peacebuilding. Furthermore, implementation of National Action Plans in
   post-conflict states is hampered by a variety of factors, such as lack
   of capacity and lack of political will. Finally, we conclude that
   National Action Plans also do a disservice to the hard work and
   dedication of local women's organisations.},

   stands at a critical political and economic crossroads. In this article,
   the author explains that political risks, including increasing
   polarization and the endangerment of democratic principles, are
   exacerbating weaknesses and undermining Turkey's long-term economic
   prospects. In particular, the Turkish economy is suffering from its
   dependence on foreign funds, unemployment, inflation, and a decline in
   administrative capacity. In order to set Turkey back on its course, a
   new political and economic paradigm is required. This should include an
   institutional overhaul with regards to democracy and the rule of law;
   reforming education and technology in order to address Turkey's
   middle-income trap; eliminating welfare inequalities; and implementing a
   sustainability agenda.},

Abstract = {Current accounts portray President Obama's tenure as dominated by
   executive policymaking and vigorous challenges from the states. We argue
   that such accounts overlook how federal-state collaboration has been
   critical to achieving Obama Administration ends. Partisan polarization
   has gridlocked Congress and made the President dependent on the states
   to advance his central policy initiatives. As a result, these
   initiatives are both more responsive to state demands and more
   bipartisan than they might appear. After exploring tools by which the
   President works with the states, we discuss implications for federalism,
   the separation of powers, and partisan polarization. In particular, the
   state role in shaping federal regulation raises the possibility that
   states are both aggrandizing and checking presidential power.},

Abstract = {We fielded an experiment in the 2012 Cooperative Congressional Election
   Study testing the theory that motivated reasoning governs reactions to
   news about misdeeds on the campaign trail. Treated subjects either
   encountered a fabricated news story involving phone calls with deceptive
   information about polling times or one involving disappearing yard signs
   (the offending party was varied at random). Control subjects received no
   treatment. We then inquired about how the treated subjects felt about
   dirty tricks in political campaigns and about all subjects' trust in
   government. We find that partisans process information about dirty
   campaign tricks in a motivated way, expressing exceptional concern when
   the perpetrators are political opponents. However, there is almost no
   evidence that partisans' evaluations of dirty political tricks in turn
   color other political attitudes, such as political trust.},

Abstract = {Drawing on a systematic content analysis, this article examines how far
   television news bulletins with different levels of public service
   obligations reported the EU and local elections in 2009 and the local
   elections in 2013. The aim is to compare coverage on the main evening
   terrestrial bulletins in the United Kingdom (the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and
   Channel 5) during different types of second order campaigns and
   according to their regulatory responsibilities. Although UK citizens
   appear to value local above EU elections, the latter campaign was more
   extensively reported than the former on all broadcasters, with
   politicians sourced differently. Most striking was the market deficit of
   second order election news, notably Channel 5 - the broadcaster with the
   lightest public service obligations - containing no policy related
   stories. It was left to the BBC - the broadcaster with the strongest
   public service commitments - to deliver the most comprehensive and
   policy-orientated coverage.},

Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},

Abstract = {This article uses a case study of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology
   Act 2008 to examine the legislative role of the UK Parliament.
   Parliament is often considered to be a weak legislative actor, although
   this view has increasingly been challenged by legislative scholars. In
   this case, Parliament exercised agenda-setting powers at the
   pre-legislative stage that produced a significant impact on legislative
   outcomes. The article demonstrates the value for legislative studies of
   disaggregating the legislative timeframe and thereby examining the power
   of legislatures beyond the formal decision-making process. It also
   identifies a set of enabling conditions - for example, extended
   pre-legislative scrutiny, low political salience, and synchronisation of
   committee timelines with the legislative process under which
   legislatures might exercise agenda-setting power in other areas of
   policy. The case study finds that those parliamentarians who engaged
   with policy in the agenda-setting phase exerted greater influence over
   policy outcomes than those who engaged at the decision-making stage.},

Abstract = {This article characterizes the aims of a practice-based method of
   justification and explains why its form of ideal theory need to only
   assume that a group of agents ideationally endorse an aim or end. Our
   interpretation of a practice, according to its aims or ends, can thus be
   quite realistic about the selfish or corrupt motives of any particular
   agent. This helps to answer selectorate theory cynics that view rules
   (in trade, etc.) as equilibrium solutions among elites optimizing for
   their personal political survival. Even when that is so, reason can
   still have an audience in politics in the ideational recognition of
   values (e.g. as upheld in the classical theory of free trade).},

Abstract = {Where some authors saw a limited impact of Europeanisation on national
   party politics, others proposed that in addition to the pre-existing
   economic left-right dimension a separate European Union dimension
   structures the national political space. This article looks at the Greek
   bail-out during the European sovereign debt crisis to examine how
   Europeanisation can change the national political space. The bail-out
   came with memoranda that set the main lines of Greek economic policy for
   the coming years. Accepting these policies was connected with remaining
   in the Eurozone. This restructured the political space: the economic and
   European integration form one dimension. A second relevant dimension
   focuses on cultural issues. The economic/European dimension is a
   stronger predictor of vote choice than the cultural dimension.},

Abstract = {An important intervention has been made in the discourse about the
   Northern Ireland conflict, demonstrating how the setting' and resetting'
   of the conflict as a problem' by academics is itself problematic, and
   calling for more work on the vexed relationship between the production
   of scholarly work and its impact on the conflict {[}Zalewski, M. \&
   Barry, J. (Eds). (2006) Special issue, intervening in Northern Ireland:
   critically rethinking representations of the conflict, Critical Review
   of International Social and Political Philosophy, 9(4), pp. 477-634;
   Zalewski, M. \& Barry, J. (Eds) (2007) Intervening in Northern Ireland:
   Critically Rethinking Representations of the Conflict (London:
   Routledge)]. This article responds to that call by examining academic
   antagonism' - the tendency of academics to engage in competitive or
   combative discourse to the detriment of collaborative or accommodating
   discourse - in relation to the first academic setting' of the Northern
   Ireland problem' by Barritt and Carter {[}(1962) The Northern Ireland
   Problem: A Study in Group Relations (Oxford: Oxford University Press)].
   Close study is made of two of the first resettings' by Trevor-Roper
   {[}(1969b) Why Ulster Fights: Professor Hugh Trevor-Roper analyzes the
   historical background to the conflict in Ireland, Realites, December,
   48-53] and Dudley Edwards {[}(1970) The Sins of our Fathers: roots of
   conflict in Northern Ireland (Dublin: Gill and Macmillan)], and the
   violent' effects of their antagonism are exposed. This offers new
   insight into the origins of the ensuing intractable meta-conflict' or
   conflict about the conflict' {[}McGarry, J. \& O'Leary, B. (1995)
   Explaining Northern Ireland: Broken Images (Oxford: Blackwells)]. It is
   suggested that a large-scale study of academic antagonism (and
   accommodation) in relation to successive resettings' of the Northern
   Ireland problem' is needed to rebuild trust in the academy with regard
   to its role in dealing with the past'.},

Abstract = {In recent times, Europe has seen a rise in active citizenship, coupled
   with support at the ballot box for political movements. This reflects a
   need for traditional political parties to respond to citizens' calls for
   better forms of political representation. The practices employed by
   political movements to engage with active citizenship, including their
   use of technology, can help established political forces regain the
   trust of citizens. This article analyzes the problems underlying today's
   evolution of political representation in Europe, discusses political
   movements as new forms of citizen-led democratic participation, and
   offers practical recommendations for political parties in Turkey and
   elsewhere.},

Abstract = {Often seen as something of a peripheral concern in New Zealand's
   reorientation towards Asia, it is argued here that India can, and
   should, occupy a more important place in it. This is due to the sharing
   of a number of common interests and concerns, including membership of
   the increasingly important Indo-Pacific' region. Following an
   examination of what the Indo-Pacific means to both countries, the
   article goes on to assess India's importance to New Zealand and how the
   bilateral relationship is perceived in Wellington. An analysis of the
   various efforts that New Zealand has made to give greater substance to
   the bilateral relationship is then provided, in which it is contended
   that rather than in the area of a free trade agreement, the greatest
   progress has been made in people-to-people ties, at the United Nations
   and with regard to defence cooperation. It is concluded that if momentum
   can be sustained, then India will no longer be at the margins.},

Abstract = {Recent discussions about the affective dimension of democracy have said
   too little about the way in which disempowered citizens can sustain
   their struggles in the face of adversity. This article develops a theory
   about democratic resilience of disempowered citizens by turning to the
   theory of aggression and play of Donald Winnicott. Drawing on Winnicott,
   I argue that resilience depends on a capacity to mourn, a capacity for
   dissent, and a capacity to invent new techniques for interaction. Yet,
   we need also think beyond Winnicott and investigate how these capacities
   are radically transformed by democratic struggles. This allows us to see
   that democratic struggles can open up new possibilities for facing
   adversity but that they can also undermine resilience by developing
   rigid attachments to strategies of resilience. I conclude with a
   preliminary discussion of how democratic struggles might undo a tendency
   to rigidity.},

Abstract = {One of the most important developments in the post-Britannica era of the
   sheikhdom of Dubai (UAE) is the emergence of state capitalism as an
   alternative to liberal capitalism. The dynastic socio-political
   structures of Dubai and other Gulf states make them susceptible to a
   statist model of economic development. The government led by Sheikh
   Al-Maktoum has not confined itself merely to a regulatory or facilitator
   role in the economy. But instead, through a raft of Government Related
   Entities (GREs) and Sovereign Wealth Fund, the city has become the
   epitome of state-led development and capital accumulation. In this
   article, the author narrates how Dubai has emerged as an exemplar of
   contemporary state capitalism in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC),
   even though there is a blurred line between the assets owned by the
   ruling family and that of the state.},

Abstract = {To improve representation and alleviate polarization among US lawmakers,
   many have promoted open primaries-allowing voters to choose candidates
   from any party-but the evidence that this reform works is mixed. To
   determine whether open primaries lead voters to choose ideologically
   proximate candidates, we conducted a statewide experiment just before
   California's 2012 primaries, the first conducted under a new top-two
   format. We find that voters failed to distinguish moderate and extreme
   candidates. As a consequence, voters actually chose more ideologically
   distant candidates on the new ballot, and the reform failed to improve
   the fortunes of moderate congressional and state senate candidates.},

Abstract = {With a continuing focus on liberal feminism, Marxist feminism and
   essentialism, one would be forgiven for thinking that feminist theory is
   unable to break free from the `second wave'. This is not the case. This
   article reviews three books which take on these feminist issues and
   offer new readings on the questions at the heart of feminism. Each
   provides clear links to feminism of the past but also connects to
   present debate and makes suggestions for future directions for feminism.
   There is plenty of literature which bemoans the end of feminism and some
   which triumphantly hails our era as post-feminist: no longer in need of
   feminist theory. Contrary to such claims, each book tackles the problem
   of women's oppression from a different perspective, each presents
   different solutions and in so doing they demonstrate that feminism is
   alive and well.},

   Creating a Relational Context},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {110},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {This article examines the role that democratic organizations play in
   fostering political activism in America. Activists make democracy work
   by attending meetings, engaging others, trying to make their voice
   heard, and participating in myriad other ways. Yet, we still need a
   deeper understanding of what role organizations play in cultivating that
   activism. The article presents data from three field experiments showing
   that creating a relational organizational context makes targets more
   likely to sign petitions, recruit others, and attend meetings. The
   article argues that civic organizations can have a powerful impact on
   activism. In doing so, it introduces a new set of variables related to
   organizational context to consider in understanding the sources of
   participation. The article thus extends a burgeoning body of
   experimental research on the social bases of voter turnout by examining
   not only voting but other forms of activism that are increasingly common
   modes of citizen involvement in the twenty-first century.},

Abstract = {This essay marks the maturing of South Africa's democracy since it was
   established in 1994. It raises questions as to whether the democratic
   dispensation has fulfilled what it promised, and it examines the reasons
   thereof. In essence it reasons that democracy has failed the people of
   South Africa because it lacks democratic accountability, and a firm
   foundation on the expressed will of the people. The theological and
   ethical factors in addressing the failings of a democratic system come
   into view. The essay concludes with an affirmation of the essential
   character of the church in promoting and defending justice in the world.},

Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {125-143},

Abstract = {This paper challenges the common explanations that failures of external
   state-building and democracy promotion are the result of a lack of
   domestic capacity or a lack of domestic willingness against an
   externally set liberal agenda of state-building and democratisation.
   Studying political decision-making on a micro-level, we argue that both
   explanations fail to capture the multi-faceted motivations and interests
   of domestic actors that go beyond mere `resistance' against externally
   induced liberal reforms. Rather, criticism of reforms might be rooted in
   ideas of social justice and claims to socio-economic security.
   Furthermore, these explanations tend to overlook the need for domestic
   elites to bargain with various domestic stakeholders. A case study of
   Croatian public administration reform illustrates that failure of
   externally promoted reforms remain an option when significant
   international resources are available for liberal state-building and the
   target of reform is a relatively mature bureaucracy.},

Abstract = {When does new economic information cause voters to reevaluate the
   government's competence and ultimately vote economically? Since
   politically relevant information is often conveyed by actors with
   incentives to influence voter perceptions, the credibility of
   information sources can vary significantly. This article randomly varies
   whether voters receive an aggregate unemployment forecast from the
   central bank, government or main opposition party using a survey
   experiment in Denmark linked to detailed panel data. We find that
   politically sophisticated voters discern differences in institutional
   credibility and the political cost of the signal and update their
   unemployment expectations accordingly. Despite failing to differentiate
   political costs, unsophisticated voters still substantially update their
   expectations. However, while sophisticated voters intend to engage in
   substantial prospective economic voting, unsophisticated voters do not
   relate their new unemployment expectations to their vote intention.
   These findings suggest that economic information supports economic
   voting most when it is credible and reaches sophisticated voters.},

Abstract = {What political problem can autobiography solve? This article examines
   the politics of Frederick Douglass's antebellum personal narratives: his
   1845 slave narrative, the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,
   an American Slave, and his 1855 autobiography, My Bondage and My
   Freedom, written at the opposite ends of Douglass's transition from the
   abolitionist politics of William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips to
   Douglass's defense of political action and the Constitution as
   anti-slavery. Placing the two texts alongside Douglass's distinction to
   narrate wrongs and denouncing them, I argue that Douglass writes My
   Bondage and My Freedom as a mode of denunciation: an autobiographical
   critique of injustice that balances analysis of collective oppression
   with advocacy for communal emancipation. Whereas to narrate wrongs
   encouraged readers to judge Douglass's story alongside popular criteria
   of justice, to denounce wrongs is to implicate readers within the
   structures that create antebellum subjects on and off the plantation, by
   revealing the coercions and conditionings of society that make not
   simply slaves but slaveowners, sympathizers, and abolitionists. This
   article claims that autobiography is a distinct genre of political
   theory, one that challenges present relations between the individual and
   the collective by representing not simply its author but an expanded
   view of the people.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the biographies of militants involved in the
   libertarian collectives from the 20s to mid- twentieth century. Based on
   the methodological approaches of sociology of criticism, from the
   postulates of Bernard Lahire, this approach aims to make visible
   experiences, identities, lives and experiences of political
   participation and some of the references of anarchism in Argentina: Jose
   Grunfeld, Juan Lazarte, Jose Maria Lunazzi, Jacobo Magid, Herminia
   Brumana, Iris Pavon and Ana Piacenza. On the other hand, the gender
   perspective allows us to observe the different paths of men and women as
   performative strategies of ``being{''} and anarchist conception of
   political action.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {78},
Number = {2},
Pages = {411-426},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article engages with the question of how to construct modern
   economic relations as an object of political theorizing by placing
   Hannah Arendt's and Karl Marx's writings in critical conversation. I
   contend that the political aspect of capitalism comes into sharpest
   relief less in relations of economic exploitation than in moments of
   expropriation that produce and reproduce the conditions of capitalist
   accumulation. To develop a theoretical handle on expropriation and
   thereby on the politics of capitalism, I syncretically draw on Marxian
   and Arendtian concepts by first examining expropriation through the
   Marxian analytic of ``primitive accumulation of capital{''} and second
   delineating the political agency behind primitive accumulation through
   the Arendtian notion of ``power.{''} I substantiate these connections
   around colonial histories of primitive accumulation wherein
   expropriation emerges as a terrain of political contestation. From this
   perspective I conclude that such putatively ``economic{''} questions as
   dispossession, exploitation, and accumulation appear as irreducibly
   political questions.},

   evolution of race in political science scholarship},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {To explore the evolution of political-science research on race, Walton
   et al., have done a systematic review of more than a century of
   publications appearing in the discipline's oldest and most prestigious
   journals: Political Science Quarterly and the American Political Science
   Review, respectively. Walton and his colleagues uncover ``dual
   traditions{''} of race scholarship: an ``African American Politics{''}
   (AAP) paradigm emphasizing empowerment and Blacks' cultural
   distinctiveness, and a ``Race Relations Politics{''} (RRP) approach that
   focuses on Blacks' socio-political status vis-a-vis Whites. Using
   computer-assisted text analyses, we introduce a measure of racial
   dialogue that is informed by theory and has suitable empirical
   properties. We replicate and extend Walton's research by adding a third
   periodical (the Journal of Politics) and demonstrating that, while race
   conversations are becoming more frequent over time, the dialogues taking
   place in mainstream journals typically fit Walton's RRP (rather than
   AAP) tradition. Following our analyses, we offer guidelines for
   researchers seeking to apply our measure to alternative contexts.},

Abstract = {There is a long-standing debate in the comparative welfare state
   literature as to whether social policy regimes come to look more alike
   over time (converge) or else retain their distinctiveness. In this
   article, we explore this question through a detailed interrogation of
   the social policy record since 1996 of three states widely classified as
   liberal: Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Overall, we
   find that the social/economic pressures faced by all three countries are
   more similar now than they were two decades ago and that each has sought
   to legitimize its policy response to the global financial crisis (GFC)
   in similar ways. In terms of the three policy areas we explore, we find
   convergence is much more substantial in welfare-to-work than in either
   child-contingent support or pensions. But we also find that any
   straightforward convergence story is unsustainable, despite the GFC and
   accelerating globalization, and partisan effects remain important.},

Abstract = {Some birth scholars (Melissa Cheyney, Robbie Davis-Floyd, and Elizabeth
   Davis) have argued that there are two models of birth that value
   different kinds of knowledge. They assert that the ``technocratic{''}
   model has been adopted by ``mainstream{''} culture, which values reason
   and scientific knowledge. Meanwhile, the ``countercultural{''} birth
   subculture, which has adopted a ``holistic{''} model, values intuition
   and ``body knowledge{''} instead. However, my research does not support
   this argument. Rather, the 119 birth stories I analyzed suggest that,
   even if the birth subculture rhetoric supports those scholars'
   dichotomies, their birth experiences do not. Neither group appears to
   uniformly hold their respective values, thus weakening the original
   dichotomy between the ``mainstream{''} group and the
   ``countercultural{''} group. Moreover, I demonstrate how the dichotomy
   between reason and scientific knowledge on the one hand, and intuition
   and ``body knowledge{''} on the other, is also inaccurate. Feminist
   epistemology also warns that this dichotomization undercuts a diversity
   of thinking styles by limiting them to just two.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we report of a case from Turkey where a civil society
   organization took an active role in development of a functioning
   domestic market for organic agriculture and organic products by not only
   influencing laws, regulations and their implementation, but also
   establishing and administering marketplaces solely for organic products.
   Although the country's climate and biodiversity is suitable for organic
   agriculture, the domestic market remained underdeveloped; the organic
   sector was directed mainly towards exports. By establishing the first
   marketplace solely for certified organic products in 2006, a
   non-governmental organization became the locomotive of the domestic
   sector. The process that led to the 100\% Ecological Marketplaces
   exhibits a contingent characteristic where particularly social and
   symbolic capital were mobilized by the NGO to facilitate embedded
   relationships of trust among a multiplicity of actors, together with a
   framing of positive `ecological living' discourse and therefore
   contributing to the `organic' movement.},

   Perspective},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {57-79},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {This article provides a summary of China's new strategic foreign
   initiatives under Xi Jinping's leadership. These initiatives include the
   ``One Belt, One Road{''} proposal, the establishment of the Asian
   Infrastructure Investment Bank, and calls for a ``New Asian Security
   Concept{''} as well as for ``a new type of major power relations.{''} In
   a localized Southeast Asian context, they are operationalized, as
   projects under the so-called 21st Century Maritime Silk Road proposal, a
   ``2 + 7 cooperation framework for China-Southeast Asia relations,{''}and
   the so-called ``dual track{''} approach to the management of the South
   China Sea disputes. These initiatives are expected to provide a
   favorable external environment for the attainment of the ``Chinese
   dream{''} and to pave the way for China to emerge into a position of
   global power and leadership. The article mainly focuses on what these
   initiatives may be signaling to China's neighbors, and the subsequent
   implications for Southeast Asia and its relations with China. There are,
   for instance, some doubts as to whether China can be a reliable provider
   of security and stability as public goods in its own region if China
   itself is a key party in the territorial contentions and power rivalries
   that could be likely causes of conflict. The fact that China is still
   trying to defend primordial territorial and cultural- ideational
   interests, settle historical scores, and find an effective model for its
   domestic politics and governance that will serve its increasingly
   globalized economy, indicates that China may not be ready yet to make
   the sacrifices and compromises that will be required of regional - let
   alone global - leadership.},

   perceptions' proximity to party ideology},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {41},
Pages = {159-178},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The article aims to explore whether the accuracy of voters' perceptions
   of party ideology are affected by party position shifts and by the
   media's turn to non-left-right issues, such as political leadership,
   during election campaigns. Using data from the Comparative Study of
   Electoral Systems (CSES) and a country specific left-right index based
   on data by the Comparative Manifestos Project (CMP), multilevel analyses
   reveal that emphasizing leadership issues can lead voters to reflect
   left-right positions more accurately. A party's left-right position
   shift between elections does not lead to a significant difference in
   voters' perceptions, while a shift on the economic sub-dimension of
   left-right ideology can even lead voters to more position clarity.
   However, multiple parties' shifting their positions seems to overburden
   respondents' cognitive capacity. (C) 2016 The Author. Published by

Abstract = {This article assess the merits of establishing a Parliamentary Budget
   Office (PBO) in Fiji by examining how such an institution would fulfil
   two important roles: first, by assisting in the oversight of the budget
   process; and second, by supporting coordination among key accountability
   institutions such as the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and the Auditor
   General (AG) in their fiscal oversight roles, which is a role specific
   to Fiji's accountability ecosystem and which stems from the uniqueness
   of the Fijian context itself. The article thereby shows that a PBO fits
   very well into Fiji's new constitutional commitment to enhancing
   accountability, by strengthening institutions that are enshrined within
   the new constitution.},

Abstract = {This article introduces and reviews a set of twelve academic forecasts
   of the 2015 British general election. Along with the vast majority of
   others including journalists and betting markets, they failed by a big
   margin to predict that the Conservatives would emerge with an overall
   majority of seats. Several suffered from the 1992 scale inaccuracies of
   the vote-intention opinion polls. Forecasts based on other data sources
   typically did a bit better, but also fell short. Nonetheless, this was
   not 1992 all over again. The dramatic collapse of the Liberal Democrats
   and rise of the SNP, IMP and Greens were successfully anticipated. Also
   this collection includes numerous methodological advancements, with
   several new methods and developments to established approaches. (C) 2015

Abstract = {Urban Chinese today do not appear to trust foreign countries. Why are
   they so suspicious? Over the past quarter century, the Chinese Communist
   Party (CCP) has utilized its educational and propaganda systems to
   produce historical narratives of imperial China's beneficence towards
   its East Asian neighbors, and of an early modern `Century of
   Humiliation' at the hands of `imperialist' foreign powers. Qualitative
   analysis of Chinese social media today suggests that these narratives
   are tied to widespread popular distrust of China's `ungrateful' East
   Asian neighbors and the `hegemonic' West today. Interrogating a 2012
   survey of urban Chinese, this paper explores the sources of
   international attitudes quantitatively. It first examines whether
   Chinese today do indeed distrust foreign countries. It then tests two
   hypotheses about the drivers of Chinese distrust towards the world
   today. A `top-down' socialization hypothesis holds that political (e.g.
   party propaganda via education and the media) and/or social (e.g. peer
   groups, social conformity) pressures shape the international attitudes
   of the Chinese people. A `bottom-up' psychological hypothesis, by
   contrast, holds that individual differences like age and gender shape
   Chinese attitudes. We find substantial support for the former: more
   years of education are associated with levels of dis/trust in foreign
   countries in the socially or politically appropriate ways. However, we
   also find that `bottom-up' individual differences in subjective interest
   in international affairs interact with `top-down' socialization
   processes like education and media exposure in shaping the international
   attitudes of urban Chinese today. The prevalence of public discourses of
   distrust towards foreign countries does not bode well for Chinese
   foreign policy in the twenty-first century.
   Following the Tiananmen Square Massacre of 1989, the Chinese Communist
   Party (CCP) launched a `Patriotic Education Campaign' to bolster its
   nationalist legitimacy (see Zhao, 2004; Callahan, 2010). The educational
   system, then CCP General Secretary Jiang Zemin (1991) declared in The
   People's Daily, should teach the Chinese people, and especially its
   youth, to `guard against worshiping the West and fawning over the
   foreign'. Only then, Jiang argued, could `national self-respect and
   national self-confidence' be enhanced.
   Have Chinese today ceased `fawning over the foreign'? If so, is it
   because 25 years of `Patriotic Education' have successfully socialized
   the Chinese people into a view of the rest of the world as being
   threatening?
   Much Western scholarship suggests that it has. Despite its embrace of
   the free market under `reform and opening', Anne-Marie Brady (2008)
   argues that the CCP has intensified its propaganda and ideological work.
   Interpreting a wide variety of texts, Bill Callahan (2010: 194) has
   argued that patriotic education in China today teaches the Chinese
   people both how to view foreigners - `as barbarians: the United States
   as the Evil hegemon, Japanese as devils' - and `what to feel' about
   them: `humiliation, hatred, and revenge'. Kirk Denton (2014: 4) has
   similarly explored the role of Chinesemuseums in shaping Chinese views
   of their past encounters with foreigners. He concludes that `{[}t] he
   CCP exerts a profound influence over the memoryscape and mediascape of
   China'.
   This article supplements such qualitative analyses with a quantitative
   one, exploring what recent surveys of Chinese public opinion can teach
   us about both what urban Chinese think about foreign countries, and why
   - the sources of their attitudes. Specifically, it assesses two
   competing hypotheses about the macro-drivers of international attitudes
   in China today. A `top-down' socialization hypothesis holds that either
   social conformity (e.g. peer pressure) or the state-run educational and
   media systems (e.g. party propaganda) most shape the international
   attitudes of the Chinese people. A `bottom-up' psychological hypothesis,
   by contrast, holds that individual differences like demographics (e.g.
   age and income) and personality (e.g. openness) are the primary drivers
   of international attitudes.
   To preview, we find substantial evidence for the `top-down'
   socialization hypothesis: exposure to education - but not media exposure
   - appears to overwhelm `bottom-up' individual differences in accounting
   for Chinese survey responses to evaluative questions such as those
   asking how much China should trust foreign countries. But not all
   Chinese are alike, and their differences do matter. Specifically, the
   `bottom-up' variable of personal interest in foreign affairs interacts
   with `top-down' variables such as education and media exposure, leading
   some Chinese to toe the socially or politically correct line, while
   others do not.},

Abstract = {In the long river of time, the Chinese nation not only achieved its
   overall transformation from an ancient country, but also created a new
   model of development, which deserves to be called a great miracle in the
   history of human civilizations. The power creating this miracle came
   from both the development trend of human civilizations and Chinese
   people's creative transformation of their historical heritage.
   Specifically, it refers to how to fully transform from a traditional
   country to a modern country in terms of existing values, rules, and
   organizational systems, so as to achieve organic integration of the
   unification of the Chinese nation and the country under the rule of the
   people. Within the organic integration, China's internal development
   logic requires that modernization and democratization must be conducted
   under the premise of ``keeping the unification of China'', which is the
   historical requirement for China's modern transformation. The trend of
   modernization and democratization requires that national rejuvenation
   and unity must be based on people's democratic liberation as the engine,
   goal and mission, which is the realistic requirement for China's modern
   transformation. China's modern politics thus formed under the combined
   effects of historical forces, age forces, and human forces. Similar to
   all modern countries, China takes democratization as its fundamental
   orientation. However, its historical requirement, realistic foothold,
   and main force creating the modern politics are totally different from
   those of other countries. Therefore, China formed its unique modern
   politics and a republican and democratic form of modern politics with
   Chinese characteristics has been created. To grasp and understand
   China's modern politics, we should fully understand not only the nature
   of modern democracy, but also the source, foundation and process of
   China's modern politics.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to contribute to the theoretical and empirical
   understandings of the role that political forgiveness plays in the
   post-conflict and post-authoritarian societies. The paper provides a
   discussion of the complexities of the concept of political forgiveness,
   and offers empirical examples that demonstrate the different capacities
   and potentials that political forgiveness has as a mode of social
   reconciliation and repair the past injustice. It argues that today, with
   the accumulation of experience in the practice of transitional justice,
   and the growing importance of human rights regime, considering of
   forgiveness through the accountability's lens is very timely and
   important. After the discussion of the contribution of forgiveness to
   societal reconstruction in the post-conflict and post-authoritarian
   societies, the paper focuses on the role of forgiveness as an essential
   part of justice and solidarity. By scrutinising forgiveness' links with
   reconciliation and justice, the paper offers a comprehensive way to
   assess the nature of preconditions and the role of forgiveness in
   addressing the past injustice and overcoming divisions in post-conflict
   societies. Its discussion of empirical findings on the role that
   forgiveness opens up a debate about risks and costs involved in a policy
   of forgiveness in newly democratised countries.},

Abstract = {Policy learning has been one of the primary mechanisms by which policy
   innovations are assumed to diffuse from one jurisdiction to another.
   Recent research suggests, however, that learning is more than simply
   observing policy adoption in other jurisdictions and must also include
   an assessment of the outcomes or effectiveness of those policies. This
   article argues that an assessment of the ability to implement an
   innovation is also likely to be a component of the learning process.
   Specifically, it argues that potential adopters are likely to ask not
   only, Was the policy effective in other states that adopted it? but
   also, Can we make the policy work for us? We test hypotheses drawn from
   this general argument in a directed dyad analysis of renewable portfolio
   standards in the American states between 1997 and 2009. Results indicate
   that shared implementation environments among jurisdictions help
   determine the impact that information about policy effectiveness has on
   adoption decisions. These findings suggest that implementation concerns
   may be an important part of the policy learning process.},

Abstract = {Rich voters tend to be Republicans and poor voters tend to be Democrats.
   Yet, in most settings it is difficult to distinguish the effects of
   affluence on partisanship from those of closely related variables such
   as education. To address these concerns I use state lottery and
   administrative records to examine the effect of changing economic
   circumstances on the partisanship of over 1,900 registered voters.
   Winning larger amounts in the lottery produces a small increase in the
   probability an individual is later a registered Republican, an effect
   that is larger for those who registered to vote after winning. This
   suggests that wealth does affect partisanship, particularly for those
   without preexisting attachments to a political party. Comparing
   estimates from the lottery to cross-sectional data suggests the latter
   exaggerates the relationship between wealth and partisanship, although
   controlling for additional variables produces largely similar estimates.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the difference between two specific forms of
   citizens' involvements, namely whether a vote is cast by ballot or in a
   citizens' assembly in which people gather in town halls to decide
   legislative questions in a deliberative manner. We show both
   theoretically and empirically how citizens' assemblies and decisions at
   the ballot box substantially differ not only in terms of their
   underlying model of democracy, but also in their structural conditions
   and, thus, with respect to the social inequality of participation. We
   test our hypotheses in a Bayesian multilevel framework using real
   participation data collected from 15 political decisions made in a Swiss
   commune. Our results show that citizens' assemblies are not only
   characterised by lower participation rates, but also by a particular
   composition of the electorate. While citizens' assemblies are more equal
   regarding income groups, ballots favour a more equitable participation
   in terms of gender and age.},

Abstract = {Current theories on institutional change tend to interpret it either as
   the result of long-term gradual trends, or of disrupting shocks
   following periods of punctuated equilibrium. Less is known about the
   moments in which change is more frequent. Focusing on the short-term
   determinants of reforms of core democratic rules in consolidated
   democracies, the article shows that proximate shifts in the electoral
   arena have a distinctive impact on the number of institutional reforms
   that are adopted in a legislature. Using the empirical and theoretical
   findings of the literature on electoral reform, the article develops a
   model tested in statistical analyses aggregating a large sample of
   institutional reforms in Western European democracies between 1990 and
   2010. The results show that rising electoral uncertainty measured by
   volatility, and the change of preferences of the actors in power
   measured by the advent of new forces in government lead to the adoption
   of more institutional reforms. These results appear consistent when some
   categories of reform are added or subtracted, giving confidence that
   this model can be applied to a wide range of institutional reforms.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the experiences of Scotland's largest
   foreign-born minority group, namely Poles, in the run-up to the Scottish
   independence referendum in 2014. We draw on 20 in-depth interviews to
   explore our participants' intentions and justifications for voting (or
   not) in the referendum. We found that our participants tended to
   emphasise the jus domicili principle when justifying their eligibility
   to vote in the referendum. However, our participants extended the jus
   domicili principle in their justifications to also include the intention
   to stay in Scotland as a central aspect of their continuing stake in
   (and right to vote in the referendum to determine) Scotland's future.
   Through exploring our participants' justifications for voting in the
   referendum, we were able to examine and better understand how migrants
   constitute their citizenship through articulating their substantive
   attachments (social, economic and relational or familial) in their
   adoptive country and in their country of origin.},

Abstract = {It is a rare moment when free speech becomes a potent political issue
   within the Australian polity. But the Andrew Bolt affair, the Abbott
   government's subsequent move to repeal </n>18C of the Racial
   Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth), and its ultimate abandonment of this
   reform, is one of those moments. This article seeks to place these
   political events in a broader political and philosophical context,
   investigating how the conflicts and tensions to which these events gave
   rise can be understood in terms of competing perspectives within a wider
   liberal tradition, producing rival imperatives centred on free speech
   and equal respect. The differing priorities which these competing
   liberal perspectives placed on free speech and equal respect give rise
   to two very different conceptions of toleration, and its application
   within liberal democracies.},

Abstract = {The TTIP is a proposal on negotiations between the EU and the USA in
   order to create the largest free international trade area by extension,
   population and volume of trade of all existing ones. In our view, TTIP
   would be the geoeconomic answer to BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China
   and South Africa), as a comercial, geopolitical and cooperation space in
   other areas such as the military, in both that TTIP reproduce on a
   commercial scale the political and military alliance already existing
   between good part of the EU and USA by the NATO. In this paper we will
   try to explain why the possible rivalry between TTIP and BRICS would
   reproduce in the XXIst. Century the schemes of ``Cold War{''} inherited
   from XXth. Century, that in turn reproduced the geopolitical
   confrontations arising from the theory of Haltford McKinder pivot area
   and the traditional opposition between thalassocratic imperialisms
   (government on the seas and oceans) and tellurocratic imperialisms
   (government on an enormous portion of emerged land). Likewise, we will
   try to show why, at a dialectic of States level, the most populated,
   territorially extensive and with greater amount of resources political
   societies will be those that have the greatest ability to impose a
   particular model of international relations and its geopolitical
   hegemony on a universal scale in response to this viable confrontation
   between TTIP, plus TTP, vs. BRICS.},

Abstract = {A network is a dominant model of creation and value share in the social
   and solidarity economy; this can he a network of companies as well as a
   network of individuals. the weaknesses, the globalization of the
   transactions and the social media role in the three types of networks -
   distributed, administered and steered - push the traditional network
   boundaries to evolve through integrating other networks. In consequence,
   we witness an extension of the network organization frontier towards ct
   form of ``network of networks{''}. We analyze this topic in this chapter},

Volume = {28},

Pages = {255-262},
Abstract = {Until the 1970s, mainstream development theory and the practice of
   international economic organizations put total faith in a trickle-down
   approach, refusing to conceive any special policy for those excluded
   from the gains of modern development. Gradually, both theory and
   practice are veering toward the mainstream's ``inclusive growth.{''} The
   authors of World of the Third and Global Capitalism conceptualize
   exclusion and subsequent inclusion as two sides of the same coin that
   can be theorized through the Lacanian couple of
   foreclosure/foregrounding. The authors propose a practice of
   counterhegemony grounded in ethical principles born of the encounter of
   the working class of the first world and the modes of being and
   producing of the third world, which are excluded from hegemonic
   discourse. Many powerful insights are provided by this Lacanian reading
   of exclusion/inclusion in development theory and practice, but this
   reading cannot accommodate the role of lived experience and may generate
   another ``end of history.{''}},

   policies and instructions for the use of force and firearms; the
   appropriate choice for equipment and weapons including instructions as

Abstract = {This article aims to identify, in the Liberal State crisis and its
   delegation model of political power, the field of study of the
   possibility of a restructuring from the foundations of participatory
   democracy, privileging local authorities as instance greater involvement
   of the subjects participating in this process. It sought to demonstrate
   that the objective of the term democracy can be used in various senses,
   including the economic, social, industrial and political. Still, in this
   line, it can be exercised traditionally in two ways: directly or
   indirectly through political representation. Connected to it are the
   political parties and the binomial representation and participation.
   Seeking to structure a reasoning by the deductive method, the article
   tried to demonstrate that the democratic decentralization, it sought to
   demonstrate that the democratic decentralization can create a viable
   alternative to the failure of the current model, giving preference to
   local authorities, as the sphere of effective popular participation},

Abstract = {With so many role-playing simulations already in the political science
   education literature, the recent repeated calls for new games is both
   timely and appropriate. This article answers and extends those calls by
   advocating the creation of probabilistic games using Microsoft Excel. I
   introduce the example of the Stag Hunt Game-a short, effective, and
   easy-to-use activity that simulates Jean-Jacques Rousseau's political
   philosophy. In testing the game's effectiveness, I found that students
   who played the game scored higher on the exam than students who did not
   play. Using the Stag Hunt Game as an example, I invite political science
   instructors to consider creating more probabilistic Excel-based games.},

Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},

Pages = {183-198},
Abstract = {Turkey is a case of a Muslim-majority country that has known an
   experience of representative democracy almost uninterrupted since the
   Second World War. The historical passages that have characterized the
   path to democracy in Turkey have configured the current set of powers.
   The aim of this article is to explore how the democratization process in
   Turkey is relevant in procedural, substantive, and result terms. In the
   first part is undertaken a historical overview from the perspective of
   modernization and democratic consolidation carried out by Turkey, also
   on the basis of the ability to meet the requirements of the Copenhagen
   political criteria. The second part investigates eight dimensions in
   which democracy spreads its effects in order to assess the quality of
   democracy of Turkey.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Common knowledge seem to suggest that international studies
   (IS) programs are at the forefront of helping their students better
   understand the world beyond United States borders. The purpose of this
   study is to test the proposition that IS students have a greater global
   awareness than other college students. Method: Hanvey's (1976) five
   dimensions of global perspective were operationalized into 45 specific
   questions. A questionnaire consisting of these questions and a few
   demographics were circulated among students of 10 universities in the
   United States. A statistical method of Differences-in-Differences was
   used to compare the global perspective of IS students with other college
   students. Results: Controlling for different initial levels of awareness
   between freshmen/sophomore of IS students and students of two control
   groups, the findings do not support the hypothesis that IS programs have
   enhanced the global awareness of their students. The findings suggest
   that increases in global awareness of senior IS students are due to
   their initial predisposition and the process of maturation rather than
   their course of study. Comments: The null findings of this study suggest
   a scholarly and professional discussion on the future direction of IS
   programs is needed.},

Title = {Capitalism \& the ``new wars{''}: free markets and societal insecurity

Journal = {CIVIL WARS},

Abstract = {Critics of globalisation suggest that growing free-market conditions
   generate anomie, leading ultimately to what some term `new wars' and new
   insecurities. Others argue that liberal economies dissuade violence
   since people gain from peace. This study argues for a micro perspective
   that views predatory economic policies driving higher investment in
   rebellion-specific capital, such as shadow economic activity that easily
   translates into insurgency in weak-state settings. Investment in the
   shadows determines survivability against superior state forces, and
   survivability determines rebellion, by definition. Using civil war onset
   data from 1970 to 2013, as well as the Global Peace Index (GPI) and
   several of its individual components, which capture societal insecurity
   above and beyond the absence of armed violence, this study finds that
   countries that are more capitalistic have a lower risk of civil war and
   societal insecurity. The results are robust to alternative models,
   testing methods, and uphold when examining several relevant
   subcomponents of the index, such as internal conflict, violent crime,
   homicides, ease of access to small arms, and political instability.
   Surprisingly, democracy tends not to be associated with peace but
   associates with increased criminality whereas strong autocracy reduces
   it, suggesting that capitalism, more than democracy, associates with
   conditions favourable to societal security, independently of a country's
   level of development.},

   Advertising: A Tri-Party Perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},

Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {333-361},
Abstract = {This article presents an empirical investigation of young partisan
   first-time voter attitudes toward the use of negative attack advertising
   in a British general election. Partisanship, particularly in relation to
   negative advertising and third-party effects, is significantly
   under-researched, yet it advances understanding of youth electoral
   interaction. Our study confirms that young British partisans are not
   passive recipients of information, but are actively involved in
   information processing, interpretation, and counter arguing. Our
   findings also highlight a third-party effect among young partisans in
   their evaluation of the attack advertising. Overall our young partisans
   broadly reject image-attack election ads, which raises a ``health
   warning'' on its use in future election campaigning. The findings of
   this study are of significant interest to election campaign strategists
   in their planning for future elections and to political researchers
   striving to advance understanding within the field of political
   marketing.},

Abstract = {The decision of judicial bodies on whether or not to defer to previous
   decisions and findings by national authorities is increasingly
   attracting the attention of international legal scholars. Judicial
   bodies enjoy a certain degree of discretion in terms of defining the
   extent and intrusiveness of their review. In looking to structure the
   element of uncertainty that the question of deference brings with it (or
   conversely, to define the margin of appreciation of the state), the
   question is also addressed through the standard of review-notion. This
   article explores deference claims in the context of the Human Rights
   Committee. The aim of the article is to identify the structure of
   deference claims in the work of the Committee. A look at the Committee's
   recent practice in deportation cases provides an opportunity to
   illustrate the nature of the doctrine of deference as a mechanism for
   expressing disagreement.},

Abstract = {This article examines the use of strategic partnerships by Asian states
   as a means of enhancing national and regional security, as well as
   advancing economic and other objectives. It argues that strategic
   partnerships are best conceived as a new practice that signals the
   emergence of new forms of ``security governance{''} in the region. It
   observes, however, that whereas early strategic partnerships were based
   on substantive shared agreement on ``system principles,{''} contemporary
   strategic partnerships take different forms, some grounding closer
   cooperation between like-minded partners and some intending to
   facilitate better management of partners with divergent values and
   interests. The contemporary behavior of the United States and its
   traditional and new security partners in the region conform to this
   general pattern. The article concludes that the proliferation of
   strategic partnerships and the emergence of regional security governance
   should prompt a reappraisal of traditional approaches to Asian security,
   which tend to concentrate on architecture and community at the expense
   of practices.},

Title = {The Legacy of Dictatorship for Democratic Parties in Latin America},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-32},
Abstract = {When dictators seize power, they face a choice about how to deal with
   the pre-existing political parties. Some simply repress all parties,
   some ally themselves with one of the traditional parties and use it to
   help organize their rule, and others repress pre-existing parties but
   create a new party to support themselves. This study examines how these
   decisions affect the subsequent development of party systems after
   redemocratization. Looking at the experience of Latin America, a region
   that has experienced its share of dictatorships, we show that dictators
   who allied with traditional parties or repressed existing ones have
   contributed to very stable party systems. By contrast, dictators who
   repressed the old parties but created a new one destabilized their
   countries' party systems for some time after the return of democracy.},

Abstract = {Spatial/spatiotemporal interdependence-that is, that outcomes, actions
   or choices of some unit-times depend on those of other unit-times-is
   substantively important and empirically ubiquitous in binary outcomes of
   interest across the social sciences. Estimating and interpreting
   binary-outcome models that incorporate such spatial/spatiotemporal
   dynamics directly is difficult and rarely attempted, however. This
   article explains the inferential challenges posed by spatiotemporal
   interdependence in binary-outcome models and recent advances in their
   estimation. Monte Carlo simulations compare the performance of one of
   these consistent and asymptotically efficient methods (maximum simulated
   likelihood, using recursive importance sampling) to estimation
   strategies naive about (inter-) dependence. Finally, it shows how to
   calculate, in terms of probabilities of outcomes, the estimated
   spatial/spatiotemporal effects of (and response paths to) hypotheticals
   of substantive interest. It illustrates with an application to civil war
   in Sub-Saharan Africa.},

Abstract = {Participation usually sets off from the bottom up, taking the form of
   more or less enduring forms of collective action with varying degrees of
   influence. However, a number of projects have been launched by political
   institutions in the last decades with a view to engaging citizens in
   public affairs and developing their democratic habits, as well as those
   of the administration. This paper analyses the political qualifying
   capacity of the said projects, i.e. whether participating in them
   qualifies individuals to behave as active citizens; whether these
   projects foster greater orientation towards public matters, intensify
   (or create) political will, and provide the necessary skills and
   expertise to master this will. To answer these questions, data from the
   comparative analysis of five participatory projects in France and Spain
   are used, shedding light on which features of these participatory
   projects contribute to the formation of political subjects and in which
   way. Finally, in order to better understand this formative dimension,
   the formative capacity of institutional projects is compared with the
   formative dimension of other forms of participation spontaneously
   developed by citizens.},

Title = {Ideology as blocked mourning: Greek national identity in times of
   economic crisis and austerity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {201-224},
Abstract = {This article approaches the 2010-2014 economic crisis in Greece from the
   perspective of loss and mourning, critically exploring what questions
   and insights this provokes. We argue first that the rhetoric of
   mainstream political and media elites has been instrumental in framing
   responses to the Greek economic crisis in patriotic terms, a frame
   subsequently adopted by groups from across the entire political
   spectrum, whether part of the establishment or not. We then draw on
   discourse theory and psychoanalysis to argue that attachments to the
   dominant austerity and anti-austerity responses to the crisis can be
   understood-at least in part-in terms of a failure (or not) to properly
   articulate and thus mourn the nationalist-inflected loss associated with
   economic dislocation. We sketch out two ideological pathways in the
   discourses of austerity and anti-austerity, which we designate as
   symptomatic of `blocked mourning': a melancholic pathway that seeks to
   contain loss through self-blame; and a pathway of ressentiment that
   seeks to contain loss by attributing its cause to a series of `others'.
   We argue that blocked mourning bears a direct relation to the
   ideological grip of the austerity and anti-austerity discourses, and
   that we can better appreciate the character and strength of their
   affective pull by drawing out the fantasmatic aspects of the narratives
   expressing Greek national and economic identity. Conversely, we argue
   that a critique of ideology can be understood in terms of the
   preconditions for mourning, whose satisfaction would make possible a
   less invested relation to the fantasmatic guarantees underpinning the
   austerity/anti-austerity narratives. In this view, a critique of
   ideology proceeds by bringing to light those factors that could
   facilitate a more open and deliberative articulation of loss, so as to
   transform and pluralize collective responses to the economic crisis.},

Abstract = {The Rise of China occurs in an adaptive and reactive regional system,
   giving impetus to the development of inclusive and expansive security
   architecture. This attempts to offset the statistical likelihood of
   conflict with the rise of a major power as capability outweighs conflict
   costs. China, in an effort to be a central player within this forming
   security architecture, contributes to its formation and participates in
   strategic narrative framing to defer from open conflict and sabre
   rattling, while maintaining an increase in capabilities. This
   functionalist system of ``open regionalism{''} incorporates external
   powers, furthering integrating the security concerns of the East Asian
   system with the security concerns of the world.},

Abstract = {Various authors have claimed that citizenship norms have changed
   dramatically in contemporary societies. Recent research has studied the
   implications of Russell Dalton's argument that duty-based citizenship
   norms (emphasizing voting and obeying the law) are being replaced by
   engaged citizenship norms (emphasizing self-expressive and
   non-institutionalized forms of participation). In this article we use
   the 2009 International Civic and Citizenship Education Survey
   (n=140,650) to ascertain the cross-national empirical validity of
   engaged and duty-based norms. By means of latent class analysis, we show
   that both of these citizenship norms are indeed adhered to by different
   groups of adolescents. We also show, however, that only half of the
   research population holds these two norms, while other more traditional
   norms are also identified. The findings confirm expectations that
   high-status respondents with low political trust are more likely to
   adhere to engaged norms, but the country-level findings contradict
   expectations: engaged norms are less prevalent in highly developed
   stable democracies, and this casts doubts on the hypothesis that new
   engaged citizenship norms are predominantly found in stable highly
   developed democracies.},

Abstract = {The research of the Polish presidential elections is important for
   political science due to the tendency of the political parties to
   emphasize its significance to a bigger extent than the actual Polish
   political system defines its importance. In this article we aimed at
   answering the questions whether the Polish presidential elections in
   2015 and subsequent presidential election could be considered
   second-order elections based on the concept of Reif and Schmitt and why
   Komorowski was unable to defend his presidential mandate in the first
   round as it was suggested by the opinion-polls and eventually lost the
   presidential bid to Andrzej Duda. The article depicts the concept of
   Reif and Schmitt and applies their concept to the Polish presidential
   elections in 2015. We considered the election subjected to analysis in
   the context of the political system of Poland and the current political
   situation. In the conclusion we also examined the position of the 2015
   presidential elections in Poland within the context of the recent
   presidential elections in Central Europe. The authors argued, that
   despite some trends suggesting the shift of presidential elections
   towards second-order elections, the higher voter turnout in the second
   round of presidential elections compared to the parliamentary elections
   suggest that the 2015 presidential elections should be considered as one
   of the country's first-order elections. Based on the analysis of the
   current political circumstances the authors consider the public's
   fatigue with the long mandate of the Civic Platform, the successful
   oppositional strategy of PiS to nominate the relatively unknown Andrzej
   Duda instead of the controversial Jaroslaw Kaczynski and the tempting
   electoral appeal of Pawel Kukiz opposed to the establishment as the
   causes related to Komorowski's defeat. The 2015 Polish presidential
   elections ended with an initially unexpected result and foreshadowed the
   results of the following parliamentary elections.},

Abstract = {This article examines Thomas Hobbes's views on legal citizenship in
   relation to sovereign prerogative powers and the conditions of rule by
   law. It is argued that the authority of Hobbesian sovereigns includes
   the right to decide whether individuals be admitted as subjects of the
   state, or treated as public enemies. While Hobbes's specific
   understanding of the legal status of citizens seems to be inapplicable
   today, it is suggested that he provides us with a broader perspective on
   the making and unmaking of citizens, which could be used to evaluate
   attempts to deprive terrorists of their citizen rights. In Hobbes's
   view, the sovereign does not only have a right to formally admit or
   exclude individuals, but also a duty to constitute them as citizens
   through civic education. Hence, it is ultimately the government's
   responsibility if citizens turn into enemies of the state.},

Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {I use a simple optimal stopping model to derive policy relevant insights
   on the timing of one-shot attacks by small autonomous terrorist units or
   ``lone wolf `` individuals. A main insight is that an increase in
   proactive counterterrorism measures can lead to a short term increase in
   the number of attempted terrorist attacks because it makes it more risky
   for existing terrorist units to pursue further development of
   capabilities. This is consistent with the events in London in 2005 where
   a terrorist attack on 7 July was followed by a similar but unsuccessful
   attack two weeks later.},

Abstract = {The popular revolts changed the balance of power in South America. There
   were social improvements, democratic gains, and the imperial aggression
   was stopped. But an increase in the export oriented extractivism and
   trade balkanization has been observed. Progressivism was affected by
   neo-developmentalist rehearsals that failed to channel agro-export
   revenues to productive activities. The right wing now advances in the
   region hiding the poor results of their administrations. The preeminence
   of primarization didn't standardize the political processes of the last
   decade. The term ``post-liberal{''} obscures the continuities with the
   previous period.},

Abstract = {Within a few weeks after its victory in the Polish parliamentary
   election in autumn 2015, the party Law and Justice (PiS) changed the
   media law and made new appointments to the top positions in public
   broadcasting. There are new staff members in the news programmes, which
   have already been brought into line with the party. The government
   rejects all criticism and speaks of de-politicisation. The facts tell a
   different story.},

Abstract = {In the Czech Republic, the situation of quality journalism is in a bad
   way. Newspapers and news magazines often cannot do justice to their
   claims of serious reporting. Responsibility for the tabloidisation was
   for a long time attributed to the foreign, mainly German media houses in
   the Czech Republic in the 1990s and dominated the press market. Since
   the global economic crisis in 2008, these investors have withdrawn. The
   new owners are mostly leading Czech entrepreneurs. But the quality of
   the reporting has not gotten better. The question, how free the press
   is, has become even more urgent. This applies in particular to
   newspapers published by the media company MAFRA, which belongs to the
   Agrofert Group owned by Andrej Babis a leading entrepreneur and the
   Czech Republic's finance minister.},

   tend to articulate their nationalist ideas by relying on the signifiers
   adopted from the generally accepted discourses of multiculturalism. In
   order to explain this seemingly incompatible meaning generation, we
   employ the concepts of the hegemonic logic of signification and the
   empty signifier, as elaborated by Laclau, as well as the concept of the
   self-description and the self-model from the theoretical framework of
   cultural semiotics. Our analysis is based on the unexpectedly insistent
   public feedback that followed the discussions of Anti-Counterfeiting
   Trade Agreement ratification in Estonia.},

Abstract = {It has been suggested that one of the reasons why majoritarian electoral
   systems are associated with lower voter turnout in comparison to
   proportional electoral systems is that citizens in uncompetitive
   districts ({''}safe seats{''}) are not motivated to vote. This study
   brings this thesis into a new context and tests it with unique data.
   Mixed-member electoral systems have both majoritarian and proportional
   components. The relative importance of these components differs between
   mixed-member proportional (MMP) and mixed-member majoritarian (MMM)
   systems. I argue that, due to this difference, the impact of
   district-level competitiveness on turnout is stronger in MMM than in
   MMP. An analysis of district-level electoral data from four countries
   confirms this hypothesis. Findings from this study advance our
   theoretical understanding of voter participation and also of the
   functioning of mixed-member electoral systems.},

Abstract = {This article is based on a paper which was developed for the Global
   Counterterrorism Forum's Foreign Terrorist Fighters (FTF) Working Group.
   It takes stock of the current trends and dynamics related to the FTF
   phenomenon and identifies some of the gaps that still need to be
   addressed. The distinction between home-grown terrorists and (returning)
   FTFS is fading, the difference between ISIL/Da'esh inspired or directed
   terrorist attacks is becoming more fluid and the nexus between terrorism
   and crime is more prominent, which clearly indicates that terrorism can
   manifest itself in many different ways. The involvement of returning
   FTFS in some terrorist attacks is a stark reminder of the potential
   threat returning FTFS pose. The data also indicates a demographic change
   with a more prominent role of female FTFS and children being recruited
   and used in hostilities or involved in terrorist attacks. The current
   trends underline the need for a comprehensive, tailored and
   multidisciplinary approach including the involvement of stakeholders at
   the local level to adequately address the evolving aspects of the FTF
   phenomenon. This paper provides a short overview of policy responses
   which can broadly be grouped into preventive, criminal, administrative
   and rehabilitative measures. The FTF related responses could have
   several human rights implications and states are encouraged to develop a
   comprehensive approach to address the FTF phenomenon in full respect of
   human rights.},

Abstract = {The article links the latest protest phenomena in Bulgaria since 2013 to
   a deepening crisis of the country's system of representative (party)

   the respective relevant actors and their claims and analyzes the reasons
   for the movement's relative failure. It also discusses the question of
   potential long-term effects of protests on the functioning of Bulgaria's

   study of fighting Irish social security retrenchment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {17-32},
Abstract = {Examining the politics of Irish responses to crisis-related social
   security cuts gives insight into Irish agency and how crisis has shaped
   the contours of Irish civil society. Despite assertions of lack of
   protest, Irish retrenchment was resisted and sometimes partially
   defeated. Using political sociology frameworks to explore interactions
   between institutional, ideological and interest variables in three case
   studies of defending cuts enables analysis of resistance strategies.
   There are tensions when short-term defensive resistance strategies
   undermine or limit offensive political coalition-building that might
   offer greater long-term solidarity and more sustainable resistance to
   intensification of the neoliberal Irish welfare state.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2016},
Number = {4},
Pages = {162-181},
Abstract = {Ideologies of authoritarian and neo-authoritarian regimes are analyzed
   in the article. The analysis is carried out in three clusters:
   ``rudimentary{''} authoritarian regimes, post-colonial dictatorships,
   neo-authoritarian regimes. Within the first cluster regimes are
   subdivided into two subgroups: authoritarian monarchies and ``communist
   regimes{''}. The regimes united in the third cluster are also subdivided
   into two subgroups: post-Soviet regimes and neo-authoritarian regimes in
   Africa, Asia and Latin America. It is noted that in the age of decline
   of ideologies on a global scale authoritarian and neo-authoritarian
   regimes as before need political ideologies for legitimacy of their
   power. However, in contemporary epoch which sets authoritarian and
   neo-authoritarian regimes before new and much more complicated
   challenges they are forced to use more flexibility in ideological issues
   in order to adapt themselves to the rapidly changing world. Ideologies
   of such regimes lose former integrity and become ``multi-layer{''},
   eclectic. Such ``non-ideological{''} element as corruption becomes a
   part of ideologies of neo-authoritarian regimes. But herewith priority
   of the state as the highest value remains ``bearing structure{''} of
   political ideologies of all authoritarian and neo-authoritarian regimes.
   The human being, protection of its rights and liberties are recognized
   by neo-authoritarian regimes as values that occupy secondary and
   subordinate place in ideological hierarchy and political practice of
   these regimes.},

Title = {Context Matters: Economic Voting in the 2009 and 2014 European
   Parliament Elections},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},

Pages = {145-166},
Abstract = {Using the 2009 and 2014 European Election Studies (EES), we explore the
   effect of the economy on the vote in the 2009 and 2014 European
   Parliament (EP) elections. The paper demonstrates that the economy did
   influence voters in both contests. However, its impact was heterogeneous
   across the two elections and between countries. While assessments of the
   economy directly motivated voters in 2009 by 2014 economic appraisals
   were conditioned by how much responsibility voters felt the national
   government had for the state of the economy, implying a shift in
   calculus between the two elections. The analysis suggests that voters in
   2009 were simply reacting to the economic tsunami that was the Global
   Financial Crisis, with motivations primarily driven by the unfavourable
   economic conditions countries faced. But in 2014, evaluations were
   conditioned by judgments about responsibility for the economy,
   suggesting a more conscious holding to account of the government. Our
   paper also reveals cross-country differences in the influence of the
   economy on vote. Attribution of responsibility and economic evaluations
   had a more potent impact on support for the government in bailout
   countries compared to non-bailout countries in 2014. Our findings
   demonstrate the importance of economy on vote in EP elections but also
   highlight how its impact on vote can vary based on context.},

Title = {THE CORPORAL REPERTOIRE OF PRISON PROTEST IN SPAIN AND LATIN AMERICA The
   Political Language of Self-Mutilation by Common Prisoners},
Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {666-690},
Abstract = {By means of case studies and historical information regarding
   penitentiary institutions in Spain and Latin America, the author offers
   an interpretative view of protest in prisons. Taking into consideration
   the concept of ``prisonisation{''}, this paper discusses the ``prisoner
   body{''} treated as a typological category. In a manner of speaking,
   this perspective enables the author to establish differences in the
   nature of the arsenal of collective actions employed by prisoners, and
   thus to put forward his own conceptual definition as ``bioprotest{''}.
   There is a subtle asymmetry in the bodily-harm aspect of prisoner
   protest, which needs to be examined in light of the dominant cultural
   frameworks. On the one hand, we have ``political and ideological
   prisoners{''}, whose non-violent corporal arsenal (hunger strikes, in
   particular) is often a sufficient to make themselves heard. On the
   other, we have ``common prisoners{''}, who are often unable to break
   free of the cultural stigma of criminality which clings to them, and
   therefore feel compelled to add a more sacrificial (corporal) aspect to
   their actions - mainly by way of self-mutilation.},

Abstract = {Overcoming death is a constant feature of utopian thinking. It takes on
   a palpable form with the rapid scientific progress towards the end of

   with technical constructs for prolonging life and the physical
   immortality of man. Following Fedorov, Andrei Platonov offers a literary
   assessment in the early Soviet period of the practices of living and
   overcoming death.},

Pages = {348-357},
Abstract = {This review provides a critique of `Democratic Governance' by one of the
   leading commentators on governance, Mark Bevir, focusing on the UK New
   Labour government and public services. It examines three main issues.
   First, an `internal' critique exploring what this text adds to Bevir's
   earlier contributions on governance finds that it focuses on `early' New
   Labour. Second, the `story' presented here is rather different to
   Bevir's, focusing on markets and hierarchies rather than networks.
   Third, the review argues that some of the data and methods used by Bevir
   in his interpretative, decentred approach may not give as `thick' a
   description as he claims.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the problem of measuring public trust in modern
   Russian public institutions, and discusses the political practice of
   using the results of these measurements, socio-political and
   methodological problems of evaluation of trust as part of public
   opinion. The author proves the legitimacy of the question of how the
   traditional polling methods correspond to the complexity of the studied
   social categories and events, and justifies his own position on the
   example of credibility issue of the key state political institutions. He
   demonstrates the inadequacy of routine approaches and presents
   alternative methods applied in three studies conducted by the INDEM
   Foundation in 1998-2015. The author analyzes formal statistical
   characteristics of the relationships between the sets of estimates of
   confidence in various institutions and other characteristics of the
   respondents, and demonstrates the correlation between changes in the
   nature and structure of public opinion and changes in the political
   process. It is established that after 2000 there was a transition from a
   diversified assessment of confidence in the various authorities to a
   rather monolithic one, as well as changes in the social framework of
   trust and separation of the trust assessment from political demands to
   the authorities. The article establishes zones of influence of
   conformism on the assessment of confidence in public authorities. Such
   confidence is not institutionalized due to its instability and lack of
   influence on political behavior. Lost is the additive character of
   adjacent estimates of confidence, as well as the forecast potential of
   traditional survey results. Basing on this study, the author draws the
   conclusion about the need for new approaches to the study of public
   opinion.},

Title = {Cultural Evolution and the Colonial Imperative},
Booktitle = {DISSENT, REVOLUTION AND LIBERTY BEYOND EARTH},
Series = {Space and Society},
Year = {2016},
Pages = {169-187},
Abstract = {Evolving populations can be described as influenced by two opposing
   forces: a conservative force preserving adaptations which suit the
   population to present circumstances and a radical one creating diversity
   in order to prepare for novel challenges. An excellent technique
   evolution uses to handle this tension is the creation of ``stealth
   diversity,{''} which does not affect the population until and unless it
   is adaptively useful. Colonies are a uniquely powerful way to do this,
   since they simultaneously eliminate the conservative influence of gene
   flow while posing new challenges that redirect selection. Turner's
   classic analysis of the interplay between the East coast and frontier
   cultures of the American west echoes these themes within the context of
   cultural evolution. As any colonial culture evolves, the mother culture
   attempts to exert a conservative influence, creating tension and
   reinforcing divergence. Nevertheless, if the colony survives, it can
   generate adaptive diversity that is as valuable to the mother culture as
   it was inaccessible to her on her own. Thus, American style democracy
   blossomed on the frontier, but eventually cross-pollinated with the
   mother culture and beyond, greatly enriching world culture. Since the
   conditions on an extraterrestrial colony will be fundamentally different
   from those shaping terrestrial ones, we can't predict their evolutionary
   trajectory in detail. However, the development of extraterrestrial
   colonies will certainly create additional adaptive diversity that could
   be critical to our long-term success as a species. Colonies should
   therefore be pursued, not as a means to particular cultural ends, but as
   experiments in cultural adaptation. Moreover, we must be open-minded
   about the fruits of these experiments, since our pretensions to
   universality are often little more than an instinctive conservatism that
   does not reflect the realities of colonial circumstances. Indeed, most
   arguments against the establishment of extraterrestrial colonies partake
   of either extremely short-term thinking or an unfounded degree of
   confidence in the capacity of terrestrial culture to adapt unaided.
   Therefore, any truly rational, long-term, strategic plan for humanity
   must include an aggressive program of extraterrestrial colonization.},

Abstract = {Distribution of resources is an essential part of politics and vast
   research has been done in this field. While the allocation of public
   money is primarily of an economic nature, the literature shows that
   political representatives tend to use it for rewarding their allies
   while punishing their rivals. In addition, allocated grants have the
   potential to increase the prospects of incumbents when seeking
   reelection. This paper elaborates on these expectations and it studies a
   governmental program of local grants in Slovakia in the period between
   2004 and 2014. The results show that better access to resources is given
   to towns led by mayors with closer ties to the central cabinet. In
   coalition governments, however, this advantage is provided primarily to
   municipalities with mayors supported by the ruling party that directly
   controls the distribution. What is more, the subsidies are beneficial
   for mayors when seeking reelection. A greater number of grants awarded
   during one term or grants distributed at the end of the electoral cycle
   help local incumbents to an even greater extent. Hence the paper
   demonstrates that a program paid for by all taxpayers may operate as a
   mechanism fueled by political and partisan interests with an impact in
   the electoral arena.},

Abstract = {Lovecraft's school of ``Interplanetary Fiction{''} allows novelists to
   consider freely extra-terrestrial human communities and their relation
   with Earth. Foucault's analysis of social order based on an
   understanding of power allows that this relationship may take many
   un-Earthly forms. If modern societies such as ``Mars One{''} rely on
   personal identities within a community being affirmed through
   communication (such as being Nodes on the Internet), new structures of
   power and discipline may evolve. This paper seeks to apply a Foucaultian
   perspective on discipline in an extra-terrestrial community.},

Abstract = {The European economic crisis has brought economic hardship and prolonged
   instability to many countries in the European Union. While economies are
   struggling to recover, citizens have opted to become more vocal
   unconventionally. Mass protest, public occupations and demonstrations
   have dominated Europe. Yet, numbers of people choosing to protest need
   to be assessed to verify whether the economic recession is indeed
   responsible for a surge in protest activism on the continent. With the
   use of multiple rounds from the European Social Survey (2006-2012), this
   article tests the hypothesis linking unconventional political behavior
   in Europe to the economy. Findings suggest that overall European protest
   levels are not higher after the crisis, although confrontational
   activism has spiked in few countries. Economic variables retain instead
   an important role in the explanation of protest in the post-recession
   era, with both objective and subjective economic measures supporting a
   grievance theory explanation of why Europeans protest. Economic decline
   matters in the selection of protest as a mode of political
   participation.},

Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-86},
Abstract = {Inspired by the never-ending quest for the end of violence in some
   African communities, the author asks what kind of leadership is required
   to lead a community from violent conflict to peaceful coexistence. The
   aim of the article is to propose some principles for leadership in
   situations characterised by violent conflict. By departing from a
   conceptual framework to explain holistic leadership, conflict leadership
   and peace leadership, the author explains what Great Heart Leadership
   is, citing several examples to illustrate these concepts. The author
   argues that a leader with a `great heart' is a leader who is able to
   apply analytical, intellectual, emotional and spiritual/normative
   leadership to activate peaceful change. This argument is applied to the
   challenge of leading people towards lasting peace in Africa, offering
   the specific case of a San community in South Africa to illustrate Great
   Heart Leadership.},

Volume = {29},
Number = {114},
Pages = {205+},
Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to analyse the social uses of law by
   migrants living in a precarious situation, through the case of Chinese
   parents of sick children, applying for regularization for medical
   reasons. Based on an ethnographic survey conducted on the two sides of
   the ``illness clause{''} in the management of applications for residence
   permits doctors as well as applicant parents the article first shows
   that what is considered as stigma can become a resource for irregular
   migrants to facilitate their access to legality. Because of the
   anticipation that these parents will make use of the law, they are
   sometimes considered as ``strategists{''} in the eyes of child
   psychiatrists, who evaluate the situation medically, morally and
   politically over time. After following these migrants in their care
   itinerary and migration trajectory over a relative long period of time,
   the ethnographic work has enabled me to analyze the temporal evolution
   of the moral issues involved in regularization for medical reasons.
   Among the parents concerned, there is an appropriation process of using
   a child's medical monitoring as an administrative resource. At the
   intersection of medical and migration uncertainties, some parents are
   able to move from a regularization decision for medical reasons to a
   return to their home country, likewise for medical reasons. When those
   families are managed by ``border guard{''} doctors, they are able to
   self-manage their relation to the borders between their countries of
   origin and their host countries.},

   conceived truth as risk-based, this work aims to point out two issues:
   the first is that this resemblance arises from a comparison of the
   concepts of power relations in Foucault and of struggle in Nietzsche,
   which in turn, allow a wider conception of cura sui; the second is that
   the differences in the understanding of these power and struggle
   relations can be brought together from what is respectively antagonistic
   in both ethical and political terms, i.e., Foucault's view of power as
   domination in contrast with Nietzsche's view of power as a civilization
   inheriting Christian values.},

Abstract = {Human activities are central to the debate on global environmental
   changes, constituted as unprecedented challenges to contemporary
   societies in transition to the Anthropocene. Regarding social and
   political dimensions of global environmental changes and the perspective
   of risk society, this article analyses how Brazil and China are
   politically responding to these challenges. It provides a summary of the
   main events and trends of environmental policies in Brazil and China,
   two countries that have been noted for their international importance
   and, above all, for the importance of environmental issues at the core
   of their actual political processes. From a theoretical point of view,
   an intercrossed analysis capable of fostering dialogue between
   environmental sociology, social theory and sustainability is proposed,
   considering international relations and the notion of governance. For
   both countries, the question that remains is whether the actions
   proposed and the existing political and institutional structures are
   sufficient to respond effectively to contemporary environmental risks,
   mainly in time to prevent irreversible climate change.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the formulation of two food security policies -
   the Food Acquisition Program (AAP) and the National School Food Program
   (NEAP)- emphasizing the role of ideas, interests and institutions. The
   establishment of AAP dates back to the 2003, a period characterized by
   the implementation of the policy Fome Zero (Zero Hunger), a public
   action which was the flagship of Luiz Inacio << Lula >> da Silva first
   mandate policies to fight poverty. This program aims to promote food
   security based on family farm supply. These ideas, the actors and the
   institutions that have shaped this policies were also the basis for the
   reformulation of the NEAP. In this sense, this article provides not only
   an analysis of two policies that are the object of transfer to other
   countries (Latin America and Africa), but also a << portrait >> -
   limited, but informative- of a political juncture of Brazilian history.},

Abstract = {Comparative scholarship suggests that sustainable democracy and conflict
   management are dependent on the existence of well-functioning political
   parties and institutionalized party systems. Surprisingly little
   attention has been given to how to strengthen parties by institutional
   means. Drawing on Lesotho, this article will discuss two different
   approaches of political party engineering: electoral system reform and
   banning party switching in parliament. Since reintroduction of
   multiparty politics, elections in Lesotho were marked by post-election
   conflict and violence. Following violent clashes after the elections in
   1998 Lesotho adopted a Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) electoral system
   to deal with electoral conflicts. The article argues that the
   introduction of Africa's first MMP system produced an inclusive
   parliament that mitigates violent conflict and the simultaneous
   introduction of a regulation of party switching was useful in preventing
   party system instability and could set an example for democracy building
   in other post-conflict societies in Africa.},

Abstract = {The flag protests that occurred during the tail of 2012 and early 2013
   gained international media attention. Much of the media attention
   focused on the involvement of young people and sought to seek answers to
   how young people who had grown up in more peaceful times could be
   involved in violence that belonged in Northern Ireland's past. Research
   being conducted by the authors during the course of the flag protests on
   young people's experiences of living in post-conflict Belfast enabled
   the researchers to gain insight and clarity on the flag protests, why
   they had occurred and underlying factors that fuelled the riots and
   violence that followed, giving a snap shot of the strength of feeling
   and overall mood of the Protestant community at that time. Using an
   interpretative phenomenological analysis approach, 2 focus groups with
   14 young people aged between 15 and 24 (M=17 years) were conducted
   followed by more in-depth semi-structured interviews with 6 young people
   from the focus groups and a further 6 interviews with youth and
   community workers from the East Belfast area.},

Abstract = {While democracy is commonly believed to reduce corruption, there are
   obvious endogeneity problems in measuring the impact of democracy on
   corruption. This article attempts to address the endogeneity of
   democracy by exploiting the thesis that democracies seldom go to war
   against each other. We instrument for democracy using a dummy variable
   reflecting whether a country has been at war with a democracy in the
   period 1946-2008, while controlling for the extent to which countries
   have been at war in general. We find that democracy to a significant
   extent reduces corruption, and the effect is considerably larger than
   suggested by estimations not taking endogeneity into account. Democracy
   may hence be more important in combating corruption than previous
   studies would suggest.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on desire in the problematization of immigrant
   integration in Canada, the UK and Netherlands. I argue that the
   immigrant's affective orientation towards society became viewed as the
   source of these problems, and not the communities or societies
   orientation towards them. The integration exam becomes a suitable
   solution because it solves multiple problems at once. The exam works as
   the mechanism through which desire is manufactured by making tangible
   the object of desire in the first place and by making society itself
   more exclusive. I turn to the implementation of the exam content to
   explore of what this might mean for the kinds of citizens that the exams
   produce, arguing that they primarily work to produce unstable citizens,
   rather than more affected' citizens.},

Abstract = {In this article, I examine the problematic of revolutionary strategy and
   how it is under-theorized at the centres of global capitalism, often
   confused with the theory of organization. Arguing that the theory of
   insurrection is uncritically accepted as normative, I discuss the
   necessity of returning to a critical engagement with the theory of
   strategy in the context of a modern capitalist military. By examining
   Karl Liebknecht's discussion of militarism, the a priori acceptance of
   the theory of insurrection by contemporary theorists in both the
   communist and anarchist traditions (i.e. Jodi Dean and the Invisible
   Committee), and the counter-tradition of protracted people's war, I
   demonstrate that the theory of insurrection is philosophically
   deficient, unable to account for the problems produced by capitalist
   militarism and pacification.},

Abstract = {The assumption that representatives hold knowledge about their parties'
   programmes underlies models of representative democracy. However,
   representatives' party knowledge is rarely discussed in theoretical
   detail, nor is it often systematically empirically investigated. This
   article takes the first steps and discusses what type of knowledge of
   their parties representatives need and what knowledge they actually
   have. Specific focus is given to parties' election pledge-making. By
   comparing the number of parties' pledges in Swedish election manifestos
   to Swedish party representatives' perceptions of the extent to which
   parties make pledges, the article presents empirical evidence indicating
   low levels of knowledge. Knowledge is higher among top-level politicians
   and politicians who trust parties to generally keep their pledges, but
   the main conclusion is that research should not assume detailed
   knowledge of pledge-making in manifestos among elected representatives,
   which has not previously been shown in systematic studies.},

   `Party (PKK) in southeastern Thrkey, has flung the peace process in this

   an inclusive political -led process to solve the Kurdish issue. In this

   four dimensions: the political terrain in Turkey after two consecutive
   general elections, the challenges of the problem, a civic approach to a
   solution, and expectations. Touting the success of two civil initiatives

   confidence must he restored between Turkey:s political parties and

Volume = {43},

Abstract = {Many studies have engaged youth's apathy to electoral participation, but
   there is a special interest in South African youth. They are
   beneficiaries of long history of struggle for political equality. This
   study examines why some `born-frees', those born since 1994, did not
   vote in 2014 General Election. It explores the socio-economic and
   political reasons affecting their participation in electoral process,
   and their opinions of the political process in the 2014 General
   Election. This study reveals that cynicism about politics and social
   economic concerns are some of the reasons affecting youth turnout.
   However, they are like youth in many nations with apathetic attitude to
   politics. The idealisation of struggle, freedom and democracy has
   created a narrative of a `born-free' generation that should honour the
   legacies of the struggle by voting. Perhaps, they should not be burdened
   with this emotional expectation, but to address their concerns about
   poverty, unemployment and inequality.},

Abstract = {Party systems research has proceeded along two parallel lines of
   inquiry, one predominantly ``qualitative{''} and the other
   ``quantitative.{''} This article attempts to bridge this divide in two
   ways. First, by showing that qualitative information can be valuable in
   the construction of quantitative measures. Second, by showing that the
   results from applying theoretically sensitive measurement tools can be
   useful for qualitative classification. These analyses are performed
   using an original dataset of party system changes in Sub-Saharan Africa.},

Abstract = {Political scientists are increasingly engaged with the importance of the
   ``visual turn,{''} asking questions about how we understand what we see
   and the social and political consequences of that seeing. One of the
   greatest challenges facing researchers is developing methods that can
   help us understand visual politics. Much of the literature has fallen
   into the familiar qualitative versus quantitative methodological binary,
   with a strong bias in favor of the former, and has consequently been
   unable to realize the advantages of mixed-methods research. We advance
   the study of visual politics as well as the literature on bridging the
   quantitative versus qualitative divide by showing that it is possible to
   generate quantitative data that is rooted in, and amenable to,
   qualitative research on visual phenomena. Our approach to conducting
   mixed-methods research is an alternative to the more common strategy of
   seeing various research methods as an assortment of tools, as it is
   directed at developing an organic relationship between qualitative and
   quantitative methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy
   for research on visual politics by discussing our own efforts to create
   a dataset for quantifying visual signifiers of militarism.},

Abstract = {Of the many structures which constitute the intellectual architecture of
   Black Power, where do canonical sources of political theory stand? How
   are they incorporated, reworked, and critiqued by the movement's
   leading, innovative thinkers? Eldridge Cleaver, author of Soul on Ice
   and Minister of Information in the Black Panther Party, is certainly
   such a thinker. Subsequently scorned or ignored, he sought to advance
   the African American struggle for liberty and equality by exposing
   gendered and sexualized structures of racial oppression. Cleaver chooses
   distinctive theoretical tools, a kind of queer classicism, engaging with
   Plato's Symposium and Republic as he develops new models for
   understanding the interdiction of black-white erotic relations, the
   policing of black masculinity, and the subordination of black persons
   within a racialized political order. Analyzing Cleaver's engagement with
   Plato equips us to recognize intersections of classical political theory
   and modern radical thought and activism, the limits of such engagements,
   and the challenges for political theory when the complex interstices of
   race, gender, sexuality, and classicism are interrogated.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL THOUGHT},

Volume = {5},

Pages = {1-25},

Abstract = {This essay locates the origins of American liberalism in the local
   politics of the early English empire. Maryland and its political discord
   in the seventeenth century provide a compelling case study of how
   imperial matters could affect politics on the local level. Settlers and
   colonial leaders in Maryland argued over how aristocratic or democratic
   the colony should be and placed those political preferences within the
   larger context of imperial success. This allowed English colonists to
   think about political power as a rightful benefit of their voluntary
   migration, which ushered into American politics a newly ambiguous and,
   at times, liberal treatment of self-interest. This article challenges
   the idea that the political thought in the colonies during this period
   was largely mimetic and reveals a distinct and polarized political
   discourse in North America as settlers mobilized the circumstances of
   colonization to challenge English norms.},

Abstract = {Governments may bargain with parties in parliament to silence them. This
   insight follows from the agenda-setting literature, which emphasises the
   power of the opposition to criticise the government. The literature on
   legislatures points to the fear of loss of future voter support as a
   motivation for majority building. However, it does not name factors that
   can cause such uncertainty. One such factor is opposition criticism.
   This article argues that majority building does not only involve an
   exchange of policy support; governments use legislative coalitions to
   dampen unwanted opposition blame. By offering the opposition noteworthy
   policy influence in legislative coalitions, governments avoid opposition
   criticism in return, in addition to having initiatives passed. In order
   to test this argument, a large dataset is compiled on opposition
   criticism in parliament and the media before and after the 325 bargained
   legislative agreements settled in Denmark from 1973 to 2003. It is found
   that such agreements are more likely amidst opposition criticism and
   that they dampen opposition criticism.},

Abstract = {Religion plays a prominent role in American politics, and candidates
   often attempt to display their religiousness in a variety of ways. For
   example, in spite of the association between conservatism and religion,
   research shows that candidates of both parties routinely use religious
   language and seek to demonstrate personal religiousness. Existing
   research portrays religious rhetoric primarily as an ideological cue,
   failing to explain why Democrats would make religious appeals. Drawing
   on psychological theories of prejudice toward atheists, we argue that
   candidates emphasize their religiousness in order to enhance perceptions
   of their trustworthiness and morality. Using survey data, we show that
   voters are quite unlikely to support an atheist candidate, an effect
   that is strongly driven by the perception of atheists' morality. Next,
   we show evidence that voters perceiving Hillary Clinton as religious
   also viewed her as more trustworthy, and were more likely to view her
   favorably. Finally, we show experimentally that religious candidates are
   perceived as more trustworthy, at least among a wide swath of the
   electorate. We conclude that displays of religiousness likely serve not
   only an ideological purpose but also the broader goal of increasing
   perceived candidate trustworthiness.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the revolving doors phenomenon in the European
   Union (EU). It proposes a management approach that treats this
   phenomenon as a form of corporate political activity through which
   companies try to gain access to decision makers. By using sequence
   analysis to examine the career paths of almost 300 EU affairs managers
   based in public and private companies across 26 countries, three
   different ideal-typical managers are identified: those EU affairs
   managers coming from EU institutions and public affairs; those who make
   a career through the private sector; and those who establish themselves
   in national political institutions. This identification confirms that EU
   institutions need different types of information and companies need EU
   affairs managers with different professional backgrounds able to provide
   it. Rather than observing a revolving door of EU officials into EU
   government affairs, what the authors term sliding doors' - namely the
   separation of careers, especially between the public and private sectors
   - is discerned.},

Abstract = {Definitions of democracy almost always refer to dimensions. An important
   question arises about the internal relationships between them. This
   article presents arguments in favor of the ideas of mutual reinforcement
   as well as of intrinsic tensions or trade-offs. A well-known example of
   these kinds of trade-offs is the complex relationship between liberty
   and equality. Surprisingly, trade-offs are not reported when measuring
   democracy. The article identifies the basic methodological problem and
   develops a new strategy for evaluating the indicators which makes
   trade-offs visible in the empirical research. The proposal combines two
   measurement strategies, arguing that in addition to established
   measurements of democracy, a further measurement to assess trade-offs
   should be employed.},

Abstract = {Previous research demonstrated that different contextual sources can
   affect voting behavior. Homogeneous familiar networks affect individual
   behavior of people embedded in these networks toward voting for certain
   parties. Moreover, being exposed to higher levels of homogeneity in the
   geographical place where one lives contributes to developing higher
   propensities to vote for a certain political object. By means of 2006
   National Italian Elections data (and by employing new measures of
   network political homogeneity), this paper tests, with multilevel
   models, the hypothesis according to which networks and geographical
   context interact while affecting individuals' voting behavior. Results
   confirm such a hypothesis, showing that familiar networks represent a
   `social bubble', which limits the likelihood of being affected by the
   broader context.},

Abstract = {Although post-communist party systems have shown signs of stabilisation
   in recent years, they are still susceptible to the emergence of new
   parties. Sikk (2012) and Sikk and Hanley (2014) have suggested that many
   of these challengers owe their success to a distinct winning formula,
   appealing to the public primarily on the basis of their newness' and
   antiestablishment credentials. However, to draw conclusions about the
   relative importance of newness in explaining the successes of these
   parties, it is necessary to understand the nature of their support among
   the electorate. Few empirical demand-side analyses of party support in
   the region explicitly address the newness thesis. This paper analyses
   support for Poland's Palikot Movement, a party which rose to prominence
   in 2011 and for whom newness constituted a significant aspect of its
   electoral appeal. It shows that while the Palikot Movement attracted
   voters who disliked the other parties, support for the party was more
   clearly attributable to its distinct ideological profile rather than its
   claim to represent those dissatisfied with the actions of the political
   establishment.},

Abstract = {Moises Ostrogorski once denounced political parties for burying diverse
   concerns of pluralistic societies under monolithic electoral options.
   E.E. Schattschneider celebrated them for the same reason: organizing
   choice and `responsible party government' amid pluralistic complexity.
   Comparativists have found both dynamics in European legislatures: most
   European parties exhibit the high average levels of voting unity that
   Schattschneider's theory implies, but also display rather Ostrogorskian
   cycles of discipline, stifling dissent on divisive issues at election
   time. We use comparativists' tools to explore the dynamics and normative
   quality of party unity in the different terrain of the US Congress. We
   find similar cycles of unity in roll-call voting, but in the American
   context - with more loosely organized parties, especially historically
   but still today - Ostrogorskian stifling of dissent operates against a
   less Schattschneiderian background. In comparative perspective,
   Congressional parties muffle divisive issues more effectively than they
   deliver governance, with tenuous implications for representation.},

Abstract = {This article examines interconnections between law, politics, and the
   quality of government in Africa. We investigate whether African
   democracies enjoy relatively better government quality (GQ) compared to
   their counterparts with more autocratic inclinations. The empirical
   evidence is based on instrumental variable two-stage least squares and
   fixed effects with data from 38 African countries for the period
   1994-2010. Political regimes of democracy, polity, and autocracy are
   instrumented with income levels, legal origins, religious dominations,
   and press freedom to account for the GQ dynamics of corruption control,
   government effectiveness, voice and accountability, political stability,
   regulation quality, and the rule of law. Findings show that democracy
   has an edge over autocracy while the latter and polity overlap. As a
   policy implication, democracy once initiated should be accelerated to
   edge the appeals of authoritarian regimes.},

Title = {Refugees welcome? A dataset on anti-refugee violence in Germany},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {The recent rise of xenophobic attacks against refugees in Germany has
   sparked both political and scholarly debates on the drivers, dynamics,
   and consequences of right-wing violence. Thus far, a lack of systematic
   data collection and data processing has inhibited quantitative analysis
   to help explain this current social phenomenon. This paper presents a
   georeferenced event dataset on anti-refugee violence and social unrest
   in Germany in 2014 and 2015 that is based on information collected by
   two civil society organizations, the Amadeu Antonio Foundation and PRO
   ASYL, who publicize their data in an online chronicle. We webscraped
   this information to create a scientifically usable dataset that includes
   information on 1 645 events of four different types of right-wing
   violence and social unrest: xenophobic demonstrations, assault, arson
   attacks, and miscellaneous attacks against refugee housing (such as
   swastika graffiti). After discussing how the dataset was constructed, we
   offer a descriptive analysis of patterns of right-wing violence and
   unrest in Germany in 2014 and 2015. This article concludes by outlining
   preliminary ideas on how the dataset can be used in future research of
   various disciplines in the social sciences.},

Journal = {PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS},

Abstract = {This comparative analysis investigates formal parliamentary bodies `for
   women' and informal networks and parliamentary groups ('gender equality
   bodies'). These are evaluated to determine the extent to which they
   contribute to a `good' collective process of women's substantive
   representation. Focusing on three countries, Belgium, the United Kingdom
   (UK) and New Zealand (NZ), we explore which venues are responsive to
   women and which are inclusive of a wide variety of claims. The UK and NZ
   cases score better than Belgiumon the responsiveness criterion given
   that linkage with the women's movement is more or less guaranteed while
   Belgium and the UK appear more promising on inclusiveness, predominantly
   because of their rules concerning the composition of the gender equality
   bodies. However, in none do the various bodies constitute a strong site
   for quality substantive representation of women (SRW). Rather, it
   appears SRW remains dependent on the role of critical actors.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {60},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1077-1092},

Abstract = {An influential literature argues that corruption behaves as a
   self-fulfilling prophecy. Its central claim is that the individual
   returns to corruption are a function of the perceived corruptibility of
   the other members of society. Empirically, this implies that if one were
   to exogenously increase beliefs about societal levels of corruption,
   willingness to engage in corruption should also increase. We evaluate
   this implication by utilizing an information experiment embedded in a
   large-scale household survey recently conducted in the Gran Area
   Metropolitana of Costa Rica. Changes in beliefs about corruption were
   induced via the random assignment of an informational display depicting
   the increasing percentage of Costa Ricans who have personally witnessed
   an act of corruption. Consistent with the self-fulfilling prophecy
   hypothesis, we find that internalizing the information from the display
   on average increased the probability that a respondent would be willing
   to bribe a police officer by approximately .05 to .10.},

Abstract = {Three of our arguments drew no objection from Dr. Koza. One is that
   plurality rulethe heart of his proposed reformcan be anti-majoritarian.
   In our three-candidate example, Libby was the plurality favorite but
   Maude beat each of her rivals, Libby included, by a majority. A
   plurality can be a majority, of course, but the Electoral College has
   never reversed a popular majority.},

Abstract = {Does exposure to political violence prompt civilians to support peace?
   We investigate the determinants of civilian attitudes toward peace
   during ongoing conflict using two original panel datasets representing
   Israelis (n=996) and Palestinians in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and
   Gaza (n=631) (149 communities in total). A multi-group estimation
   analysis shows that individual-level exposure to terrorism and political
   violence makes the subject populations less likely to support peace
   efforts. The findings also confirm psychological distress and threat
   perceptions as the mechanism that bridges exposure to violence and
   greater militancy over time. The study breaks ground in showing that
   individual-level exposure - necessarily accompanied by psychological
   distress and threat perceptions - is key to understanding civilians'
   refusal to compromise in prolonged conflict.},

Abstract = {Ideal point estimation in political science usually aims to reduce a
   matrix of votes to a small number of preference dimensions. We argue
   that taking a nonparametric perspective can yield measures that are more
   useful for some subsequent analyses. We propose a conditional
   autoregressive preference measurement model, which we use to generate
   case-specific preference estimates for US Supreme Court justices from
   1946 to 2005. We show that the varying relative legal positions taken by
   justices across areas of law condition the opinion assignment strategy
   of the chief justice and the decisions of all justices as to whether to
   join the majority opinion. Unlike previous analyses that have made
   similar claims, using case-specific preference estimates enables us to
   hold constant the justices involved, providing stronger evidence that
   justices are strategically responsive to each others' relative positions
   on a case-by-case basis rather than simply their identities or average
   relative preferences.},

Abstract = {In the past, feminist scholarship was often highly sceptical of
   institution-building within existing political and governance
   institutions. This may have contributed to a neglect of the new
   phenomenon of specialised parliamentary bodies with a gender equality
   remit. This article explores whether such parliamentary bodies can be an
   effective means of promoting the substantive representation of women and
   whether they can be understood as part of the diverse repertoire of

Abstract = {The 2016 Republican Party presidential primary debates were
   unprecedented in the amount of media and public interest they generated.
   Substantially driven by curiosity about reality television celebrity
   Donald Trump, the initial debates hosted by FOX News and CNN both
   reflected and validated interest in his candidacy while proffering
   attention to a full slate of more traditional presidential contenders in
   front of boisterous audiences. This study considers these audiences'
   response. Whether applause, laughter, booing, or combinations thereof,
   these group utterances provide a reliable metric by which insights may
   be derived concerning partisan attitudes towards Trump and the other
   candidates, as well as the unity of the Republican Party. Findings
   suggest that the debate setting in concert with the demographics of the
   in-person audience may well have influenced initial response to the
   candidates and as a result have subtle yet lingering consequences for
   the 2016 presidential election.},

Abstract = {This paper draws upon the capability approach and critical pedagogy to
   analyse the value of using Problem-posing Education, a participatory
   action research method, in a digital inclusion initiative in Brazil.
   First it the capability approach and explains why using critical
   pedagogy is a valuable way to deal with issues of power, collective
   conscientisation and adaptive preference. Freire's pedagogy is then
   presented and conscientisation is explained as a process of raising
   critical awareness and praxis. The case study, presents empirical work
   conducted in Campinas, together with a NGO named CDI, which offers free
   internet access and basic ICT skills using a Freire's inspired
   methodology. Findings are then explained and discussed using the
   theoretical framework. This paper concludes that there is great value in
   using Freire's critical pedagogy for digital inclusion, but that further
   research is necessary to identify less resource intense solutions that
   can provide students with both conscientisation and skills.},

Abstract = {As a conservative philosopher, Leo Strauss reconsiders and criticizes
   modern political thought methodologically and epistemologically, in that
   he believes it has faced crises leading history of philosophical
   thinking to deviate. To put simply, Strauss claims that the major part
   of critical thinking arisen in the West is the by-product of the modern
   political thought. According to this, the present paper reviews
   Strauss's critique of modern political thought, putting the question
   ``what kind of insights and enlightenments does Strauss' critique of
   modern political thought encompass?{''} As a finding of the research, we
   can hold that Strauss attempted to show that methodology of historical
   and epistemology of relativism governing modern political thought
   disregard trans-spatial and timeless principles of natural law; as a
   result, it substitutes suspicion for real knowledge and certainty. Thus,
   it encourages nihilism; on the one hand, it introduces any form of
   autonomous agreement by human beings as fair right, as it neglects
   universal morality on the other hand, turning it to the matter of
   validity. Therefore, it resorts to irresponsibility, and eventually
   introduces human reason as the only instrumental benchmark for living
   rules, which in turn encompasses the emergence of totalitarianism. The
   method of the research is an analytical-descriptive method.},

Abstract = {Selection and separation of inheritance has the desired characteristics
   of plants, animals and organisms have specific morphological
   characteristics and called them in terms of biotechnology. Including
   applications help farmers to reduce the amount of fertilizers, chemical
   pesticides, water and fuel consumption for the production of food As
   well as biotechnological products can be used for purification and
   cleansing the environment and food production at lower costs and reduce
   the use of harmful chemicals to human health and the environment.
   However, criticism has been leveled on biotechnology, for example,
   genetically modified organisms, unlike chemicals, have a risk of spread
   and replication capabilities and unknown toxins may be produced by
   biotechnological products or reduce biodiversity, genetic contamination
   and poisoning and destroy beneficial insects harmless. This article, in
   addition to addressing various aspects of biotechnology, seeking to
   assess the strengths and limitations of current international law and
   structures designed to address these concerns communities. Biotechnology
   problems at the international level and treaties related to each of them
   are as follows: A) Concerns about patent genetically modified crops:
   National rules developed countries, genetically modified crops have to
   support intellectual property. If to be biotech crops intellectual
   property rights, the bulk of the food of world award to several
   capitalist companies. B) Concerns about Transparency Regarding Exports
   of Genetically Modified Products: Notification of genetically modified
   content could be achieved through a labeling system C) Liability for
   damage caused by genetically modified imported products: The
   international community have tried to establish international rules on
   liability and compensation for damage caused by genetically modified
   crops that in the Biosafety Protocol, the provisions limiting the
   harmful effects caused by genetically modified organisms. D) Liability
   of Trans boundary damage caused by genetically modified crops:
   Genetically modified crops could have a negative impact on the
   environment of neighboring states, even if completely in a state of
   production and consumption. After careful consideration of the above it
   can be concluded that there is not a single treaty regime and specific
   concerns to address the biotechnology. But we are faced to fragmented
   and conflicting network of treaties relating to intellectual property,
   trade and the environment, as well as a series of general principles of
   law and legal norms ambiguous.},

Abstract = {The 2016 G20 Summit in Hangzhou takes place within a tense global
   political context. The outcome of the UK Brexit referendum in June
   revealed the deep divide between the politics of competitive nationalism
   and the commitment to international cooperation. It also reflected the
   depth of public reaction to global economic integration and the absence
   of response to public anxieties about social well-being and
   environmental sustainability from the political middle in many
   countries. China's hosting of the G20 Summit presents an opportunity to
   turn a corner in global summitry by strengthening global leadership at
   this critical juncture, while China's ability to do so depends on the
   willingness of other G20 members to comprehensively address public
   anxieties. The UN 2030 Agenda and the Paris Climate Agreement, both
   reached in 2015, do provide political and policy answers to the public
   anxieties. The question is the effectiveness of the initiatives
   governments are taking to implement them, which could be framed together
   to achieve sustainability for all in the face of serious, demonstrable
   systemic risks. Many governments may resist this level of ambition and
   prefer to strike a lower profile as the world shifts its focus from goal
   setting in 2015 to goal implementation in 2016. Yet even with this less
   ambitious approach, there are ways that G20 countries can initiate
   processes that engage stakeholders in envisioning the future and
   developing alternative approaches and pathways to move their nations
   toward where they need to be by 2030 in terms of social, economic, and
   environmental sustainability. As people-centered and planet-centered
   agendas, the sustainable development goals (SDGs) set in the UN 2030
   Agenda and the Paris Climate Agreement have the policy content necessary
   to provide hope and direction for anxious publics. Similarly, it is
   hopeful that G20 leaders can develop narratives and define commitments
   to address the economic insecurity of their people and in the meantime
   strengthen the G20's role in global governance.},

Abstract = {While analysis of the relationship between the descriptive and
   substantive representation of women has mainly focused on women
   politicians as critical actors in many contexts political parties
   provide the linkage between voters' preferences and policy programmes.
   The manner in which political parties respond to women voters is shaped
   by both the information they receive about women voters' preferences,
   from the news media, pollsters and other sources, and by gendered party
   type. Analysis of parties' attempts to target women voters can help us
   understand whether parties perceive women as typical or average voters.
   I conduct two case studies on the influence of gendered newsframes on
   party policy and inter-party competition in the United States and Great
   Britain to formulate a preliminary analytic framework designed to
   facilitate research to assess how parties' responses to portrayals of
   women voters vary according to institutional and contextual factors
   across time and space.},

Abstract = {Most political scientists regard parliamentary committees as one of the
   most successful aspects of parliamentary business, where MPs of all
   persuasions come together to analyse and investigate issues of public
   policy and governance. Whilst their recommendations are not always
   implemented, they do play a major role in informing parliamentary
   debates. Amongst the public however, the work of parliamentary
   committees remains unrecognised and underappreciated. Utilising a pilot
   study of Western Australian parliamentary committees, this paper looks
   at how these committees go about seeking public input into their
   inquiries, and whether they plan to broaden their methods of
   communicating with the public in the future. This analysis is placed in
   the context of evidence at the Commonwealth level in Australia, along
   with ideas from other jurisdictions internationally.},

Abstract = {What explains the social policy profile of populist radical right
   parties (PRRPs)? Building on the argument made by Mudde (2007) that
   socio-economic policies are secondary elements within the populist
   radical right ideology, this paper conjectures that the primary elements
   of that ideology (nativism, authoritarianism, and populism) structure
   the PRRP's attitudes in the social policy domain. Based on a discussion
   of the PRRP's core ideology a number of expectations are derived as to
   which groups should be viewed as deserving or undeserving of support.
   These expectations are examined through an analysis of the social
   policies put forward in the election manifestos of the Austrian Freedom
   Party (FPo) between 1983 and 2013. The analysis confirms most of the
   expectations and highlights an important shift in the FPo's social
   policy agenda, from welfare populist arguments and some retrenchment
   proposals under Jorg Haider to strong welfare chauvinism after the
   leadership change in 2005.},

Abstract = {The recent finding that right-wing parties increasingly make efforts to
   integrate women's concerns raises questions as to whether ideology still
   counts as a reliable indicator for women's substantive representation
   and how different party contexts shape opportunities for the
   articulation of women's interests. This article therefore critically
   reassesses how ideology defines the opportunities for women's
   substantive representation, based on a comparative study of legislators'
   acting on behalf of women in 14 European countries. We argue that
   ideology still offers an important explanation for women's substantive
   representation, but that the link between the two should be
   conceptualized as complex rather than straightforward. The role of
   ideology is best understood if scholars (1) adopt an understanding of
   ideology' that allows for more variation and is conceptually different
   from party', (2) differentiate between gendered interests and feminist
   interests and (3) understand the impact of ideology as both direct and
   mediated.},

   branches. If there is a contract between two or more persons and one of
   them committed a breach of contract (failure to perform, delay in

   and should the contract have contractual liability for damages cope.
   Where does harm to another person without a contract exists between them
   or if there is a contract, Inflict losses not related to the contract,
   the talk of non-contractual liability.
   About whether contractual and non-contractual obligations is two
   different legal system or single legal system form, there is
   disagreement among the lawyers: Some distinguish these two systems from
   each other. But others believe that because the purpose of civil
   liability is to compensate for losses, these two are the single legal
   system.
   By examining the different opinions, we see that both contractual and
   non-contractual liability system distinct from each other. And despite
   the contract, the victim can rely on the rules of non-contractual
   liability.},

Abstract = {Can states make credible commitments to respect concessions they make as
   part of national reunification agreements? German leaders negotiating
   reunification in 1990 had to reconcile West Germany's more restrictive
   abortion policy with East Germany's more permissive one, and agreed in
   1990 to a compromise that seemed to preserve first-trimester abortion on
   demand in the Eastern states. By 1993, however, that compromise had been
   undone and the formerly West German policy prevailed throughout the
   country. This history challenges the theory that commitments made by
   democratic regimes are credible, especially since there were a number of
   international and domestic factors present in this case that other
   scholars have identified as enhancing credibility. We investigate the
   trajectory of unification-era German abortion policy and make two
   arguments: the decision by West German leaders to undo their earlier
   concessions was conscious rather than accidental, and despite Western
   attempts to reach a compromise that Easterners would see as credible the
   prevailing view in the East during the negotiations was that the Western
   commitment was uncertain at best. We conclude with some broader
   speculation about reunification, and suggest that promises made by a
   larger partner during negotiations over national reunification have
   inherent credibility problems that democratic institutions cannot by
   themselves solve. This implies that future reunifications, for example
   between North and South Korea or China and Taiwan, may be even more
   difficult to negotiate than currently recognized.},

Abstract = {This article engages with radical critiques of the Eurocentric grammar
   of development discourses. I start from a position of considerable
   sympathy with their appreciation of the discursive dimensions of power
   that attach to the idiom of development and their solidarity with the
   oppositional projects of subaltern groups. However, this sympathy
   combines with a considerable degree of disagreement in terms of how the
   discursive power of development is understood and how the dynamics of
   popular resistance are theorised. As an alternative to the relatively
   crude postulation of development as a discursive regime that enables the
   West to exercise power over the Rest, I develop an argument that
   emphasises the multivalent character of the idiom of development and
   trace this multivalence to situated contestations that take place
   between opposing political projects that strive to shape the form and
   direction of social change in specific ways. Furthermore, I will argue
   that this contentious dynamic becomes particularly evident in those
   world-historical conjunctures when subaltern groups mobilize around
   social movement projects that destabilise hegemonic power relations in
   the capitalist world-system. To illustrate this point, I will provide a
   broad-brushed outline of three distinct `development regimes' that have
   shaped North-South relations from the late nineteenth to the early
   twenty-first century and discuss the ways in which these regimes have
   been destabilised by the articulation of oppositional meanings of
   development articulated from below by progressive social movement
   projects. Finally, I draw on my own fieldwork experiences to reflect on
   how critical scholars can engage with movement projects that challenge
   the dominant directions and meanings of development in ways that can
   contribute to democratic deliberations within social movements.},

Abstract = {The complex composition of the Australian Senate, along with the
   relative influence of micro-parties on legislative outcomes, has
   recently resulted in renewed major party calls for electoral reform.
   However, government majority to pass legislation through both houses of
   parliament without negotiation with smaller parties or independents has
   been rare in Australia over the last three decades. What then is the
   view of those outside of the leadership but inside of the legislature in
   relation to minority arrangements? This paper interviews experienced
   parliamentarians from across the political spectrum about their views on
   minority government and democracy in Australia. Hence, the paper
   provides suggestions on what it takes to make minority government work,
   as well as views on the urgency for electoral reform. In doing so, it
   also reveals varied interpretations of the relationship between the
   executive and the parliament within the Westminster model. Such insights
   will be of interest to both those working within parliament, those
   pursuing parliamentary reform and those seeking a more thorough
   understanding of minority government in Australia and other Commonwealth
   nations.},

Abstract = {This essay aims to investigate the reasons of the allegedly late
   reception of Justus Lipsius's political thought in Counter-Reformation
   Italy. The efficacy of censorship in Catholic countries after the
   Council of Trent, together with the Church's distrust of pagan Stoicism
   and the anti-Machiavellianism that was taking hold in the 1590s, do not
   alone support the assumption of a lack of interest in Lipsius's
   political thought within the Italian cultural and publishing milieu. The
   contribution provides a short overview of both the publishers and
   booksellers, as well as the authors and editors, involved in the
   printing venture of Lipsius's political works in Italian translations in
   order to demonstrate that their reputation, literary distinction as well
   as their production in terms of both quantity and quality is far from
   being insignificant.},

Abstract = {Much like Iran's nuclear program, scholars and policy makers are largely
   puzzled to understand Iran's intentions in developing its ballistic
   missile program. The aim of this study is to understand Iran's
   objectives in developing its ballistic missiles arsenal. To fulfill this
   objective, the article reviews the entire history of Iran's ballistic
   missile program. It hypothesizes that just like its nuclear program,
   Iran developed its ballistic missiles arsenal as a strategy of
   deterrence, a response to Iraq's invasion and Washington's policy of
   containment. The second hypothesis held that Iran's determination to
   continue developing its ballistic missile program might be an attempt to
   dissuade its rivals from exercising power in the Middle East.},

Abstract = {The UK's relationship with the European Union (EU) has long been
   fraught, creating tensions with European partners and dividing the main
   political parties. To try to overcome internal divisions in the Labour
   Party, Harold Wilson sought to renegotiate the UK's terms of membership
   and then held a referendum on whether the country should stay in. The
   result - a two to one majority in favour of remaining - was thought to
   have ended the question marks over British membership definitively. Four
   decades later, it was the Conservatives who were divided over Europe and
   Prime Minister David Cameron, in what appeared to be almost a carbon
   copy of Wilson's actions, promising reform, renegotiation and a
   referendum. Yet the stakes in 2016 were rather higher than in 1975 and
   the challenges far greater - the more multi-faceted and
   institutionalised nature of the EU rendered the debate, and the
   potential costs and benefits, more complex. This article assesses the
   similarities betiveen the two prime ministers' decisions to renegotiate
   the UK's terms of membership and the frameworks established for the
   ensuing referendums and notes significant differences that render
   over-interpreting the parallels a risky business.},

Abstract = {Do state-level exams in civics have a positive impact on young people's
   civic knowledge? We hypothesize that civics exams have the biggest
   effect in states where they are a requirement for high school
   graduation-the incentive hypothesis. We further hypothesize that civics
   requirements have the biggest effect on young people with less exposure
   to information about the US. political system at home, specifically
   Latinos and, especially, immigrants-the compensation hypothesis. We test
   these hypotheses with the 2006 and 2010 National Assessment of
   Educational Progress (NAEP) civics test administered to high school
   students, and with a large national survey of 18-24 year-olds. Across
   the two datasets, we find modest support for the incentive hypothesis
   and strong support for the compensation hypothesis.},

Abstract = {The early modern revolution in political philosophy not only transformed
   political philosophy itself; it also played a crucial role in shaping
   the character of modern politics. This article contributes to our
   understanding of that revolution through an examination of Thomas
   Hobbes's critique of the classical tradition. Although it is well known
   that Hobbes was a critic of that tradition, the details of his critique
   have not been sufficiently uncovered. Hobbes's key target was Aristotle,
   whom he regarded as the most important source of the tradition he
   opposed. Hobbes's critique of Aristotle consists of two main lines of
   argument-one moral-political, the other metaphysical-that ultimately
   prove to be connected. An examination of Hobbes's twofold critique can
   help us understand what was at stake in the reorientation of political
   philosophy that eventually gave rise to modern liberalism.},

Abstract = {``Imprisonment{''} is one the main penalties currently applied in all
   legal systems of the world. This penalty, as well as other penal
   institutions, has undergone many changes throughout history and has been
   evolved by several reforms to turn into its present form. However,
   imprisonment system has not moved towards its goals - which are
   ``punishment{''}, ``intimidation{''} and ``rehabilitation{''}. Also it
   has adverse effects and serious damages for the society, including the
   impact of prison on recidivism.
   Serious attention to the problems arisen from prison is a critical and
   essential issue that requires cooperation and coordination of triple
   forces and community as well as the prisoners themselves. It is not a
   unilateral issue which involves the prisoner community at all, but its
   major victim is society where recidivism disturb the peace, order and
   security. Thus, the goal of all criminal systems in recent years was
   reducing the resort to this punishment and eliminate its adverse effects
   and also passing several rules, regulations and bylaws or holding
   numerous conferences and training workshops at national and
   international level. In order to achieve this purpose rules and
   providing different solutions are imposed.},

Abstract = {One long-recognized consequence of the tension between popular
   sovereignty and democratic values like liberty and equality is public
   opinion backlash, which occurs when individuals recoil in response to
   some salient event. For decades, scholars have suggested that opinion
   backlash impedes policy gains by marginalized groups. Public opinion
   research, however, suggests that widespread attitude change that
   backlash proponents theorize is likely to be rare. Examining backlash
   against gays and lesbians using a series of online and natural
   experiments about marriage equality, and large-sample survey data, we
   find no evidence of opinion backlash among the general public, by
   members of groups predisposed to dislike gays and lesbians, or from
   those with psychological traits that may predispose them to lash back.
   The important implication is that groups pursuing rights should not be
   dissuaded by threats of backlash that will set their movement back in
   the court of public opinion.},

Abstract = {Deception is a strategy that has been widely used in cyber conflicts.
   How to detect deception in a timely manner is always a challenge,
   especially for a cyber commander who is at the point of making decisions
   with respect to the actual target to go after, the exact location of the
   target, the starting and ending time of a cyber operation, the type of
   cyber operation, the way of launching the cyber operation, and the
   amount of resources and support needed. It is absolutely important for a
   cyber commander to know for sure that he/she is not deceived by an
   adversary so he/she will be able to make right decisions. Varied
   solutions do exist. However, they are either too narrow or too broad.
   The solutions represented by signature technology are narrow in scope,
   so that they are not capable of dealing with the deception that they
   have not handled before. The solutions represented by behavioral
   analysis are relatively broad, so that they require extra time to
   re-adjust their focuses, incorporate contextual information, and combine
   heterogeneous data resources in order to get to what is exactly needed.
   In addition, the use of contexts in analysis is at random and not in a
   systematic way in most cases. Even when contexts are included in
   analysis, their relations with the relevant events are not well explored
   in all these solutions. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
   new strategic and systematic solution applying the Operational-Level
   Cybersecurity Strategy Formation Framework. This new solution employs
   purpose analysis, contextual analysis, and risk analysis. A case study
   is provided to test the effectiveness of this solution in detecting
   deception in a timely manner. The benefits and limitations of this
   solution are discussed. The capabilities of the Operational-Level
   Cybersecurity Strategy Formation Framework are evidently proved via this
   use case.},

Abstract = {While most research on the e-diaspora focuses on connections within
   heterosexual families and communities, this paper explores the
   transnational connections and digital media uses of LGBTQ migrants.
   Based on semi-structured interviews with 23 LGBTQs living in Belgium,
   two groups are distinguished: voluntary migrants, who chose to move, and
   forced migrants, who (felt they) had to leave their country because of
   their sexual orientation. Comparing their familial and ethno-cultural
   connections, it becomes clear that both groups-for varying reasons and
   to varying degrees-feel disconnected from their countries of origin,
   families, and ethno-cultural communities in Belgium. For all
   participants, digital media are a key tool to maintain some connections,
   but particularly for the forced migrants `context collapse' on social
   media leads to a sense of insecurity. Overall, this research illustrates
   the importance of intersecting variables in research on the e-diaspora,
   as well as the impact of `offline' legal and material conditions on
   online media uses.},

Abstract = {In this article, the censorship against the Chilean working-class press
   in Chile between 1919 and 1925 will be analyzed in the context of the
   social question, the crisis of the oligarchy and the reconfiguration of
   the reppressive branch of the State. We consider as a hypothesis that
   governments favored the administrative-police censorship over judicial
   censorship, seeing the current legislation as insufficient in controling
   these media characterized as being ``subversive{''}. For this reason, in
   this time, it was built this way to create regulations that established
   controls and prohibitions unknown until then. To explain the censorship
   mechanics, we will focus on the procedures, agents and promoters of said
   censorship and the defense of freedom of expression carried out by the
   working-class press and we have used as sources the working-class and
   latest press, the parliamentary debate, the sentences, and the
   government files.},

Abstract = {According to freedom of will, people are responsible for what they do
   and due to this principle, they would be punished. However, whenever
   human's will is distorted for some reason, punishment would be null and
   void. One of these reasons that can distort individual will is the
   principle of duress that is discussed in Imami Jurisprudence and Islamic
   Penal Code several times. Hence, almost in all crimes that their
   penalties are codified in Islamic Penal Code, duress can cause
   disclaimer of the coercer; unless about duress in murder. Although there
   are many disputes among jurists on retaliation or lack of retaliation
   for this crime, opinion of majority of jurists on acceptance of
   retaliation is accepted by the legislator. About other crimes like
   duress in adultery and sodomy, the coercer would be disclaimed; unless
   in cases that the criminal claims for coercion. In this case, legislator
   accepts principle of lack of duress and makes the court responsible for
   investigations. However, in Imami jurisprudence, the sentence would be
   issued for disclaimer of the coercer immediately after creation of doubt
   for judge and in case of probability of accuracy of claim.},

Abstract = {Women's organisations can help address some specific challenges faced by
   different groups of women during the political recruitment process. This
   article explores whether US and UK organisations do so. Legislative
   composition analysis confirms women of colour are under-represented,

   with disabilities are under-represented in both countries, along with
   younger women in the USA and older women in the UK. Interviews with US
   women's organisations reveal a greater attention to diversity,
   particularly with regard to women of colour; however, the focus remains
   on increasing the overall number of women in both countries.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes, from a multi-dimensional point of view, the
   elements on which the concept of security in Colombia has been
   articulated in the last decade. Study the policy of Democratic Security
   of Alvaro Uribe Velez (2002-2010) and the policy of Democratic
   Prosperity of Juan Manuel Santos (2010-2014) from a socio-political
   perspective. Although both policies share military elements, each one
   aims to consolidate a different political country project. The first one
   relates to rebuild a country based on a Security State and on an

Abstract = {Legislative defection in political systems characterized by party
   dominance and cartelization is usually seen as damaging the members of
   parliament's (MPs') careers. Switching legislators does not portray an
   image of confidence and reliability and the MPs' re-election is
   unlikely. Drawing on a dataset that includes all defector MPs in
   post-communist Romania until 2008, this article indicates that one in
   five defectors gets re-elected. The quest for explanations focuses on
   individual and party features. Results indicate that re-election of
   defectors is a function of the strategic behavior (the choice of the
   destination party) and the legislative experience of the defector. All
   these items count against party and legislative activity.},

Abstract = {Past cyber-attacks on Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
   Systems for Critical infrastructures have left these systems compromised
   and caused financial and economic problems. Deliberate attacks have
   resulted in denial of services and physical injury to the public in
   certain cases. This study explores the past attacks on SCADA Systems by
   examining nine case studies across multiple utility sectors including
   transport, energy and water and sewage sector. These case studies will
   be further analysed according to the cyber-terrorist decision-making
   theories including strategic, organisational and psychological theories
   based on McCormick (2000). Next, this study will look into
   cyber-terrorist capabilities in conducting attacks according to Nelson's
   (1999) approach that includes simple-unstructured, advance-structured
   and complex-coordinated capabilities. The results of this study will
   form the basis of a guideline that organisations can use so that they
   are better prepared in identifying potential future cybersecurity
   attacks on their SCADA systems.},

Abstract = {Concern that donations to political campaigns secure preferential
   treatment from policy makers has long occupied judges, scholars, and the
   public. However, the effects of contributions on policy makers' behavior
   are notoriously difficult to assess. We present the first randomized
   field experiment on the topic. The experiment focuses on whether
   contributions facilitate access to influential policy makers. In the
   experiment, a political organization attempted to schedule meetings
   between 191 congressional offices and the organization's members in
   their districts who were campaign donors. However, the organization
   randomly assigned whether it revealed to congressional offices that
   prospective attendees had contributed to campaigns. When informed
   prospective attendees were political donors, senior policy makers made
   themselves available between three and four times more often. These
   findings underscore concerns about the Supreme Court's recent decisions
   deregulating campaign finance.},

Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ESTUDOS POLITICOS},

Volume = {113},

Abstract = {Martin Heidegger, one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th
   century, is a theoretical reference of an increasing number of authors
   in Brazil's legal doctrine, especially in the field of hermeneutics,
   interpretation and application of the law. These contributions, however,
   hardly deal with the objections that have been directed against
   Heidegger's ideas and theories. This article aims to introduce the basic
   lines of the German philosopher's works on hermeneutics and language. We
   will see that his use of language, which is full of mystic and poetic
   elements, already has been criticized heavily by several authors, who
   question their consistency and usefulness for the confrontation of
   theoretical and practical problems. In fact, Heidegger's ideas about
   hermeneutics in the area of law lead to an overvaluation of
   understanding to the detriment of explanation and argumentation. His
   idiomatic creations go beyond the standards of rationality, reflecting a
   rather subjective experience. At the same time, his ``hermeneutics of
   facticity{''} can hardly be exploited in the legal sphere, where
   rational communication should prevail to enable a better understanding
   of the key elements of law interpretation, allowing even its criticism
   and its control.},

Abstract = {Over the past half century no judicial politics scholar has been more
   respected or influential than Martin Shapiro. Yet it is hard to identify
   a school of thought one could call ``Shapiroism.{''} Rather than offer
   convenient methodologies or grand theories, Shapiro provides rich
   empirical studies that show us how to think about the relationship
   between law and courts on the one hand and politics and governing on the
   other. Three key themes run through Shapiro's impressive oevre. First,
   rather than study courts in isolation, political scientists should view
   them as ``one government agency among many,{''} and seek to `` integrate
   the judicial system in the matrix of government and politics in which it
   actually operates.{''} Law professors may understand legal doctrines
   better than political scientists, but we know (or should know) the rest
   of the political system better than they do. Second, although judges
   inevitably make political decisions, their institutional environment
   leads them to act differently from other public officials. Most
   importantly, their legitimacy rests on their perceived impartiality
   within the plaintiff-defendant-judge triad. The conflict between judges'
   role as impartial arbiter and enforcer of the laws of the regime can
   never be completely resolved and places powerful constraints on their
   actions. Third, the best way to understand the complex relationship
   between courts and other elements of the regime is comparative analysis.
   Shapiro played a major role in resuscitating comparative law, especially
   in his work comparing the US and the EU. All this he did with a rare
   combination of thick description and crisp, jargon-free analysis,
   certainly a rarity the political science of our time.},

Abstract = {Even twenty years after the downfall of communism, coalition formation
   in the post-communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and
   in Western European democracies differs. Contrary to expectations, in
   many countries, the communist past continues to play a pivotal role.
   There is, however, remarkable variation between CEE countries. While
   communist successor parties do not appear to play a special role due to
   their past in Hungary and Slovakia, they still face constraints in
   Poland and the Czech Republic. These differences are driven by a
   sequential logic that continues to reproduce the coalition patterns of
   the 1990s. These patterns depend on the extent of the conflict between
   former communist rulers and the opposition (regime divide).},

Abstract = {Over the last more than two decades, political parties and governments
   across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have adopted electoral gender quotas for
   parliament at an astonishing rate - and with remarkable success as many
   sub-Saharan African countries have catapulted to the top in terms of
   women's representation in a single or lower house of parliament. During
   a first wave in East and Southern Africa (part of a global second wave),
   quotas were adopted in the aftermath of conflicts and in the course of
   political transitions as mobilized national women's movements,
   influenced by an international women's movement and international norms,
   took advantage of political openings to press for the adoption of quotas
   through new constitutions or new electoral laws. In some cases a clear
   diffusion effect was at play between political movements that closely
   influenced one another and across national borders. During a second wave
   mostly, though not only, in West Africa (part of a global third wave),
   quotas are again being adopted as women's movements, in collaboration
   with regional, continental, and international organizations, similarly
   press for an increased representation of women during constitutional
   reform processes or through revisions to electoral laws. During this
   second wave in SSA, women activists and governments have sought to
   strengthen existing electoral gender quotas or adopt them for the first
   time - going as far as seeking gender parity in a handful of cases. In
   most ways, SSA conforms to international trends in second and third wave
   quota adoption, though not without some regional variation. This article
   explores some of the ways in which the sub-Saharan African experience
   has been distinctive - focusing on the adoption of parity quotas in
   Senegal, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe - and some of the remaining challenges
   affecting the adoption and implementation of electoral gender quotas
   across the continent.},

Abstract = {This paper draws from contemporary psychoanalytic theory as well as
   nineteenth-century crowd theory to critique Louis Althusser's account of
   the ideological interpellation of the subject. I argue that rather than
   ideology interpellating the individual as a subject, bourgeois ideology
   interpellates the subject as an individual. By bourgeois ideology I mean
   the loose set of ideas and apparatuses associated with European
   modernity, an instrumental concept of reason, and the emergence of the
   capitalist mode of production. The advantage of reversing the
   Althusserian account is that the subject is not pre-constrained to the
   individual form, a form that is itself always already as failing and
   impossible as it is assumed and demanded. In Althusser's version, the
   individuality that emerges in history is posited as universal, a given.
   In mine, the individual form is itself the problem; it's a coercive and
   unstable product of the enclosure of the common in never-ceasing efforts
   to repress, deny, and foreclose collective political subjectivity. The
   individual is thus a form of capture. Rather than natural or given, the
   individual form encloses into a singular bounded body collective bodies,
   ideas, affects, desires, and drives. There is nothing necessary about
   the link between subjectivity and individuality; it is an effect
   contingent to the array of processes that converge into bourgeois
   modernity.},

Abstract = {A growing body of literature has emerged that examines the contributions
   of mid-level institutions of accountability ( e. g., public ministries,
   federal police, and electoral courts) in curbing corruption. Notably
   absent here is the Defensor del Pueblo ( ombudsman). This study posits
   that, under the right conditions, these nonsanctioning bodies have
   several tools at their disposal that can be leveraged against state
   actors to reduce corruption. The ombudsman's unique links to the public
   ( or principal) and external actors allow it to function like a ``fourth
   estate,{''} but the strength of the office to act as an effective
   deterrent to corruption is endogenous to the system and actors that
   created this office. This study conducts a two-stage least squares
   regression analysis for 17 Latin American countries ( 2000-2011),
   provides support for these expectations, and suggests that the ombudsman
   is beginning to deliver on its promise, at least with respect to
   corruption.},

Abstract = {Intense partisan conflict characterized the Affordable Care Act's
   passage and continues to influence its implementation. The Act granted
   state officials significant discretionary authority over the
   implementation of health insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion.
   Decisions by state officials vary from full state involvement to partial
   involvement to refusal to administer a state health exchange or expand
   Medicaid. The federal government administers a health exchange in those
   states choosing not to operate an exchange. The article examines whether
   variation in state program choices affects citizen decisions to enroll
   in an exchange. Also examined is whether health insurance premiums vary
   by which level of government administers the exchange. The analysis
   provides evidence that the Act's goals of increased enrollment in health
   insurance and affordable premiums are influenced by state government
   decisions on the extent of state involvement in health exchanges and
   Medicaid expansion.},

Abstract = {Research focusing on the relationship between the economy and
   satisfaction with democracy often presents mixed results. This article
   argues that this uncertainty is mainly due to model specification,
   number of surveys and measurement. After discussing why the role of the
   economy should not be overlooked, by using an empirical strategy that
   applies Bayesian cross-classified mixed models to 572 national surveys
   in 28 European countries from 1973 to 2013 drawn from the Eurobarometer,
   it is shown that objective macro-economic indicators and a subjective
   indicator seem to substantially affect citizens' satisfaction with
   democracy in Europe. The findings are robust when controlling for
   various institutional and political variables and using alternative
   model specifications. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Researchers have long studied the underpinnings of voter perceptions of
   national economic conditions. Of growing interest though, is the effect
   of local economic evaluations on approval and voting behavior. Even
   though individuals engage more directly with the local economy than with
   that of the nation, perceptions of local conditions are colored as much
   by individual attitudes and demographics as by objective measures.
   Metropolitan area unemployment rates strongly predict local evaluations,
   but so do education, age, sex, and political attitudes. Of particular
   interest, even controlling for objective conditions, support for the Tea
   Party strongly predicts more negative evaluations and overpowers most
   other sources of bias. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Scholars have reached mixed conclusions about the implications of
   increased political polarization for citizen decision-making. In this
   paper, we argue that citizens respond to ideological divergence with
   heightened affective polarization. Using a survey experiment conducted
   with a nationally representative sample of U.S. citizens, we find that
   increased ideological differences between political figures produce
   increasingly polarized affective evaluations, and that these differences
   are especially large among respondents with stronger ideological
   commitments and higher levels of political interest. We provide further
   support for these findings in an observational study of citizens'
   evaluations of the U.S. Senators from their state. We also find that the
   polarizing effects of ideological differences can be largely mitigated
   with biographical information about the public officials, which suggests
   that the pernicious consequences of ideological polarization can be
   overcome by focusing on matters other than political disagreement.},

Abstract = {On 15 July 2016, Turkey experienced a milestone in its political
   history. An entity, judicially and officially recognized as the Gulenist
   Terror Organization (FETO), operating through a group of its disciples
   nested in the Turkish military, attempted to overthrow Turkey's
   legitimate and elected government. Several important and unprecedented
   factors prevented the coup d'etat. Among them, the determined and
   courageous approach of the ruling AK Party, in solidarity with its
   opposition; the heroic resistance of the people of Turkey, the Turkish
   police, and members of the Turkish armed forces; the anti-coup stance of
   the judiciary; and the democratic posture of the mainstream media. The
   foiling of the coup attempt will contribute tremendously to Turkish
   democracy in many respects. In short, the democracy in Turkey in the
   post-July 15 period will emerge stronger than ever before.},

Abstract = {Is there such a thing as the crisis in the European public discourse? We
   investigate the Great Recession as it appears in the public discourse of
   seven European countries (Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden,
   and Switzerland). We do so through a political claim analysis conducted
   on the most important newspapers of each country between 2005 and 2014.
   We show that the economic crisis, as a shared experience able to produce
   consequences on political processes, does matter, but not as one
   monolithic factor that generates homogeneous outcomes. Different
   countries are characterized by specific features, which need to be taken
   into account to understand the relationship between economic crisis and
   political change. We identify four different crises (the global
   financial crisis, the public debt and austerity crisis, the industrial
   productive crisis, and the political legitimacy crisis) and propose
   interpretations on the relationship between their relative visibility,
   structural factors, and political change.},

Abstract = {Do parties learn from or emulate parties in other political systems?
   This research develops the argument that parties are more likely to
   employ the heuristic of learning from and emulating foreign successful
   (incumbent) parties. Spatial-econometric analyses of parties' election
   policies from several established democracies robustly confirm that
   political parties respond to left-right policy positions of foreign
   political parties that have recently governed. By showing that parties
   respond to these foreign incumbent parties, this work has significant
   implications for our understanding of party competition. Furthermore, we
   contribute to the literature on public policy diffusion, as we suggest
   that political parties are important vehicles through which public
   policies diffuse.},

Abstract = {Over the last several decades, scholars have noted a strengthening link
   between ideology and party identification among the public, but the
   causal direction of this phenomenon remains contested. The ideological
   realignment thesis holds that ideology now strongly influences party
   identification, but this position conflicts with literature suggesting
   that party identification remains the primary causal force behind most
   important political attitudes. This study examines the causal forces at
   work between ideology and party identification by focusing on the
   distinction between symbolic and operational ideology. The methodology
   involves the use of panel data that span several decades, and structural
   equation modeling. The findings indicate that between 1982 and 1997,
   symbolic ideology had a strong influence party identification, but
   operational ideology had little effect on party identification. The
   results suggest an important revision to the ideological realignment
   thesis, as the evidence indicates that symbolic ideology has been the
   primary force driving realignment.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses official Russian discourse on educational
   diplomacythat is, discourse that prioritizes the political rationale for
   internationalization of higher education. When Russia promotes its
   higher education abroad and recruits international students to Russian
   universities on the territory of the Russian Federation (RF) or abroad,
   it engages in educational diplomacy as part of its public diplomacy
   activities. Thus, in official discourse, cross-border education should
   also serve foreign-policy goals. Economic, cultural, and academic
   rationales do co-exist, but they are instrumental to the political
   rationale. This becomes evident with the emphasis on the Commonwealth of
   Independent States (CIS) as the ``target audience{''} for Russia's
   higher education promotion and the main recruitment area, in line with
   Russia's foreign-policy priorities; and the understanding that
   cross-border education would help Russia to enhance its negative
   external image and that alumni would function as ``Russian diplomats{''}
   after returning home.},

Abstract = {The present work is to make a presentation of the work of Th. W. Adorno
   in relation to his reading of the idealist dialectic. For this reason,
   emphasis will be placed, in the first place, in noting the relationship
   between metaphysics and politics, within the hegelian system, and then
   proceed to the criticism which Adorno performs to such articulation. In
   this way, the thesis based on the correlation between the principle of
   identity and the exchange of equivalents, shall give rise to the
   consecration of a particular kind of domination that requires the
   presence of the State to become effective. In front of this theoretical
   frame, the proposal of Adorno will release the force of the particular,
   destabilizing the metaphysical engineering that gives sustenance. The
   consequence of such intervention should be to question the paradigm of
   reconciliation, opening the way to the notion of emancipation, which
   allows the coexistence of the multiple and different.},

Abstract = {The 2008/2009 economic crisis has been identified as an important
   element contributing to declining trust in institutions in Europe and
   worldwide. However, it is unclear whether this decline in trust is
   distributed homogenously among citizens or whether there are differences
   across social strata. This article applies multilevel models to six
   waves of European Social Survey (ESS) data to analyse changes in trust
   in the European Parliament (EP) from 2002 to 2012 in 20 European Union
   countries. Moreover, it investigates whether individuals with different
   socioeconomic backgrounds experienced different reductions in trust. The
   results indicate that trust in the EP declined the most in the
   peripheral European countries hit hardest by the economic crisis:
   Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Cyprus, Greece and Spain. Furthermore, the
   results suggest that the decline in trust was more pronounced among
   subjects with lower social status. The tightening of the link between
   social and political inequalities is especially preoccupying considering
   the importance of trust in institutions for citizens to actively
   participate in society, voice their needs and demand their place at the
   table. Hence, the worsening economic conditions, combined with declining
   levels of trust, are not only troublesome for the functioning of
   democracies as a whole, but they are also problematic at the individual
   level as they are likely to perpetuate the divide among subjects at
   different ends of the social ladder.},

   competing in Belarus},

Abstract = {How do China, Russia, and the European Union (EU) facilitate or hinder
   political liberalization in Belarus? In this paper, using the
   qualitative case study method, I primarily highlight the competition
   that the EU faces with the Russian active autocracy promotion in
   Belarus. The EU provides aid only in exchange for promise of democratic
   and economic reforms, which might be very costly and danger the
   persistence of ruling elites. Russia, at the same time, offers economic
   and diplomatic support to Belarus, which is, however, conditioned by
   privatization of the Belarusian strategic assets in favor of Russian
   stakeholders. I also claim that China, with growing international
   ambitions, passively supports autocracy in Belarus, by providing
   financial aid without interfering with internal political affairs. For
   Belarus, whose leadership still enjoys legitimation by a large part of
   the population due to the economic stability, losing major state
   enterprises might weaken sovereignty. Thus, diversification of economic
   partners is of crucial importance for Belarus. I argue that Belarusian
   ruling elites may have found an escape away from democratic and
   autocratic pushes from the EU and Russia, respectively, by increasing
   linkages with China. To promote effectively democracy in its
   neighborhood, the EU ought to reconsider interactions with external
   non-democratic actors. The paper concludes by providing some policy
   recommendations for the EU.},

Abstract = {Existing research suggests that both natural resource abundance and
   scarcity are likely to increase the risk of interstate and domestic
   conflict. Two crucial aspects, however, have largely been neglected in
   the existing literature: (1) the analysis of international crises (i.e.
   non-violent conflicts) and (2) the effects of different market
   conditions of energy resources. Especially a growing number of market
   participants can affect the strategic value of natural resources and,
   thus, the incentives for international crisis initiation. It is argued
   that different market structures make countries to adopt either
   aggressive or more peaceful behavior towards other states, and this is
   why I empirically then disaggregate fossil fuels along with the market
   that they belong to. This study examines 179 countries at the monadic
   level since 1980. The results suggest variation on the incentives of
   crisis initiation along the different fossil fuels, while I also correct
   for potential endogeneity issues.},

Abstract = {In its recent Decision 145/2015, the Spanish Constitutional Court ruled
   on whether staff of pharmacies could be granted the right to
   conscientious objection. The Court upheld the constitutional right of
   pharmacy staff to conscientiously object to selling the so-called
   ``morning-after pill{''}. The Court, however, did not extend the scope
   of such a right to the sale of contraceptives. As a result of this
   decision, regarding a highly controversial matter within Spanish
   doctrine, what should be understood as the new scope of the right to
   conscientiously object? How does this decision impact the precedent
   case-law on the issue? As could be expected, Decision 145/2015 has
   sparked a lively doctrinal debate. This article intends to contribute to
   the debate under the assumption that the Constitutional Court's ruling
   ``may not have been fully understood{''}.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {78},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Demand for renewable energy is booming. Scholars often attribute this
   success to feed-in tariffs (FITs), which mandate that energy utilities
   pay a premium to renewable electricity producers and guarantee grid
   access for them. Why have so many countries, including least-developed
   ones, adopted these policies? We hypothesize that democratic governments
   have political incentives to adopt the FIT because it improves
   environmental quality, promotes rural development, and distributes
   electricity generation profits from large utilities to independent
   producers. We analyze global data on FIT adoption, 1990-2012, and we
   find that the association between democratic regime type and FIT
   adoption overwhelms all other covariates. The effect is specific to the
   FIT and does not exist for renewable portfolio standards or public
   competitive bidding for renewable energy contracts. Consistent with
   theories of distributive politics, among democracies, institutional
   malapportionment in favor of rural political constituencies favors FIT
   adoption.},

Abstract = {This article scrutinizes the role of political parties in gender quota
   implementation. First, it theoretically specifies and operationalizes
   the concept of bureaucratization in relation to candidate selection.
   Second, it examines whether parties with bureaucratized selection
   procedures are better at implementing legally mandated candidate quotas
   than other parties. We measure implementation as the number of women
   candidates and women elected (the latter measuring implementation of the
   spirit of quota laws). Using unique data on almost 100 Latin American
   parties, the analysis shows that once quotas are in place, parties with
   bureaucratized selection procedures put substantially more women on
   their candidate lists than other parties. However, these parties are
   only better at implementing the letter of the law: they do not get more
   women elected.},

Abstract = {The field of cybersecurity crosses multiple domains as it has risen to
   affect state governance. The Internet has enabled aspects of
   connectedness and capabilities that have the potential to effect state
   power. Such conditions affect the standing of nation-states within the
   international political system and their relation to other states. This
   is a matter of cyber-relations, where the behavior of states towards
   each other is based on the comparative cyber-capability of the state.
   Emerging conditions include the ability of non-state actors to wield
   similar cyber-power and affect state governance, and affect state
   operations and its contract with its constituents (contract alluding to
   the provisions for the public good). This research addresses the notion
   of non-state actors within this context, specifically, proposing and
   analytical framework for analyzing cyber threats from non-state actors.},

Abstract = {The Parliament of Australia has been host to a rare phenomenon of
   `cross-party collaboration' (CPC), in which politicians work together
   across party lines by co-sponsoring a bill or voting together in a
   conscience vote. CPC points to gaps in political parties' platforms,
   leading individual politicians to seek representation of issues outside
   party divisions. This article explores the phenomenon of CPC and
   outlines different ways it has been used by politicians. As will be
   demonstrated, CPC in the Australian context is relatively gendered as
   mainly women politicians have used it to advance socio-moral issues,
   suggesting an alternative style of representation.},

Abstract = {This paper aims at investigating bank guarantees in Iranian law and
   exploring new and different bases for the nature of bank guarantees that
   create liabilities and make accepting this legal action simpler for
   community members. In other words, we have been in a position to answer
   these questions: What is the nature of bank guarantees? In other words,
   do bank guarantees include civil or commercial guarantees? Finally,
   according to the proposed principles and introduced ideas, it seems that
   bank guarantees cannot act as a Civil or Commercial Guarantee. It should
   also be acknowledged that bank guarantee letter is an innovative
   financial tool that is very important in commercial contracts and in
   particular international contracts, because they minimize economic risk
   of the contract and are strong executive guaranty. In general, no
   contract can be executed or take effect without bank guarantees and
   insurance.},

Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2016},
Number = {15},
Pages = {28-41},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {As asymmetric warfare perpetuates in Nigeria, the resultant loss of life
   and destruction of public and private infrastructure attributed to Boko
   Haram has put Nigeria in the international spotlight. Although
   international support is being deployed to bolster Nigeria's efforts to
   repress Boko Haram's insurgency, mostly in the Northern part, attacks in
   other cities in Central Nigeria compel the need for more in-depth
   analyses to understand what fuels Boko Haram's growth, and determine the
   best approach to ensure Nigerians' safety in curbing the insurgency.
   This paper is premised on the assumption that factors sustaining Boko
   Haram have yet to be fully understood by policymakers and until that is
   done, restoring order in Northern Nigeria will remain elusive. The paper
   further argues that should Boko Haram be responsible for all attacks
   outside of their key areas in core North of Nigeria then their
   capability to destabilize Nigeria is yet to be contained. Lastly, that
   these attacks are, possibly, the emergence of unknown insurgent groups
   capitalizing on the fragile security situation to showcase the
   weaknesses of the Nigerian security forces and government as a whole.
   What needs to be done by the government is in part what this paper
   posits in its recommendations.},

   focussed on generating reasons that are oriented to the issue of
   articulating norms of justice, legitimacy and so on, that guide
   political judgements about institutions and/or forms of conduct;
   `Continental' political philosophy is oriented to critically assessing
   the practices of reasoning that characterise our social and political
   institutions and forms of conduct as well as our first-order normative
   reflection on them. It explores the distinction between the two
   orientations in terms of, what are called, their `structural
   problematics': the guidance problem and the critique problem, before
   considering briefly ways in which they may be combined.},

Abstract = {This article explores the implementation of policy integration in the
   area of development cooperation by analyzing in a comparative
   perspective the intra-country dimension of Policy Coherence for
   Development (PCD) in four European Union (EU) Member States (United
   Kingdom, Sweden, The Netherlands and Italy). The current standard
   explanation of the differences among national policy process and
   outcomes in this policy area point out the role of politics and
   institutional design. In contrast to this conventional view, the article
   highlights the relevance of others factors operating at the level of
   subsystem politics, namely, paradigm clashes and organizational
   bargaining. The first section of the article examines the concept of
   PCD, its rationale and application in the EU. The second section
   clarifies the main hypothesis, the research design and presents the
   empirical analysis of the four national cases. Finally, the article
   concludes with a mixed assessment of the explicative factors behind the
   implementation of PCD and of the perils of policy integration in
   development cooperation.},

Abstract = {Inter-party conflict management is a typical coalitional problem in
   parliamentary governments. To study how and why conflicts in coalitions
   emerge and how parties cope with them can enhance our knowledge of
   coalition governance. Here, I propose a framework for comparative
   studies on the topic. The framework is based on the conception of
   coalition politics as politics of exchange. It looks at inter-party
   interactions, but also accounts for the impact of intra-party politics.
   Moreover, I provide a classification of inter-party conflicts in
   coalitions and point out when they are more likely. The process of
   conflict management is operationalized with two proxiesactors, and
   arenasand a taxonomy of conflict terminations is presented. The
   viability of the framework is tested both by mapping coalition
   governments according to their modes of managing internal conflicts and,
   after deriving research hypotheses, through empirical inquiries of
   conflict management in diverse coalitions.},

Abstract = {Democracy was established in the Greek cities in the fifth century B.C.
   It is a liberal western system. In this regard, various Islamic
   countries applied democracy as a political and legal system where the
   people elect their representatives in the legislative authority in order
   to put the legal regulations that organize the human behavior. The
   research included a brief idea about liberal democracy, its history and
   objectives, the political and legal system in the Islamic state, the
   dispute among Muslim scholars on the application of democracy in the
   Islamic states; some Muslim scholars refuse to apply democracy since the
   legal system in Islam relies on the Holly Qor'an and the Prophet's
   speeches, which are a biding regulation for Muslims, while other authors
   believe that Islam accepts democracy and others think that Islam should
   have its special democracy that differs from the liberal democracy. This
   paper discussed the political and legal systems that were applied the
   Islamic state during the history of Islam. Finally the paper presented
   the most conclusions and recommendations reached by the researcher.},

Abstract = {Despite recent studies that find few people face significant wait times
   when attempting to vote in U.S. elections, the 2012 election produced
   numerous anecdotal and journalistic accounts claiming otherwise. This
   study relies on a national survey of local election officials to
   systematically ascertain their views about the challenges and successes
   they had in administering the 2012 general election. Consistent with
   surveys of voters, most officials report that wait times and lines were
   minimal. Furthermore, the relative amount of money available to a
   jurisdiction for election administration was unrelated to the occurrence
   of these problems, while the presence of more poll workers-especially
   first-timers-may actually exacerbate them. (C) 2015 Published by

   New Evidence From a Sub-National Comparison},

Abstract = {This article argues that governments play a considerable role in shaping
   citizens' attitudes toward Muslim immigrants through the way they
   regulate religion. European democracies are far from secular, and
   matters of religious regulation cannot be reduced to abstract values or
   constitutional clauses. Under conditions of high state support of
   religion, accommodating new religious minorities involves not only the
   changing of existing rules but also giving up on long-standing
   traditions and everyday habits. As a result, citizens see religious
   newcomers as a threat to their way of life and react with animosity to
   their practices and demands. We support our argument by combining newly
   designed survey items with original data on religious regulation in 26
   Swiss cantons. Our findings contradict the extant literature and have
   important implications for the democratic challenges in Europe, the
   quality of modern immigration societies, and the role of religion in
   democracy more generally.},

Abstract = {The return of democracy to Spain in 1977 cleared the way for the
   institutional differentiation and launch of the discipline in the
   country. However, this double process did not actually crystallize until
   the mid1980's, when the ``Political Science and Public
   Administration{''} was approved by the government as a separate field of
   knowledge. This article intends to provide an account of the most
   relevant milestones that took place since then until the last few years
   of the 20th century, when full institutionalization of the discipline
   was reached with the publication of the first issue of this Journal.
   Moreover, the article systematizes a comprehensive set of data on
   students, faculty staff, teaching and research structures, scientific
   congresses, etc., with an aim at offering a balance of the main events
   and changes experienced by the discipline and the profession during
   their consolidation phase in the 21st century. The developments covered
   here have contributed to the evolution from the initial amateurism to
   the professionalization of scholars dedicated to this social science,
   which has gained full recognition in the academic sphere both nationally
   and internationally, even if it still suffers from a lack of legitimacy
   concerning the specificity of its subject vis-a-vis other social
   sciences.},

Abstract = {Since the late 1990s, Congress and the states have debated how to treat
   electronic commerce for purposes of sales taxation. Frustrated by their
   limited progress at the national level, advocates of policy change
   attempted to generate vertical diffusion by using increasingly
   aggressive state-level actions to press Congress to act. The state
   initiatives provided national legislators with an opportunity to learn,
   and a systematic analysis of congressional policymaking suggests that
   vertical diffusion affected the early stages of the legislative process.
   State policies influenced the specific options that national officials
   considered, the rhetoric they employed, and, less consistently, bill
   cosponsorship patterns. The impact of vertical diffusion receded,
   however, as the congressional debate continued. Its muted effect during
   the later stages of the legislative process implies that national
   officials do not necessarily learn from what occurs in the laboratories
   of democracy. In addition to shedding light on the shifting politics of
   electronic commerce, this study illustrates the benefits both of
   studying the impact of vertical diffusion on individual decision-making
   and of conceptualizing vertical diffusion as a process rather than as an
   outcome to be explained.},

Abstract = {The state-orchestrated plunder of Armenian property immediately
   impoverished its victims; this was simultaneously a condition for and a
   consequence of the Armenian Genocide. A series of laws and decrees as
   well as complex bureaucratic mechanisms were devised in the
   Ottoman-Turkish Republican periods concerning the administration of the
   belongings left behind by the deported Armenians. The aim of this
   article is to analyze these laws and statutes, which were known as the
   Abandoned Properties Laws. It attempts to elucidate the dominant logic
   of the laws, decrees, and regulations concerning the abandoned
   properties, which are closely connected to the political economy of the
   Armenian Genocide.},

Title = {Voter perceptions of coalition policy positions in multiparty systems},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {41},
Pages = {80-91},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A growing body of research shows how voters consider coalition formation
   and policy compromises at the post-electoral stage when making vote
   choices. Yet, we know surprisingly little about how voters perceive
   policy positions of coalition governments. Using new survey data from
   the Austrian National Election Study (AUTNES), we study voter
   perceptions of coalition policy platforms. We find that voters do in
   general have reasonable expectations of the coalitions' policy
   positions. However, partisan beliefs and uncertainty affect how voters
   perceive coalition positions: in addition to projection biases similar
   to those for individual party placements, partisans of coalition parties
   tend to align the position of the coalition with their own party's
   policy position, especially for those coalitions they prefer the most.
   In contrast, there is no consistent effect of political knowledge on the
   voters' uncertainty when evaluating coalition policy positions. (C) 2015

Abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of the Economic and Monetary Union on
   international tourism flows across a set of 37 developed countries. To
   do this, an augmented gravity model is estimated using a sample of 31
   European countries plus six non-European OECD countries over the period
   1995-2012. Results suggest a substantial impact of the euro on
   intra-Eurozone tourism of between 44 and 126\% when proper estimation
   method, control group and definition of the Eurozone are used. Moreover,
   evidence of tourism creation is also found. Finally, the potential
   tourism gains for new members and possible entrants of adopting the euro
   are explored. This study provides a detailed analysis on the effect of
   the euro on tourism flows which might be of interest for policymakers of
   the Eurozone or future member states.},

   Context of Legislative Behaviour},
Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {This article examines the degree to which sponsored private member's
   bills (PMBs) in parliament can be explained by electoral incentives.
   Such bills are a peculiar piece of draft legislation - technically
   simple, topically unimportant and with negligible passage rates. Yet
   members of parliament (MPs) sponsor them in large numbers. One possible
   explanation for this behaviour is the electoral context arising out of
   the variance in electoral district size and electoral list types, which
   makes a strong personal reputation comparatively more important for some
   MPs. Sponsoring bills that have no realistic chance of becoming actual
   regulations could be a form of personal reputation-building and/or
   vote-seeking behaviour. Evidence is examined on the sponsoring of such
   bills in Finland between 2003 and 2007 and in Estonia between 1999 and
   2007 in order to determine if the electoral context explains why some
   MPs do this more frequently. The results suggest that the electoral
   system does have an effect. MPs who have been elected under rules where
   personal reputation is not central in getting elected are less likely to
   sponsor such bills the larger their electoral district becomes.},

Title = {Parties, Brokers, and Voter Mobilization: How Turnout Buying Depends
   Upon the Party's Capacity to Monitor Brokers},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {110},
Number = {1},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Despite its prevalence, little is known about when parties buy turnout.
   We emphasize the problem of parties monitoring local brokers with
   incentives to shirk. Our model suggests that parties extract greater
   turnout buying effort from their brokers where they can better monitor
   broker performance and where favorable voters would not otherwise turn
   out. Exploiting exogenous variation in the number of polling stationsand
   thus electoral information about broker performancein Mexican electoral
   precincts, we find that greater monitoring capacity increases turnout
   and votes for the National Action Party (PAN) and the Institutional
   Revolutionary Party (PRI). Consistent with our theoretical predictions,
   the effect of monitoring capacity on PRI votes varies nonlinearly with
   the distance of voters to the polling station: it first increases
   because rural votersfacing larger costs of votinggenerally favor the
   PRI, before declining as the cost of incentivizing brokers increases.
   This nonlinearity is not present for the PAN, who stand to gain less
   from mobilizing rural voters.},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine three key, recently emergent sites of
   anti-austerity activism in Britain - Left Unity, the People's Assembly
   and Occupy - in order to explore to what extent and in which ways the
   traditional British left is in the process of reconfiguring itself. More
   specifically, we explore the `points of contact' being developed, or
   not, amongst feminist, anarchist and Marxist/socialist activists. We
   argue that if we are seeing a mutation of the left at present, it
   concerns a noticeable (if partial and contested) `feminist turn' in
   terms of the composition, ideas and practices of these sites.},

Abstract = {Though more than 100 countries have adopted gender quotas, the effects
   of these reforms on women's political leadership are largely unknown. We
   exploit a natural experimenta 50-50 quota imposed by the national board
   of the Swedish Social Democratic Party on 290 municipal branchesto
   examine quotas' influence on women's selection to, and survival in, top
   political posts. We find that those municipalities where the quota had a
   larger impact became more likely to select (but not reappoint) female
   leaders. Extending this analysis, we show that the quota increased the
   number of women perceived as qualified for these positions. Our findings
   support the notion that quotas can have an acceleration effect on
   women's representation in leadership positions, particularly when they
   augment the pool of female candidates for these posts. These results
   help dispel the myth that quotas trade short-term gains in women's
   descriptive representation for long-term exclusion from political power.},

Abstract = {The UK appears to be making a cautious return to international policing
   after a decade of following an approach best described as muddling
   through'. Recent reforms and new co-ordinating structures seek to
   improve coherence and promote the British model of policing abroad.
   These are timely initiatives as international policing is also under
   review at the UN. Yet what is missing - argue Stephanie Blair and
   Maureen Brown - is a clear, pragmatic, realistic and holistic UK
   government strategy for international policing and law enforcement that
   would provide a sense of purpose, ambition and direction, and deliver
   coherence across UK domestic and international security objectives.},

Abstract = {A prominent feature of recent Australian economic discourse is the
   assertion that there was a `productivity surge' during the 1990s,
   resulting from the neoliberal microeconomic reforms inaugurated in the
   early 1980s. However, the evidence for the productivity surge is
   routinely overstated, thus undermining the rationale for many past and
   future microeconomic reforms. There is also substantial evidence that
   productivity growth can have perverse socioeconomic and/or environmental
   consequences. Nonetheless, many policymakers, economists and
   commentators remain preoccupied with increasing productivity growth.
   This article examines the Australian productivity debate and concludes
   that this is driven more by neoliberal norms than socioeconomic
   necessity. These are manifest in a disciplinary discourse that
   constructs productivity growth as a national imperative, unencumbered by
   negative social and environmental externalities.},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},

Pages = {334-355},
Abstract = {The literature on Lebanese resistance to Israel is overwhelmed with work
   on Hezbollah, the role of religion, and its connection to Iranian
   influence. However, few of these studies have looked at the totality of
   Lebanese resistance, from its secular origins to its Islamic monopoly.
   Moreover, no work to date has looked at Lebanese resistance through the
   prism of just war theory. This article aims at addressing this gap by
   applying the criteria introduced by Childress regarding the justness of
   war. Moreover, the article examines resistance as a practice of
   non-state actors and its terrorist label, and at the same time,
   evaluates Israel's military response to Lebanese resistance through the
   prism of state terrorism.},

Abstract = {Lithuanian society did not observe the Euromaidan in Ukraine from afar.
   It saw itself directly affected. Russia's annexation of the Crimea and
   the war of intervention in eastern Ukraine unleashed fears of a similar
   aggression on the part of Russia in the Baltic region. The war also
   changed Lithuanians' self-understanding of their country's own history.
   In debates over German and Soviet rule, an escalation and relativisation
   of positions is taking place. History and memory are becoming a screen
   for projecting the present political conflict with Russia.},

Title = {INSTITUTIONAL POSSIBILITY FRONTIER AND TOTAL FACTOR PRODUCTIVITY:
   TOWARDS A THEORETICAL SYNTHESIS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2016},
Number = {6},
Pages = {95-113},
Abstract = {This paper outlines a link between two theoretical perspectives on the
   prerequisites of high institutional quality and long run growth. One
   framework is based on the trade-off between disorder and dictatorship
   and introduces the notion of the institutional possibility frontier
   (IPF). The idea of IPF implies that social institutions can be situated
   on the continuum between two extrema of dictatorship and disorder, each
   point on the continuum has an associated level of social losses. It is
   implied that the dictatorship-disorder trade-off is mole severe in some
   societies than in others:The other theoretical perspective focuses upon
   the role of total factor productivity (TFP) as a parameter underlying
   long run growth (TFP can be represented as a parameter A in the
   Cobb-Douglas function). It is possible to associate different social
   groups with different productivity factors in the Cobb-Douglas function
   and, further, with different institutional preferences on the
   dictatorship-disorder continuum. As a result, the linkage between TFP
   and IPF emerges and the effects of TFP can be interpreted in the
   framework of the IPF theory. The formalization of the linkage between
   two theoretical perspectives is presented in outline and it is shown
   that high TFP can mitigate the trade-off between dictatorship and
   disorder. The second part of the paper contains a tentative empirical
   analysis of the link between TFP and major institutional
   characteristics. It is demonstrated that this link is present and has
   from medium to high strength. An interesting innovation concerns the
   method of estimating TFP. By and large, the paper sheds some light on
   the nature of TFP and designates directions for further research on the
   fundamental conditions for high-quality development.},

Title = {Habituation to atrocity: low-level violence against civilians as a
   predictor of high-level attacks},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {539-562},
Abstract = {`Habituation to atrocity' is characterized as an actor's increased
   willingness to carry out high-level violence against civilians (VAC)
   owing to the choice of low-level attacks in an earlier period. We
   theoretically analyse habituation to atrocity using a rational choice
   model in which a government, rebel organization or militia group
   allocates resources to fighting, attacking civilians and identity
   formation to achieve territorial control. Based upon concepts available
   in the rational addiction literature, the model generates a demand
   function for VAC in which substantial additional demand arises owing to
   the `bad habit' generated by previous atrocities. The model guides our
   empirical inquiry into VAC for a sample of forty-nine African countries
   over the period 1997 to 2014. We find that the number of past low-level
   civilian attacks (even sometimes those involving zero fatalities)
   significantly affects the number of high-level attacks in the present.
   We also find that previous low-level civilian attacks sometimes better
   predict high-level attacks than civil conflict. Our work suggests that
   regional and global datasets on `small' VAC incidents can serve as
   valuable early warning indicators of more severe atrocities.},

Abstract = {Young citizens show an increasing interest for direct democracy tools
   and for the building of a new relationship with public administration
   through the use of digital platforms. The Open Data issue is part of
   this transformation. The paper analyzes the Open Data issue from the
   perspective of a spontaneous and informal group of digital activists
   with the aim of promoting data disclosure. The study is focused mainly
   on the case of a specific local movement, named Open Data Sicilia (ODS),
   combining traditional ethnographic observation with an ethnographic
   approach. The aim of the study is to detect the social profile of the
   Open Data movement activists, understanding how is it organized their
   network, what are the common purposes and solidarity models embodied by
   this type of movement, what are the resources mobilized and their
   strategies between on-line and off-line. The ODS case appears
   interesting for its evolution, its strategy and organizational
   structure: an elitist and technocratic movement that aspires to a broad
   constituency. It is an expressive or a reformist movement, rather than
   an anti-system actor, with features that are similar to a lobby. The
   case study also shows all the typical characteristics of digital
   activism, with its fluid boundaries between ethical inspiration of civic
   engagement and individual interests.},

Abstract = {Politics in democracy and dictatorship is markedly different; democracy
   and dictatorship are also associated with distinct policy outcomes. Do
   political regimes also select different leaders, i.e., do democratic
   leaders have distinct personal backgrounds to those of their peers in
   dictatorships, do they tend to hold different prior careers and posts
   while climbing the ``greasy pole{''} of politics? The aim of this paper
   is to introduce the new data on leaders' careers in democracy and
   dictatorship and compare their personal background, experience in
   politics, careers and significant posts prior to their tenure, and
   details about their time in office, inter alia. In general, democratic
   leaders differ from nondemocratic ones in terms of their educational,
   social and career background. The paper also finds significant
   differences among leaders in different nondemocratic regimes, and
   suggests possible venues for further research.},

Title = {Unilateral or Reciprocal Climate Policy? Experimental Evidence from
   China},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Pages = {152-171},
Abstract = {The traditional political economy account of global climate change
   governance directs our attention to fundamental collective action
   problems associated with global public goods provision, resulting from
   positive or negative externalities as well as freeriding. The governance
   architecture of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol uses the traditional approaches
   of international diplomacy for addressing such challenges: legally
   binding commitments based on principles of reciprocity and (fair)
   cost/burden sharing via formalized carbon-budgeting. Yet, the 2015 Paris
   Agreement has essentially abandoned this approach, as it now operates on
   the basis of internationally coordinated and monitored unilateralism. On
   the presumption that public opinion matters for government policy, we
   examine how citizens view this shift in climate policy from reciprocity
   to unilateralism, after many years of exposure to strong reciprocity
   rhetoric by governments and stakeholders. To that end, we fielded a
   survey experiment in China, the world's largest greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emitter. The results show that there is, perhaps surprisingly, strong
   and robust public support for unilateral, non-reciprocal climate policy.
   To the extent China is interested in pushing ahead with ambitious and
   thus costly GHG reduction policies, our results suggest that China can
   leverage segments of public support in order to overcome domestic
   obstacles to GHG mitigation policies.},

Title = {Electoral reform, values and party self-interest},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {93-104},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {It is often taken for granted that parties support electoral reform
   because they anticipate seat payoffs from the psychological and
   mechanical effects of the new electoral system. Although some studies
   point out that elements related to values and the willingness to achieve
   social goals are also relevant to explaining party preference in those
   situations, a general model of how these considerations influence
   support for electoral reform is still missing. To fill this gap, I
   develop in this article a policy-seeking model accounting for
   values-related factors and operationalize it using one of the most
   firmly established effects of electoral systems in the literature: The
   degree of inclusiveness and its consequences for the representation of
   social groups in parliament. The empirical relevance of this model is
   then tested using an original dataset reporting the actual position of
   115 parties facing 22 electoral reform proposals in OECD countries since
   1961. The results show that willingness to favour the electoral system

Abstract = {The contemporary empirical literature on military spending has focused
   on institutional and conflict factors, and although has acknowledged the
   role of trade openness, it has not taken into account the position of a
   state in the trade network. Building on the concept of network
   centrality, we claim that the structure of trade networks affects the
   optimal investment in security, and that a country's level of military
   spending is a function of its strategic position in the global network
   of a critical commodity, such as oil. Our empirical results show that
   network centrality constrains military spending.},

Abstract = {In Russia, the idea of a specific Russian civilization has been
   propagated for several years. The concept of the ``Russian world{''} is
   vague, and many of its oft-cited elements contradict one other. This
   also applies to the variant of the concept espoused by the Russian
   Orthodox Church. On the one hand, Russian culture and the Russian
   language are to provide cohesion. On the other hand, the church
   distances itself explicitly from an understanding of the ``Russian
   world{''} constricted by nationality. The contradictions also have to do
   with the fact that while the church seeks proximity to the state, it at
   the same time wants to maintain its independence and tries not to act as
   the Kremlin's proxy.},

Abstract = {The independence of the European colonies produced in the twentieth
   century, opened a postcolonial scene in which we have developed
   different challenges to the persistence of elements of colonial rule
   with posterity to his disappearance, questions that have led to current
   and critical thinking political programs that seek to reverse such
   persistence. In this scene postcolonial indigenous peoples manage to
   position protagonist so, belatedly considering its longstanding
   colonized people, from the 1980s. On the historical reasons for this
   late position, especially the colonial situation the Mapuche people live
   in the following article. When the colonial condition starts, how it has
   been reconfigured over time, how has analyzed the criticism of
   postcolonial scene and what projects are out to colonialism are the
   questions that organize this work.},

Abstract = {Do people with more formal education make better political leaders? In
   this article we analyze cross-national data on random leadership
   transitions, data on close elections in the US Congress, and data on
   randomly audited municipalities in Brazil. Across a wide range of
   outcomes, we consistently find that college-educated leaders perform
   about the same as or worse than leaders with less formal education.
   Politicians with college degrees do not tend to govern over more
   prosperous nations, do not pass more bills, do not tend to do better at
   the polls, and are no less likely to be corrupt. These findings have
   important implications for how citizens evaluate candidates, how
   scholars measure leader quality, and how we think about the role of
   education in policy making.},

Title = {The Political Potential of Mindful Embodiment},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {226-240},
Abstract = {This article argues that the emerging literature on mindfulness tends to
   de-emphasize embodiment, both in how it theoretically defines
   mindfulness, as well as in terms of the practices it tends to study.
   Alternatively, the article argues that a focus on embodiment is key to
   articulating the political potential of mindfulness. An emphasis on
   mindful embodiment, both in theory and in practice, can issue a
   challenge to the latent mind-body dualism of much of the theoretical
   discourse on mindfulness and highlights the capacities of relationality,
   empathy, and attunement, capacities which are the foundation of the
   political significance of mindfulness. Practices of mindful embodiment
   provide a counterpoint to the focus upon contemplation in the
   mindfulness literature and help to refute the concern that mindfulness
   practice is solipsistic and apolitical. The article concludes by
   exploring the Occupy Wall Street movement as illustrative of the
   significance of mindful embodiment to contemporary social movements.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that dependent countries are affected by the
   phenomenon of land grabbing, and that the major investors acquiring land
   come from countries of the ``center.{''} The phenomenon thus has two
   effects in terms of worldwide production specialization: (1) a
   ``vertical{''} effect of bringing about greater differentiation between
   the traditional countries of the ``center{''} and dependent countries,
   where the latter focus their development policies on deepening their
   foreignized and primarized productive structures; and (2) a
   ``horizontal{''} effect, through which states such as China and the Arab
   countries, which are developing countries in terms of their productive
   structure, are differentiated from the rest of the dependent countries
   in terms of their capacity to export capital.},

   Paradox},
Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {117-135},
Abstract = {Psychocentrism is a governing neoliberal rationality that pathologizes
   human problems and frames individuals as responsible for socially
   structured inequalities. The homeless community provides an important
   case study to examine the ways psychocentrism manifests among an
   excluded population. This paper explores the paradox whereby homeless
   individuals are simultaneously pathologized and responsibilized through
   psychocentric discourses in which their status as economically poor
   becomes individualized as a symptom of mental illness and/or addiction.
   Although medicalized understandings of mental and emotional distress
   pervade the homeless industry, the obligations of freedom in the
   neoliberal era mean that individuals alone are held responsible for
   their failures. The paper examines the ways individuals experiencing
   homelessness are compelled to embark on an entrepreneurial project of
   the self that requires them to accept blame for their social
   precariousness. Further, it deconstructs the narratives that regard
   social explanations as an excuse and a failure of individual
   accountability. I argue that the ``shamed poor{''} adopt empowerment
   discourses touted by the homeless industry, which paradoxically
   encourage individuals to find strength in their personal failures and to
   work toward self-governance, devoid of historical, social, and cultural
   context.},

Abstract = {As long as human condition uses freedom as universal structure and that
   is what provides the human being with dignity, the real exercise of it
   would have occupied the focus of the social struggle in the history of
   our culture. The normative and practical development from classic Greece
   has pointed out a collision between confronted visions which respond to
   that relentless dialectics that Sartre mentioned. In the modern world,
   the ways of understanding the exercise of freedom follow that logic: on
   the one hand, models which favour the rules of the game that allow an
   unequal distribution of the exercise of freedom as in liberalism; on the
   other hand, those who propose mechanisms to prevent the limitation and
   exclusion of the exercise of freedoms by underpriviledged social sectors
   in republican freedom},

Journal = {SECURITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1-2, SI},
Pages = {28-44},
Abstract = {The role of gender equality considerations, including the gender balance
   of peacekeeping operations, has been underplayed as a potential solution
   to the UN'S recurrent problems with sexual exploitation and abuse by
   blue helmets. This article explores 3 elements related to gender
   equality that have been neglected in responding to this issue: the
   presence of women in peacekeeping operations, the voice and opinion of
   women's organizations, and the assistance to victims of such violations.
   The connection between women's leadership and participation, on the one
   hand, and better outcomes for women and girls on the other, has been
   evident in many related policy areas, and should be applied more
   forcefully in addressing sexual exploitation and abuse by UN
   peacekeepers.},

   (1980-2015)},
Journal = {ACTIVITAT PARLAMENTARIA},
Year = {2016},
Number = {29},
Pages = {89-114},
Abstract = {This paper sets forth the democratic activity of the Catalan Parliament
   on public memorial policies between the first and the tenth legal terms
   (motions, questions and formal questions, resolutions, institutional
   declarations, bills, etc). In particular, from the sixth onwards, as it
   marks a qualitative no-turning point, both in the number and in the
   variety of memorial initiatives. Thus, the text points out fields most
   debated in the area (commemorations, homages, the juridical revision of
   court-martials during Francoism, withdrawal of fascist symbols from the
   public space, recovery of documental funds and access to historical
   archives, economic funding to political ex convicts, research of missing
   persons' data and exhumation and signaling of common pits. Also,
   compilation and identification of human remains of persons gone missing
   during the Civil War and Francoism). The paper also goes through Law
   13/2007, of 31 October, of the Democratic Memorial, and Law 10/2009, of
   30 June, about the location and identification of persons gone missing
   during the Civil War and Franco's dictatorship. It claims for the
   dignification of common pits, and reviews the most outstanding relevant
   motions (217/VI, 47/X, 69/X, etc.). It is thus that it pinpoints
   troublesome issues as emerged during parliamentary debates and
   formulates observations about the convenience of going through the
   current legal frame in Catalonia as regards memorial policies.},

   Quixote},
Journal = {SECURITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3-4, SI},
Pages = {479-497},
Abstract = {Conflicts and their management in Central Asia have never been
   prioritised by the osce although five states of the region are among its
   participating states. This has been due to that unlike in some other
   parts of the post-Soviet space most of the conflicts did not threaten
   with military escalation, and the intensity of strategic rivalry is less
   noticeable in this distant part of the osce area than closer to the
   heart of-Europe. The fact Russia is not a direct party to the conflicts
   in Central Asia also reduces the interests of many participating states.
   There was one high intensity conflict in the region, the Tajik civil war
   that came too early for the osce. Lower intensity conflicts, ranging
   from border skirmishes, disputes about access to water, violation of
   rights of national minority groups, rigged elections are monitored and
   their resolutions are facilitated by the organisation. Some of them,
   like the 2010 Kyrgyz-Uzbek conflict had such short shelf-life
   internationally that no consensus-based inter-governmental organisation
   could have effectively intervened into it. The osce has been successful
   in conflict management when the party or parties also wanted to break
   the stale-mate that the Organization could facilitate. Domestic change
   in some Central Asian states is essential for advancing the osces
   cooperative security approach.},

Title = {Democratic Governance Beyond the Nation-State: Democratic conceptions
   from six world regions},
Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2016},
Number = {51},
Pages = {147+},
Abstract = {Democratic rule is no longer only expected of nation-states. The most
   impressive demonstration of this is the recurring critique of
   international organizations (IOs) and their democratic deficits. At the
   same time, negotiating the future contours of global governance has
   ceased to be a Western prerogative. The debate on how to democratize IOs
   includes states and regions whose experience with democratic rule does
   not necessarily coincide with that of the West. This raises an important
   question: how do political elites inside and outside the Western core
   conceptualize democratic rule beyond the state? Do their different
   contexts of origin on the one hand and the specific characteristics of
   global rule on the other impact countries' understandings of 10
   democracy - and if so how? To answer these questions, I analyse states'
   democratic discourse within the reform debate of two UN sub
   organizations, namely the Security Council and General Assembly. By
   means of collocation analysis, I examine 1015 speeches made by 161 state
   representatives from six world regions that participated in the debate
   from 2003 to 2013. The results are surprising. Something that proves
   difficult for the domestic context seems feasible beyond the state:
   countries share a common understanding of democratic rule. In fact,
   diplomats from all world regions consistently link the notion of global
   democracy to a common set of principles and ideas. In essence, these are
   principles of representative democracy that are known from the domestic
   democratic context. Yet, when applied to IOs rather than nation-states,
   the democratic idea differs in one decisive respect: states, not people,
   are the core subjects of rule.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {19},
Number = {6},
Pages = {699-713},
Abstract = {The view that the choices people make affect what it is fair for them to
   receive has widespread appeal. This very general thought has found
   particular and acute expression in the context of distributive justice
   in the form of the influential view that has become known as luck
   egalitarianism. In a surprising development, one of luck
   egalitarianism's foremost advocates G.A. Cohen - appeared, in one of his
   final papers, to reject the commitment to the fairness of chosen
   inequalities that defines luck egalitarianism. In opposition to the luck
   egalitarian view, Cohen suggests that choice merely deprives the
   disadvantaged of a complaint against being worse off, rather than
   rendering such inequality fair. Against Cohen's revised view, Andrew
   Williams has argued that Cohen's move underestimates an account of
   equality under which what individuals choose to do with their equal
   allocation affects what it is to treat them fairly. Here, I seek to show
   how the Williams response fails to undermine Cohen's claims about the
   relation between fairness and choice. I draw on this analysis to show
   how the disagreement between Williams and Cohen on this issue
   illuminates a broader methodological divergence over how to approach
   questions of justice and fairness.},

Abstract = {This article analyses discourses on Islamist radicalisation and threats
   of terrorism in Norway, with a focus on a new category of people known
   as ``Syria travellers{''}, i.e. young Norwegians who go to Syria to
   fight for the Islamic State. Our analysis of debates in the media,
   policy documents and parliamentary discussions revealed two main
   narratives regarding the authorities' response to Syria travellers: the
   first emphasises legal sanctions, and the second highlights the
   reintegration of returnees. We found that contentions about how to react
   to the new kind of people (the Syria travellers) are intertwined with
   the way these people are portrayed, understood or ``made up{''}. In the
   political realm, there is also a striking consensus on the need for both
   reintegrative and legislative responses.},

Abstract = {Why are relations between non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and

   between NGOs associated with the anti-/alterglobalization movement and
   multilateral economic institutions (MEIs). Drawing on an original
   database and interviews with MEI and NGO staff members, the article
   shows that attributes of NGOs-including NGO budgets, ideology, and
   organizational structure rather than the political or economic
   environment better account not only for an overall increase in
   collaboration with IOs since the late 1990s, but also for a growing
   divergence among NGOs regarding the acceptability of such collaboration.},

Title = {POLITICAL SCIENCE FACING THE CHALLENGES OF MODERN POLITICS. TO THE 60TH
   ANNIVERSARY OF RPSA / SPSA},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {The text dedicated to the 60th anniversary of Russian Political Science
   Association is devoted to the genesis, mission and role of this
   organization in the context of political development of the past decades
   and current trends in the evolution of modern politics. The key threats
   the modern political science is facing are divided into two main sets.
   The first one includes relations of political science and political
   practice, or how global and local challenges shape the modern social
   knowledge. The second set includes development issues of the discipline:
   correlation of the world science mainstream with the agenda and
   configuration of Russian political science; dichotomy of the foundations
   of political science - theoretic, conceptual and imperatively
   pluralistic; conjugation of fundamental and applied areas and their
   thematic content; comparative analysis of the effectiveness of research
   strategies and methods; the relevance of the applied performance
   evaluation system of scientific activity in political science. The
   importance of political science today is determined, in the author's
   opinion, by the fact that the dominant feature of the current era
   (post-modern in its essence) has become the compound symbiosis of
   politics and economics. Ideas, ideals, interests and technologies of
   their conjugation constitute the subject of political science. In terms
   of the second law of thermodynamics, political science is an
   institutional tool against irreversible dissipation of social energy.
   The complexity of political science in this case is that is operates
   with patterns of probability character, most of which are applicable
   only in a short time perspective. This, in the author's opinion,
   determines the need for constant self-reflection of the discipline,
   which does represent the mission of RPSA and its social function - to
   create the formats and provide for stability of professional
   communication. The author examines the formats and technologies of
   implementation of RPSA's social function as a significant civil society
   institution which continues to form its identity in the context of
   qualitative increase in complexity of social changes and domination of
   nonlinear processes.},

Abstract = {Citizens delegate the representation of their political preferences to
   members of Parliament (MPs), who are supposed to represent their
   interests in the legislature. However, MPs are exposed to a variety of
   interest groups seeking to influence their voting behavior. We argue
   that interest groups influence how MPs cast their vote in Parliament,
   but that this effect varies across groups. While lobbying by sectional
   groups provides incentives for MPs to defect from their constituents, we
   expect that cause groups in fact strengthen the link between MPs and
   their voters. We test our argument based on an innovative study of 118
   Swiss public referenda, which allows for directly comparing voter
   preferences with legislative voting of 448 MPs on these issues. Drawing
   on a multilevel regression analysis, this study shows that interest
   groups considerably affect the link between MPs and their voters. Our
   findings have important implications for our understanding of political
   representation.},

Abstract = {This research aims at shedding light on the relations between
   Giambattista Vico's philosophy and Gramsci's political thought. We here
   do not simply take note of the conceptual relations, even if they may
   seem striking to those who know the two thinkers, but we single out the
   particular conditions of Gramsci's understanding of Vico, studying in
   particular the complexity of how Vico's thought became widespread in
   nineteenth-century Italy.},

Abstract = {Starting from epistemological reference that is framed in the
   consolidation of modern knowledge, the article shows how these
   references were adopted by Colombian intellectuals to understand the
   situation of the country in the first half of the twentieth century.
   From this perspective, Colombian society had not reached higher stages
   of development, that means that the country was in a minority, so, it
   could be classified as an infant society to be wary. Doctors Miguel
   Jimenez and Luis Lopez de Mesa suggest that genetic and geographical
   conditions made the Colombians a distorted version of the European and
   Anglo-Saxon peoples, so that, it is proposed the adoption of eugenic
   policies related to immigration of Europeans, as well as educational
   measures to promote the discipline of the body and hygienic strategies,
   all in order to improve human race.},

Abstract = {How is the political participation of Asian immigrant communities
   portrayed by local mainstream media? How does coverage vary over time,
   by immigrant group, and by host country? This article examines the civic
   presence of Indian and Vietnamese immigrants in Boston, San Jose,
   Toronto, and Vancouver from 1985 to 2005. We measure civic presence
   using a database of 224 articles from the primary newspaper of record in
   each city, representing a 10\% random sample of all articles covering
   the political participation of these groups. We find that both the
   frequency and tone of mainstream news coverage vary based on a
   combination of group-level characteristics and national reception
   contexts, such that the civic presence of Asian-origin immigrant
   communities differs significantly between national-origin groups, and
   for the same group across countries. These findings point to the need
   for more heterogeneous approaches to the study of Asian minority
   politics in North America.},

Abstract = {Some epistemic approaches to democracy evince an exclusivistic approach
   to voting participation whereby high turnout elections are thought to
   produce adverse outcomes. On this view, high turnout introduces greater
   input from less politically competent citizens which, in turn, leads to
   bad governance. I challenge these claims from both an empirical and
   normative perspective by defending procedural democracy against
   epistemic democracy. I argue that it is mistaken to privilege epistemic
   considerations over other values that democracy is meant to serve, in
   this case, political equality, liberty and representativeness. Further,
   it is not clear that high voter turnout leads to worse government. In
   sum, (electoral) epistemic democracy is hard to justify given that (a)
   even in theory it is unconvincing as a form of democracy and (b) even on
   its own terms it is not demonstrably better than procedural democracy at
   `performing' democracy.},

Abstract = {We analyze effects of physical appearance on-electoral results. Existing
   work has so far mostly focused on direct effects of perceived attraction
   and paid little attention to both competence and likability and to the
   potential conditioning of effects. Using an online survey, we capture
   which direct candidate in the German general election 2013 was regarded
   as more attractive, competent or likable compared to his closest rival
   and what drives the impression (e.g. glasses, beard). We find that
   perceived competence and attractiveness have substantial direct effects
   on election results. Likability has a separate effect only among female
   competitors, young candidates profit disproportionally from both
   attractiveness and competence while for non-incumbents perceived
   attractiveness plays a role.},

   Elections},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},

Pages = {104-115},
Abstract = {The European elections in 2014 were the first to be held after a long
   period in which EU-related news was prominent in the media. They were
   held after years of daily news about the euro crisis and after months of
   news about the popular uprising in the Ukraine against president
   Yanukovych, who had refused to sign the association agreement with the
   EU. This could have invited political parties to overcome the usual
   problem of low salience of EU issues by strongly profiling themselves on
   EU issues. Turnout at the 2014 EU elections, however, remained low,
   hinting that parties were unable to convert the attention for European
   issues into enthusiasm for their party at the European elections. This
   paper asks how vote choice was influenced by party campaigning on EU
   related issues. A news effects analysis based on a content analysis of
   Dutch newspapers and television, and on a panel survey among Dutch
   voters revealed that EU issues functioned as wedge issues: the more
   strongly parties were associated in the news with the euro crisis and
   the Ukraine, the less they succeeded in mobilizing voters.},

Title = {Violence against Women in Politics: A Defense of the Concept},
Journal = {POLITICA Y GOBIERNO},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {459-490},
Abstract = {The phenomenon of violence against women in politics is gaining growing
   and urgent attention from actors around the globe. Piscopo (2016)
   criticizes emerging theories and strategies to theorize and combat this
   problem, arguing that scholars have accepted activist definitions at
   face value, violence against women in politics is simply a sub-category
   of violence in politics more generally, weak State capacity and criminal
   justice systems (the result of incomplete democratic consolidation)
   explain this phenomenon, these acts of violence do not only violate
   women's political rights but also other laws, legislation is
   insufficient given widespread impunity for criminal offenses, and
   further state actors and policies should be activated to tackle this
   issue. In response, we argue that nascent academic studies do bring new
   tools to bear on definitions of this phenomenon. We maintain that
   violence against women in politics is distinct from violence in
   politics, seeking to prevent women's participation as women. Worryingly,
   this problem is present in all regions of the world, not just Latin
   America, although context may influence the content and prevalence of
   different categories of violent acts. This violence is more than a
   criminal issue, posing a serious challenge to democracy, human rights,
   and gender equality such that even ineffective laws can play an
   important normative role in validating these acts as a ``problem{''}.
   Solutions, finally, should not only be pursued by the State, but instead
   engage a host of different actors. Although debates continue, we
   conclude that scholars and activists should not abandon the concept of
   violence against women in politics, but rather, should work together to
   bring this problem into focus and ensure that men and women are able to
   participate in politics equally without fear of violence.},

Abstract = {Since the 1980s, there has existed in Poland an unshakable myth of the
   West as the better, morally superior world. Even after the accession of
   the East Central Europeans to the European Union, this myth lived on.
   But in recent years, the various crises in the EU, the refugees issue,
   and a generational turnover have led to an erosion of the West's
   positive image. The Eurosceptic governments in Budapest and Warsaw draw
   on another tradition. They are putting distance between themselves and
   West European influences.},

Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {55-60},
Abstract = {In the globalizing world of financial and economic interdependence, a
   polycentric, multi-level, and hierarchical system of global financial
   regulation is emerging. The article highlights two vectors of recent
   development in international financial regulation: the rise of
   cooperation through the mechanisms of the Group of Twenty (G-20) on the
   one hand, and the efforts to maintain the US leading role in global
   finance, on the other hand. In the circumstances of the global financial
   crisis of 2008, the G-20 countries initiated an international reform of
   financial regulation. According to G-20 decisions, international
   standard-setting organizations developed transnational regulatory
   regimes in the fields of banking, derivatives and bankruptcy resolution,
   and the states now implement these regimes in their jurisdictions. The
   so-called ``soft law system{''}, which is not legally binding, allows
   the states to sustain national sovereignty in their financial policy.
   The United States play a leading role in the international financial
   reform, as well as in the shaping of the global financial regulation
   system. The American regulators push for extraterritorial application of
   the US norms and take other unilateral actions on the international
   arena. The article also touches upon legitimacy problems of the emerging
   system of global financial regulation. The most important constrains are
   the excessive influence of the financial industry ({''}regulatory
   capture{''}), the weakness of civil society participation, and also the
   fact that for the rest of the world the American norms lack legitimacy,
   as they are adopted by regulators assigned by officials elected by
   population of a foreign territory.},

   pro-NATO and pro-European Union government. Russia's actions are
   considered in the wider context of the political transformation in
   Soviet space, the enlargement of the European Union and the expansion of
   NATO. Russia's economic and military strengths and weaknesses are
   outlined against the background of the development of the Eurasian

Title = {Why We Love to Hate the Wolf (of Wall Street): Using Georges Bataille
   and Friedrich Nietzsche to Critique the Function of Moral Ideology Under
   Late Capitalism},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {81-99},
Abstract = {The release of Martin Scorsese's film The Wolf of Wall Street in late
   2013 helped to reignite a public conversation about corporate greed and
   the moral excesses and violations of Wall Street firms and executives. A
   barrage of articles, reviews, and criticisms of the film emerged
   throughout popular media that sought, for the most part, to single out
   and condemn the immoral actions and behaviors of individuals (for
   example, Jordan Belfort, whose actions constitute the primary subject
   matter of the film) within a pre-given and non-negotiable context of
   capitalist economic and social relations. This article uses the writings
   of Georges Bataille and Friedrich Nietzsche to critique this popular
   discourse. It reads the discourse as structured by a false identity of
   opposites, whereby the normal, moral, legal, and ``peaceful{''} state of
   things is depicted as constitutive of a separate world from that of
   Belfort and the ``criminal{''} excesses and expenditures of Wall Street.
   As a result of this conceptual maneuver, a mode of moralizing is
   enabled. In a fit of ressentiment, critics unleash their moralizing
   sentiments, single out and constitute guilty subjects, and hold these
   subjects responsible in order to repair the ``secondary malfunctions{''}
   of capitalism. They do this so that capitalism can continue to survive
   and so they can have a good conscience while it does.},

Abstract = {This study was undertaken to develop and validate an instrument for
   gerontological policymakers, practitioners, and researchers to
   comprehensively assess the nature and severity of problems experienced
   by older adults. The Comprehensive Ageing Problem Scale (CAPS) for older
   adults living in the community was created as a reliable and valid
   instrument that is easy to use. A cross-sectional strategy was utilized,
   in which a total sample of 1060 older South Korean adults was selected
   (through a proportionate random-stratified sampling method) from four
   regions nationwide. The psychometric properties of the instrument were
   verified using item analysis, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and
   confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). To achieve cross-validity, the total
   sample was randomly divided into two groups. The first group (for the
   EFA) was employed to identify the factor structure of the initial scale.
   The second group (for the CFA) was used to confirm the factor structure
   of the revised scale with the first group. The final version of the
   19-item CAPS with four factors showed good internal consistency and a
   CFA confirmed the acceptability of the model fit.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {151-164},
Abstract = {Basing itself on the concept of the ``historical epoch{''} (Lenin 1988c,
   143), this article contends that today's world is still in the epoch of
   financial imperialism as Lenin employed the term. The two epochal themes
   are those of war and revolution, and of peace and development. The
   contradictory movement, unity of opposites and mutual transformation
   that take place between these two themes determine the specific features
   of the various periods of a given historical epoch. Financial
   imperialism is a special and also the highest (last) phase in the
   development of capitalist society, and may continue to exist for a
   lengthy historical period. As the diverse, accumulated long-term
   contradictions of today's world grow deeper, we may be entering a more
   turbulent period full of disasters and conflicts. As a result, we cannot
   equate the theme of ``peace and development{''} in the contemporary
   world with actual entry into the epoch of ``peace and development{''};
   instead, we must recognize that there has been no fundamental change in
   the essence and basic contradictions of the epoch of imperialism, and
   while maintaining confidence in the future, we should remain alert even
   during peaceful periods.},

Journal = {AUSTRIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {45},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {11-21},
Abstract = {When Austria joined the EU in 1995, it was expected that the Austrian
   government would increase the Official Development Assistance (ODA)
   budget and organise their aid management more in line with European and
   international standards. There was thus an expectation that Austria
   would witness a Europeanization of its development policy. Looking at
   the situation after 20 years of membership, it seems that Austria took
   on board the European development rhetoric without a significant
   increase of the overall ODA budget. Although a more professional
   Austrian Development Agency (ADA) has been established, ODA is still
   focused more on neighbourhood policy in the Western Balkans and in
   promoting foreign trade interests in the Caucasus region than on poverty
   reduction in the global south and in delivering contributions to the
   global public goods. Due to the lack of a strong binding acquis, Austria
   has been able to hide under the umbrella of an European Development
   policy with development rhetoric and some adjustment of implementing
   structures without any significant financial disbursements.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},

Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Research on agenda-setting dynamics in American politics has a rich and
   deep history. Recent efforts to extend this work into other countries
   provides a comparative perspective on how differing institutional
   designs shape attention allocation and punctuated equilibrium. This
   comparison is not only possible cross-nationally, but also between the
   American states. Using an untapped resource-the Pennsylvania Policy
   Agendas Project-the author replicates three components of punctuated
   equilibrium and agenda-setting theory (leptokurtic budget distributions,
   agenda-opinion correspondence, and media effects) that provide a
   benchmark for future comparative analysis as additional states join the
   project. This work argues that these efforts are beneficial not only for
   understanding agenda dynamics within the states, but also broader issues
   of representation, responsiveness, and their relationship with
   institutional design.},

   Education Courses},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},

Abstract = {The use of service-learning pedagogies in general education courses is
   often limited to increasing volunteerism or civic literacy with
   problem-based or research-based projects reserved for upper level
   courses. This article examines the implementation of an ``actionable
   data{''} service-learning project in an introductory, general studies
   course, which enrolled mostly freshmen and nonmajors. Combining elements
   of community-based research, action research, and service-learning, this
   project required students to undertake a research project on their own
   campus designed to affect meaningful policy change. Students used basic
   social science research methods to understand the policy-making process,
   to gather information from various stakeholders, to analyze alternative
   proposals, and to lobby for change. I examine the process for
   implementing this type of student-directed project and the limits of
   this type of service-learning assignment. Analysis of student reactions
   to the project indicates that participation had a positive effect on
   their interest in civic engagement and their sense of efficacy. This
   type of project is a low-cost and effective option to introduce students
   to social science research and service-learning in general education
   courses.},

   Models in Europe},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},

Volume = {53},

Pages = {187-215},
Abstract = {The link between employment policies and social policies influence the
   subjective perception of individual uncertainty. The labor market model
   has an important role on the perception of uncertainty. Employment in
   itself is not enough insurance guarantee income. Part-time work and
   temporary contracts generates a growing demand for policies of income
   redistribution in the South and Eastern Europe. In Scandinavia countries
   the same types of labor contracts generate less inequality because
   government employment contributes to a ``virtuous circle{''} that favors
   equality policies and the reconciliation of work and family life.
   Individually pro-redistributive attitudes are implemented more by women,
   also for those with uncertainty in their income and low education. By
   contrast, those who rely more on individual success and merit are the
   young college-educated and those earning higher incomes.},

Abstract = {The metaphysics of domestic reform seems to be the leitmotif of Russian
   political science. The debate about the direction of the reforms of the
   last 25 years, about the nature and specifics of transformation of the
   society and the individual constantly come up in various contexts, the
   intersection point of which is the identification of relations between
   political and institutional transformation and the status of Russia as a
   subject of historical creativity. The goals and results of
   transformations in the social and individual projections reflect
   multilayered overlay of civilizational parameters of Russian society,
   its social canvas, social needs and political strategies. The problem of
   social stability and variability correlates with the notions of subjects
   and objects of political and economic reforms, their ideological
   intentions and the dominant socio-political discourses. The ambiguity of
   the outcomes of the reforms in Russia implicates research perspective of
   categorization and understanding of the essential forces of the
   individual and the society: understanding the social features of Russia,
   reflection of social needs in the mass consciousness, the political
   meanings of the reformation and finally the destiny of man.},

Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {Since the 1990's, more and more studies have been analyzing conceptions
   of democracy. This study focuses on determinants of conceptions of
   democracy in the Arab world. Therefore, we distinguish between input-
   and output-oriented conceptions of democracy. Whereas the former ones
   are highlighting procedural elements of democracy, the latter ones focus
   on materialistic aspects of democracy. We test different theories
   (modernization theory, social capital theory, political culture theory,
   diffusion theory, culture theory and the impact of the Arab Spring) on
   the basis of the third wave of the Arabbarometer (2012-2014) using a
   logistic multilevel model allowing us to include both individual and
   context effects. Our results show that the likelihood of having
   internalized an input-oriented conception of democracy rises with higher
   formal education, income, bridging social capital, political interest or
   the regular attending of the Friday prayers. Additionally, we can show
   that especially in Egypt and Tunisia democracy is understood in the
   sense of an output-conception.},

   Policies and Local Experiences in Rural Rwanda},
Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {278-298},
Abstract = {Despite the growing importance of the concept human security, security
   studies in Africa remain largely focused on the threat of direct
   violence and the role of state actors. This article broadens the
   security agenda by focusing on food security and discusses how women in
   rural Rwanda experience and view food security. In making individual
   women the referent of security, the article exposes the gap between
   national level reforms, which aim to and have been deemed successful to
   combat poverty and increase food production, and the experiences of
   women who report a decline in food availability and increased problems
   in accessing food in the wake of reforms and who often struggle against
   hunger in a disadvantaged position within their households and local
   power structures. Building on 51 interviews with women in western Rwanda
   conducted in 2013 and 2014, the article illustrates how the human
   security perspective with a sensitivity to gender relations and
   positions is important for gaining a fuller picture of the security of
   individuals.},

Abstract = {The excessive territorial fragmentation leads to low budget revenues and
   development potential at national, local and regional levels. Since the
   competences of central, regional, and local authorities are intertwined,
   competences of these administrative bodies ought to be defined clearly
   and legislated decisively so that they stand firmly against any future
   attempt to bend them. The processes of decentralization and
   regionalization are companions to economic and political reform. These
   policies are interlinked, therefore by clear division of
   responsibilities and competences; this will increase the institutional
   capacities of the local public authorities in terms of regional
   development policy and projects implementation.
   Eastern partnership countries' aspiration to accession to EU calls for
   their transformation into competitive countries, able to ensure economic
   growth based on European trends. The desire for accession was an
   important factor for administrative and territorial reform processes
   (based on principles of regionalism, multi-level governance and
   subsidiarity) in most countries. Some of the countries chose regional
   development policy and division in regions, levels at which development
   is planned and implemented and levels at which is easier identifying the
   development possibilities, and stimulating and controlling development
   in harmony with national goals.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},

Abstract = {This paper examines committee behavior in Colombia to determine whether
   parties or coalitions exert agenda-setting powers despite the fact that
   the formal rules seemingly create little incentive for cooperation.
   Colombia's party system is extremely fragmented, electoral volatility is
   high, and there is a long history of candidate-centered electoral rules,
   all of which suggests that party and coalition leaders have few tools to
   control the legislative agenda. Additionally, chairs do not directly
   control committee reports as in other presidential cases. However, the
   naming of ponentes (rapporteurs) to write ponencias (bill reports) for
   the committee may give leaders the opportunity to set the agendas in
   committees. Hence, we test whether committee chairs strategically name
   ponentes to control the agenda and favor their partisan or coalition
   interests. We test these ideas using a unique dataset covering two
   complete legislative sessions and thousands of bills. Overall, we find
   that committee chairs use the ponente process to set the agenda and
   privilege legislation sponsored by allies, especially the executive.},

Abstract = {We frequently observe that politicians accept lucrative private sector
   employment after leaving office, but we have little systematic evidence
   that politicians are able to profit from their government service. In
   this paper, we examine the returns to office that many former senators
   and governors receive from serving on the boards of directors of
   publicly traded corporations, part-time positions where the average
   compensation exceeds \$250,000 per year. We find that almost half of all
   former senators and governors serve on at least one board after leaving
   office. Using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, we estimate that
   winning a Senate or gubernatorial election increases the probability of
   later serving on a corporate board by roughly 30\%. For senators, we
   find that developing skills and connections through committee service,
   particularly in areas such as finance or military, is associated with
   increased board service after leaving office.},

Abstract = {The basque and catalan conflict -the second nowadays at his peak- demand
   a revamp of Spain's constitutional order to adapt the organization of
   the state to the diverse structure of the country. Such reform should be
   addressed taking into account the radical transformations resulting from
   its integration into the European Union project and from an increasingly
   interdependent comunity at the international level. This article points
   out the most important aspects of the reform or (where relevant) of the
   constitutional review that the author considers more feasible. This
   appraisal will be carried out based on the analysis of the current
   situation and looking to the future, as well as on the experience gained
   with the political transition, the constitutional consensus and the so
   called Authonomic State-making process. However, the sucess of this
   commitment within the constitutional and legal framework depends on
   something that is out of the shaping capacity of the law -the political
   and social life renewal, as well as of the institutions- and has a
   crucial importance for the functioning of a complex state such as the
   spanish and, therefore, for the vitality and authenticity of the
   territorial pluralism without affecting (in a substantive -not formal-
   way) the constitutional unity.},

Abstract = {The article shows how powerful colonial discourses are in Switzerland,
   especially with regard to popular narratives on national identity. It
   starts with the Swiss Dhaulagiri expedition of 1960, which led to the
   first ascent of this Himalayan mountain, and how it is remembered 50
   years later. The paper examines how in the discourse surrounding this
   expedition, the colonial trajectory of mountain climbing is linked to
   the use of technology (in this case aviation) and the emergence of white
   masculinity. It is argued that up to the present day, this
   `techno-colonialism' is crucial for the self-conception of Switzerland.},

Abstract = {While there have been numerous critiques of the ideology of technology,
   it is useful to situate technology within both a liberal and a
   conspiratorial framework. The early work of Auguste Comte offers an
   ideal vehicle for this kind of analysis. Liberalism's embrace of
   technology is developed in Comte to produce a theory of scientific and
   technical elites intent on reinventing society and the individual. This
   ``technological conspiracy{''} reads very much like elements of a
   Silicon Valley manifesto describing the cyber-utopia of a near tomorrow.
   For these reasons Comte is relevant to a discussion of conspiracy today.},

   non-permanent United Nations Security Council members},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {A number of recent studies have found that temporary members of the
   United Nations Security Council (UNSC) experience increased foreign aid
   inflows. We use a constrained permutations approach to replicate
   analyses found in Vreeland and Dreher (2014). Permuting the timing of
   country membership on the Security Council, we create placebo UNSC
   membership histories which plausibly could have been observed. We use
   these placebos to construct a reference distribution for the null
   hypothesis that there is no relationship between UNSC membership and
   foreign aid flows and then observe whether or not the observed test
   statistic for the correlation found in the real-world data is in the
   tails of this distribution. In other contexts, such empirically based
   hypothesis tests have revealed a high false-positive rate for
   traditional, model-based time-series cross-sectional inference. Given
   the controversial nature of studies about increased aid flows as
   secondary benefits of UNSC membership, it is valuable to subject such
   analyses to additional scrutiny. Our reanalysis largely validates
   existing findings.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {61-70},
Abstract = {This article contributes to the discussion surrounding involvement of
   interest groups in the political process on the European and global
   level. My purpose here is to examine how groups of interest can affect
   EU's role as a global actor and find out which mode of lobbying
   regulation could strengthen Europe's position in global governance. In
   this article, I am trying to bind concepts which at first glance might
   seem quite remote: groups of interests and global governance. By
   analyzing Europe's position on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment
   Partnership (TTIP) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), I argue that
   European ambitions on international arena are undermined by inner
   tensions. These tensions are mainly caused by discrepancy in positions
   of different groups of interest who try to influence the outcome of the
   political process and, thus, make it less stable and predictable. At the
   same time, adequate lobbying regulation could increase accountability
   and transparency and, therefore, help to overcome inconsistencies in
   EU's position in global governance system. The results suggest that
   without proper backing from inside actors like business groups and civil
   society associations the EU will constantly wobble and will not be able
   to fully achieve its global goals.},

Abstract = {The article addresses significant aspects of the constitution of the
   European Union's social basis from the broader perspective of a European
   space under construction. The specific point of view regards the process
   of Europeanization through enlargement to the post-socialist Eastern and
   South European countries, and conditionality as its main instrument. In
   the light of the five-year moratorium proposed by the Juncker Commission
   in 2015, the process is examined particularly from its margins by
   considering the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), i.e. the last
   country in the `Western Balkans', together with Kosovo, that is not yet
   a candidate for EU membership. The analysis aims to shed light on two
   different and conflictual forms of agency: first, the institution
   building process through accession procedures; second, social dissent
   patterns and citizens' mobilization in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The
   purpose is to analyze if and how these diverse agencies cross borders
   and soften boundaries to constitute an emerging European society. A
   constant methodological concern of this study is if and how an
   ethnography of the process may contribute to the analysis of European
   integration in its complex, non-linear and often contradictory nature
   (Kauppi 2013).},

Abstract = {Media space is a part of social space covered by means of mass
   communication. Social environment, saturated with visual images,
   gradually turns into visual space, and if controlled by visual mass
   media, it turns into visual media space. Visualization is, on the one
   hand, a tool for orientation in the world, and on the other hand, it is
   a means of representing the world, in other dimensions and projections.
   The media space, rich with political content, turns into a political
   media space, formed mainly by political stakeholders to influence the
   target segment - for example, the electoral audience. The media space
   produces the most effective political impact on people. This, in
   particular, explains the emergence of mass society, which is dominated
   by the average perception of the familiar world of images, which
   saturated the world. Today, a strong system of mass communications
   exists, which affects human behavior. If earlier, less rigid
   stratification dominated in society, the blurring of its boundaries
   shows the development of ``mass man{''} society. In this society, elite
   gets less recognizable as it is mixed with the crowd. Political
   competition and one-sidedness, poor information culture of those who
   produce visual content seriously distort the media space environment.
   Therefore, visual informaiton that is associated with aggression,
   violence, killings of civilians by Ukrainian military in the
   southeastern Ukraine, dominates on TV screen. Visualization of media
   space by various means, described in this article, can become a powerful
   tool of political influence.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},

Abstract = {For over a decade, academia has been engaged in a lively discussion of
   how to internationalize the curriculum so that students are better
   prepared to step into the role of global citizens. This article
   contributes to the discussion of methods that can be employed to further
   promote internationalization. The article examines a class project
   designed with the goal of connecting students through the use of
   Facebook in order to expand their global awareness and perspectives. In
   the project, students from U.S. and non-U.S. colleges posted images and
   descriptions of international relations concepts. By recognizing that
   others around the world attribute different ( and sometimes similar)
   meanings to these concepts, students broadened their own understandings
   and gained a greater awareness of the diversity in the study of
   international relations. A review of three iterations of the project
   yields useful feedback for future endeavors. While this study is focused
   on international relations concepts, the framework could also be adapted
   for other topic areas where a comparative perspective would be
   beneficial.},

Abstract = {The article attempts to systematize the most important informal
   practices that ensure stability of authoritarian regimes. In particular,
   the analysis of the post-Soviet cases identifies costs and benefits (in
   terms of stability of the ruling coalition) of cooptation mechanisms
   based on the principles of nepotism, clientelism and patronage. S. Shkel
   draws the conclusion that the formation of the ruling coalition based on
   clan principle is the least effective way to retain power, fraught with
   destabilization of the regime. Clientelism is somewhat better at this
   task, because it allows to build the ruling coalition on a broader
   basis. Patronage seems to be the optimal strategy. However, the use of
   patronage practices requires significant resources, which makes this
   strategy almost inaccessible to those countries that experience a
   shortage of material resources.},

Abstract = {In April 1946, the first post-war course of the Imperial Defence College
   (IDC) got underway with General Bill Slim as the new commandant. The
   college had been established during the interwar years to provide an
   opportunity for senior military officers and civil servants from Britain
   and the Commonwealth to gain a better understanding of higher strategy
   and how it was conducted. Andrew Stewart examines Slim's role in the
   reopening of the IDC as Britain re-thought its role in international
   politics. He shows that the students at the college would spend much of
   their time studying what is now referred to as soft' and hard' power,
   and over the eight months of the course they gained a much better
   understanding of the influence Britain wielded in the world.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {This paper presents data from the analyses of political party web pages
   during the 2009 European Parliament elections in Estonia. It examines
   the presence and absence of web 2.0 features on the sites and aims to
   find out whether interactivity-based applications are used by parties to
   increase participation and to foster deliberative politics. Estonia as a
   small ex-Soviet country has emerged after the Soviet Union collapse as
   one of the most advanced e-societies in the world. Therefore, Estonia is
   chosen as a case study to explore whether and how decision makers use
   web 2.0 elements for fostering Habermasian dialogue between the citizens
   and the power holders in the society where technical obstacles for
   deliberative politics do not exist any longer. The results show that the
   Estonian parties still focus on the one-sided or top-down model of
   communication, based on web 1.0 features, even though all conditions for
   deliberation from the technical and infrastructural side in Estonia are
   fulfilled. The paper concludes with a discussion on the possible reasons
   parties might not be interested in using web 2.0 elements in their web
   campaign and how it might be linked to the conditions where citizens'
   participation and interest in politics is low. There is also emphasis on
   the need for further systematic comparative research in order to draw
   conclusions on the changes in the online campaigning and political
   communication process in the era of cyber-democracy.},

Abstract = {This article explains why some presidential crises end up with the
   resignation of the president and others trigger the impeachment against
   him. Research results suggest that: a) some of the variables that shape
   Executive-Legislative relation and causes political instability, also
   explain the way the instability is resolved in the framework of the
   presidential regime; and that b) the isolated influence of these key
   factors does not explain, by itself, early departures modalities of

Abstract = {This article explores the way in which the UK Political Studies
   Association (PSA) has sought to tackle issues of inclusion within the
   profession. UK political science is dominated by white males, and while
   women have made progress, we argue this is less so for black, Asian and
   minority ethnic colleagues. In both cases, we view progress as likely to
   be limited without proactive intervention strategies. We draw on work
   that we have recently been doing with the PSA and offer some positive
   strategies for embedding this agenda within the profession. We argue
   that for a vibrant, pluralist and healthy political science, a diversity
   of academics is needed, and that learned societies and professional
   organisations have a key role to play in advancing this agenda.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the special issue on constituency representation
   in France, Belgium and Germany. First, it proposes a brief state of the
   art to show that the literature on European parliamentary systems
   concentrates on the legislators' activities in the house but it remains
   comparatively limited regarding their activities outside Parliament. It
   is even more so in the three countries under study. This lack of
   comprehensive knowledge is problematic, considering the centrality of
   political representation in modern democracies but the current context
   of declining trust and confidence in representative institutions.
   Second, it describes the data from the CITREP and IMPLOC(BEL) projects
   as well as the original methodology used by the articles. Indeed, this
   special issue takes a new approach and combines different types of data
   and methods to analyse the concrete practices of parliamentarians on the
   ground. Finally, this article explains the main research questions,
   hypothesis and variables to be tested in the special issue, including
   institutional and individual factors.},

Volume = {11},

Abstract = {The relationship of women to conditions of material austerity is often
   characterised as having two main themes: women as recipients of charity
   and the question of which women are entitled to various forms of
   charitable and state assistance. This paper discusses the ways in which
   discourses about women and charity are highly moralised, assuming both
   that women are unlikely to `ask for more' and that women have to be
   `good' and `respectable' in order to deserve public assistance. In the
   concluding section, the paper considers the ways in which women's
   `respectability' has become associated with participation in the labour
   market, and the various ways in which this constitutes a new form of the
   `deserving' female poor.},

Abstract = {Since the end oil.{*} 2015, Turkey has been mired in a spiral of
   violence. The escalating clashes between Ankara and the Kurdistan
   Kurdistan Party (PKK) have shifted to urban settlements. Some suggest
   that Turkey is moving towards civil war while others assert that all
   these clashes can still be understood within the terror/counter-terror
   paradigm. When analyzing the space of clashes, the actors involved, the
   level of popular support, and some certain thresholds olviolence, the
   author concludes that the current state of the conflict is in a limbo
   zone beyond the terror/Counter-terror paradigm and below the
   insurgency/counter-insurgency (COLN) paradigm. There/bre, he argues.
   Ankara should alter its enemy -centric strategy of fighting the PKK, and
   instead employ a hybrid approach that draws from both paradigms.},

Title = {Economic inequality, winner-loser gap, and satisfaction with democracy},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {44},
Pages = {85-97},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study analyzes how economic inequality affects electoral winners
   and losers' satisfaction with democracy. We posit that both the poor and
   the rich have more at stake in elections when inequality is high.
   Electoral losers, whether they are the poor or the rich, are more likely
   to be dissatisfied with democratic systems when facing greater disparity
   in wealth. In contrast, electoral winners confronting higher inequality
   are more likely to express satisfaction with democracy. Employing a
   multilevel analysis of Comparative Study Electoral Systems (CSES) data,
   we find that the gap in satisfaction with democracy between electoral
   winners and losers widens as income inequality increases. Broadening the
   conventional wisdom that electoral systems mediate the effect of
   citizens' winner-loser status on their democratic attitudes, we
   demonstrate that the mediating effects of economic inequality are more
   critical than the institutional effects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {This paper explores the conditions under which voters in emerging
   democracies support non-viable candidates. We argue that cognitive
   biases and the geographic clustering of minor-party supporters in
   ethno-political enclaves lead to misperceptions about the electoral
   prospects of minor-party candidates, weakening strategic defections both
   among co-ethnic and non-co-ethnic supporters. We explore these arguments
   using original survey data from Kenya's 2007 presidential election, a
   contest that featured a minor-party candidate, Kalonzo Musyoka, who
   stood little chance of electoral victory. Despite this, results show
   that most of his supporters chose to vote for the candidate, failing to
   perceive that he was not a viable contender. The findings suggest that
   theories of political behavior in multi-ethnic settings can be enriched
   by drawing upon insights from the political psychology literature on
   belief formation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The nuclear program is arguably Kim Jong-un's strategic fantasy and core
   asset for breaking the status quo in order to achieve a unified Korea.
   To cope with North Korea's grave nuclear and missile threats, the
   Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system needs to be deployed
   in South Korea for deterrence by denial. In the meantime, the United
   Nations Security Council (UNSC) should not exclude the military option
   in the event of any further nuclear test and Intercontinental Ballistic
   Missile (ICBM) launch experiment by North Korea. The U.S. government
   should consider redeploying tactical nuclear warheads to South Korea in
   order to make the extended deterrence more effective. The South Korean
   government should make it clear that the Republic of Korea (ROK) does
   not seek to join, nor will it be incorporated into, the U.S.-led missile
   defense system. The United States and China should cooperate with South
   Korea to take the lead in achieving a norm-oriented, nuclear-free, and
   unified Korea. In particular, ROK-U.S.-China strategic cooperation is
   essential to preventing any potential nuclear warfare and maintaining
   peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. South Korea, the United
   States and China should propose restructured negotiations on important
   issues that provide genuine incentives for Pyongyang, culminating in
   complete and verifiable denuclearization and a treaty that will end the
   tensions on the Peninsula. In addition, the trilateral cooperation needs
   to adopt a more proactive engagement policy to facilitate North Korea's
   lasting transformation.},

   violence, and the marginalization in Guatemala. This proposal considers
   that gangs are an exceptional example of the use of violence, and
   repairs in the orientation of these groups, towards the activities of
   transgression of law as a tool of affirmation and empowerment. The paper
   describes the impact of the unequal distribution of violence at the
   social level, it is accentuated in impoverished neighborhoods and
   acquired a chronic character. Finally, the article mentions social
   cleansing directed at the Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha because this
   phenomenon is a manifestation of the deepening of community aggressions.
   The violence is used by diverse social actors, the gangs are one more
   case of the necropolitics reality in Guatemala.},

Abstract = {In Zivotofsky v. Kerry, the Supreme Court engaged in an erroneous and
   unnecessary debate about the scope and definition of the president's
   powers over foreign affairs. It was unnecessary because the case
   embodied what was essentially a political question (which the Court
   chose not to address) concerning the nature of the legislative process.
   The Court discussed presidential power in terms of erroneous dicta in
   Youngstown v. Sawyer and U.S. v. Curtiss-Wright that miscast and
   misinterpret the nature of executive power. The result is a missed
   opportunity to clarify key aspects of the legislative process and a
   muddying of the waters concerning the conduct of foreign affairs.},

Abstract = {Present research was accomplished to survey penal mediation role in
   dissolving discord among peasants in Guilan province of Iran.
   Restorative justice is to make all parties participate in discord
   dissolution process and to decriminalize it with tools like mediation.
   It is based on a principle in which no culprit is pursued and also it is
   planning to relief victim. The law of criminal procedure in Article 82,
   projects ``mediation{''} subject in crime deterrent grades 6, 7, 8.
   These crimes usually are pardonable or at least private complainer
   pardon is effective in mitigation. This issue causes reduction of
   criminal files and also criminal costs. It facilitates the social revive
   of the criminal. Modern criminal justice believes that penal mediation
   as one of settlement methods should follow special regulations which
   guarantee criminal and victim rights. This research is presented in four
   sections. This research is practical and the method is descriptive -
   analytical. Statistical population is consisting of 160 persons from
   many different villages in Guilan province. In order to collect data,
   questionnaire was administered and data analysis was performed using
   SPSS software. In forth section of this research, considering related
   questions, we were after to prove hypotheses. Results showed that
   criminal mediation can be settled by meetings performed by elders of
   villages in Guilan province and it prevents fights and claim. As a new
   look of criminal justice, it can be used as an appropriate instrument
   for judiciary.},

Title = {Dubious Economic Partnership Why a China-Russia Free Trade Agreement Is
   Hard to Reach?},
Journal = {CHINA QUARTERLY OF INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIC STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2},
Number = {4},
Pages = {529-547},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Since the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade
   negotiations in the early 1990s, regional trade agreements of various
   types, including bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs), have replaced
   internationally comprehensive agreements as the main driver for
   development of official trade relations. There is also a tendency for
   such agreements to extend beyond trade and cover security and other
   issues. Russia is a ``resource-cursed{''} country like Australia, and
   there seems to be a prima facie case for China and Russia to conclude an
   FTA similar to the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA).
   However, Russia intends to promote free trade with China via the
   Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) because it views any FTA in
   quite narrow political and security terms, and its economic agenda is
   orientated toward new industrial development rather than trade
   development. In comparison, China prefers an FTA within the framework of
   the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) because it is, at the
   current stage, most interested in enhancing economic development and
   trade across the Central Asian and wider Eurasian regions. Russian
   resistance to the idea of an SCO-based FTA was one of the reasons for
   China's initial development of the land part of the ``One Belt, One Road
   (OBOR){''} initiative. While China and Russia have recently agreed to
   work toward an FTA between China and the EAEU, it is not quite hopeful
   in the near future, and a ChAFTA-type FTA between China and Russia will
   be even more difficult to achieve mainly due to Russia's lingering
   strategic considerations.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {39},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1230-1250},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The use of politically appointed ministerial advisors has increased
   noticeably in many Western countries, but we know little about how this
   development has affected the civil servants recruited on merit. The
   article asks whether political appointees accentuate or blur the line
   between politics and administration. Do political appointees take over
   political-tactical advice and leave policy advice to the permanent civil
   service, or do they cause permanent civil servants to be even more
   influenced by political considerations? And do political appointees make
   it easier or more difficult for the permanent civil service to be
   politically responsive? A Most Similar Systems Design comparison of
   Denmark and Sweden allows an assessment of the effects of political
   appointees. It is found that a large number of political appointees
   decreases functional politicisation of the permanent civil service; that
   functional politicisation tends to crowd out tasks related to more
   classic policy advice; and that functional politicisation increases
   political responsiveness.},

Abstract = {A key requirement of democratic governance is that policy outcomes and
   the majority preference of the electorate are congruent. Many studies
   argue that the more direct democratic a system is, the more often voters
   get what they want, but the empirical evidence is mixed. This analysis
   explores the democratic effect of initiatives and referendums
   theoretically and empirically. The prediction of the formal model is
   that ``bad{''} representation (i.e., a large preference deviation
   between the electorate and the political elite) is good for the
   democratic effect of direct democracy. An empirical investigation of
   original voter and elite survey data, analyzed with multilevel modeling
   and poststratification, supports this argument. Building on the
   literature, the findings of the analysis suggest that the extent to
   which direct democratic institutions are conducive for policy congruence
   - and may thus be advisable as democratic correctives to representative
   systems - depends on the political conflict structure.},

Abstract = {Research stresses that congressional committees increase their oversight
   of the bureaucracy during divided government. We extend this research by
   developing an explanation, rooted in a more dynamic view of
   policymaking, for why Congress would sometimes conduct vigorous
   oversight under unified control as well. In short, committees seem to
   engage in what we call retrospective oversight and take advantage of
   newly friendly executive administration to refocus existing policy made
   under a past opposition president. We assess our perspective using two
   separate sources of data on oversight hearings spanning more than 60
   years and find support for our claims regarding retrospective oversight.},

   a Realist Orientation to Politics},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {110},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Contemporary politics is often said to lack utopias. For prevailing
   understandings of the practical force of political theory, this looks
   like cause for celebration. As blueprints to apply to political
   practice, utopias invariably seem too strong or too weak. Through an
   immanent critique of political realism, I argue that utopian thought,
   and political theory generally, is better conceived as supplying an
   orientation to politics. Realists including Bernard Williams and Raymond
   Geuss explain how utopian programs like universal human rights poorly
   orient their adherents to politics, but the realists wrongly conclude
   that utopias and other ideal theories necessarily disorient us. As I
   show through an analysis of utopian claims made by Michel Foucault,
   Malcolm X, and John Rawls, utopias today can effectively disrupt
   entrenched forms of legitimation, foster new forms of political
   identity, and reveal new possibilities within existing institutions.
   Utopias are needed to understand the political choices we face today.},

Abstract = {This article explores some of the challenges generated by recent
   attempts to relate the concept of political corruption to real politics.
   It shows that the three distinct arguments upon which scholars who
   conceptualize political corruption through the lens of real politics
   often rely are ambiguous, and posit standards for the use of power on
   the basis of naive or conservative assumptions about politics. The
   article then contends that we do need to consider real politics in the
   study of political corruption, but not in the manner or for the reasons
   suggested in much current scholarship. Specifically, examining real
   politics can help us determine the form of any given case of political
   corruption. In making this argument, the article attempts to avoid the
   problems that accompany most real-politics-based understandings of
   corruption while retaining concern for how the discourse around
   political corruption might inFLuence political study and democratic
   politics.},

Abstract = {The culprit is one of the fixed parties in penal judgments and because
   he is to be stood before the social rights with the support of the
   prosecutor he enjoys a vulnerable judicial standpoint. The person being
   charged with a crime or an offence faces the judicial system in the
   preliminary investigation stage, in other words, pretrial stage. In this
   stage the culprit, due to the fact that has not been convicted to any
   crime, he has to undergo interrogation and investigation based on the
   acquittal principle and preservation of the human prestige and credit.
   Interrogating the culprit is the main axiom of the pretrial period and
   it is possible that the culprits be exposed to torture and inhumane
   behaviors as a result of their rights being ignored and their human
   dignity being refused by the interrogating bodies. Therefore, the
   accused person should be enjoying the rights and liberties under the
   shade of the fair judgment. On the other hand, fair judgment is not
   intended solely for safeguarding the accused person's defense rights,
   rather a just proceeding in its exact meaning is seeking to serve the
   preservation and supporting the rights and the liberties of all of the
   individuals who somehow share the legal procedure process. Observing a
   fair procedure should not be taken as to mean leniency for any single
   one person, rather observing such principles in the proceedings causes
   the humanity aspect of the parties not to be underestimated and justice
   and fairness can be implemented and served regarding their rights.
   In the present article because it is carried out in humanities realm we
   have tried to make use of an analytical-descriptive method through the
   use of the international charter of human rights and requirements and
   the constitutional laws in Iran and this is while the accused individual
   rights in the pretrial period has also been enumerated and elucidated on
   and then we deal with the survey of the Iran's judicial system and the
   international charter of human rights regarding the methods of keeping a
   hold onto such rules and regulations and consequently we will figure
   that in both of the described systems it has been frequently emphasized
   on observing the accused person's rights in the majority of the cases in
   this period and there has been criminal enforcement mandates for it.},

Abstract = {Despite their long-time physical presence in our country (Iran),
   non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have not been taken seriously by
   the government and public institutions, and play no effective role in
   criminal proceedings. An innovative by 2013 criminal procedure code is
   to realize doctrine of participatory criminal policy through NGOs
   participation in criminal proceedings, which has been provided for by
   legislator in Article 66 of mentioned code which was amended suddenly
   within a few days prior to being approved to come into effect on the
   basis of an interesting decision and which degraded NGOs' right to
   litigate into the limit of that of indictors and viewers at proceedings.
   During proceedings, NGOs play the role of indictors and viewers,
   regardless of the lack of legal, cultural and social grounds necessary
   for them to take an active part in criminal proceedings in our country;
   and, in effect, they face such limitations and ambiguities as criteria
   of the recognition of their qualifications to do so (Article 66,
   provision 3). In addition, it is not clear how to develop NGOs'
   participation in criminal proceedings and how to monitor their
   activities. Present study is intended to examine grounds of and barriers
   to NGO's activity in criminal proceedings and to address vital roles
   they can play in the crime prevention and their involvement with
   criminal proceedings.},

Abstract = {Recent studies document that voters infer parties' left-right positions
   from governing coalition arrangements. We show that citizens extend this
   coalition-based heuristic to the European integration dimension and,
   furthermore, that citizens' coalition-based inferences on this issue
   conflict with alternative measures of party positions derived from
   election manifestos and expert placements. We also show that citizens'
   perceptions of party positions on Europe matter, in that they drive
   substantial partisan sorting in the electorate. Our findings have
   implications for parties' election strategies and for mass-elite policy

Abstract = {Much of the research on organized interests concludes that lobbying has
   little influence on lawmaking. We argue that businesses often need only
   small actions from politicians in order to secure profitable outcomes in
   the marketplace. Case studies show how lobbyists affected the Air Cargo
   Deregulation Act in the 1970s, the Data Quality Act in the 2000s, and
   the recent Federal Trade Commission investigation of Herbalife. Hedge
   funds are particularly well situated to profit from small actions by
   lawmakers, as those political actions affect market values. As a largely
   unregulated sector, hedge funds are ideal for testing the idea that
   businesses lobby for directly profitable actions. Our time series
   analysis demonstrates that spending on lobbying coincides with the value
   of assets under management in hedge funds and with increases in the
   federal budget. Although the time series work cannot directly test our
   theory, our results do fit with the notion that businesses and financial
   firms treat spending on lobbying as an investment to protect their
   interests.},

Abstract = {The United States Supreme Court recently employed foreign legal sources
   to interpret U.S. law, provoking widespread political and legal
   controversy. Scholars have yet to examine systematically the conditions
   under which justices cite foreign law, however. Applying theoretical
   approaches from international relations and judicial politics
   scholarship, we search every Supreme Court opinion between 1953 and 2009
   for references to foreign law. Justices strategically reference foreign
   law to prop up their most controversial opinions. They also borrow law
   from countries whose domestic political institutions are viewed as
   legitimate; and, surprisingly, conservatives are as likely as liberals
   to cite foreign law. These findings add important information to the
   discussion over citing foreign law, and highlight how geopolitical
   context influences domestic legal policy.},

Abstract = {When do voters win? We derive conditions under which a democracy will
   produce policies that favor the voter over special interests in a
   setting where politicians can be influenced by contributions from
   special interests, and are also motivated by electoral incentives. We
   show that increasing office holding benefits, increasing political
   competition, decreasing potential rents to special interests, and
   increasing the salience of policy imply improved policies for the
   representative voter. We examine panel data on the ratio of taxes paid
   by individuals relative to corporations in the United States and show
   that it is negatively correlated with political competition, office
   holding benefits, and policy salience, as predicted by the model.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship on liberal exclusion focuses on ways in which liberal
   norms and standards of rationality disqualify certain persons from the
   rights of civic membership. Few works, however, move beyond
   philosophical anthropology in considering the basis of such exclusions.
   This article examines the economic concerns that frame citizenship and
   political membership in two strands of modern liberal thought: the work
   of John Locke and John Stuart Mill. I argue that both thinkers collapse
   requirements of economic and political membership, excluding the
   so-called ``nonindustrious{''} and economically dependent from the full
   rights and benefits of political membership, and creating a spectrum of
   partial citizenships. What begins as a concern for the value of labor in
   Locke's writings extends through Mill's work, creating a tension between
   democratic participation and the exclusion of the non-industrious.
   Although both thinkers include provisions for aiding the poor, a vision
   of economic membership - of inclusion in a community of the industrious
   - precedes political membership in these liberal frameworks.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the important role state political culture played in
   the race for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Donald Trump
   appealed to demographically distinct types of voters in the 2016
   Republican presidential primaries and caucuses that varied considerably
   from previous Republican presidential nominees. Relative to the
   demographics of the primary electorates, however, this study finds that
   state political culture played an outsized role in determining Donald
   Trump's relative level of support in a particular state. When state
   demographics are utilized in ordinary least squares regression models as
   independent variables with state partisanship and Daniel Elazar's state
   political culture typology, political culture proves to be a significant
   determinant of the level of support given to Trump in a state. States
   that are characterized by a more moralistic political culture are
   considerably more likely to have given Trump a lower share of the vote
   while voters in states that are characterized by a more traditionalistic
   or individualistic culture were more likely to support Trump.},

Abstract = {Parliamentary Women's Delegations were set up in France in 1999 to
   introduce gender mainstreaming in legislation. This preliminary study
   tests their ability to open parliamentary hearings to women and civil
   society `to make women's voices heard in legislation'. It demonstrates
   that the Delegation does indeed consult significantly more women and
   women's groups than the legislative committees of the National Assembly
   and sheds light on how this input can be channelled into the legislative
   process. It sets out a framework for more extensive comparative analysis
   of gendered participation in parliamentary hearings in France and in
   other legislatures with dedicated gender-equality bodies, and asks how
   such bodies influence the balance between bottom-up
   participative-democratic and top-down expert-bureaucratic modes of
   operation.},

Volume = {78},

Abstract = {Traditionally, scholars have tied the emergence of legitimate opposition
   to the rise of political parties in the nineteenth century. Once
   governments acknowledged parties' and partisans' essential roles in
   representative government, they also established limits on legitimate
   opposition. Illegitimate opposition was now defined as the pursuit of
   unconstitutional, extreme, or disloyal ideals. This article upends the
   traditional understanding of legitimate opposition. Athenian democracy
   did not feature parties, but it did feature intense political
   competition. As I demonstrate, that competition was structured by a
   recognizable form of legitimate opposition. Focusing on the fifth
   century, I illustrate how Athens fostered contestation and where it drew
   the boundaries of opposition. Competitors were not sanctioned because of
   their ideals. Instead, Athenian institutions were antimonopolistic,
   blocking individuals from wielding excessive power. Recognizing Athens'
   distinctive, partyless model of legitimate opposition should lead us to
   fundamentally reconsider the practice and the dominant approaches to
   regulating political competition today.},

Abstract = {Human Rights are for didactical purposes separated in (i) civil and
   political rights; (ii) economic, social and cultural rights; and (iii)
   the protection of specific groups. The present paper aims at testing the
   hypothesis that left-leaning governments would have a bigger impact in
   the commitment of States to all three categories of human rights. Two
   alternative hypotheses are considered. According to the first, political
   parties do not impact in States' adhesion to human rights treaties.
   According to the second, left-leaning governments would prioritize
   economic, social and cultural rights and the protection of specific
   groups, whereas right-leaning governments would prioritize civil and
   political rights. The paper analyses the participation in human rights
   treaties during the Brazilian democratic period between 1946 and 1964,
   the Military Dictatorship between 1964 and 1985, and the governments of
   the first three presidents after the return to democracay (1985-1994).
   As, during such period there were few left-leaning governments,
   evidences were inconclusive on whether the political orientation of the
   government is an independent variable with relevant impact on the
   predisposition to commit internationally to respect human rights. The
   study suggests other variables as important in their influence on the
   participation in human rights instruments, as the position of the
   government's party in the authoritarian-libertarian scale, the proximity
   of a democratic government with an authoritarian past and the hosting by
   the country of international thematic conferences on human rights. In
   the conclusion we propose a research agenda that includes applying a
   similar analysis to the governments of Fernando Henrique Cardoso
   (1995-2002), Luis Inacio Lula da Silva (2003-2010) and the first mandate
   of Dilma Rousseff (2011-2014). It is also proposed the resort to
   Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) for verifying the combined effect
   of possible necessary and/or sufficient variables in the celebration,
   signature, ratification or accession to International Human Rights Law
   treaties.},

Abstract = {Understanding how money influences the legislative process is essential
   for assessing American democracy, but problems of endogeneity, legality,
   and observational equivalence make it difficult to isolate the effect of
   contributions on policy. We seek to answer long-standing questions about
   the influence of money in Congress by exploiting a congressional
   procedure (committee exile) that exogenously varies a member's influence
   over the policy-making process. We leverage exile as an identification
   strategy to show that business interests seek short-term access to
   influential legislators. Industries overseen by the committee decrease
   contributions to exiled legislators and instead direct their
   contributions to new committee members from the opposite party. Partisan
   interests, in contrast, attempt to influence electoral outcomesboosting
   contributions to exiled members. Together, we provide evidence that
   corporations and business PACs use donations to acquire immediate access
   and favorsuggesting they at least anticipate that the donations will
   influence policy.},

Abstract = {Since its establishment in 2013, the German political party Alternative
   fur Deutschland (AfD) has had an exceedingly strained relationship with
   the media. This article seeks to examine this complex relationship by
   means of qualitative content analysis of the media coverage of the AfD
   on three of the most influential German digital media platforms during
   the 2013 German general elections and the 2014 European Parliament
   elections. The analysis thereby provides insights on the evaluation of
   the party by journalists and commentators. A comparison of the media
   coverage on the different platforms reveals that the AfD received
   disproportionately high media attention, especially during the EP
   elections. The media coverage itself was clearly negative regardless of
   the political color or journalistic style of the platform. This was in
   clear contrast to the user generated content - users responded with
   largely positive comments. Consequently, overall, the media discourse
   most likely strengthened rather than weakened the party's position.},

Abstract = {This article relies on the Brazilian social and political thought to
   provide a narrative of sociological foundations of the national foreign
   policy in the New Republic. This research analyses the conformation of
   the Brazilian society and its national State to discuss how the
   Portuguese patrimonial and bureaucratic heritage, which shaped the
   Brazilian empire, the ever-increasing technical and bureaucratic
   rationality, mainly since the 1930s, and the process of pluralisation in
   the Brazilian society, majorly since the democratic transition sparked
   in 1974, set the foreign policy production in the first thirty years of
   the New Republic. This narrative argues that these seemingly antinomic
   characteristics engendered tensions and adaptations, which result in the
   accumulation of estate-type patrimonialism, bureaucratic insulation,
   mitigated republicanism as characteristic features of the foreign policy
   production in the New Republic. The historical accumulation of these
   three characteristics resulted in a concentrated foreign policy cycle
   that is refractory to the participation of society. In recent years,
   this cycle has been under pressure to expand its openness to
   participation and opposition, thought these demands have not necessarily
   advocated for an enlargement that permits the unrestricted participation
   of society, reflecting historical values of the formation of the
   Brazilian political community and State. To develop this scientific
   endeavor, this research employs the qualitative methodology,
   predominantly historiographical and literature reviews, as well as
   discursive narrative.},

Abstract = {This article deals solely with the analysis of economic-political cycles
   during the past decade. The reader will find here a limited attempt to
   point out the present status of the arena while it is used as an
   analytical tool. This article offers a theoretical examination of the
   concept economic-political cyclicality and discusses the development of
   patterns of thinking related to it. The article presents the main
   principles of the idea, explains the basic assumptions, which the
   various approaches to it have in common, and points out the differences
   of opinion among the leading theorists. The analysis shows that there
   are numerous limitations of the theoretical tools and that great caution
   should be used in regard to conclusions arrived at on the basis of
   analyses that use these instruments. In this area, as in other areas of
   study that bring together economics and politics, a great deal still
   needs to be done. We argue that whereas those who deal with business
   cycles the attempt are always the same. Simply stated, they deal with
   specific events in which decisions are made for the purpose of achieving
   the maximum political-social gain in (conscious) exchange for conceding
   optimum macro-economic gain.},

Abstract = {While the importance of social and political trust has been well
   documented, there is a lack of scholarly consensus over where trust
   originates. This article tests three theoretical arguments -
   social-psychological, social-cultural, and political institutional - on
   the origin of political trust against three East Asian democracies
   (Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan). The empirical analysis from the
   AsiaBarometer survey illustrates that political institutional theory
   best explains the origin of political trust in East Asian cases.
   Citizens of these East Asian democracies have a high level of political
   trust when they believe that their governments perform well in
   management of the national economy and political representation of
   elected officials. Meanwhile, social-psychological and social-cultural
   theories explain the origins of social trust, but not political trust.
   The evidence reveals that socially trusting people are not automatically
   politically trusting; social trust and political trust originate from
   different sources and do not transform from one to the other.},

Abstract = {Turkey hosts more than three million refugees, which presents an
   unprecedented number of problems. Refugees need protection as well as
   durable solutions. By maintaining the geographical limitation to the
   1951 Refugee Convention, Turkey has based its asylum system on the
   assumption of the ongoing possibility of the resettlement of refugees to
   third countries. Resettlement policies worked well for years, however,
   for the last 10 years, it has been increasingly difficult to find
   countries willing to receive refugees from Turkey. In this article, the
   author argues that a durable solution for the three million refugees in
   Turkey is to develop comprehensive integration policies to enable these
   people to build a new life in the country. This should start with the
   lifting of Turkey's geographical limitation. Meanwhile, EU member states
   need to remember their responsibility to more efficiently share the
   humanitarian burden with Turkey.},

Abstract = {This article provides a case study analysis of the provision of gender
   and political studies education in the United Kingdom (UK). The article
   notes the lack of gender and politics modules available to students at
   the undergraduate level and links this to the under-representation of
   women within the discipline but also to the wider political and economic
   context. The article reflects upon the extent to which the study of
   gender and politics has been promoted within the UK, arguing that
   despite the key role played by national groups such as the Political
   Studies Association's Women and Politics group, the wider discipline is
   yet to view gender as a core part of the curricula.},

   among oblivion and mythologization},
Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {1-48},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The following article deals with the brief history of the Constituent
   Assembly of Workers and Intellectuals or `` Small Constituent{''} that
   took place in Santiago de Chile between March 8th and 11th, 1925, days
   before the constituent process announced by the government took place.
   Said deliberation, driven by the initiative of a wide variety of
   organizations of the Popular Movement (Communist Party, Federation of
   Chilean Workers, General Association of Teachers, Union of Chilean
   Employees, Federation of Chilean Students, anarchist sectors, democrats,
   radicals and feminists, among others) came promptly to an end due to the
   imposition of the official constituent itinerary of president Arturo
   Alessandri Palma. In a similar fashion, the promoters of the ``Small
   Constituent{''} erased the experience from their collective memory,
   paving the way for its silencing or minimization by historians that
   specialize in said period of time. Recently, contrary to forgetting and
   minimizing, this reflection lead by organized popular sectors has been
   presented in a mythified fashion as a constituent power exercise of
   completely autonomous ``social bases{''}, without any link to the
   political models present in the Popular Movement. Facing both opposite
   ends that show up in the collective memory and in historiography, the
   author of this article reconstructs the context in which the Constituent
   Assembly of Workers and Intellectuals sprang forth, its conception,
   development and outcome, to bring us closer, based on a wide variety of
   sources, to a more balanced and objective point of view, that is to say,
   closer to the historic truth.},

Abstract = {Despite their responsibility for federal policy implementation in the
   United States, little research has focused on how presidential nominees
   and appointees affect public opinion. This study offers the first
   systematic examination of this overlooked phenomenon. Using a survey
   with an embedded experimental manipulation, we find that perceived
   nominee competence is associated with increased trust in government in
   general, whereas perceptions of favoritism or patronagecharacterized
   here as the nomination of campaign fundraisersare associated with
   decreased levels of trust in the same. Notably, perceived nominee
   ideology has no perceptible effect on trust in government.},

Abstract = {The word ``(sic){''} (reservation) has been stated in Arabic language
   before Islam means to abstain, keep and hide. This word before the
   advent of Islam has been used as a customary word for the act of
   expressing or concealing the belief and opinion to protect their life or
   property or whatever is honorable for the user of reservation.
   Reservation passed certain semantic developments and transformations in
   Shia after Islam and finally was turn to a religious - moral word. The
   use of the reservation became common due to the conditions of social -
   political life of Innocent Imams (peace to be upon them) and their
   followers in the period of Imam Baqir and Imam Sadiq (peace to be upon
   them). It was used in the meaning of hiding the truth and not stating to
   believe in it against the opponents in order to abstain from religious
   or secular loss. Thus, was considered in the category of Shia religious
   - moral vocabulary. Reservation is of the first level terms of language
   according to Izutsu method and describes an objective and real concept.
   Its first semantic core is without valuation. Some elements have been
   considered at the semantic core of the reservation that faith and
   security is of the most important of them.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},

Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Pages = {64-79},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Tragedy of the anticommons is the logical reciprocal to the better-known
   tragedy of the commons. It is generally characterized as a legal regime
   in which multiple owners hold rights of exclusion over a resource in
   demand. The resource cannot be put into use without a bundling of
   approvals from the various separate owners, yet bundling entails serious
   bargaining complications resulting in systematic Pareto
   underutilization. Nevertheless, we argue, the anticommons concept often
   has been employed without consistency and appropriate precision.
   Illustrations come primarily from the writings of Michael Heller, whose
   oft-cited work has been central to the anticommons literature. This
   paper presents a simple version of the formal anticommons model and
   demonstrates that relevant applications can be constructed with
   uniformity and analytic rigor.},

Abstract = {This paper draws upon data collected from an online voting experiment to
   test the implications of going negative in a multiparty election
   campaign. Specifically, we investigate two sets of questions: First,
   does the attention and vote share that candidates receive vary according
   to the tone (positive/negative) of their election campaign? Second, does
   the attention and vote share that candidates receive vary according to
   whether or not all candidates engage in similar (positive/negative)
   campaigns? While studies of negative campaigning have been prominent in
   the American context, our work builds upon this literature by using an
   experimental design to test for their effects in a multiparty setting.
   Resume Cet article se fonde sur des donnees recueillies lors d'une
   experience de vote en ligne visant a mesurer les implications d'une <<
   orientation negative >> de la campagne dans une election multipartite.
   Plus precisement, nous examinons deux series de questions :
   premierement, l'attention et les suffrages accordes aux candidats
   varient-ils en fonction du ton (positif/negatif) de leur campagne
   electorale ? Deuxiemement, l'attention et les suffrages accordes aux
   candidats varient- ils en fonction du fait que tous les candidats
   s'engagent ou non dans des campagnes (positives/negatives) analogues ?
   Meme si les etudes sur les << campagnes negatives >> tiennent une place
   importante dans le contexte americain, notre analyse s'inscrit dans le
   prolongement de ces travaux en adoptant un concept de recherche
   experimentale qui vise a mesurer leurs effets dans un cadre
   multipartite.},

Abstract = {The subject of oppression and wastage and liability arising from it,
   involve a significant part of the relationship between human beings with
   each other and the relationship between natural and legal persons. This
   has long been the most important issues and has been subjected to human,
   and in Islamic jurisprudence considered as the cause and contraption of
   liability; such a way that sometimes acceptance actions (oppression) and
   sometimes deprivation actions (wastage) caused harm to others. In law
   and religion, the rule of acceptance and denial actions has been
   explicitly stated. However, there are some cases as well which no
   special rule has been stated for them but in majority cases, omission or
   doing an action to stave off the losses from other is necessary. So it
   is necessary the aspects related to this topic to be explained properly.
   Hence, this question arises, what are the features of oppression and
   wastage led to liability in jurisprudence and consequently the rights
   derived from it?
   Although in the case law according to the rule of Estimate (asking for
   something on loan), the liability of the authorized person in possession
   of the property has been removed despite the oppression and wastage the
   trustee is considered traitors and bondsman. In fulfillment of
   oppression and wastage and the liability resulted from that insight and
   intention of authorized person has no interfered and effect and
   oppression and wastage are the bases of liability and civil
   responsibility. Of achievements of this study which has been done
   descriptive-analytic is introduction and explanation of proper criteria
   for identifying oppression and wastage in cases where in the law and the
   jurisprudence have not been mentioned.},

Abstract = {What are the main objectives of social protection institutions in
   developing countries? What should be their scope and reach? What is the
   source of their legitimacy? Finding appropriate answers to these
   questions is essential to understanding, and shaping, the emergence of
   welfare institutions in low- and middle-income countries. Most available
   answers rely on instrumental arguments. Few make reference to normative
   principles. This article draws on three concepts from Rawls - social
   justice as regulating cooperation, the social minimum, and the need for
   a freestanding political notion of social justice - to develop a
   coherent argument for grounding social assistance on social justice. In
   line with this argument, it identifies some parameters for a
   justice-based social assistance. This article then discusses, with
   examples, the tensions existing between a social justice-based social
   minimum and real' social assistance institutions emerging in developing
   countries.},

Abstract = {Migrants and refugees continue to die as they attempt to cross into
   Europe. This article explores the issue of dying to live' to draw
   attention to the disturbing fact of these deaths in relation to the
   state, biopolitics, and citizenship, but also to the growing
   mobilization around refugee and migrant deaths along European borders.
   The article examines transnational activism in solidarity with migrants,
   refugees and their families in response to deaths at Europe's borders as
   one example of the many political struggles for greater rights
   undertaken by refugees, migrants, and solidarity activists emerging
   across Europe and elsewhere. An examination of struggles around rights
   of the dead and in response to migrant and refugee deaths suggests that
   they can be transgressive of the logic of modern citizenship.},

Journal = {TEMAS Y DEBATES},
Year = {2016},
Number = {32},
Pages = {27-49},
Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {A comparison of the two variants of populism that we propose shows that
   only classical Peronism developed upon a process of constitution of
   social actors, particularly the working class and the trade unions.
   While classical Peronism was politically inclusive, and accompanied that
   inclusion with a subjective experience of social ascent, the plebeian
   populism of the Kirchners governments reproduces the ways of life of the
   communities that constitute its social and electoral base. The
   discursive and identity dimensions of this latter variant of populism
   are notably weak, while those connected to the patrimonial exercise of
   power, the predatory administration of government, and the manipulation
   of fiscal resources are remarkably strong. Plebeian populism is
   disconnected from the labor market in its relation to the working and
   lower classes. As a result, this variety of populism is centered on the
   management of the poor, and consists in a pragmatic and successful
   adaptation to the new social conditions presented by structural poverty.},

Title = {Public Interest in Criminal Procedure and Its Challenges: An Attitude
   toward Iranian Criminal Law},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {1-14},

Abstract = {Greek philosophers had accepted ``rule of law{''} as desired governance
   system since it was the only way to provide all citizens' public
   interest. In today's societies where public policy is accountable for
   the interests of total society or at least its majority, it is too vital
   to recognize the concept of public interest. Like other concepts, it is
   also radically transformed in modern age, despite varied perceptions on
   this concept, modern concept of public interest is understood as
   recognizing individual rights, accepting utility principle which means
   to attract the highest interest for most people, respecting legal
   process and adapting with common values of society independent of
   individual interests.
   Criminal procedure is shaped in three main areas including criminal
   process, entities and its governing laws affected by public interest
   concept. Regulations such as competencies and penal provisional remedy,
   entities like the public prosecutor's office and NGOs and criminal
   process models like crime control are all justified by this concept. In
   present paper, it is attempted to adapt such claim to Iranian procedural
   rights by some illuminations.
   One can claim that criminal procedure is one of the most obvious arenas
   of public interest where individual rights and freedoms clash. Since
   criminal procedure is set to provide public interest like many other
   laws, it also supports individual rights. Such rights include both
   procedural and substantial rights. On this basis, criminal procedure
   aims at achieving a balance point between public interest and individual
   interest. Here, we study the challenge of four rights supported by
   criminal procedure on public interest in Iranian laws.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {39},
Number = {4},
Pages = {667-687},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article studies political participation in the context of
   decentralisation in Europe. Recent secession attempts demonstrate how
   the demand for decentralisation energises citizens. Yet the fact that
   decentralised institutions, initially, were endorsed to increase
   citizens' participation is often neglected. In order to test this
   contention empirically, three theoretically informed arguments are
   developed, making use of the most recent data on regional authority for
   282 regions in 20 European countries. Results of three-level
   hierarchical models lend support to the arguments. Regional self-rule
   increases probabilities to engage only in more demanding and less common
   forms of participation. It also acts as a political opportunity
   structure, moderating the influence of individual driving forces of
   participation. Participatory effects on protest activity, however, turn
   out to be endogenous, as the instrumental variable analysis indicates
   that decentralisation does not increase protest, but rather the reverse.
   These findings seem relevant to the current heated debates both on
   secession attempts and waning political involvement.},

Abstract = {The principle of proportionality of punishment to the crime represents
   completion of crime law for determining appropriate penalty, that is
   resulted from revolution of criminal justice in the way to considering
   the subject of criminal act and his personality. In fact, the correct
   response to against breaking norms needs to consider the question that
   ``who did it{''} in spite of considering the act itself, it means that
   ``what did the criminal do{''} or ``what happened{''} by criminal
   prosecution authorities and specially courts and this time not only in
   terms of assign a criminal act to a person but also this means that what
   is the defendant's mental, physical structure and family history which
   could effect on his/her criminal characteristic is a necessary fact.
   File character that the necessity of formation was considered more in
   twentieth century, is called to a case that is formed besides file
   character and indicates information about general and special statues of
   criminal such as mental, family, educational and social condition. This
   file guide decision-makers and criminal justice to choose appropriate
   clinical methods and they will make appropriate criminal measures
   according to related information such as laboratory and conducted
   research in order to fulfill medical and correctness. In this research,
   we only study role of this file in trial phase.},

Abstract = {Since the triumph of the revolution, the Cuban government has striven to
   depoliticize society, namely by ``shrinking{''} the language used to
   talk about politics. The intuition for this article comes from Orwell's
   novel 1984, in which ``Newspeak{''} is explained as a longterm,
   problematical project to ``shrink{''} language and narrow the range of
   thoughts. I look at one strategic source of language production, the
   academic field, and examine one glaring example of ``shrinking{''}: the
   actual dismissal of political science as a discipline under the Castro
   regime. The case is made that in lieu of political science, one finds
   largely defanged social sciences and humanities that talk about politics
   and policies without actually talking about power. Illustrations are
   found in the work of social scientist Rafael Hernandez and in the
   journal Temas, of which he is the director.},

Abstract = {World democracies widely differ in legislative, executive, and legal
   institutions. Different institutional environments induce different
   mappings from electoral outcomes to the distribution of power. We
   explore how these mappings affect voters' participation in an election.
   We show that the effect of such institutional differences on turnout
   depends on the distribution of voters' preferences. We uncover a novel
   contest effect: Given the preferences distribution, turnout increases
   and then decreases when we move from a more proportional to a less
   proportional power-sharing system; turnout is maximized for an
   intermediate degree of power sharing. Moreover, we generalize the
   competition effect, common to models of endogenous turnout: Given the
   institutional environment, turnout increases in the ex ante preferences
   evenness, and more so when the overall system has lower power sharing.
   These results are robust to a wide range of modeling approaches,
   including ethical voter models, voter mobilization models, and rational
   voter models.},

Abstract = {Twenty-first century developmental projects like those of the Brazilian
   Workers' Party take place in a regulatory context that at least on paper
   demands new scrutiny of their environmental and community impacts.
   Scholars of the democratic developmental state also argue that
   development now requires building human capabilities, promoting
   sustainable development, and seeking community feedback. We examine 302
   electricity projects financed by BLADES to see if and when these
   developmentalist infrastructure projects faced challenging scrutiny on
   environmental and community impact grounds. 29 percent generated
   organized community opposition, extended licensing processes, and/or
   legal action. These were most common for large projects and projects
   where community and state actors worked together in blocking coalitions.
   We conclude that the ideals of the democratic developmental state are
   more compatible in theory than in practice.},

Abstract = {How to measure a multidimensional regional integration? This is the
   problem that has guided the realization of this work. While scholar's
   regional integration have built different indicators for measuring,
   their progress they have been limited to construct an indicator to
   measure a process of integration of multidimensional way. To advance in
   this direction, this paper presents the design of a multidimensional
   index of regional integration, based on the selection of variables
   necessary, not sufficient, and that are articulated with different
   approaches on the phenomenon. After the design of the index, the paper
   includes a section in which the salient results of its application to
   the process of integration of Mercosur in its 25 years of existence are
   presented. Finally, the paper presents an explanatory conjecture on
   levels of integration achieved in this process.},

Abstract = {Aristotle's doctrine of the wisdom of the multitude (DWM) has become a
   canonical reference for political theorists, particularly supporters of
   epistemic approaches to democracy. Yet the excessive focus on the
   collective capacity of the many has obscured a more promising defense of
   democracy within Aristotle's work. Despite Aristotle's infamous
   arguments defending unequal merit and hierarchical relationships, his
   account of citizenship is strikingly egalitarian: he argues that
   citizenship, properly distributed, reflects an equal capacity for
   judgment. On this basis, an Aristotelian justification of democracy
   emerges, one quite distinct from the DWM-inflected defense of collective
   judgments.},

Abstract = {Using data and written feedback published as part of the UK Cabinet
   Office's evaluation of 24 UK local authority projects aimed at
   maximising registration in under-registered groups, this article
   explores the potential of electoral registration activities when
   designed to encourage a more electorally active youth. Focusing on six
   cases from the evaluation-covering examples of intensive canvassing,
   partnership work and publicity campaigns-it considers the relative
   effectiveness of traditional duty-based canvass activities versus more
   informal, less administrative initiatives. In doing so it develops wider
   thinking about youth engagement and finds that despite the notable
   contribution of those activities which are less overtly connected to
   formal politics and electoral administration, much can still be gained
   from the direct recruitment techniques found in canvassing.},

Abstract = {Four aspects of Donald Trump's hijack of the Republican party are
   examined. First, how he used unconventional techniques, usually
   associated with some `reality' television programmes, to become the
   leading candidate in the pre-primary debates. He could thereby develop
   `momentum' before the primaries began despite his limited support among
   Republican activists. Second, how his insurgency differed from the
   party's takeover in 1964 by supporters of Barry Goldwater. Third, how
   the Republicans have replaced the Democrats since the early 1980s as the
   party with a less cohesive potential coalition among voters, with the
   result that internal party relations became more conflictual throughout
   the period. Finally, that internal conflict has been intensified by two
   factors in those decades: the prevalence of divided government, which
   has made it virtually impossible to impose a truly conservative agenda
   on federal government policy, and the impact of forty years of
   stagnating real incomes for many middle -income Americans.},

Abstract = {Much research has been done to identify factors that facilitate or
   prevent democratic breakdown. Little attention, however, has been paid
   to the question of whether and how the baseline risk level (after
   controlling for the impacts of relevant factors) changes over time.
   Using a flexible parametric survival model, I analyse the duration of
   149 democratic periods (1946-2008) and demonstrate that the baseline
   risk has an inverted-U shape, which provides evidence for the honeymoon
   effect and democratic consolidation. This finding has an important
   policy implication for democratic assistance programmes.},

Abstract = {This article examines the growing impact of partisan polarization on
   intergovernmental relations under the Obama Administration.
   Increasingly, red and blue states have taken different trajectories in
   implementing Obama Administration policies, with resistance from many
   conservative state leaders and enthusiasm from Democrats. To manage
   these challenges, the Administration has turned to an array of old and
   new tools for accommodating territorial variations in politics and
   policy: opt outs for reluctant or resistant states, accommodation for
   states that wish to go beyond federal standards, aggressive use of
   waivers, and so forth. This ``variable speed federalism{''} model-marked
   by increasingly diverse patterns of state implementation of national
   policies-has been the paradoxical outgrowth of what President Obama once
   hoped would become a ``new nationalism.{''} This article explores these
   themes in more detail, briefly recapping the principal domestic
   accomplishments of the Obama Administration, examining emerging patterns
   of intergovernmental relations, and discussing the increased federal
   tolerance of state diversity in federal intergovernmental programs.},

Abstract = {Marxian thinking following the TSSI (temporal single system
   interpretation) of Marx's work is applied to refute the allegation of a
   tautology in the resource-based view of the firm, paired with the
   provision of an explanation of how and why resources create value, where
   resources are synonymous with Marx's categories of constant and variable
   capital. Refuting the allegation naturally leads to the Holy Grail of
   resource-based thinking: the question of what, conceptually, constitutes
   a firm's competitive advantage within the industry context. This article
   achieves its objectives by tying the resource-based view into Marx's
   theory of value.},

Abstract = {Letters of credit play a crucial role in international trade. In this
   study, we investigate the most preferable characteristics of letters of
   credit for the international trading companies in Iran. We seek to
   investigate which kind of guarantee (commercial L/C or standby L/C) they
   prefer to secure the performance of their client's obligations. Studied
   companies were 20 international trading companies in Tehran, from which
   50 experts were participated in our survey study. For measuring the
   participants and their policy in using letters of credit, a
   questionnaire in Persian was designed. For analyzing data we used
   statistical tests (One-sample t-test). Data showed that being a
   guarantee, integration, documentary conditions, and secondary payment
   mechanism are four important reasons for international trading companies
   in Iran to use letters of credit in their contracts. Statistical results
   showed that ``being a guaranteed credit{''} is the most important factor
   with a mean of 3.660 +/- 1.135. Also, we found significant relationship
   between these four factors and the L/C usage policy (p < 0.01, and p <
   0.05). We concluded that they mostly prefer standby letters of credit
   for securing their transactions.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {69},
Number = {2},
Pages = {309-319},

Abstract = {This article turns to Hobbes's theory of laughter to determine the role
   collective laughter plays in democratic politics. After examining the
   political themes in Hobbes's various accounts of laughter as well as the
   appearances laughter makes in his political philosophy, I argue that the
   Hobbesian body politic is a laughing body politic at the moment of its
   foundation. The individuals who contract with one another to establish a
   commonwealth perform the same sudden, ``vainglorious,{''} and
   counter-sovereign political enactment as the laughing individual in
   Hobbes. This notion of a ``laughing body politic{''} illuminates how
   Hobbes-the philosophical champion of sovereign power-provides resources
   for theorizing the counter-sovereign, democratic possibilities of
   collective laughter today.},

Abstract = {Social riots, popular uprisings, and revolutions are among the threats
   that could have jeopardized the stability of the Islamic Republic of
   Iran (IRI) in its recent history. Since 1979, the clerical establishment
   has utilized a number of institutions and social groups and applied
   various strategies to control Iranian society and neutralize such
   threats, including policies used to silence the masses and force public
   allegiance to the Islamic Republic. One of Iran's key strategies involve
   social manipulation, which includes the ``engineering{''} of the minds,
   bodies, and emotions of its population. In addition to distributing
   massive amounts of propaganda and regulating and disciplining citizens'
   bodies, the Islamic Republic has deliberately been depressing Iranian
   citizens through a policy which I call the ``politics of sadness.{''}
   Through this strategy, the IRI has promoted despondency and hopelessness
   to the extent that citizens become paralyzed and incapable of
   challenging the political status quo. The result has simultaneously been
   satisfying the more conservative and religious parts of society while
   suppressing its more progressive social spheres. Through these policies,
   the Islamic Republic has been able to maintain power and has survived
   despite several social protests that have occurred in last two decades.},

Title = {Income-based voting and polarization over redistribution under
   alternative electoral systems},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {22-32},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Democracies that have proportional electoral systems spend substantively
   more on welfare policies than those that have majoritarian systems.
   Theoretical accounts of this empirical regularity are generally tested
   using macro-level data, leaving micro-level implications untested. In
   this paper, I take an alternative approach, leveraging the fact that the
   theories in question make predictions about the electoral coordination
   between parties and voters around broad-based redistribution under
   alternative institutional arrangements. To test the theories, I create a
   novel measure of income-based voting, which captures the sensitivity of
   vote choice to changes in income and forms the dependent variable in a
   second stage model. Overall, I find robust support for more
   proportionality leading to more income-based voting. (c) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {A common theme in studies of voter turnout in Central and Eastern Europe
   (CEE) is that the legacy of communism attenuates electoral
   participation. It is argued that socialization and the political habits
   that emerged under communism impeded democratic development by not
   motivating citizen activism. This paper examines this claim for voter
   turnout in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland for all
   general elections since 1990 using cohort analysis on pooled
   crosssectional post-election surveys from given countries. This paper
   shows that socialization and political habit formation under communism
   have had no discernible effect on voter turnout in the Czech Republic,
   Slovakia and Hungary between 1990 and 2013. Generational effects are
   evident in Poland suggesting that this country's political history is
   qualitatively different from that of its neighbours. This research is
   important in highlighting that citizens' political development within
   non-liberal democratic regimes does not always lead to lower levels of
   voter turnout. Consequently, the decline in turnout in CEE is likely to
   have attitudinal rather than generational origins where contemporary
   rather than historical political developments are most important. (c)

Abstract = {Enhanced participation has been prescribed as the way forward for
   improving democratic decision making while generating positive
   attributes like trust. Yet we do not know the extent to which rules
   affect the outcome of decision making. This article investigates how
   different group decision rules affect group trust by testing three ideal
   types of decision rules (i.e., a Unilateral rule, a Representative rule
   and a Non-rule') in a laboratory experiment. The article shows
   significant differences between the three decision rules on trust after
   deliberation. Interestingly, however, it finds that the Representative
   rule yields more trust than the Non-rule and also significantly more
   trust than the Unilateral rule, when analysing the results at group
   level. These findings challenge the theoretical understanding by, for
   example, deliberative normative theorists that more inclusive,
   consensual and non-hierarchical decision-making procedures enhance trust
   vis-a-vis other more hierarchical decision-making procedures.},

   women occur in conservative parties?},
Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {68},

Abstract = {This article aims to contribute to the growing literature on the
   substantive representation of women in conservative parties by
   evaluating MPs' claims to act for women' during parliamentary debates on
   reproductive health and same-sex marriage in the UK and Australia. It
   argues that the actions of centre-right MPs who made claims about the
   situation of women in their speeches can be understood as the
   substantive representation of women, but the nature of this
   representation is problematised. While some legislators' actions can be
   understood as a feminist' substantive representation of women, the
   action of MPs who supported liberalising reforms can be broadly
   understood as a different kind of conservative' substantive
   representation of women, which aims to address women's status in a more
   traditional way. This can be differentiated from the actions of a group
   of conservative MPs who claimed to act for women' but did not seek to
   address women's position (even in a traditional way), which is
   considered conversely as the representation of conservative interests.
   This article argues that to fully understand MPs' legislative behaviour
   in Westminster democracies, consideration of an MP's ideological view
   must be central to any explanation of the substantive representation of
   women on morality politics' issues.},

Abstract = {This article re-claims and invigorates the debate on `New Materialism'
   as it is unfolding within Marxist political economy specifically. We
   choose this site to make our intervention in the debate because, while
   Marxism claims to makes visible the poor, dispossessed and those `left
   behind' in the contemporary global capitalist economy, we discern, in
   contributions made thus far, a marked tendency to sideline the rich
   tradition of feminist historical materialist scholarship. We contend
   that feminist analyses are vital in elucidating the `gendered face' of
   global financial crisis and austerity. Accordingly, after first mapping
   the contours of current discussion, we briefly revisit feminist
   critiques of Marxism; interrogate the inter-relationship between
   neoliberal capitalism, the gendered nature of labour markets, the
   `patriarchal' state and social reproduction and unpaid care work; and,
   finally, we further develop our argument through an analysis of the
   gendered impacts of current austerity measures in the United Kingdom.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},

Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {163-174},

Abstract = {This article shows how Lewis Minkin's specific approach meticulously
   unpicks the mechanisms of party management to reveal the vulnerabilities
   of New Labour's managerial culture and behaviour. Minkin breaks new
   ground in our understanding of organisational change and offers a better
   grasp of the dialectic between organisational culture and party
   reputation. The first section of the article presents the main
   counterproductive effects of the New Labour managers' rolling coup' on
   the project it was supposed to sustain, with detrimental effects on
   intra-party democracy and organisational vitality. The second section
   highlights some of the main external misconceptions about the party and
   about the impact of the reforms by analysing the effect of party
   management on perceptions of New Labour and of Tony Blair, both in the
   United Kingdom and abroad (in France in particular), exploring the
   paradox of Blair's standing abroad as a model to emulate, despite being
   described at home as the most reviled former prime minister since 1945'.
   The conclusion draws out lessons from Blair's management style - and
   eventual downfall - for star-struck foreign politicians and
   commentators.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},

Number = {3},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The common thought of Christian and Moslem philosophers considers moral
   responsibility of a person as dependent on his or her ability to choose
   from several options. However, Harry Frankfurt in his famous paper
   ``alternate possibilities and moral responsibility{''} challenges
   freedom condition for moral responsibility with implicit reasons and
   makes use of several examples to show that it is completely possible for
   a person to be considered as morally responsible despite failure to
   access any kind of alternate possible. However, there are two reasons
   presented by Frankfurt that contrary to his claims show that presence of
   alternate possibilities or at least imagination for presence of
   alternatives is the base for responsibility or difficulty of moralactor
   and if sometimes anactor is regarded as responsible despite absence of
   alternate possible, this is resulted from his or her ``ignorance{''} of
   the matter and also the impact of his ``intention{''} in doing action.
   One of the main defects of theories which deal with moral responsibility
   conditions is ignoring the intention and purpose of moralactor. This is
   while ethics domain includes internal actions like intention and will of
   moral actor as well as apparent actions.},

Abstract = {How much do factual information and other kinds of frames affect policy
   attitudes? And whose attitudes are most malleable? I address these
   questions via two original survey experiments about the estate tax. I
   demonstrate that correct information about who is potentially subject to
   the estate tax increased support for the estate tax. Furthermore, this
   information did not appear any less persuasive than pro- or antitax
   arguments that emphasized values such as equality or fairness. Finally,
   the effects of this information were concentrated among lower income
   conservatives and Republicans. These findings contrast with previous
   research on estate tax attitudes and have broader implications for the
   study of political information, framing, and policy attitudes.},

Abstract = {Notwithstanding its status as a modern classic, Hannah Arendt's study on
   The Origins of Totalitarianism is generally considered to be lacking a
   clearly reflected methodological basis. This article challenges this
   view and argues that in her study Arendt implicitly applies a
   characterological method of political theorizing that provides a genuine
   conceptual framework for systematically connecting structural analysis
   with ideographic historical investigations and with a political theory
   of action. On this conceptual basis, the study renders an analysis of
   anti-Semitism, imperialism, and totalitarianism not merely in terms of
   abstract structural concepts, but in terms of dynamic character-context
   constellations. Arendt's account not only shows interesting parallels to
   a number of similar conceptual reflections, especially in the 20th
   century's theory debate; it can also serve to inspire the current debate
   on methodology in political theory.},

Abstract = {This article examines the extent to which advertising outside of an
   explicit campaign environment has the potential to benefit the electoral
   fortunes of incumbent politicians. We make use of a novel case of
   non-campaign advertising, that of North Carolina Secretary of Labor
   Cherie Berry (R-NC), who has initiated the practice of having her
   picture and name displayed prominently on official inspection placards
   inside all North Carolina elevators. We extend Mayhew's theory of
   advertising to a non-campaign environment and then theorize that Berry
   serves as a novel case of non-campaign-specific advertising via a
   priming mechanism. We then test our theory using spatial regression
   methods and find that Berry outperformed other statewide Republican
   candidates in the 2012 North Carolina elections. Our findings suggest
   that candidates can use this form of advertising to indirectly improve
   their electoral fortunes.},

Abstract = {This article takes issue with the development, at the dawn of 21st
   century, of a new legal tool, which I will refer to as ``millennial
   rights{''}. I make the claim that the political impact of the
   unprecedented socio-political dynamics triggered by the penetrating
   jargon typical of these rights goes often unnoticed. I first provide
   both a historical reconstruction and theoretical account of millennial
   rights. Then I draw on Ian Hacking's conception of human kinds to
   explore the semantic activity that such legal rights carry out at an
   individual, social and political level. I conclude the article by
   discussing the risks that inhere in the uncontrolled expansion of such
   an effective legal tool.},

   a New Database},
Journal = {ASIAN POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {263-279},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Social spending in Thailand is often regarded as an important tool for
   building human capital and for fighting poverty. The Thai government has
   made a strong commitment to expanding the access of Thai population to
   education, healthcare, and other welfare services, but the question is
   how well the benefits of these social services are actually distributed.
   The objective of this article is to explore the distributional effects
   of public education, health, and welfare spending in Thailand by using a
   benefit incidence analysis with a new database covering the year 2011,
   as many new social programs were implemented and expanded after the
   financial crisis in 1997 and after 2006 and 2009. The benefit incidence
   analysis in 2011 should make it possible to analyze the extent to which
   the rich and the poor are benefiting from the current allocation of
   social spending. Additionally, the paper explores the policy
   implications of the findings.},

Title = {Can There Be a Human Right to an Essentially Contested Concept? The Case
   of Democracy},

Abstract = {The idea of a human right to democracy has received substantial
   attention from political theorists, philosophers, and international
   lawyers. Arguments for its existence ignore the fact that democracy is
   the paradigm essentially contested concept, so cannot establish what a
   right to democracy would be a right to. I survey three responses to
   essential contestability. The first holds that history has decided upon
   liberal democracy, so essential contestation is a philosophical worry
   with few practical implications. The second seeks a broadly acceptable
   minimal definition of democracy. The third would deploy sophisticated
   empirical analysis to determine which aspects of democracy have desired
   positive effects. All three prove inadequate. The right to democracy
   must instead be understood as the right to engage the contestation at
   the core of the concept, through formative agency that determines what
   democracy should mean in practice in particular contexts.},
