Abstract = {In recent decades, some attempts have been made to empirically assess
   different models of democracy in action by identifying and measuring
   various indicators. Lijphart's seminal work, Patterns of Democracy, is
   one of the most comprehensive attempts to categorize models of democracy
   systematically. However, it has mainly focused on established
   democracies. There is no extensive operationalization of models of
   democracy which evaluates a broader range of countries, including new
   democracies in a systematic way. This article aims to fill the gap by
   operationalizing two persistent dimensions of democracy - contestation
   and participation - for 80 electoral democracies around the world
   between 1990 and 2009. Extracting empirical scores, we present a
   two-dimensional global map of democracy over two decades. We finally
   examine the associations between democratic models and indices of level
   and performance of democracy.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {Why do authoritarian regimes permit elections in some settings but not
   in others? Focusing on the decision to hold subnational elections, we
   argue that autocrats can use local elections to assuage powerful
   subnational elites. When subnational elites control significant
   political resources, such as local political machines, leaders may need
   to co-opt them to govern cost-effectively. Elections are an effective
   tool of co-optation because they provide elites with autonomy and the
   opportunity to cultivate their own power bases. We test this argument by
   analyzing variation in the decision to hold mayoral elections in
   Russia's 207 largest cities between 2001 and 2012. Our findings suggest
   that Russian mayoral elections were more likely to be retained in cities
   where elected mayors sat atop strong political machines. Our findings
   also illustrate how subnational elections may actually serve to
   perpetuate authoritarianism by helping to ensure elite loyalty and
   putting the resources of powerful elites to work for the regime.},

Abstract = {Resume L'analyse diachronique des commissions extra-parlementaires (CEP)
   suisses montre un fort declin de leur composition neocorporatiste dans
   la seconde moitie du 20ieme siecle. Lieux de rencontre et de negociation
   pour les principaux acteurs des champs economique, scientifique,
   politique et administratif, les CEP sont traditionnellement considerees
   comme une importante instance de representation des groupes d'interet en
   Suisse. Notre contribution interroge la validite de cette position a
   l'aune des reformes du systeme commissionnaliste des annees 1970-1980 et
   de la remise en cause du neocorporatisme des les annees 1990. Bases sur
   l'analyse de l'affiliation des membres de CEP sur quatre dates (1957,
   1980, 2000 et 2010), nos resultats indiquent que les CEP perdent leur
   fonction de concertation et d'intermediation des differents acteurs
   impliques dans le processus decisionnel, au travers notamment d'une
   baisse de la representation des interets economiques organises et d'une
   augmentation de la representation des acteurs scientifiques ainsi que
   d'une diminution de la multi-expertise.},

Abstract = {The last part of 20th century saw the collapse of a dramatic number of
   dictatorships. Rather than democracy, several of these transitions
   brought regimes where limited political competition coexists with
   persistently authoritarian practices. The diffusion of this form of
   authoritarianism in the developing world raises several questions about
   its broader consequences. Most importantly, does political change short
   of democratization matter for ordinary citizens? Recent research
   demonstrates that nominally democratic institutions, even in the absence
   of people empowerment, can result in better living conditions. The paper
   adds to this debate by formulating and testing new hypotheses. I compare
   electoral authoritarianism with democracy and full dictatorship,
   including specific subtypes of the latter, and focus on both policy
   outputs and outcomes.},

Abstract = {The relative bargaining power of rulers and right holders is thought to
   be a key determinant of property rights, but because it both shapes and
   is shaped by property rights, it is difficult to estimate the impact of
   bargaining power on property rights. We take advantage of a natural
   experiment by comparing the responses of managers interviewed just
   before and just after a surprising parliamentary election in Russia that
   weakened the relative bargaining power of the ruling party. This
   electoral shock had little impact on the perceived property rights of
   the average firm, but firms with close economic ties to the state viewed
   their property as more vulnerable after the election. By exploiting
   largely exogenous variation in the timing of survey interviews, we
   estimate the impact of bargaining power on property rights with greater
   precision. We also contribute to the literature on elections under
   autocracy by focusing on their economic, rather than political, impacts
   on individuals.},

Abstract = {Political science should play a larger role in grappling with the
   political roots, meanings, and implications of the various levels and
   unique configurations of class inequality and racial diversity that have
   characterized the last several decades of U.S. history. I offer some
   observations about the discipline's research, or lack thereof, and
   indicate suggestions about how we might think about and do more in these
   respects.
   I will come at these concerns by noting some developments that
   influenced the present in social and political terms and other events in
   political science; identifying intellectual guideposts that may help how
   we think about research issues of our day; considering why race and
   class are not studied (more); acknowledging how the questions have been
   studied, as well as noting some reservations about these; and providing
   several examples from the research in which I have been involved, both
   directly and indirectly, that suggest how we might or can study these
   questions.},

Abstract = {Pooled event history analysis (PEHA) allows researchers to study the
   effects of variables across multiple policies by stacking the data and
   estimating the parameters in a single model. Yet this approach to
   modeling policy diffusion implies assumptions about homogeneity that are
   often violated in reality, such that the effect of a given variable is
   constant across policies. We relax this assumption and use Monte Carlo
   simulations to compare common strategies for modeling heterogeneity,
   testing these strategies with increasing levels of variance. We find
   that multilevel models with random coefficients produce the best
   estimates and are a significant improvement over other models. In
   addition, we show how modeling similar policies as multilevel structures
   allows researchers to more precisely explore the theoretical
   implications of heterogeneity across policies. We provide an empirical
   example of these modeling approaches with a unique data set of 29
   antiabortion policies.},

Abstract = {This article critically engages with Israel's settler-colonial racial
   regime in Palestine as an Agambenian state of exception. The first part
   reiterates the author's argument that the Israeli state extends its laws
   to rule occupied and besieged Palestine while excluding itself and its
   Jewish citizen-colonists from legal instruments of oppression,
   occupation and siege. Positioning itself above and outside domestic and
   international law as far as Palestinian citizens and occupied and
   besieged subjects are concerned, Israel is theorized as a textbook
   example of state of exception, racial state and settler colony. The
   second part follows Weheliye in placing race front and centre in
   theorizing political violence as a socio-political process of
   differentiation and hierarchization that differentiates between the
   human, the not-quite-human and the non-human, employed by the State of
   Israel in dehumanizing and racializing Palestinian citizens, occupied
   and besieged subjects.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to take the admonition of taking the
   visual seriously into the realms of murals. It will present empirical
   data on contemporary murals in the Basque Country with a view to
   examining why murals are important to the abertzale-left, the broad
   left-wing nationalist movement in the Basque Country which includes but
   ranges far beyond the armed group ETA. The struggle for Basque autonomy
   from Spain has its roots in a nationalist awakening in the late
   twentieth century. It has developed through the struggle with fascism;
   the prolonged authoritarian, centralist state; and the transition to
   democracy after the death of Franco. Central to this development has
   been the definition of Basque identity in terms of culture rather than
   birth. Language has been key, but there has also been a visual strand to
   the struggle. The article will examine the state of that visual strand
   currently by examining murals on a range of themes: language and
   culture, independence and socialism, armed struggle, political
   prisoners, torture and repression, martyrs and heroes, women and
   environmental issues.},

Abstract = {The elections to the Swiss Federal Council in December 2015
   re-established a system of party-centred concordance, cherished in
   consociational theory, consisting of two representatives of the Swiss
   People's Party, two Radicals, two Social Democrats and one Christian
   Democrat. At the same time, the government has rarely been as unbalanced
   in terms of the representation of Switzerland's languages and regions.
   The article analyses the concept of concordance with regard to both
   aspects of governmental inclusiveness. It also highlights the crucial
   role of electoral rules used in governmental elections. It argues that
   they resemble the Alternative Vote, a majoritarian electoral system that
   has been criticized in consociational theory but prescribed by the
   rival, centripetalist approach to power sharing.},

Abstract = {For a short and controversial period in 2006-2007, Poland was governed
   by a three-party populist coalition which attempted to break with the
   liberal-democratic model of post-communist transition and implement a
   far-reaching set of reforms. In this article, I analyse the ways in
   which domestic and external actors responded to the challenges posed by
   this coalition. I argue that Poland's Constitutional Court and the
   temporarily united opposition parties were key to repelling the populist
   challenge. However, the anti-populist response was driven less by a
   deliberate strategy than by the confrontational logic of populism
   itself, and the institutional design of Poland's liberal-democratic
   system. I conclude with a discussion of several lessons the Polish case
   holds for further analyses of anti-populist reaction.},

Abstract = {Most estimates of the incumbency advantage and the electoral benefits of
   previous officeholding experience do not account for strategic entry by
   high-quality challengers. We address this issue by using term limits as
   an instrument for challenger quality. Studying US state legislatures, we
   find strong evidence of strategic behavior by experienced challengers.
   However, we also find that such behavior does not appear to
   significantly bias the estimated effect of challenger experience or the
   estimated incumbency advantage. More tentatively, using our estimates,
   we find that 30-40\% of the incumbency advantage in state legislative
   races is the result of scaring off experienced challengers.},

Title = {Making a Mark-Time Changing Politics from Estonia: An Alternative Idea

Abstract = {Estonia is famous among politicians for its e-Governance policies. One
   core ingredient for this progress is the abolishment of outdated
   technologies and standards as this kind of legacy policy slows down the
   innovation process. This short paper adapts the Estonian approach
   towards legacy policy and proposes a political symbol initiated by the
   EU Presidency Trio of the United Kingdom, Bulgaria and Estonia. The
   entire topic was inspired by the motivation of the Estonian government
   to use the presidency to make a mark for Estonia. The twice-yearly
   occurring process of introducing and disabling the summertime, is not
   only annoying but has also almost exclusively negative impacts.
   Meanwhile, the summertime itself comes with many aspects of questionable
   impact and even opposing empirical results, but it also has some
   generally agreed upon positive influences. This paper takes side against
   the process of changing times, but does not take position for one of the
   possible solutions. This short article shall only inform and show the
   possibilities in regard to the summer time, the EU presidency and the
   political symbolism of celebrating the centenary of the First World War.},

   `border' (finis) and `frontier' (limes) will help to expose the
   political effects of such a tension, unveiling the way in which a solid
   and striated organisation of space has been mobilised in the topographic
   antagonism of the nation, sustaining the phantasm of a self-enclosed,
   self-sufficient finitude.},

Abstract = {This article reviews the scholarship on semi-presidentialism since the
   early 1990s. We identify three waves of semi-presidential studies. The
   first wave focused on the concept of semi-presidentialism, how it should
   be defined, and what countries should be classified as
   semi-presidential. The second wave examined the effect of
   semi-presidential institutions on newly democratized countries. Does
   semi-presidentialism help or hinder the process of democratic
   consolidation? The third wave examines the effect of semi-presidential
   institutions on both recent and consolidated democracies. Third-wave
   studies have been characterized by three questions: to what extent does
   the direct election of the president make a difference to outcomes; to
   what extent does variation in presidential power make a difference; and
   what other factors interact with presidential power to help to bring
   about differential outcomes? The article argues that the concept of
   semi-presidentialism remains taxonomically valid, but that the empirical
   scholarship on countries with semi-presidential institutions needs to
   respond to broader developments within the discipline if it is to remain
   relevant.},

Abstract = {This essay suggests that Machiavelli's claim that the moral vice of
   hypocrisy is inescapable in politics constitutes a real issue for
   democratic politics today. Indeed, it concludes that democratic
   societies are implicated in creating the impetus to hypocritical
   behaviour. The essay questions the prevalent conviction that a liberal
   democratic polity should be premised on transparency and candour, not on
   hypocritical manipulation - a conviction which is paradoxically shared
   by the dirty hands thesis which is mostly owed to Michael Walzer and
   which purportedly takes Machiavelli's insights on the moral messiness of
   politics seriously. Attempts to deny the necessity of political
   hypocrisy misconstrue the realities of democratic politics - the messy
   context in which politicians operate and what is distinctive of
   political friendships. Democratic politicians operate in a context
   ridden with conflict and dependence which renders hypocrisy a necessary
   political virtue and one of the strings that hold together a virtuous
   political life.},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {This article seeks to explore how the BBC made sense of the al-Qaeda
   phenomenon in its flagship ``News at Ten{''} bulletin during the
   aftermath of the September 11th 2001 attacks. Using Critical Multimodal
   Discourse Analysis, it shows how the BBC's representations function as a
   dynamic and continually shifting site upon which a range of fears,
   identities, discourses and forms of knowledge and power struggle and
   contend, and through which a number of different ``al-Qaedas{''}
   manifest themselves. In particular, three shifting modes of visual and
   verbal representation are identified within the BBC's coverage which
   each correspond to a separate understanding of al-Qaeda: the
   ``Islamic{''} mode, the ``Personalised{''} mode and the ``Elusive{''}
   mode. These representations both draw upon and challenge the dominant
   discourses surrounding Islam, non-state terrorism and the identities of
   terrorist suspects, providing audiences with a variety of often
   conflicting ways of seeing and speaking about this entity. As such, the
   article provides insight into the complex nature of the BBC's
   representations of al-Qaeda during its coverage of the September 11th
   2001 attacks, and shows how such complexity serves, albeit
   inadvertently, to legitimise the far-reaching counterterrorism policies
   that were enacted in the aftermath of these attacks.},

Abstract = {We take a new look at the question of the Arab democratic exception by
   looking at the preference for democracy among individuals in the Arab
   world in a comparative context. We use the new sixth wave of the World
   Value Survey, which was collected between 2012 and 2013, and which
   included for the first time 12 Arab countries (up from only four in wave
   5) and 68 non-Arab countries. We innovate empirically by measuring the
   preference for democracy over strong rule in a way that, we argue, is
   more adapted to an understanding of the Arab world than other measures
   used in past studies. Our statistical analysis reveals a democratic gap
   in the Arab region compared to global experience, which is especially
   marked among the more educated individuals, and to a lesser extent among
   the youth and the middle class. We conclude by discussing the reasons
   that may explain the Arab exceptionalism, and argue that it is unlikely
   to be related to culture alone.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {53},

Abstract = {The long economic crisis affecting Spain has brought major social
   consequences. The increasing social divide inside the country is the
   most discussed topic among academics, mass media and members of the
   political spectrum, being the result of growing economic inequalities
   due to high unemployment and harsh adjustment policies of public
   spending. However, and beyond economic issues the crisis is taking its
   toll very deeply in the social imaginary of the country, bringing
   further reflections about the reasons and consequences of the crisis,
   both in short and long term. The aim of this paper is to explore the
   social perceptions of the Spanish citizens about the crisis, focusing on
   aspects such as how Spaniards perceive the consumption of public goods
   and services, in a scenario of a clear hegemony of austerity as the only
   anti-recession remedy. To do so, a discourse analysis on focus groups
   transcriptions (collected during a qualitative research conducted in
   2014) will be carried out. The results show a huge pessimism about the
   future of the welfare state and the Spanish middle class itself, whose
   frustration may lead to future waves of social unrest.},

Title = {RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH STATE AT TIMES OF
   PATRIARCH ALEXY II},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Pages = {8-30},
Abstract = {After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian Orthodox Church and its
   social standing have gone through a significant transformation. This
   institution, which was formerly subject to the communist regime, quickly
   became a strong social force and to a large degree a political power
   under the leadership of Patriarch Alexy II. Over the course of his
   office, the relationship between the Church and the Russian state
   apparatus went through pronounced changes. The main goal of this paper
   was to analyze the transformation from the initial period, in which the
   state and Church operated as two relatively independent actors, to the
   period in which the state and the Church begin to work in close
   cooperation. These two institutions have become closely linked actors in
   a bond that is favorable to both parties. This state of affairs,
   historically labeled a ``throne and altar alliance{''}, is nothing new
   to Russia. This paper was written with the help of a wide range of
   secondary and (mostly) primary sources official Church documents, media
   appearances, and so on. This paper also introduces a number of topics:
   mutual relations of the state and Church after 1991; the transformation
   of the mutual relationship over the course of the 1990s and after
   President Putin's election in 2000; the Church's link to the armed
   forces and its role in the Chechen conflicts; and the influence of the
   Church on building the new identity of post-Soviet Russia. The authors
   of this paper have endeavored to prove that without considering the
   political and social role of the Church, the analysis of political
   processes in post-Soviet Russia would be wholly incomplete.},

Journal = {REVISTA ANDINA DE ESTUDIOS POLITICOS},

Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {5-28},
Abstract = {Over the past decade, China has gradually increased its trade and
   political ties with Latin America, particularly with South American
   countries. This process has prompted important changes regarding China's
   role in the project of a South American regional order, driven by Unasur
   since 2008. Unasur was proposed as an integration block outside of the
   inter-american system led by United States, because it would promote
   regional autonomy. In parallel, the rise of China in the world economy
   generated high expectations about the possible emerge of a multipolar
   international order. This paper seeks to examine the current and
   potential role of China in a South American regional order, suggesting
   that while China increased commercial proximity to South America, its
   main priority is to establish links to the Latin American region as a
   whole, as Unasur is not yet recognized as a strategic regional entity.
   China has not been able to challenge the established regional order led
   by the United States, however is interested in building political
   influence in this region. As a result, China coincides theoretically
   with the goal of autonomy promoted by Unasur, but is also generating
   scenarios for a weaker South America.},

Abstract = {The current situation in Ukraine confirms that the European thesis on
   solving conflicts within peace and diplomacy categories does not work in
   a perfect way. The evaluation of the Russian Federation's activity (RF)
   after occupying the Crimea shows that strategic objectives of Moscow
   have spread farther. In the strategic dimension the hybrid war led by
   Moscow is measured up against the entire NATO as perceived being the
   main threat. Past experiences in Ukraine and the theory assessment show
   that the new generation war run by the RF embraces multi-storey efforts
   directed at the state's function destabilizing, changing the internal
   order or/and leading to the state's bankruptcy not even necessarily
   seizing its territory. The complex nature of the hybrid threats requires
   undertaking integrated actions by the international community. It seems
   it will be possible to reach it while having the common NATO and EU
   doctrine on the hybrid threats counteraction. States, particularly those
   endangered, should draw up and implement their own accustomed strategy
   of the national security that will let opposing both classical and
   hybrid threats with as well as without the NATO aid.},

Abstract = {There is abundant research on how social cleavages shape political
   preferences in developed countries with uninterrupted democracies, but
   we know less about this topic for middle income countries with recently
   restored democracies. In this analysis of the Chilean case, we examine
   with Latinobarometer survey data from 1995 to 2009 the evolution of
   social cleavages as shapers of political preferences (measured with a
   left-right self-placement scale). We find a general process of
   dealignment across time, indicated by the decreasing association between
   political preferences on the one hand, and class, religion and regime
   preferences on the other. We tentatively link dealignment at the mass
   level to the strategies pursued by political parties operating in a
   political and economic context that encourages ideological moderation
   and convergence to the centre. These strategies weaken the
   differentiated signals needed for sustaining an aligned citizenry.},

Abstract = {Quantitative and qualitative surveys, deliberative surveys, citizen
   consultations, the European Citizens' Initiative... The array of policy
   instruments allowing the emergence of a ``European public opinion{''} is
   widely used. This article examines the logics through which it is
   produced from a public policy perspective, by exploring the development
   of the European public opinion policy, its usages and effects. In doing
   so, this paper contributes to current debates about the government of
   the European Union. It paper assumes that forms of instrumentation in
   the European public opinion policy domain contribute over time to the
   production of a specific type of governing resources that is,
   information resources. These forms of policy instrumentation, combined
   with institutionalized forms of citizens' participation and
   representation, enable EU institutions to draw on ``self-knowledge{''}
   tools which are considered critical for developing the EU's own
   governing capacity distinct from that of the Member States.},

   measures remains one of the cornerstones of European security. It
   enhances trust and confidence among participating states of the
   Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and allows
   for intrusive verification measures by the OSCE states. Despite the
   significant success achieved by many osce participating States in
   increasing the number of women in their armed forces, the number of
   women who participate in military verification (under this Document)
   remains low. This article contains information regarding international
   military cooperation related to the verification of military activities
   in which women's involvement remains low. It also provides suggestions
   for further research concerning the reasons why so few women participate
   in the military verification activities and for ways to increase their

Title = {From heaven to hell in ten days: the genocide trial in Guatemala},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2-3, SI},
Pages = {143-169},
Abstract = {Latin America leads the world in efforts to prosecute perpetrators of
   gross violations of human rights in domestic courts. Domestic justice
   offers a number of advantages to international and hybrid tribunals:
   proceedings take place in close proximity to the site of the atrocities,
   facilitating victim participation; they are directed by domestic
   prosecutors and judges, thus contributing to local buy-in; and they can
   strengthen rule of law and legitimize fragile transitional democracies.
   The case of Guatemala appears to contradict such arguments, however,
   given the overturning of the landmark conviction of former dictator Jose
   Efrain Rios Montt on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity and
   the ongoing impasse of the proceedings. Drawing on the author's work as
   an international observer to the genocide trial, interviews with those
   directly involved in the case, and comparative research on human rights
   trials in Latin America, this article suggests an alternative reading.
   By situating the genocide trial in relation to the broader transitional
   justice process in Guatemala and in the region more broadly, it argues
   that current setbacks should be viewed as a backlash to initial
   transitional justice success that is neither unexpected nor fatal to the
   accountability process. Second, the article argues that the genocide
   case is illustrative of a victim-centred approach to human rights
   prosecutions that hold important lessons for transitional justice theory
   and practice, and examines the way in which victims of sexual violence
   were incorporated into prosecutorial strategies and helped to prove that
   a genocide had taken place in Guatemala. Finally, the article argues
   that despite the undoing of the genocide verdict, the very fact that the
   trial took place is historically and politically significant, both for
   survivors and for the construction of collective memory in Guatemala and
   Latin America as a whole.},

Abstract = {The authors employ modern Marxist methodology and theory to analyse
   imperialism and so-called ``empires,{''} making it possible to reveal
   the mechanisms through which the capital and states of the countries
   that make up the ``centre{''} ensure the economic, political and
   ideological manipulation of the ``periphery.{''} On this basis, it is
   shown that the capital and state machines of the countries of the
   semi-periphery in general, and of Russia in particular, are primarily
   objects of imperialist subordination and manipulation. Only in a few
   cases are such countries and their capital capable of being the subjects
   of imperialist policy. An analysis is provided of the contradictions
   affecting relations between the Russia, Ukraine and the West. A system
   of politico-economic, geopolitical and other arguments is also advanced
   with the aim of showing that the Russia does not as a rule act as a
   subject of imperialist policy, and that only in particular cases (in
   which, for the most part, it relies on the Soviet heritage) is it
   capable of resisting the ``rules of the game{''} dictated by the
   imperialist powers. Ironically these instances of resistance prompt
   accusations of ``Russian imperialism.{''}},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {28},

Abstract = {This essay outlines the strengths and limitations of a professional
   ethics for economists. While such an ethics can, by its very existence,
   highlight the limitations of economic knowledge, it does not challenge
   the status of economics as a knowledge standing apart from, and
   presiding over, the practical experiences of citizens/workers/consumers.
   Separate from a larger project to democratize economic ``life{''}
   itself, a professional ethics could even have the effect of
   strengthening the separation between knowledge/subject and practical
   life/object. The essay illustrates this possibility by developing an
   analogy between (1) the relationships among knowledge, ethics, and
   democracy on the plane of ``economics{''} today, and (2) the
   relationships among religion, politics, and civil/economic society Marx
   critically assessed, for his own times, in ``On the Jewish Question.{''}
   The review concludes with an invitation to read The Economist's Oath in
   the context of a broader struggle for economic democracy.},

Journal = {ANALELE UNIVERSITATII BUCURESTI-STIINTE POLITICE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Cosmopolitanism and populism are opposing concepts: populism usually
   sees persons as embedded in national or ethnic communities, while the
   core idea shared by all cosmopolitan views is that all human beings
   belong to a single community and the ultimate units of moral concern are
   individual human beings, not particular forms of human associations.
   However, the paradigm of conceiving both cosmopolitanism and populism is
   changing. Authors discover the promise and relevance of populism, while
   within the political theory of cosmopolitanism there are calls towards
   `roots', as in the concept of rooted or vernacular cosmopolitanisms. In
   this new theoretical context, the incompatibility between populism and
   cosmopolitanism is weakening, points of convergence between two concepts
   start becoming visible. This paper examines the confluences between
   populism and cosmopolitanism, and assesses the limits of this
   convergence. Thus, the first section of the paper examines the main
   features of populism, seen mostly from the perspective of populism as a
   pathology. The second section examines the proposals to see populism as
   part of emancipatory politics, showing that this perspective of
   conceiving populism is compatible with cosmopolitanism. The third
   section identifies the populist emancipatory elements in a cosmopolitan
   discourse and action, while the fourth section examines the possible
   criticism of cosmopolitan populism, pointing that most of the criticism
   of populism in the state context is not valid for populism in a
   cosmopolitan context. The conclusion shows that a cosmopolitan populism
   is not part of a vision of cosmopolitanism as eternal peace and global
   consensus, but of a contestatory and agonistic cosmopolitanism.},

Abstract = {This study examines the question: What are the factors that increase the
   probability of Chinese interference in intrastate wars? Chinese
   behaviour concerning intrastate wars was examined using multivariate
   logistic regressions. The analyses included the general behaviour of
   China regarding interference in intrastate wars, Chinese support of
   violent non-governmental organizations and of state governments. Both
   were also studied separately for the Cold War and the post-Cold War
   eras. Among the covariates that were examined, several emerged as
   possible explanations for China's behaviour: geographic contiguity,
   adversary regime type, and China's relative military capabilities.
   Furthermore, differences were found between Chinese support of violent
   non-governmental organizations and of governments in intrastate wars.
   Different results were also obtained for Cold War and post-Cold War
   eras.},

Abstract = {Research on women prisoners and drug use is scarce in our context and
   needs theoretical tools to understand their life paths. In this article,
   I introduce an intersectional perspective on the experiences of women in
   prison, with particular focus on drug use. To illustrate this, I draw on
   the life story of one of the women interviewed in prison, in order to
   explore the axes of inequality in the lives of women in prison. These
   are usually presented as accumulated and articulated in complex and
   diverse ways. The theoretical tool of intersectionality allows us to
   gain an understanding of the phenomenon of women prisoners who have used
   drugs. This includes both the structural constraints in which they were
   embedded and the decisions they made, considering the circumstances of
   disadvantage in which they were immersed. This is a perspective which
   has already been intuitively present since the dawn of feminist
   criminology in the English-speaking world and can now be developed
   further due to new contributions in this field of gender studies.},

Journal = {TEORIA Y REALIDAD CONSTITUCIONAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {37},
Pages = {405-433},
Abstract = {In a political situation characterized by the undeniable radicalization
   of the nationalist parties that have been governing Catalonia since
   2010, as expressed by the repeated demonstration of their intention to
   secede from Spain -either through negotiation or by a unilateral
   declaration of independence-, and by the inescapable existence of a
   numerically important and socially influential public opinion in favor
   of the separation, the objective of this essay is, firstly, to record
   the successive draft constitutions for a future independent Catalonia
   that have been made public in recent months in the middle of this
   so-called ``process{''}; then to clarify and sistematize their contents,
   noting its shortcomings, and highlighting the most relevant aspects -and
   also the more controversial ones- of their provisions; to assess their
   real chances of ever becoming standard legal norms; and -ultimately- to
   find some common features to all of them in order to better understand
   the ultimate objectives of Catalan separatism as regards the
   constitutional configuration of the State that it aspires to conform.},

Title = {Lessons in suffering: Greek tragedy's teachings on disability through
   Sophocles' Philoctetes},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {335-353},
Abstract = {Political theory often sees disability through the negative language of
   abnormality and inability, which perceives disability as a deficiency
   that deviates from the able-bodied. However, critical disability studies
   strives to transform the disabling language of political theory into an
   enabling project that sees the ability, unique perspectives, capacities,
   and contributions of people with disabilities. Through Sophocles'
   Philoctetes, this article examines the negative ways in which disability
   is conceptualized, socially constructed, and (dis)valued, as well as the
   possibilities for a positive and enabling theory of disability. The
   character of Philoctetes exposes the negative social construction of
   disability as well as the extraordinary ability of those who live with
   chronic impairments. The Philoctetes meditates on the status of the
   disabled who are unfairly isolated from human community and who are
   often unfairly seen in an instrumental fashion that fails to recognize
   their fundamental status as human beings who are capable, valuable, and
   essential for the success of human endeavors and community. For
   political theory, the Philoctetes demonstrates the ability in
   disability, and shines brightly on the essential contributions that
   people with disabilities make in our societies. Philoctetes shows that
   the lives of people who live daily with chronic impairments need not be
   seen as necessarily tragic. Instead, these modes of being speak to human
   diversity, ingenuity, and triumph.},

Abstract = {As the American nonprofit sector continues to grow, so does interest in
   nonprofit management graduate education. MPA programs play a significant
   role in preparing students for work in the nonprofit field. This article
   examines nonprofit management as an area of graduate study, paying
   particular attention to how NASPAA-accredited MPA programs currently
   approach it from a curricular standpoint. The article provides lessons
   for successful nonprofit management track building gleaned from
   experience gained at two universities with accredited MPA programs.
   Specifically, the article illustrates the importance of stakeholder
   commitment, quality curricula, and the use of experiential-learning
   methods in preparing future and current nonprofit leaders. Challenges to
   building a nonprofit management track or increasing nonprofit course
   offerings are also discussed. The article concludes with commentary
   regarding the importance of MPA programs in advancing quality nonprofit
   management graduate education.},

   Constitutional Court: New Evidence, Revised Theory},
Journal = {POLITIKON},

Volume = {43},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {53-77},
Abstract = {Outside South Africa, the South African Constitutional Court is one of
   the most esteemed high courts in the world. Inside the country, however,
   empirical evidence suggests that the Court has been unable to build much
   of a store of popular legitimacy. Some scholars have suggested that the
   shortfall of legitimacy is of little consequence because the Court has
   been able to maintain its independence, largely through the largess of
   the government. My purpose here is to reconsider both the empirical
   evidence on the Court's support and the theoretical position that
   judicial independence can be effectively guaranteed by the government. I
   find that confidence in the Constitutional Court has indeed grown since
   its first decade of operation. However, confidence is not the same thing
   as legitimacy, even if sustained confidence may evolve into
   institutional legitimacy, so my evidence cannot be taken to suggest that
   the Court has developed a ``reservoir of goodwill{''} among the South
   African people. I conclude by identifying some ways in which the
   Constitutional Court might build its popular legitimacy, at little cost
   to itself or its policy-making goals. Developing their own political
   capital ought to be a high priority for all courts aspiring to
   sustainable independence.},

Abstract = {The Worker's Party of Social Justice is the most significant far right
   party in the Czech Republic. Research on this party has not been very
   intensive and has looked at it as a whole. The present study is focused
   on the attitude of the party towards the liberal democratic political
   system of the Czech Republic and the liberal democratic political system
   in general. The main purpose was to investigate whether the party's
   attitude towards the political system is radical (but still compatible
   with the constitution) or anti-system. Two major issues were analyzed:
   criticism or refusal of liberal democracy, and suggested or planned
   changes of the political system. The analyses was based on Sartori's
   narrower definition of anti-system attitude which is broadly accepted
   and believed by the author of this study to be sufficiently
   sophisticated and therefore usable in this case. A wide variety of
   sources of party ideology was researched, including official party
   manifestos, contributions on the party website and in the party press,
   statements of leading members of the party etc. The results show that
   however this far right party pretends to be system-accepting its
   attitude is anti-system. The Worker's Party of Social Justice is a
   representative of a non-democratic ideology.},

Abstract = {Is there a Euroslavia in the making? Europe is increasingly feeling the
   politico-military pressure of a China-supported, Slavic and Eurasian
   Russia re-surging in the pan-European geopolitical map. Russia harbors
   significant geo-strategic ambitions beyond its traditional European and
   Central Asian Near Abroad, and clearly aims to benefit from the ample
   European techno-industrial capital, especially that of Germany, also
   growing in geopolitical stature well beyond its European context. Given
   the institutional weaknesses of the various European organizations in
   handling serious regional crisis effectively, considering the demanding
   American involvement in extra-European conflicts, and in view of Russian
   and German national interest to ensure their growth and national
   security issues, it is possible to envision a future a Russian-German
   gas-for-technology axis in a eurasianized and post-Atlantic and
   post-American Europe.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the study of political simulations of
   terrorism as a hyperreality with a historical analysis of the Libyan hit
   squad scare that haunted the United States over several weeks in late
   1981, when the US media and Reagan administration officials warned of an
   imaginary hit squad of terrorists sent to Washington by Libyan leader
   Muammar Gaddafi to assassinate President Reagan. Through an analysis of
   a range of declassified documents, mainly from the Reagan Library, most
   of which are processed here for the first time, the emergence of the
   rumour, which was planted in the US media through fabricated
   intelligence documents, will be traced to a small group of officials
   within the Reagan administration who tried to gain public support for
   the US government's policy towards Libya.},

Title = {State De-Construction in Iraq and Syria},
Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {57},
Number = {4},
Pages = {560-585},
Abstract = {In International Historical Sociology, states and states systems
   co-constitute each other. While IHS focuses on state formation, this
   paper argues that state de-formation, and in its extremes, state
   failure, is also ``co-constituted{''}. In Syria and Iraq, state failure
   was co-constituted through an interaction between internal insurgencies
   and the Western interventions aiming at regime change. Iraq and Syria
   were created by Western imperialism as weak states suffering from
   identity fragmentation and pervasive irredentism. Ba'thist state
   builders used populist versions of neo-patrimonialism to consolidate
   regimes but excluded social forces were permanently poised for rebellion
   and regime decline gave them opportunities to bid for power.
   Nevertheless, external intervention was the extra factor that initiated
   state de-construction and tipped both into failed states. In Iraq the US
   invasion deconstructed the existing state and established a sectarian
   based regime bound to fail. In Syria, shrinking inclusiveness led to
   revolt but external intervention, making it a battleground of regional
   and global powers, tipped the country into a failed state. Two failed
   states left a vacuum in which the `Islamic State' arose, inviting yet a
   further round of external intervention.},

   perceptions of discrimination},
Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},

Pages = {363-392},
Abstract = {Immigrants' perceptions of discrimination (PD) correlate strongly with
   various political outcomes, including group consciousness and partisan
   identity. Here, we examine the hypothesis that immigrants' PD vary
   across US localities, as threatened responses by native-born residents
   may increase perceived discrimination among neighboring immigrants. We
   also consider the alternative hypothesis that barriers to the expression
   and detection of discrimination decouple native-born attitudes from
   immigrants' perceptions about their treatment. We test these claims by
   analyzing three national surveys of almost 11,000 first-generation
   Latino, Asian, and Muslim immigrants. The results indicate that
   immigrants' PD hardly vary across localities. While anti-immigrant
   attitudes are known to be geographically clustered, immigrants' PD prove
   not to be. This mismatch helps us narrow the potential causes of
   perceived discrimination, and it suggests the value of further research
   into perceived discrimination's consequences for immigrants' social and
   political incorporation.},

Abstract = {2000's and 2010's witnessed diminishing margin of the United States in
   science and technology. Meanwhile, the U.S. remains a clear leader in
   this field. Major driving force of the country's success in the second
   half of the.. century remained assertive federal science policy. The
   article seeks to identify major trends in evolution of the U.S. science
   policy and the reasons behind relative decline of the level of budget
   support of the scientific research. The author studies evolution of the
   policies of George Bush and Barack Obama, as well as the views of
   Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives and the
   Senate. The article also examines the input into the federal policy of
   the governmental bodies, which are directly responsible for its
   implementation, as well as non-governmental organizations, which seek to
   advocate interests of scientists; it studies rising competition between
   the executive authorities and legislators for the recognition as a major
   champion of the academic community as well as American Recovery and
   Reinvestment Act.},

Abstract = {Continuing with the series of articles devoted to the problematique of
   political form, this time S.Kaspe addresses the issue of democracy. The
   author believes that the emptiness of the center (in Shils'
   interpretation of the term) should be considered a ``stable core{''} of
   the essentially contested and therefore extensible concept (and the
   project), or its fundamental characteristic, which remains unchanged
   despite all external transformations: ``No one ... can imagine herself
   the sole spokesman for and translator of democratic values, the sole
   ruler and manager of democratic institutions, the sole prophet of
   democratic transcendence{''}. The roots of this normative statement are
   found in the field of political theology. The main (but not the only)
   means of its practical implementation are separation of powers and
   multi-party system. It is their combined effect that makes democracy
   although imperfect, but still rather effective way of protection against
   political evil.},

Abstract = {Emmanuel Levinas is a profoundly influential figure in several
   post-World War II continental European philosophical traditions. A
   growing scholarship has started to explore the links between his work
   and Judaism and, inter alia, phenomenology, feminism, and
   deconstruction, but very little has been written in the English-speaking
   world on the connections between his thought and that of Marx. This
   essay is an attempt at an encounter between the two thinkers, exploring
   how Levinas's radical critique of ontology in the Western philosophical
   traditions can be brought to bear on Marx's antihumanist critique of
   capitalism as a way to think of an alternative ethical stand that starts
   from alterity, which is where the essay finds the spirituality of both
   thinkers to reside. While the theoretical planes on which they operate
   are different, through a difficult but necessary conversation, Levinas
   and Marx can pose to one another fundamental questions with crucial
   implications for their orientation.},

Abstract = {This article attempts to link `who governs' in Romania with `what they
   do when governing'. It utilizes time series analysis of actual
   expenditures since the revolution, and examines the division of outlays
   between national budgets and local authority budgets; between capital,
   current, and transfer allocations; and across the various substantive
   purposes for state expenditure. The main hypotheses are that the
   government in power, the political party of the Prime Minister who heads
   that government, the incentives of electoral law, and the timing of the
   election cycle should all prove statistically relevant, causing visible
   deflections from long-term expenditure trends. Most often, however, no
   systematic variation is observed, raising questions about the degree of
   actual representation.},

Abstract = {The second Congo war (1998-2003) was a very complex conflict that
   involved a vast array of actors, interests and issues. After a stalemate
   was reached on the battlefield with none of the warring parties able to
   achieve military victory, peace negotiations became the only viable
   option to end the war. Civil society organisations were directly
   involved in both the peace process and the subsequent transitional
   dispensation designed to resolve the conflict, providing some sort of
   popular legitimacy to these two processes clearly dominated by
   politico-military forces. The central argument of this article is that
   while civil society involvement in the peace and transitional processes
   was instrumental in resolving the conflict underpinning the second Congo
   war, it entrenched a legacy: the politicisation of the civil society
   movement as inaugurated in the early 1990s. Indeed, although
   ground-breaking, the direct involvement of civil society in the
   management of transitional institutions contributed to weakening its
   member organisations as many of their leaders were either directly
   recruited into existing political platforms or simply decided to
   establish their own political organisations and join active politics.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the study of changes in the party political
   space of Russia. On the basis of analyzing the results of the regional
   elections held on September 13, 2015, Yu.Korgunyuk and S.Shpagin denote
   the strengthening of the tendency that started a year earlier to
   ``hermetization{''} of the party political system of the country and to
   waning of the effect of the 2012 party reform, and at the same time the
   fragility of the ground beneath this seeming stability. The elections
   were accompanied by further simplification and flattening of the
   political space. All regions without a single exception witnessed the
   number of political cleavages reduced to two. The number of electoral
   cleavages also dropped. The authors conclude that the 2016 Duma
   elections will see further tightening of the political and electoral
   space with fractures along the weakest links. The only question is where
   exactly these fractures will appear and whether they entail the failure
   of the whole system.},

Abstract = {Should 16-year-olds be entitled to participate in elections? We theorize
   that mock elections for adolescents, who are not eligible to vote,
   affect the short-term support among the general public for lowering the
   voting age. To test our theoretical expectation, we utilize variation
   among municipalities in the organization of mock elections during the
   Danish local elections in 2009. Difference-in-difference estimates with
   data from the subsequent local elections in 2013 demonstrate that
   citizens in municipalities with mock elections for adolescents were more
   supportive of lowering the voting age and that their support was
   strongly rooted in ideological differences.},

Abstract = {From an analysis of the American health care policies, this article
   proposes a renewal of our understanding of the ``neo-liberal turning
   point{''} of the 1970s. It highlights a dimension that is usually
   ignored in the classical studies of this period: the transformations
   that occurred in the 1950s and 1960s in the social spaces where ideas
   and knowledge are produced (mainly the academic space and the space of
   expertise). Thus it invites us to relativize the impact of the economic
   and budgetary context of the 1970s, which is generally considered as the
   trigger of the paradigmatic change. On the other hand, it underlines the
   interest of introducing some elements of the sociology of knowledge into
   the analysis of policy change.},

Abstract = {The paper investigates whether there is a link between the main radical
   right-wing parties in Greece, Italy and Sweden and the pre-dominant
   church institutions within these countries. The focus lies on the
   interaction between the party's ideology and the church's political
   discourse. We distinguish between the `internal supply side' (the
   party's discourse on the religious agenda), the `external supply side'
   (the Church's current discourse), and the `demand side' (the Church's
   traditional discourse). The research aim is to determine whether
   religious voters (who are formal church members, who believe and who
   practice regularly) might constitute a potential electorate for radical
   right-wing parties. This assumption builds on the `pathological
   normalcy' thesis that radical right-wing parties promote an extreme
   version of the mainstream values in society (Mudde 2010). The method for
   elaborating the official church and party documents is based on the
   theorization of the so-called Essex school of discourse analysis. The
   findings of the paper are that the religious electorate is a potential
   pool for the radical right party family to the extent that the internal
   supply side and the external supply side overlap. This applies to the
   largest extent in Greece, to a medium extent in Italy and to a low
   extent in Sweden.},

Abstract = {In an effort to delineate a more plausible account of political change,
   this paper reads Pierre Bourdieu's social theory as a corrective to
   exaggerated enthusiasm about the emancipatory force of reflection. This
   revised account valorizes both Bourdieu's insights into the acquired,
   embodied, durable nature of the political habitus and judgment
   theorists' trust in individuals' reflection as a perpetual force of
   novelty and spontaneity in the public sphere of democratic societies.
   The main purpose of this exercise is to reveal the mix of continuity and
   discontinuity that is characteristic of most transformations in the
   political common sense of democratic societies. In other words, this
   paper seeks to offer a more complex understanding of the inertial
   character of reflective judgment and of the difficulty of shifting the
   categories that define the political common sense. By cross-pollinating
   the ever-growing literature on reflective judgment and Bourdieu's sombre
   theory of politics, we can better calibrate our expectations regarding
   the possibilities of significant democratic transformation in late
   capitalist societies.},

Title = {INTERPRETATIVE APPROACH TOWARDS VOTING BEHAVIOR. EVIDENCE FROM RUSSIA},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2016},
Number = {4},
Pages = {65-80},
Abstract = {In the last 15 years Freedom House has downgraded Russia's status from
   ``intermediate{''} into ``consolidated authoritarian{''} political
   regime. Despite its gradual sliding in terms of political rights and
   civil liberties since early 2000s, the country did not witness any
   significant change, either upward or downward, in terms of voting
   turnout in the federal elections. Why people vote in Russia after all, a
   country where voting does neither change the government nor seems to
   influence its decisions? This paper answers the question by analyzing
   Russian public opinion expressed within the frame of the World Values
   Survey. Beyond the specific Russian case, this research bridges the gap
   existing between statistical and interpretative approaches in political
   science. It provides cultural studies the rigidity of statistical
   methodology, and statistics the richness of hermeneutics. Going beyond
   citizens' interests and expectations, traditionally at the center of
   voting turnout explanation, this study finds clues to something
   conceptually very close to the sense of civic duty as a voting
   determinant. In addition to this, the puzzling phenomenon of persistent
   voting behavior in Russia can be explained in terms of cultural
   significance of the national belonging and pride. On this rather large
   foundation four independent from one another add-ons suggest the
   existence of cultural sub-groups that understand voting as a sign of:
   confidence toward the strong political leader, confidence toward all
   public institutions, altruism, and, lastly, traditionalism.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {272-282},
Abstract = {This article examines whether the American cultural phenomena of the
   practice of Buddhism or the Buddhism-derived technique of mindfulness
   are likely to be helpful to the political left. It summarizes the
   central teachings of the ancient Buddhist texts, with particular focus
   on the issues of mindfulness and politics. It also reviews the political
   history of Buddhist countries. The author argues that although modern
   Buddhism has shed its historical embrace of absolutist monarchy in favor
   of republicanism, and although there is some ideological overlap between
   Buddhism and the American Left, Buddhism in America is too small a
   movement for it to be of much significance for progressive politics.
   Mindfulness appears to be capable of becoming a much larger phenomenon,
   but its separation from its Buddhist origins makes it also unlikely to
   be strategically important for the Left.},

Abstract = {In previous work, we have advanced towards the identification and
   differentiation of three categories of powers: world powers, middle
   powers and regional powers. But beyond the world powers and middle
   powers that are in the core of the world-system, and regional powers
   that are located in the semi-periphery, is it possible to speak of
   powers that are in the periphery? In terms of peripheral States, can
   they be classified as ``powers{''}? What is its relevance and scope?
   Such ``powers{''}, can be grouped into a new category? If so, what
   features would they share? The aim of this document is to propose and to
   debate a new category of powers in the international system: the
   subregional powers.},

Title = {Catalonia, between autonomy and self-determination (a proposal)},
Journal = {TEORIA Y REALIDAD CONSTITUCIONAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {37},
Pages = {221-248},
Abstract = {The aforementioned thesis is right, since the Spanish autonomic state
   should become a federal state, following the German model. Nonetheless,
   we cannot forget the fact that Catalan and Basque nationalists consider
   that, far from satisfying their self-government expectations, the
   federal model is utterly insufficient. Whether we like or not, Catalonia
   and the Basque Country are different from the other fifteen autonomous
   communities. Unlike the rest, they are true nations, which (always) aim
   at a higher degree of self-government. The inadequacy of the traditional
   federal model with regard to those two territories is quite evident, as
   well as the need to urgently find a realistic formula to ensure a stable
   coexistence within the Spanish state. Our proposal, which demands a
   constitutional reform, settles on the formula of ``asymmetric
   federalism{''} or ``dual federalism{''}. This formula would imply the
   constitutional recognition of a specific legal status for Catalonia and
   the Basque Country as free associated states, granting the maximum
   degree of self-government compatible with the Spanish state. Thereby,
   the Spanish federal state would consist, for one thing, of fifteen
   ``member states{''} or common federated states and, there again, two
   ``free associated states{''}.},

Abstract = {Partisanship and gender are powerful heuristic cues used by citizens to
   understand their elected officials' ideology. When these cues send
   complementary signals - a Democratic woman or a Republican man - we
   expect they will aid citizens in evaluating their leaders' political
   ideology. However, when partisanship and gender send conflicting
   signals, we expect citizens will be more likely to misperceive their
   leaders' beliefs. We test this proposition using ideological evaluations
   of incumbent US senators collected in the 2010 and 2012 Cooperative
   Congressional Election Studies. The findings support our hypotheses,
   illustrating voters' reliance on both partisan and gender cues. Our
   results suggest potential consequences for not only Republican women,
   but also Democratic men.},

Abstract = {Assessing the socio-political trends as they unfold is an art, and it
   needs to be approached from various angles. Bevir's anti-foundationalist
   approach hinges upon the belief (not fact) that governance and networks
   have replaced government and hierarchies. His analysis is constructed
   around several strawmen (expert civil servants, street-level
   bureaucrats, judges, Keynesians, social welfare officials, and the
   wicked, modernist social sciences) rather than based in careful and
   balanced empirical evidence. To `cherry-pick' some non-representative
   cases in support of an ideological perspective is academically
   unsatisfying.},

   economic field. Finally, it analyzes possible and alternative scenarios

Abstract = {The secret ballot is considered a central feature of democratic
   elections, but its practical implications may be contested when Internet
   voting (and remote voting in general) is introduced. How do citizens
   understand the principle of the secret ballot in practice? The issue was
   brought to the fore in a trial with Internet voting that was conducted
   in 12 Norwegian municipalities for the 2013 parliamentary election.
   Based on a representative population survey, we explore how Norwegian
   voters approached the principle of the secret ballot in the context of
   Internet voting. A large majority supported the general principle, but
   the picture became more nuanced when it was put to the test of concrete
   situations. Unless the situation involved coercion or undue influence,
   many people were willing to accept that voting can be observed by
   others-even if this was a breach of legal regulations.},

Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {259-277},
Abstract = {The involvement of the European Union in DR Congo from 2003-2006 raised
   the possibility that collaboration between the United Nations and
   regional organizations was taking a new turn in maintaining
   international peace and security. From the outset it seemed as if the
   relationship between the United Nations and the European Union was being
   enhanced as the two organizations set up a framework of cooperation in
   the joint declarations of 2003 and 2007. However, the argument in this
   article is that although organizations like the United Nations and
   European Union are dependent on each other's resources, organizational
   and member state interests and capability parity (whereby two
   organizations have similar functional areas like police reforms or
   peacekeeping) create a constrained environment due to overlap and
   crowded operational space that negatively affects cooperation and
   resource sharing.},

Pages = {395-406},
Abstract = {The departmental elections of March 2015 redrew the French political
   landscape, setting the new terms of electoral competition in advance of
   the regional elections of December 2015 and, more critically, the
   presidential election of April-May 2017. These elections saw the
   far-right National Front (FN) come top in both rounds only to be
   outmanoeuvred by the mainstream parties and prevented from winning a
   single department. As a case study in vote-seat distortion, the
   elections highlighted a voting system effective in keeping the FN out of
   executive power but deficient in terms of democratic representation and
   inadequate as a response to the new tripartite realities of France's
   changing political landscape.},

Abstract = {Ross argues that oil wealth reduces women's economic and political
   power, but critics maintain that accounting for a community's attitudes
   toward gender equality makes the gendered resource curse disappear. This
   article disentangles the two perspectives by studying the effects of
   resource wealth on women's economic and political status in the U.S.
   states, where resource wealth varies significantly while cultural
   differences are comparatively small. Data between 1997 and 2012 reveal
   evidence of a gendered resource curse, consistent with Ross. I also
   update the theory of the gendered resource curse by showing, via a
   culture-augmented labor-leisure model of workforce participation, that
   far from being irrelevant when accounting for varying attitudes toward
   gender roles, resource wealth and those patriarchal attitudes combine to
   suppress even more women's economic and political influence. Data from
   the U.S. states support this expectation as well.},

Abstract = {In this article I explore the experiences of women of color in the
   academy through the lens of intersectionality. I use three major lessons
   of intersectionality research to frame the experiences of women of color
   in the academy and in particular how identity matters for women of
   color's experiences in fields such as political science where their
   numbers are quite small. Beyond offering an overview of their
   experiences, I follow with a critical conversation of the supports and
   intervention strategies necessary to have women of color not only
   survive to tenure but build sustainable careers. The strategies and
   interventions rely on a both/and strategy, using strategies that are
   common in the academy coupled with strategies that are uniquely situated
   for women of color. These strategies and interventions require
   department heads, deans, and other senior university leaders to act as
   allies supporting the career-sustaining decisions women of color make
   that may deviate from the norm. These allies are also critical partners
   in creating the types of workplace cultures that allow women of color to
   thrive in their fields.},

Abstract = {Political competition may have virtuous effects similar to the effect
   that economic competition has in markets. Using cross-sectional data on
   local elections in Mexico, we evaluate the effect of political
   competition on the provision of local public goods, controlling for
   socio-economic and demographic factors. Evidence suggests that political
   competition is positively related to the coverage of municipal public
   services, having a greater effect in those areas with the highest
   poverty and income inequality conditions.},

Pages = {347-379},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the meaning of secession in international and
   constitutional law. It also examines the phenomenon of secession in
   European law. This requires studying two types of problems: the
   secession of a member state of the European Union and the fragmentation
   of a Member State for the secession of part of its territory. The
   conclusion is that conservation or fragmentation of a Member State of
   the European Union is not an internal matter. In our opinion, the
   political and legal system of the Union can be characterized also
   federally, which prevents the national and regional authorities to carry
   out unilateral acts that go against the principle of Community federal
   loyalty and European citizenship.},

Title = {The emotions of powerlessness},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {83-121},
Abstract = {After briefly considering cognitive aspects of powerlessness, we propose
   that the affective basis of powerlessness is comprised of four primary
   emotions-acceptance-acquiescence, anticipation-expectation, sadness, and
   fear. Plutchik's psychoevolutionary model of primary emotions, together
   with a partial classification of pairwise combinations of these four
   emotions, enables a theoretical model hypothesizing that powerlessness
   also involves six secondary-level emotions - fatalism, pessimism,
   resignation, anxiety, submissiveness, and shame. A quantitative content
   analysis of 564 life-historical interviews of Australian Aborigines and
   Euro-Australians was used for structural equations models relating
   objective and subjective powerlessness. The results of these analyses
   fit the data. Cultural and sex difference in the manifest variables were
   analyzed. This work aspires to contribute to alienation theory, to
   establish a linkage between alienation theory and the sociology of
   emotions, and to develop hierarchical, lexical categorization analysis.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade and a half, Carl Schmitt has become firmly
   established in the domestic intellectual space. Now everyone, who at
   least somehow comes in touch with the sphere of political theory and
   philosophy, is familiar, if not with the main provisions of the concept,
   then at least with the definition of the political as a distinction
   between ``friend{''} and ``enemy{''}. Realizing that it hardly makes
   sense to review the texts, which not only were published 80-90 years
   ago, but also became classic in the past decades and produced a diverse
   literature, A.Teslya sets for himself a fundamentally different task to
   identify a number of possible useful turns of discussion out of those
   turns, which may be relevant in the context of domestic political
   thought, but have not been sufficiently articulated yet.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2016},
Number = {3},
Pages = {181-191},
Abstract = {History of concepts has influenced several political science
   disciplines: political philosophy, political theory, political history,
   history of social and political thought, even political analysis.
   Despite considerable interest of Soviet and post-Soviet humanities to
   the social and political vocabulary, for a long time this impact was not
   as noticeable in Russia as in the West. It was only in 2000-2010s when
   active development of corresponding scholar approaches started and the
   key works of R. Koselleck, K. Skinner and other scholars were
   translated. After Russian readers studied achievements of the leading
   schools, German Historical Institute in Moscow issued a translation of
   selected articles from the German dictionary ``Geschichtliche
   Grundbegriffe: Historisches Lexikon zur politisch-sozialen Sprache in
   Deutschland{''} (1972-1997), edited by O. Brunner, W. Conze and R.
   Koselleck. This article reviews the translated book in the context of
   Russian studying of the history of concepts and the formation of this
   approach as a political sub-discipline. In accordance with the approach
   proposed by J. Farr, the methodological basis for the studying of social
   and political concepts should be ``political theory of conceptual
   change{''} which deals with language as a political tool, and with
   conceptual changes as political changes. One of the characteristics of
   development of a scientific discipline is formation of a system of
   reference books. Russian scholars have already gained considerable
   experience in the study of social and political concepts, which allows
   to approach closely the issue of the preparation of reference books and
   systematic descriptions of Russian concepts.},

Abstract = {This article examines federal dynamics during times of crisis in
   fiscally decentralized federations using Switzerland as an example.
   Based on qualitative research, we analyse how the relationship between
   the federal government and the cantons evolved during the recent `Great
   Recession' and ensuing financial crisis. We contend that fiscally
   decentralized structures, as well as the consensus-oriented institutions
   of the political system, protect the federal balance of power. Our
   results show that Switzerland indeed adapted well to the crisis of the
   2009 economic recession. However, the deficit crisis has revealed
   challenging coordination problems, notably in the areas of fiscal
   equalization and corporate taxation, which have the potential to put
   federal stability under stress. So far, the system has adapted well and
   safeguarded the federal order. Due to its combination of fiscally
   decentralized institutions and a strong consensus culture, Switzerland
   has proven to be a particularly robust federation.},

Abstract = {After having decided the objective of independence, the political
   parties in favour of this objective had to find a way how to articulate
   their aspirations. Since there is no legal way within the national or
   international law, the independence movement based their demands in the
   democratic principle by building the so-called right to decide. However
   this right to decide means to limit the democratic principle to a single
   electoral act, with unilaterally established rules and outside the
   existing legal framework. In this article we try to disprove both the
   supposed opposition between the rule of law and the democratic
   principle, as well as the supposed democratic spirit of the right to
   decide. Along with this, we will argue that it is impossible to
   constitutionalise the right of self-determination. The right of
   self-determination is opposed to the essence of any constitutional
   order, moreover the difficulties of setting the conditions in order to
   implement this right, and particularly, the definition of the subject,
   makes the application impossible.},

Title = {Deterring Things With Words: Deterrence as a Speech Act},
Journal = {NEW PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Pages = {23-50},
Abstract = {As Cold War historians and fans of the film Doctor Strangelove know,
   deterrence can be a tricky business. The complexity of deterrence and
   the lack of attention that has been paid to its social effects have too
   often left one of its forms - nuclear deterrence - depoliticized,
   uncontested, and thus a danger to us all. I argue in this article that
   speech act theory can provide insights into deterrence and its
   concomitant political effects. It can be used to philosophically explain
   the communicative difficulties involved in deterrent relationships, and
   to form a basis for a critical stance on deterrence as politics. This
   entails a shift of focus from deterrence as a state of mind to the
   politics of deterrence and the deontic powers it wields - a shift from
   the causative aspects of deterrence to the deontology of deterrents. The
   analysis of such political functions is aided by the neologism of
   deterrentification, which refers to assertive and declarative acts that
   alter the status functions of things so that they are thought to act as
   deterrents and bring about determent in someone or something. It also
   aids in conceptualizing how the status of deterrents can be cancelled,
   and how nuclear weapons can be drawn away from the exceptional sphere of
   deterrence and back into the sphere of politics. Such a status
   transformation is required to achieve a sustained nuclear disarmament.},

Abstract = {This paper responds to Evans and Kat's critique of the valence politics
   model of electoral choice. Their critique is deficient in several
   respects. First, the authors do not test the valence politics model,
   which is motivated by a theory of voting rather than a claim about the
   relationship between generalized measures of ``party preference{''} and
   ``party performance.{''} Second, Evans and Kat do not provide
   theoretical grounding for partisanship, which they claim is strongly
   exogenous to other variables of interest. Third, there are several
   specification and testing problems with their structural equation model.
   We study the properties of the valence model using a vector error
   correction model of aggregate monthly survey data gathered throughout
   the New Labour Era. Consistent with theoretical expectations, key
   valence politics variables constitute a powerful cointegrated system in
   which the dynamics of partisanship are endogenous to other variables in
   the system.},

Abstract = {Although a voluminous literature has shed light on the relationship
   between economic conditions and government accountability, most studies
   in this literature have implicitly assumed that the actions of competing
   political parties are either irrelevant or that they cancel each other
   out. In this paper, we take an important first step toward relaxing this
   strong assumption. We develop and test a set of theoretical propositions
   from the issue competition literature about the amount of emphasis that
   parties place on the economy during election campaigns. We test these
   propositions with an estimation technique that properly situates the
   motivations of rival elites within the context of spatial party
   competition using a spatial autoregressive model. On a sample of 22
   advanced democracies from 1957 to 2006, we find strong support for the
   proposition that parties with a greater role in economic policymaking
   respond to worsening economic conditions by increasing their emphasis on
   the economy during election campaigns. We also find strong evidence of
   spatial contagion effects as parties respond positively to the campaign
   strategies of ideologically proximate parties. This finding reveals a
   fundamental link in the chain of economic accountability and has
   important implications for the study of party competition.},

Number = {51},

Abstract = {Past research has demonstrated the vast spectrum of political ideas that
   have been held by Muslim-Arab intellectuals, especially with regard to
   the concept of democracy. Their approaches range from showing the
   compatibility of Islamic sources and democracy to claiming their
   irreconcilability. However, these approaches have hardly been attached
   systematically to their socio-political circumstances. As a consequence,
   the sincerity of the intellectuals as well as the representativeness of
   their thought has remained highly contested. Therefore, it remains
   unclear how this spectrum of approaches has to be interpreted. The
   article highlights specific problems of `Western' research with regard
   to `non-Western' political thought in general, depicts major findings
   regarding Islamic-Arab normative theories of democracy, and discusses
   approaches that help to contextualize theories systematically. These
   approaches will also help to better assess the sincerity of
   intellectuals and the representativeness of their ideas.},

Abstract = {What determines the balance that democratizing constitutions strike
   between majority empowerment and individual rights? Some constitutions
   deliberately handicap state power to forestall threats to liberty, while
   others try to empower the government to hold the country together. We
   answer this question in the context of post-Arab Spring
   constitution-making, hypothesizing a U-shaped relationship between
   polarization among politically significant factions and net
   majority-empowering provisions in constitutions of new democracies, a
   relationship mediated by breadth of inclusion in the constitutional
   drafting process. We test the hypothesis through a controlled case
   comparison of Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt, the three Arab-majority
   countries in which protestors successfully toppled authoritarian
   regimes.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {44},
Pages = {235-244},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Democratic theorists argue that vigorous competition between
   candidates/parties is essential for democracy to flourish because it
   engages citizens' political interest and ultimately makes elected
   officials more accountable to their constituents. Using data on
   citizens' perceptions of government responsiveness to their political
   opinions from the American National Election Studies and the Ranney
   measure of party competition for control of state government, we examine
   the effects of competition on citizens' political attitudes from 1952 to
   2008. Our analysis reveals that citizens feel government is more
   responsive to them when there is greater competition between the two
   parties for control of government in their state. However, this
   relationship is confined only to citizens who identify with the party
   that controls government in their state. We also find that the
   relationship between competition and efficacy is strongest among
   citizens with lower levels of education and income. These results
   suggest that vigorous competition for control of state government can
   have important implications for citizens' political attitudes. (C) 2016

Abstract = {The 2016 presidential campaign broke the mold when it comes to patterns
   of political advertising. Using data from the Wesleyan Media Project, we
   show the race featured far less advertising than the previous cycle, a
   huge imbalance in the number of ads across candidates and one candidate
   who almost ignored discussions of policy. This departure from past
   patterns, however, was not replicated at the congressional level. We
   draw some lessons about advertising from the 2016 campaign, suggesting
   that its seeming lack of effectiveness may owe to the unusual nature of
   the presidential campaign with one unconventional candidate and the
   other using an unconventional message strategy, among other
   non-advertising related factors.},

   presents a new dataset of the date, duration, and policy coding of more
   than 70,000 meetings of Council working parties, covering all areas of
   the Council's policy activities between 1995 and 2014. In terms of both
   scope and resolution, the data allow for the generation of unprecedented
   insights into what issues occupy the Council's agenda, how that varies
   between and within policy areas, and how that changes over time. After
   discussing conceptual issues and explaining the construction of the
   dataset, the article demonstrates its usefulness and versatility through
   analyses of the Council's political attention at various levels of

Title = {Elections as a democratic linkage mechanism: How elections boost
   political trust in a proportional system},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {44},
Pages = {46-55},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Elections offer a privileged moment in representative democracy, when
   citizens have the opportunity to express their views, both on the track
   record of the incumbent government, as on the way the country should be
   governed in the future. Procedural fairness theory assumes that taking
   part in a decision making procedure that is perceived to be fair,
   strengthens the legitimacy of the entire process. Most of the empirical
   research assumes that the attitudinal effects of elections are mainly
   due to the fact that one's preferred party wins the elections. In
   multi-party systems, however, such a clear distinction is not always
   possible and therefore it is hypothesized that the winner-loser-logic is
   weaker in this kind of party system. In this study we rely on a unique
   Belgian panel study to ascertain how electoral participation has an
   effect on political trust. The results show that in a proportional
   system all voters rise in political trust following their participation
   in elections. The winner-loser effect is not significant. Furthermore,
   the analyses suggest that especially the respondents with the initially
   lowest trust levels gain most by participating in elections. The
   theoretical implication of this finding is that apparently elections are
   still considered to be an important and legitimate linkage mechanism
   between citizens and the political system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The Crisis of the Uyghur problem has transformed into a key element of
   China's overall national politics, identity politics, international
   image, national security perception, and relations with the Islamic
   world. No effort has been undertaken toward discussion of the issue or
   recognition of the existence of a problem. The region and its population
   continue to be perceived as a threat to the Chinese State. Because of
   this, Uyghur communities have become alienated from the state, and
   tension between Uyghurs and Han Chinese has escalated. The Uyghur issue
   has begun to grow into a geopolitical and strategic problem for the
   emerging economic power and regional ambitions of China. The first step
   for the solution is only possible if China changes its approach to the
   issue and relieves its security based approach to the problem.},

Volume = {68},

Abstract = {This article examines why and how scholars should acknowledge and name
   each of the diverse political actors and institutions that typically are
   objectified as `indigenous peoples' on the global stage, or `Maori' in
   New Zealand. For instance, rather than suggesting a political
   relationship or conflict exists between `Maori and the Crown', political
   scientists and theorists should name the political actors and political
   institutions for which Maori is a shorthand, for example, `Te Runanga o
   Ngai Tahu (the corporate entity of the Ngai Tahu whanui) and the
   Committee of Tuahiwi Marae disagreed with the Crown'. A variety of
   reasons are discussed as to why this objectification of Maori (and any
   other indigenous population) as a single political actor has occurred,
   the problems are pointed out, and a range of examples are given. Not
   every use of the terms `Maori', `indigenous peoples' or similar
   descriptors in political science stands in for a specific political
   actor (e.g. sometimes, it is suggesting a cleavage or a group at whom a
   policy is directed), but where scholars are describing or suggesting
   political action, they should be careful in their use of ethnic labels.
   I suggest that it would be more productive to study the specific
   contexts, intentions and actions of individuals and institutions that
   might consider indigeneity as being part of their identity.},

Abstract = {Can fieldwork still be done in today's most violent warzones? We contend
   that long-held methodological principles about power and impartiality do
   not hold in today's conflict-ridden environments. Research of this kind
   can still be pursued, but only if the scholar's place is reconceived as
   one of limited power and unavoidable partiality. We argue that those
   still able to do fieldwork in sites of increasing danger do so by virtue
   of building their own `tribes,' forming and joining different social
   micro-systems to collect data and, in some cases, survive. Field
   research must, therefore, be recognized as its own form of foreign
   intervention. In considering the future of political science research in
   the most challenging war-torn settings, we examine the risks and
   opportunities that accompany `tribal politics' of this kind and
   underline the importance of reflecting on our own positionality in the
   process of knowledge production.},

Abstract = {There is an inherent connection between the party cover and policy
   availability theories that has been largely overlooked by the
   presidential use of force literature. Party cover views the president's
   party strength in Congress as the prominent structural source shaping
   presidential incentives by diffusing responsibility in foreign policy.
   But policy availability adds to this view by explaining how such
   domestic conditions shape the variety of choices (or tools) presidents
   have for demonstrating political leadership. Policy availability
   anticipates that presidential incentives to use the Constitution's
   Article II authority across foreign policy operations will vary
   depending on the president's relationship with Congress. This analysis
   provides insight into claims made by policy availability arguments
   regarding the role of Congress in explaining presidential decisions to
   initiate military interventions. The findings point to important
   differences in the effects of Congress on presidential decisions for
   low-risk versus high-risk military missions. We find that the
   president's ability to legislate decreases the likelihood of
   humanitarian interventions. In addition, we find that as the president's
   relationship with Congress becomes more legislatively productive,
   presidents seem significantly more drawn toward high- risk military
   interventions. We infer from these findings that policy availability
   represents a powerful motivation in the president's calculation to
   engage in foreign policy interventions.},

   vote. In fact, they might be a rational expression of discontent with
   party policy offerings. By employing individual and party system-level
   data on eighteen European party systems, this article focuses on voter
   discontent and voter apathy as two major determinants of casting an
   invalid vote and seeks to answer why some voters intentionally waste
   their votes despite paying the costs of voting. I find that higher
   distinct policy offerings decrease the probability of casting an invalid
   vote. However, voting behaviors of politically sophisticated and
   unsophisticated voters vary conditionally on the diversity of policy
   offerings and the cost of information. On one hand, when a party system
   offers a larger set of policy offerings, politically sophisticated
   voters become less likely to cast an invalid vote and more likely to
   support niche parties. On the other hand, sophisticated voters cannot
   deal with increasing cost of information, and are more likely to cast an
   invalid vote, especially in party systems with compulsory voting where
   the cost of nonvoting is higher.},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of cognitive ability on ideological
   voting. We find, using a U.S. sample and a Danish sample, that the
   effect of cognitive ability rivals the effect of the traditionally
   strongest predictor of ideological voting, political sophistication.
   Furthermore, the results are consistent with the effect of cognitive
   ability being partly mediated by political sophistication. Much of the
   effect of cognitive ability remains, however, and is not explained by
   differences in education or openness to experience either. The
   implications of these results for democratic theory are discussed.},

   the period 2008-2012. First, I built a baseline for 2008, where none of
   the police sectors had installed cameras, then the difference was
   compared between baseline and the percentage of crimes in each sector of
   temporary cuts 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, by linear regression (OLS),
   using as an explanatory variable the number of cameras in each sector,
   but no evidence was found to suggest that the installation of cameras
   had some effect in reducing crime.},

Abstract = {Why are most African emerging democracies failing to consolidate and
   reach the two-turnover test? Most scholars attribute this to the poor
   quality of elections and limited institutionalization of vertical
   accountability, overlooking some important variables. This article
   challenges this conception both theoretically and empirically by
   focusing on the quality of horizontal accountability illustrated by
   observations of comparative interest in Liberia's emerging democracy.
   Since the end of Liberia's bloody civil war in 2003, two successive and
   successful democratic elections (2005 and 2011) have been organized,
   putting Liberia on the path towards democratic consolidation. When
   analysing the electoral mechanism of vertical2016 accountability, many
   scholars have been enthusiastic about the prospects of democratic
   consolidation in Liberia, most of them neglecting the horizontal
   accountability processes that are also crucial for the quality and
   durability of democracy. This article analyses the processes and
   challenges of democratic consolidation in Liberia by focusing on key
   institutions of horizontal accountability. It argues that although the
   country has made some progress towards democratization since 2005, the
   domination and centralization of executive power, weak and dependent
   institutions of horizontal accountability (legislature, judiciary,
   national elections commission, general auditing commission, and
   anti-corruption commission) are major challenges to the consolidation of
   democracy. These findings have important implications for our
   understanding of horizontal accountability and democratic consolidation
   in African emerging democracies.},

Journal = {PUBLIUS-THE JOURNAL OF FEDERALISM},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-50},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Why is fiscal federalism so often dysfunctional from an economic point
   of view? Particularly in the developing world, fiscally decentralized
   systems often lack hard budget constraints and an open, common market.
   This article argues that preventing secession can require fiscally
   deleterious institutions. Beyond the well-known device of ``fiscal
   appeasement,'' central governments facing potential secessionist
   challenges try to hamstring regional tax collection and permit regional
   protectionism against goods and labor. While ethnic diversity has helped
   to preserve relatively robust forms of fiscal federalism in Canada and
   Switzerland, it has had the contrary effect in developing countries.
   Even among Western democracies, those governments unwilling to
   countenance secession are less likely to respond to secessionist
   challenges by decentralizing taxation powers. The political logic of
   decentralization may stymie efforts to reform decentralized institutions
   along the lines recommended by economists and the multilateral lending
   institutions.},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of electoral politics on state welfare
   policy in the post-civil rights era South. In contrast to an emerging
   consensus concluding that southern African Americans materially
   benefited from rejoining the electorate, this study suggests that higher
   black registration rates actually reduced states' poverty relief
   efforts. In the years immediately following the Voting Rights Act (VRA),
   when Democrats controlled state government, the significant negative
   relationship between the size of the black electorate and state welfare
   generosity was moderated to some extent by high levels of partisan
   competition. In such cases, Democrats ostensibly chose a core targeting
   strategy of pursuing lower-income votes and had the institutional
   wherewithal to purchase these votes with policy concessions. Overall,
   however, the liberal Downsian policy response to African American
   mobilization was dominated by an antiredistributive response. In the
   South, welfare policies were relatively conservative vis-a-vis the other
   states during Jim Crow and became more so in response to black voting.},

   Turkish security forces and Kurdish militants is indicative of the new,
   turbulent phase the Kurdish problem has entered. This paper will analyze
   Turkish foreign policy in Syria with regards to the Kurdish issue;
   Ankara's efforts to constrain Kurdish activities in Syria will also be
   examined. Moreover, further analysis will reveal the ways in which the
   escalation of Turkish military operations against the PKK is connected
   with Turkish foreign policy in Syria and the potential consequences the
   creation of a second autonomous Kurdish state in Syria might have for
   Turkey.},

Title = {The role of geoblocking in the Internet legal landscape},
Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Number = {23},
Pages = {45-58},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Geoblocking has been presented both as an evil perpetrated against the
   Internet and as the savior of content on the Internet. The European
   Commission regards geoblocking as undesirable and aims to eliminate
   geoblocking within the European Union to the extent possible. Although
   the Commission's 2015 proposed cross-border portability regulation and
   its 2016 proposed anti-geoblocking regulation would not eliminate
   geoblocking entirely, the two regulations would significantly limit the
   instances in which geoblocking would be legal. Content creators, such as
   motion picture studios, take a different position on geoblocking: they
   see geoblocking as a helpful means to partition markets, maintain
   distribution schedules, and secure financing based on
   territorially-defined distribution. For content providers such as small
   online radio stations, geoblocking may be the only way to conduct
   business if these stations rely on affordable, but
   territorially-limited, licenses. This article reviews the recent legal
   developments concerning geoblocking and considers whether the future of
   the Internet can and should include geoblocking. Recent developments
   suggest that geoblocking is receiving a greater role in the legal
   context: legislators, courts, and regulators are considering geoblocking
   as an effective and necessary means of territorially limiting on the
   Internet the effects of their laws, judgments, and decisions. Because
   there are no uniform global laws that would govern activities on the
   Internet without respect to where those activities occur in the world,
   some form of geoblocking might be needed to address specific
   circumstances.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {69},
Number = {4},
Pages = {667-677},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Along with inequality in wealth, politics is increasingly divided
   between a very small percentage who can afford access and the vast
   majority who are effectively marginalized. In 2014, billionaire Tom
   Perkins essentially proposed eliminating that last trace of fairness by
   arguing that one ought to be able to purchase as many votes as he or she
   could afford. Ostensibly, one million dollars would buy one million
   votes. Given the current state of inequality, we concur that one person,
   one vote is no longer sensible. However, following from the political
   philosophy of Pierre Proudhon, we take the position that property is
   theft. Accordingly, the possession of wealth, far from being a source of
   increased rights, is exactly what disqualifies an individual from
   supernumerary votes. Instead, drawing upon Proudhon's views, and those
   of other nineteenth-century anarchists, we argue that the poorest in
   society, those who have the least property and have therefore committed
   the least theft, ought to have a surplus of votes. Using anarchism as a
   framework for critique within the parameters of existing politics, we
   will argue that as wealth declines, individuals ought to be bestowed
   with additional votes as compensation.},

Abstract = {Starting from an exploration of unsettled historical memories and
   anti-Japanese nationalism, this article moves on to examine how Chinese
   pragmatism helped maintain a superficial friendship for several decades
   after the normalization of the diplomatic relationship, and how China's
   perception of a shifting power balance in its favor led to its
   increasingly assertive position in territorial disputes. It then
   analyzes China's efforts to force Japan to agree to its terms in the
   solution of historical and territorial disputes, and the need for
   rationality in China.},

Abstract = {In response to growing popular dissatisfaction with politics and
   politicians, several scholars have sought to explain the cause of this
   malaise and demonstrate what can be done about it. To tease out the
   significance of four recent additions to this discussion, this article
   reviews how they diagnose the problem of anti-politicians and what they
   consider the cure might be. Riddell and Flinders, it is argued, view the
   problem in terms of an expectations gap', while Kane and Patapan, and
   Medvic cast it as a leadership paradox' or an expectations trap'. The
   former two primarily see greater citizen participation, generated via
   institutional reform or revived civic values, as the solution, whereas
   the latter two question whether the problem can or should be solved at
   all. The article concludes that while these books provide important
   insights, by and large they neglect to take serious or systematic
   account of the views, experiences and reFLections of political leaders
   themselves. To take this research agenda forward, this omission warrants
   further attention. Flinders, M. (2012) Defending Politics: Why Democracy

Abstract = {In this article, we use an experimental survey design to explore how the
   tactical choices of social movements affect public opinion about whether
   the government should negotiate with the movement and the bargains that
   should be struck once negotiations begin. In doing so, we test competing
   theories about how we should expect the use of tactics with varying
   degrees of extremenessincluding demonstrations, occupations, and
   bombingsto influence public opinion. We find that respondents are less
   likely to think the government should negotiate with organizations that
   use the tactic of bombing when compared with demonstrations or
   occupations. However, depending on the outcome variable and baseline
   category used in the analysis, we find mixed support for whether
   respondents think organizations that use bombings should receive less
   once negotiations begin. The results of this article are generally
   consistent with the theoretical and policy-based arguments centering
   around how governments should not negotiate with organizations that
   engage in violent activity commonly associated with terrorist
   organizations.},

Abstract = {The present study has analyzed the relationship between geopolitical,
   geoeconomical, geostrategical and environmental issues in Caspian Region
   and its effects on the regional and international security by the use of
   descriptive-theoritical method. Caspian Sea has unique environmental
   features. Protecting the Caspian Sea is of a vital importance to its
   coastal states in terms of economic, social, environmental, and national
   security. It can be said that Caspian Sea is a Sui Generis and this
   uniqueness requires specific solutions and approaches. Regional and
   international practices indicate the need for cooperation and joint
   exploitation of natural resources in a fair way and despite all the
   restrictions, it is necessary to adopt temporary measures on joint
   development and utilization of such resources. This study shows that
   such similar international experiences, using a joint development model
   is one way to achieve economic, social, political and environmental
   goals of Caspian Littoral States. It seems that ``Joint Authority{''}
   model is best suited to the Caspian Sea conditions. The Joint Authority
   can facilitate sustainable development in the region and promote
   environmental protection, regional and international peace and security.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to analyze the ways in which modernism and
   nationalism were embodied in the music of Heitor Villa Lobos (1887-1959)
   on the basis of a study of his exchanges with the musical culture of
   North America during the 1940s. His musical works and the way they
   became known in the United States, constituted a dynamic process which
   involved him entering into a continuous dialogue with other
   intellectuals - musicians, musicologists, journalists and other artists.
   Following his first journey to the United States and his involvement in
   the ``networks of sociability{''} of that country, it was evident that
   as well as engaging in ``social thinking about Brazil{''}, Villa-Lobos
   was drawn into an ``intellectual culture{''}. This comprised a dynamic
   network and was expressed by sharing musical practices and holding
   conversations with musicologists which had political and social
   meanings. These are reflected in the way the historico-cultural
   significance of the works of Villa-Lobos was studied and the spread of
   his ideas in North-American and Brazilian periodicals.},

Abstract = {Can digital technologies serve to highlight and strengthen the work of
   social organizations that promote human development? This is the
   question the authors want to answer in this article, in which they
   analyse an eight-month participatory video (PV) process, promoted by a
   group of university researchers and conducted in collaboration with two
   grassroots innovations (GI) in the city of Valencia (Spain): the Fuel
   Poverty Group and Solar Domada. The innovative component of PV is
   situated in two areas: firstly, as an action research methodology, the
   PV process enables people's participation, with the aim of generating
   learning, agency and contextual knowledge from the participants;
   secondly, the innovation is found in the product, the video itself. The
   video narratives can be used to disseminate the practices of the GIs and
   offer a space for critical reflection on the structural constraints that
   may hamper the diffusion of innovations. Furthermore, the audiovisual
   work itself has its own agency and has the potential to create
   opportunities for advocacy and contribute towards removing barriers that
   limit human development.},

Abstract = {We model faction formation in a world where party politicians' objective
   is the development of an informed program of governance. Politicians'
   preferences reflect their own views and their information that, when
   aggregated via intraparty deliberations, influences the party manifesto.
   By joining a faction, a politician increases the influence of its leader
   on the manifesto, but foregoes his individual bargaining power. For
   broad model specifications, we find that a faction formation process
   allows power to be transferred to moderate politicians. This facilitates
   information sharing, increasing the capacity of the party to attain its
   objective. These positive welfare effects may hold even when
   factionalism restricts intraparty dialogue, and hold a fortiori when
   information is freely exchanged across factions. We conclude that the
   existence of ideological factions may benefit a party: It provides a
   means to tie uninformed or extremist politicians to more moderate and
   informed faction leaders.},

Abstract = {Terror in the name of God and the specter of returning fighters for the
   so-called Islamic State' have recently moved some Western states,
   including Britain, Canada, and France, toward revoking the citizenship
   of terrorists. To critics, this constitutes a return to banishment,' a
   fate universally decried by civilized people,' as an American Supreme
   Court Chief Justice put it in the late 1950s. In a double reflection on
   the changing nature of terror and of citizenship, this paper argues that
   denationalization is, in principle, the adequate response to terror.
   This is because terror, particularly of the Islamist kind, is no
   ordinary crime but attack on the fundaments of citizenship. But what is
   right in principle may not be the right thing to do, because
   denationalization raises serious practicality problems.},

Abstract = {Governments' decisions to delegate policy decisions to non-majoritarian
   agencies have been both criticized as attempts at blame avoidance or
   depoliticization and defended as enhancing the rationality and
   credibility of decisions. This article focuses not on the decision to
   delegate, but on the decisions of how and to whom to delegate. We argue
   that strategic motives are relevant not only in the decision to
   delegate, but equally, and perhaps more importantly, in the selection of
   the institutional properties of these non-majoritarian agencies. We
   present two case studies of health care priority-setting, in England and
   Germany, to illustrate how governments proceed strategically in
   institutional design choices and how their decisions affect outcomes.},

Title = {The Fear of a `Change out of Control': Fraga's Failed Turn during the

Abstract = {The image of a successful political transition is linked in Spain to
   three key words: reform, centrism and democracy. The political actors of
   that moment did not agree on their meaning, whilst scholars today do not
   agree on which political groups supported and promoted political change
   in Spain at that time. This paper analyses the role of Manuel Fraga
   Iribarne during the late stage of the Francoist Regime and the first
   stage of the Spanish Transition. It highlights the image of the past
   which characterised his project of political reform. This explains
   better the presence of Canovas del Castillo and other historical
   references of the Restauracion in Fraga's discourse and political
   behaviour. These references, more than being simply a manifestation of
   his political use of the past, unmask the lack of identity of his own
   political project, his disconnection from social change and the
   difficulties arising from his relationship with the King. These are
   argued to be the main reasons for his Fraga's defeat at precisely the
   moment he had coveted throughout his political career, revealing his
   fear of a ``change out of control{''}.},

Abstract = {A growing body of scholarship on the political and economic
   subordination of women in the Muslim world has argued that widespread
   patriarchal attitudes toward women's roles in public life can be
   ameliorated by offering progressive reinterpretations of Islamic
   scriptures. In this article, we explore this hypothesis with a
   large-scale survey experiment conducted among adult Egyptians in late
   2013. In the study, a subset of respondents were exposed to an argument
   in favor of women's political equality that was grounded in the Qur'n,
   Islam's holiest text. We found that this group was significantly more
   willing to express approval of female political leadership than those
   exposed to a non-religious argument in favor of women's eligibility for
   political leadership. A further analysis of conditional treatment
   effects suggests that the religious justification for female political
   leadership was more likely to elicit agreement among less educated and
   less pious respondents, and when delivered by women and targeted at men.
   Our findings suggest that Islamic discourse, so often used to justify
   the political exclusion of women, can also be used to help empower them.},

Abstract = {The strict criminal liability is one of the institutions which has been
   accepted and expanded its dimensions in countries, including England,
   since 19th century. Although, criminal intent or fault is the most
   important elements of every offenses, but, due to some reasons, such as
   expediency, necessity, benefit, increasing prevention index, the mens
   rea element of offense, fully or partially, is sometimes removed or
   presumed. In Iran's criminal legal system, this legal institution has
   not been considered formally and explicitly by the legislator, but
   recently, Iranian legal experts, given some existing necessities, try to
   put some offenses into the category of the strict criminal liability. In
   fact, some offencesin criminal legal system, namely traffic offences,
   bounced cheque, injuries resulted from medical operations and some
   environmental offences, can be placed under the title of the strict
   criminal liability. Despite many problems to which the acceptance and
   development of the strict criminal liability may be faced, It seems, in
   many cases, this institution can solve the problems related to
   difficulties of proof and ascertainment of the criminal intent
   beforecourts. Also, today, Iranian judicial courts don't take into
   account the mens rea practically and presume itin many cases.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS POLITICOS},

Number = {174},
Pages = {113-141},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {This article identifies how three factors or implicit principles act in
   an unnoticed and naturalised way in formally gender equal democracies,
   and how their action explains the persistence of gender-based
   discrimination despite the existence of gender equality policies. These
   three factors are: homogenizing universalism; treating difference as
   otherness; and considering women's rights as specific. The last part of
   the article illustrates the effects of these factors through a concrete
   example - the management of the Spanish crisis - and thus demonstrates
   that the rapid increase in the gender gap during this period wasn't a
   consequence of the crisis itself, but of these implicit principles when
   dealing with sexual difference.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The authors propose a novel quantitative method to analyse the structure
   of legal texts. The method enables to determine grammatical similarity
   between legal texts. The authors use the external theory of fundamental
   rights to separate the text of fundamental rights of the Estonian
   Constitution into two categories of norms: constitutional rights and
   restrictions. Grammatical similarity between constitutional rights,
   restrictions and selected legal acts and case law is measured. The layer
   of special norms renders the best grammatical similarity with the text
   of fundamental rights. The same grammatical similarity tests can be
   replicated to cover other jurisdictions in the future. The research is
   experimental, but the authors believe that the method can be utilised in
   fields of computational linguistics and legal text mining, but also in
   research where legal text structures are analysed for various purposes.},

   and the role of economic development in consolidating the basis of

   development and - on the other hand-what's the relationship between
   observance of regulations of international law by governments and their
   economic development? Based on the theory of the formation of
   international law mechanisms derived from it must reflect Humanity's
   collective demands and in concrete manifestation must found norms that
   ensure and deepen human rights in the International scope. However,
   since the governments are considered the first and the most important
   subject of international law, the achievements obtained by international
   law cannot be apart from the governments actions, so that national
   sovereignties normativism and observance of regulations of international
   law-in line with multiple characteristics necessary for achieving
   economic development-are pivotal factors in the economic development.},

   country - influences the formation of pro-European sentiments. We argue
   that domestic transnational activities foster recognition of common,
   transnational interests and identities that support the European
   integration project. Using a 2013 Eurobarometer, we show the distinct
   need to pay attention to domestic transnationalism. Individuals engaging
   in more domestic transnational activities display more pro-European
   sentiments in four of our five dependent variables. Moreover, the effect
   of domestic transnationalism is particularly intense among less-educated
   citizens.},

Abstract = {This paper examines judicial reasoning in the area of Aboriginal title,
   paying particular attention to the Supreme Court of Canada's Tsilhqot'in
   Nation (2014) decision. While the decision has been heralded as a
   game-changer' within media circles and legal commentaries for its
   recognition of a claim to title under section 35(1) of the Constitution
   Act, 1982, the authors argue that the decision does not depart
   substantially from prior judicial logics predicated upon the production
   of Crown sovereignty and the denial of Indigenous legal orders. In fact,
   the authors argue that the decision displays a clear judicial
   orientation towards the present jurisdictional divisions of Canadian
   federalism which not only serves to eliminate Indigenous legal orders
   and territorial responsibilities, but also provides federal and
   provincial governments with enhanced powers of incursion' into
   Aboriginal title lands.
   Resume Cet article examine le raisonnement judiciaire dans le domaine du
   titre ancestral, en accordant une attention particuliere au jugement de
   la Cour supreme du Canada dans l'affaire de la Nation Tsilhqot'in
   (2014). Bien que la decision ait ete presentee dans les cercles
   mediatiques et les commentaires juridiques comme ayant << change la
   donne >> en raison de sa reconnaissance d'une revendication au titre en
   vertu de l'article 35(1) de la Constitution canadienne, les auteurs
   avancent que la decision ne deroge pas substantiellement de la logique
   judiciaire anterieure reposant sur l'affirmation de la souverainete de
   la Couronne et le refus des ordres juridiques autochtones. En fait, les
   auteurs soutiennent que la decision affiche une orientation juridique
   claire vers les partages actuels de competences du federalisme canadien
   qui ne sert pas seulement a eliminer les ordres juridiques autochtones
   et les responsabilites territoriales, mais qui confere egalement aux
   gouvernements federal et provinciaux des pouvoirs elargis d'<< incursion
   >> dans les terres visees par un titre ancestral.},

Abstract = {The Second Khordad Movement was a democratic social movement in
   contemporary Iran. Investigation of this movement revealed two images,
   of flourish and of decline, as the movement was first generally
   successful until early 2000 and thereafter began to regress from the
   spring of that year onwards. The purpose of this article is to provide a
   comprehensive framework in which to examine the reasons behind the
   movement's failure and regression. To this end, the study utilizes the
   literature on social movements, especially the political process model,
   and attempts to explain the initial success and subsequent decline of
   the movement based on elements such as political opportunity, framing
   processes, mobilizing structures, and the repertoire of collective
   action.},

Abstract = {A well-known economist at the end of XIX century, Achille Loria received
   a radical criticism from both Marxist and liberal intellectuals, that
   blurred his celebrity. Nonetheless, he was a member of the Italian peace
   movement and the author of a large number of essays concerning
   international relations. The core elements of his vision were presented
   in the manuscript La Pace Permanente (1876), where Loria maintained that
   the enduring peace would he realized by supporting the republican ideas
   and the principle of nationality. Influenced by the Italian Risorgimemo
   and the European positivist culture, he mixed the Kantian legacy with
   the theoretical approach of Mazzini and supported the so-called
   ``patriotic pacifism{''}, containing a latent contradiction between
   peace and nation.},

Abstract = {Presidential election years attract attention to the rhetoric,
   personalities, and agendas of contending White House aspirants, but
   these headlines do not reflect the ongoing political shifts that will
   confront whoever moves into the White House in 2017. Earthquakes and
   erosions have remade the U.S. political terrain, reconfiguring the
   ground on which politicians and social groups must maneuver, and it is
   important to make sure that narrow and short-term analyses do not blind
   us to this shifting terrain. We draw from research on changes since 2000
   in the organizational universes surrounding the Republican and
   Democratic parties to highlight a major emergent force in U.S. politics:
   the recently expanded Koch network that coordinates big money funders,
   idea producers, issue advocates, and innovative constituency-building
   efforts in an ongoing effort to pull the Republican Party and agendas of
   U.S. politics sharply to the right. We review the major components and
   evolution of the Koch network and explore how it has reshaped American
   politics and policy agendas, focusing especially on implications for
   right-tilted partisan polarization and rising economic inequality.},

Abstract = {Simulation, especially the human generation, is one of the most amazing
   technologies of Genetics. Human cloning after successful experiments in
   mammals' simulation and scientists' prediction regarding its possibility
   in the current status of human science has raised up arguments in other
   fields than the experimental science such as ethics, religion, and laws.
   There are several perspectives regarding simulation lineage in Iran's
   Laws: some believe there is no lineage since it's not through natural
   fertilization. Some others believe that if the owner of the cell is
   masculine, the father, and if it's feminine, the mother is simulated.
   And some others consider the parents owner of the cell as simulated
   parents and the simulated will be twin sibling of the cell's owner and
   the carrying mother will be ``Mother Rezaee{''}.},

Volume = {55},

Abstract = {What explains the variation in institutional adaptation of national
   parliaments to European integration? Whereas the existing literature has
   mainly focused on domestic conditions, this article explains
   institutional adaptation to integration by focusing on
   inter-parliamentary diffusion. The argument draws on `learning'
   mechanisms of diffusion on the demand side and on `emulation' mechanisms
   on the supply side. Parliamentary demand for external inspiration is
   related to uncertainty about functional oversight institutions, and the
   selection of sources to perceptions of similarity and success. Demand
   arises in new European Union member parliaments and young democracies
   that then turn towards culturally alike countries and old democracies.
   Using spatial econometrics, support is demonstrated for the argument in
   the article while ruling out alternative diffusion mechanisms such as
   spatial proximity and learning from Scandinavian frontrunners once links
   along cultural similarity and democratic experience are controlled for.
   The results underline the limits of the `isolated polity' approach in
   the comparative study of institutions in Europe's closely integrated
   political system, while also showing that, even in this favourable
   environment, diffusion pathways are contingent on the mechanisms
   generating demand among policymakers and shaping their selection of
   sources for external information.},

Abstract = {The article investigates the consequences of post-Cold War regime
   transitions on human development in the former Soviet bloc. Relying on a
   mixed-methods research strategy that combines econometric and
   qualitative comparative analysis, it proceeds through three consecutive
   steps. First, there is a discussion of how democratic institutions may
   solicit governments' attention toward social issues. Second, the
   relationship between democratisation and human development in 21
   post-communist countries is tested. Third, democracy in its core
   attributes is unpacked, and qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) is
   used to identify a few alternative institutional configurations
   favouring human development. The analysis reveals that not only full
   democracies, but also some hybrid regimes, have been successful in this
   task.},

Abstract = {The present study is conducted via library and field method and
   implementing interviews. First, general issues in terms of natural gas
   and its market and its features within Persian Gulf and the past and
   present of the gas industry of the country has been explored to
   facilitate entering the main discussion and found out that the gas
   market is a local market and lack of recognizing a basic price in
   Persian Gulf and in particular in Iran caused that despite its superior
   position among resources not to have an efficient impact so far and in
   continuation gas export contract conditions and common formula analysis
   were analyzed to find out how apposite pricing formula can be arranged.
   The obtained results showed that lack of gas export is an unwritten
   political policy and originates mostly from the loss of its pricing
   formula and specialized analyzing of the pricing principles across the
   world and use of regional standards can solve this retardation},

Abstract = {This article uses agent-based computer simulation to investigate the
   dynamics of policy diffusion through learning. It compares these
   dynamics across state systems in which policy-makers possess different
   capabilities to learn about policy effectiveness: independent
   decision-makers focusing on own experiences vs. interdependent social
   learners relying heavily on experiences of others. The simulation can
   thus compare policy adoption patterns in the presence and absence of
   policy diffusion within a controlled setting. The simulation makes two
   propositions. First, it supports the existing critique that relying on
   the identification of policy clusters can lead researchers to draw false
   positive conclusions about the relevance of policy diffusion. Second, it
   suggests that relying on the identification of policy volatility under
   political stability minimizes this risk.},

Abstract = {The first organization party entitled Ejtemaioun Ammioun was established
   at the first of 20th century. This party at first was established not
   only in Iran, but also Transcaucasia by the Iranian immigrant. At the
   end of 19th century, revolutionary movements were initiated in
   Transcaucasia and Russia, Georgian and Armenia coalitions led it. Due to
   the reluctance of Muslims and particularly Iranian for cooperating with
   non-Islamic organizations for the religious purpose, some of the
   activist Muslim members or close to the Russian Social Democratic Labour
   Party member tried to establish a community and absorbed them through
   the establishment of a political party. The organization was founded
   with the name of Hemat and a significant number of Iranian and native
   Muslims were organized in this organization. The close relationship of
   Iranian to Hemat, the Iranian activist immigrants encouraged to
   establish their own party organization. These persons by following
   administrative and organizational goals of Hemet party and collaboration
   with some of its leaders, organized Ejtemaioun Ammioun with the aim of
   supporting the Iranian migrant workers and expanded its activities
   toward Iran. Given this background, part of its plan came under the
   influence of Social Democratic Party's ideas. Ejtemaioun emphasized over
   the loss of privilege, reform land ownership patron-client relations,
   and workers' rights by limiting working hours, the right of strike and
   freedom of trade unions. The prominent feature of Ejtemaioun Ammioun
   party was mixing religion with their organizational plans. Contrary to
   the impression prevailing at the time, Ejtemaioun Ammioun tried to show
   the Social socialist principles do not contradict the Islamic principles
   andeven many of the principles already existed in Islam. They introduced
   themselves as the true defenders of Islamic law.},

Abstract = {The attacks in Paris January and November 2015, perpetrated by Muslims
   fundamentalists, revived the ethnocultural racist debate to the largest
   Moslem community in Western Europe located in France. Considering the
   above, in this article it has decided to analyze the impacts of
   Islamophobic sentiment in France, the different types of violence
   directed to the Muslim community, and the difficulty of multiculturalism
   product of building a strong French identity. The presence of Muslims
   and cultural conflict in Europe is as old as religion itself, which
   necessitates the use of a historical analytical method for understanding
   how identity construction leads to the formation of Islamophobic
   feelings. Islamophobia is a kind of racism, which in France it seems to
   have support in the national identity, the fear produced by Islamic
   fundamentalist attacks, and the belief that Islam remains foreign, but
   most French Muslims are European citizens.},

Abstract = {Mediation is an alternative, increasingly implemented, for the
   resolution of conflicts outside the judicial sphere and one of its
   applications in conflicts reported to the police. The present work is
   part of an experience of police mediation that has been carried out
   during the years 2012-2014. Two data collection techniques have been
   applied: on the one hand, in the analysis of the files, with the whole
   set of variables that may be applicable; And by performing
   questionnaires to the parties involved. The two conditions adopted as a
   criterion in the selection of cases that refer to family conflicts of
   partners and which were registered in a resolution agreement. With these
   data, the analysis affects, beyond the characteristics, in the
   satisfaction of the process and the permanence of the conflict. As
   conclusions, the incidence of sociodemographic variables, especially the
   level of studies and occupational and the high degree of satisfaction
   and recommendation of the service, stands out. However, there is a high
   rate of repetition of conflicts, especially in cases of family
   conflicts.},

   and Quota Implementation in Electoral Authoritarian Tanzania},
Journal = {GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION},

Volume = {51},

Abstract = {This article investigates the dynamics that gender quota reforms create
   within and between government and opposition parties in electoral
   authoritarian dominant-party states. A dominant-party state regularly
   holds relatively competitive elections, but the political playing field
   is skewed in favour of the government party. We investigate the
   circumstances under which gender quotas' goal of furthering political
   gender equality within political parties can be reconciled with parties'
   electoral concerns. We address these issues by analysing the
   implementation of reserved seats by the three largest parties in the
   dominant-party state of Tanzania. The empirical analysis suggests that
   the uneven playing field leaves an imprint on the specific priorities
   parties make when implementing candidate selection reforms. Because of
   large resource gaps between parties, the ruling party, Chama Cha
   Mapinduzi - (CCM), is able to reconcile gender equality concerns with
   power-maximizing partisan strategies to a greater extent than the
   opposition parties.},

Abstract = {Following the World Polity School of sociological institutionalism, this
   article argues that `many Europes' operating in different (strategic,
   normative and cognitive) realms affects the EU's projection of its
   authority abroad, and paves the way for the trifurcation of the
   Europeanization processes that influence society and politics in
   candidate countries like Turkey. The Turkish case is critical in terms
   of demonstrating a decoupling between the EU-led reform process and
   Turkey's EU membership bids. By studying attitudinal variation in two
   reform areas where the status quo proves difficult to change, the study
   emphasizes the ritualized character of domestic compliance with EU
   membership conditionality and the role of the EU as a `heuristic device'
   to help unpack some of the complexity of the global context and European
   multiplicity.},

Abstract = {Recent court decisions have encouraged new types of interest groups to
   become involved in election campaigns. Yet questions remain about
   whether interest group sponsorship of advertising affects the content of
   the issues being discussed. The ability of interest groups to influence
   the campaign agenda has implications for the extent to which politicians
   can be held accountable by citizens. In this research, we present a new
   conceptual framework for explaining variation in interest group
   advertising strategies and examine the factors leading different types
   of interest groups to be loose cannons (diverging from the issue debates
   among candidates) or loyal foot soldiers (matching the candidates' issue
   debates). We find more evidence of loyal foot soldier behavior among new
   multi-issue interest groups and among Republican groups and candidates.
   Fears of interest groups ``hijacking{''} campaign agendas appear
   unfounded.},

Abstract = {Research in the discipline of International Relations (IR) has been
   dominated by positivism. Positivist philosophy of science has been
   useful in the conduct of inquiry but it has come at a cost: Cartesian
   anxiety. That is, the pursuit of absolute certainty, with the demanding
   assumptions such an ambitious goal entails. In light of these
   questionable standards, pragmatism is presented as a promising
   alternative. A pragmatist approach rejects the search for `truth' and
   instead proposes a focus on `warranted assertibility'. As such, it takes
   the preliminary character of knowledge seriously. Consequently, it is
   argued that pragmatism can address the shortcomings posed by positivism.
   By so doing, this exercise makes a call for pluralism, not a new
   orthodoxy.},

Abstract = {More students are beginning their college careers at community colleges
   before completing degrees at four-year institutions. As enrollments
   swell at these two-year institutions, issues surrounding transfer and
   articulation agreements are increasingly important, and two-and
   four-year institutions must work together on the recruitment, retention,
   and transition of political science majors. Central to this
   collaboration is the curriculum. Building on conclusions from the 2011
   Leadership Collaborative Core Curriculum and General Education track
   regarding a common curriculum in the discipline, this article examines
   the political science curriculum using data from 47 two-year colleges
   with separate political science departments. We examined similarities
   and differences among these programs and found sufficient commonality in
   curriculum to allow students to transfer credits to four-year
   institutions. The article also offers community colleges an indication
   of common curricular features and informs the wider profession about
   community college curriculum design.},

Abstract = {Patient safety is one of the main issues in health care services.
   Medical mistakes are common potential dangers for patients that can be
   treated as a measure of patient safety. Medication errors are the most
   common errors in the nursing profession, which can be potentially
   dangerous for patients. In this study, the main purpose was evaluation
   of criminal responsibility of nurses in administration of prescriptions
   using descriptive and analytical approach. Since for medical
   professionals legal aspects of such cases are beyond their duty, we wish
   to determine the criminal liability for medical care personnel (e.g.
   nurses) and associated professionals
   We will look at penal provisions for this matter closely. Obviously,
   lack of medical community responsibility for such errors will diminish
   cases of criminal prosecution. While specific rules in Medicine provide
   the possibility to call upon relevant incumbents, yet, criminal
   responsibility has not been assigned to this issue. In the legal
   responsibility of medical superintendents, nursing faults are divided
   into two categories, general criminal liability and specific criminal
   liability. Recent responsibility requires that necessary coordination
   exists between prosecution laws and specific laws in medicine.},

Abstract = {In a principal-agent relationship, how should principals budget time for
   oversight when oversight activity is not instantaneous? We develop a
   formal model of resource allocation by a principal monitoring multiple
   agents, where the principal faces a dynamic budgeting problem. Our model
   reveals a tension between the value of holding resources in reserve to
   maintain the threat of an audit and the direct policy gains of
   monitoring activity. We show that as the frequency of principal-agent
   conflict increases, there are some conditions under which the most
   effective strategy for a principal is to allocate less and less of their
   total time to monitoring. The model has important implications for the
   empirical analysis of a monitoring setting where a principal oversees
   multiple agents.},

Abstract = {Do male and female legislators have different qualifications,
   experience, and backgrounds? If so, what are the main differences and
   what explains these differences? Are women more likely to rely on
   personal connections? Are well qualified women routinely passed over in
   favor of similarly qualified men? Do gender quotas and transitions to
   multiparty democracy affect the recruitment patterns of men and women?
   Do gender quotas lead to the recruitment of less qualified women? This
   article attempts to explain how informal gendered selection norms change
   over time using detailed data from over 500 Mexican Senators since 1964.
   The data provide evidence of discrimination in that to be successful,
   female senators need to have more legislative experience and more party
   experience than male senators. We also find evidence that traditional
   gender roles lead women to follow different paths to power. After the
   transition to democracy and the implementation of gender quotas, the
   importance of local legislative experience increased, discrimination
   against female aspirants declined, and a more diverse group of women
   entered the Senate. Our data show that women are no more likely than men
   to rely on personal connections to get into power.},

Abstract = {The mass franchise led to more responsive government and a more
   equitable distribution of resources in the United States and other
   democracies. Recently in America, however, voter participation has been
   low and increasingly biased toward the wealthy. We investigate whether
   this electoral ``class bias{''} shapes government ideology, the
   substance of economic policy, and distributional outcomes, thereby
   shedding light on both the old question of whether who votes matters and
   the newer question of how politics has contributed to growing income
   inequality. Because both lower and upper income groups try to use their
   resources to mobilize their supporters and demobilize their opponents,
   we argue that variation in class bias in turnout is a good indicator of
   the balance of power between upper and lower income groups. And because
   lower income voters favor more liberal governments and economic policies
   we expect that less class bias will be associated with these outcomes
   and a more equal income distribution. Our analysis of data from the U.S.
   states confirms that class bias matters for these outcomes.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Using a multilevel analysis method, this article tests different
   hypotheses for how income inequality affects voter support for radical
   right-wing parties (RRPs) in Western Europe. Specifically, the article
   shows how this `income inequality effect' encourages poor people to vote
   for RRPs, while it concurrently discourages rich people from doing so.
   This finding supports the social identity hypothesis, which states that
   social identity (a micro-level factor) intermediates income inequality
   effect (a macro-level factor) on voter support for RRPs. The article's
   results suggest, further, that income inequality has different effects
   between the main supporters of RRPs with dissimilar occupations (e.g.,
   manual workers and the petty bourgeoisie) because they belong to
   different income groups; and that country-level factors may have
   different effects on people regarding their support for RRPs. (c) 2016

Abstract = {This paper extends the empirical research on determinants of corruption
   conducted during the last 20 years. It argues that the apparent
   correlations between cultural traditions and a country's corruption
   level are not valid causal inferences. Instead, these correlations are
   primarily the artifacts of measurement bias on the dependent variable.
   Corruption measured by perception-based indicators can be conflated with
   the cultural bias conceived by the respondents whose subjective
   assessments are the main sources of these indicators. These assessments
   tend to attribute clean government to specific cultural traditions, for
   example, Protestantism and a long history of being a democracy. These
   claims are defended with a series of tests that show first the
   perception-based indicators of corruption suffer substantial weaknesses,
   especially systematic measurement bias; second, how the causal
   mechanisms linking corruption to cultural traditions exhibit inherent
   theoretical uncertainties; and third, that most of the statistical
   relationships between cultural traditions and corruption disappear when
   perception-based indicators of corruption are substituted with an
   experience-based measurement of corruption. In short, the proposed
   causal relationships between cultural traditions and corruption are
   spurious.},

Abstract = {By its design and implementation, the conditional cash transfer programs
   (CCT) face a number of risks that may limit the citizenship building of
   these policies. Using the case of Progresa / Oportunidades program in
   Mexico, we analized two major risks: synecdoche risks (to confuse a
   program to fight poverty with all the social policy) and asymmetry of
   power risk (increase, rather than reduce abuses of power at local
   level). The results show that the hegemony of targeting, the political
   fragility and lack of a coordinated social policy reinforces the
   centrality of the Oportunidades Program in the fight against poverty,
   unable to avoid completely the risks it faces, generating significant
   deficits in citizenship construction, both in the exercise and
   protection of social rights},

Abstract = {While legislative polarization at the national level has been carefully
   examined and largely explained, the causes of polarization in state
   legislatures have been more elusive. Studies examining factors such as
   gerrymandering and party primaries as possible explanations have found
   largely undetectable or at best very modest relationships between these
   variables and levels of polarization. This paper provides an explanation
   of state legislative polarization based on socio-economic and
   demographic factors within the states. Economics and demographics have
   long played a significant role in understanding party choice, vote
   choice, the decision to abstain or vote, and support for various
   policies. Because of this we explore if these factors also influence
   polarization of state legislatures. Utilizing the Shorr-McCarty
   polarization data for state legislatures, which provides the differences
   between the mean Democratic and Republican legislator scores, and
   controlling for important economic and demographic factors, we explain a
   significant amount of the polarization existing in state legislatures.
   These findings present a fascinating look into not only the root causes
   of polarization in state legislatures, but also point to some
   fundamental differences in politics and ideology at the state and
   national levels.},

Abstract = {This article offers an analysis of the legacy of the Obama
   Administration's education agenda, focusing on implications for American
   federalism. Faced with partisan gridlock in Congress-which was not able
   to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) until
   the last year in office-the Obama Administration opted to make education
   policy through creative, expansive, and controversial uses of executive
   power that changed the national political discourse around education and
   pushed states to enact important policy changes regarding charter
   schools, common core standards and assessments, and teacher evaluation.
   The administration's aggressive efforts on school reform, however,
   eventually led to a political backlash against those same reforms and
   federal involvement in education more generally and resulted in an ESEA
   reauthorization (the 2015 Every Student Succeeds Act) that rolls back
   the federal role in K-12 schooling in important ways. One of the
   enduring legacies of the Obama presidency may well be the invigoration
   and expansion of the state role in education.},

Abstract = {International security institutions play a pivotal role in the
   realisation of the Women, Peace and Security agenda through their
   adoption and implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325. This
   article examines NATO's adoption of UNSCR 1325, drawing upon Cynthia
   Enloe's conception of NATO as a teaching machine' disseminating lessons
   on gender. In doing so, it finds UNSCR 1325 has been understood to be of
   added-value' to the Alliance in two respects: first, to support NATO's
   long-established agenda to increase the representation of women in NATO
   forces; second, as a tool to increase operational effectiveness. I find
   that NATO's adoption of UNSCR 1325 emerged as part of a counter
   discourse. The fact that this counter discourse was put forward by
   partner states challenges dominant understandings of the direction of
   policy dissemination within NATO. This case provides salient lessons on
   the opportunities for - and hindrances to - change through the pursuit
   of a feminist agenda within an international security institution.},

Abstract = {What are the psychological roots of support for populist parties or
   outfits such as the Tea Party, the Dutch Party for Freedom or Germany's
   Left Party? Populist parties have as a common denominator that they
   employ an anti-establishment message, which they combine with some host'
   ideology. Building on the congruency model of political preference, it
   is to be expected that a voter's personality should match with the
   message and position of his or her party. This article theorises that a
   low score on the personality trait Agreeableness matches the
   anti-establishment message and should predict voting for populist
   parties. Evidence is found for this hypothesis in the United States, the
   Netherlands and Germany. The relationship between low Agreeableness and
   voting for populist parties is robust, controlling for other personality
   traits, authoritarianism, sociodemographic characteristics and ideology.
   Thus, explanations of the success of populism should take personality
   traits into account.},

Abstract = {Appeals for bipartisan diplomacy pepper popular commentary, often with
   wistful references to a bygone era where leaders (like Lyndon Johnson
   and Everett Dirksen) set aside partisan point scoring to serve the
   public interest. Here we reconsider the elements driving bipartisan
   contact in Washington. Stepping back from popular narratives, we situate
   the president-opposing leader relationship within a more general class
   of institutional bargaining, leading to the prediction that bipartisan
   negotiation emerges from a particular combination of incentives and
   institutions-namely, when the president is strong politically (rendering
   opposing leaders willing to compromise) but opposing party leaders are
   strong institutionally (rendering them crucial to passing the deal).
   Utilizing Presidential Daily Diaries, hypotheses are tested against
   original data on presidents' personal interactions with opposing Senate
   leaders across 40 years, 20 Congresses, and eight presidencies
   (1961-2000).},

Abstract = {Does the electoral success of Islamist parties depend on the support of
   religious voters or does it owe as much or more to their performance in
   dealing with key political and economic issues? The repeated electoral
   success of an Islamist-rooted party, the Justice and Development Party
   (AKP) of Turkey, provides an important opportunity to answer this
   question. Using a nation-wide survey conducted in 2011 in Turkey, our
   findings suggest that in addition to religiosity the party's performance
   with respect to social services, the economy and democracy were
   determining factors in the AKP's success. We also found that the
   popularity of political leaders has an independent effect on party
   preference. We discuss similar tendencies in the aftermath of the Arab
   Spring elections where the Islamist parties emerged as the major
   winners.},

Abstract = {Different factors were affecting the presence of women during the
   Pahlavi era. In new structures after the constitutional period and along
   with the absolute modernism of Pahlavi, discourses changes were made
   based on democracy, socialism, Shia resistance and autonomy, court to
   government and political figures to people. During this period the role
   of women was formed on the basis of their social position and in their
   gender approach it changed from a <class in itself> to a <class for
   self>. The consequences of social contexts led to witness more active
   presence of women during Pahlavi era compared with the past periods
   particularly in the visual arts arena; so that the history of the Tehran
   galleries from 1953-1978 which reflects their activities during that
   time confirms this fact. The purpose of the present essay is to analyze
   the social contexts which have attracted women from margin to the center
   and attending to them since no study has been done in this respect seems
   essential and it's an attempt to answer the question that what social
   contexts have been influential in boosting up the presence of women
   especially women painters of Pahlavi era? In this research the data
   collect is library type and filed study and it has been compiled in a
   comparative descriptive-analytic method, the origin and social contexts
   of the women painters of the Pahlavi era whose works were displayed were
   studied and analyzed and it can be inferred that the presence of
   supportive men in families, education, social context, urban life,
   publicizing the culture thanks to the cultural foundations and media,
   the actual and legal presence of the queen, government support due to
   cultural policies, women social movements, and the transformation of the
   women role in twentieth century had decisive role on enhancing the
   social position of women particularly the role of the women painters of
   the second Pahlavi era.},

Abstract = {This article advances a reading of rights that moves away from the
   individualistic nuances characterizing today's prevailing conceptions.
   To this end, it first delineates how one can come to a concept of law
   able to offer a suitable counterpoint for a richer conceptualization of
   rights: the philosopher needs both to reformulate the question from
   which s/he starts off and to make the most of the synergies that such a
   reformulation favours. The article then provides a reconstruction of
   some key junctures in the historical development of rights with a view
   to grasping their specific nature vis-a-vis the political form where
   they have shaped up, which is to say, national-constitutional states,
   which will then become democratic-constitutional. The argument this
   reconstruction implies is that understanding rights largely depends on
   the way they are read and justified, also in the framework of a specific
   historical-social configuration of the law. In the light of a subtler
   reading/justification than the widespread views, the article concludes
   by considering the relationship among law, rights and democracy with
   respect both to the dynamics of the neoliberal society and to possible
   revisions of a political sphere that intends to become authentically
   democratic.},

Abstract = {In this article, we investigate the relationship between home ownership
   and support for redistribution in 24 European countries, integrating
   research on housing regimes and welfare attitudes. We improve upon
   earlier research by taking into account within-group heterogeneity of
   owners and tenants, by elaborating on social mechanisms (self-interest
   and socio-spatial segregation), by researching a wide range of European
   (instead of Anglo-Saxon) countries and by recognizing differences in the
   meaning of tenure and home ownership across countries. We find that,
   while home owners are less supportive of redistribution, the effect of
   home ownership varies with age and income position. We furthermore find
   that housing regime characteristics matter, as owners and tenants have
   different welfare attitudes in different contexts. In settings where
   home ownership has become more financialized, support for redistribution
   is smaller, and more so among home owners. On the other hand, in
   settings where outright home ownership fills gaps in welfare provision,
   both owners and tenants prefer more redistribution.},

Abstract = {This paper reads Antigone from the perspective of the Chorus. Whereas
   most interpreters read Antigone from the perspective of Creon and
   Antigone's respective laws, I maintain that the protagonists represent
   laws that are distinctly apolitical. Alternatively, I argue that the
   Chorus make the polispast, present, and futurethe center of their
   thought and action and are therefore uniquely political. Through close
   attention to the Chorus's composition as a body that is both one and
   many at the same time, and by tracing their evolving position throughout
   the action of the drama and in their choral odes, I argue that they
   model a reflective and political orientation to judgment rooted in
   plurality, tradition, and innovation.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {78},
Number = {2},
Pages = {557-571},

Abstract = {A broad class of theories, applied to a wide array of substantive
   issues, argues that international institutions facilitate compliance by
   mobilizing procompliance domestic groups. I develop a general model of
   political contestation over compliance policy in which institutions
   mobilize both pro-and anticompliance groups. The model predicts that
   institutions have the greatest ability to induce compliance when the
   groups have similar values to winning a compliance contest or costs to
   effort, ex ante. Institutions have a weaker marginal effect when groups
   are imbalanced. I demonstrate features of the model using the Kenyan
   experience with the International Criminal Court. The ICC cemented the
   political alliance of two anticompliance candidates. The ICC's
   indictments had the greatest effect on support for the most prominent
   indicted candidate in regions of Kenya where pro-and anti-indictment
   forces were balanced. Features of domestic political contests are a key
   moderator of the effectiveness of international institutions.},

Abstract = {Large numbers permeate political life, and students of political science
   can expect to encounter a wide range of numbers in newspaper articles,
   course readings, and statistics. Recent research in cognitive psychology
   demonstrates that American adults make systematic errors when comparing
   numbers in the millions, billions, and trillions. Political decisions
   made by voters often require weighing large quantities that range across
   many orders of magnitude, which is difficult without at least a basic
   understanding of relative magnitudes. If students also lack an
   understanding of large numbers, professors cannot meaningfully teach
   them about political phenomena involving such magnitudes. The authors
   designed and tested an exercise to improve students' accuracy in dealing
   with large magnitudes, which had immediate and sustained effects on
   their political judgments about information involving large numbers.},

Abstract = {The cyber security discourse is dominated by states and corporations
   that focus on the protection of critical information infrastructure and
   databases. The priority is the security of information systems and
   networks, rather than the protection of connected users. The dominance
   of war metaphors in the cyber security debates has produced a security
   dilemma, which is not sufficiently addressing the needs of people. This
   article underlines this shortcoming and views cyber security through a
   human-centric perspective. Freedom of expression and the right to
   privacy are under attack in the era of cyber surveillance. From a
   human-centric perspective such rights should be understood as a critical
   part of cyber security. Human rights protections need to be effectively
   addressed in the digital sphere and gain their place in the cyber
   security agendas.},

Abstract = {The United States was a suffrage pioneer for eliminating restrictions
   based on class and race, but not for prohibiting the use of sex
   classifications as a voting qualification. This contribution focuses on
   the relationship between the family and the state to explain this
   discrepancy. In the context of America's liberal heritage, the family
   and the state are separated by virtue of being ruled by opposite
   principles: parental rule versus political rule. I argue that women's
   suffrage was delayed in the United States because women's identification
   with the family as an institution separated them from formal inclusion
   in the state. Reformers had to solve, therefore, the relationship
   between the family and the state in order to achieve women's political
   citizenship. Using a new data set that tracks family-state frames used
   by women's suffrage and women rights leaders from the founding of the
   American state to the addition of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, I
   show how configurations of the family and the state developed over time.
   It was when the family and the state were eventually conceptualized to
   be analogous, rather than opposite, institutions that women finally
   achieved the right to vote.},

Abstract = {Scholars of American politics often assume World War II liberalized
   white racial attitudes. This conjecture is generally premised on the
   existence of an ideological tension between a war against Nazism and the
   maintenance of white supremacy at home, particularly the Southern system
   of Jim Crow. A possible relationship between the war and civil rights
   was also suggested by a range of contemporaneous voices, including
   academics like Gunnar Myrdal and activists like Walter White and A.
   Philip Randolph. However, while intuitively plausible, this relationship
   is generally not well verified empirically. A common flaw is the lack of
   attention to public opinion polls from the 1940s. Using the best
   available survey evidence, I argue the war's impact on white racial
   attitudes is more limited than is often claimed. First, I demonstrate
   that for whites in the mass public, while there is some evidence of
   liberalization on issues of racial prejudice, this generally does not
   extend to policies addressing racial inequities. White opposition to
   federal anti-lynching legislation actually seems to have increased
   during the war. Second, there is some evidence of racial moderation
   among white veterans, relative to their counterparts who did not serve.
   White veterans were more supportive of anti-lynching legislation in the
   immediate postwar period, and they offered stronger support for black
   voting rights in the early 1960s. However, they were not distinguishable
   on many other issues, including measures of racial prejudice and
   attitudes toward segregation.},

Abstract = {More than 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the electoral
   volatility in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) is still remarkably high.
   A considerable part of the volatility derives from the votes for new
   political parties, since they are very often on the winning side of
   elections. This article examines corruption as a potential determinant
   of their electoral support. It argues that the effect of corruption is
   twofold: on the one hand, the historically derived corruption level
   reduces the electoral support for new political parties due to strong
   clientelist structures that bind the electorate to the established
   parties. On the other hand, an increase in perceived corruption above
   the traditional corruption level leads to a loss of trust in the
   political elite and therefore boosts the electoral support for new
   competitors. A statistical analysis of all democratic elections in CEE
   between 1996 and 2013 confirms these two counteracting effects.},

Abstract = {A few years into the most recent wave of popular uprisings-the Arab
   Spring-studying regime trajectories in countries such as Syria, Egypt,
   and Yemen still seems like shooting at a moving target. Yet what has not
   escaped notice is the central role military actors have played during
   these uprisings. We describe how soldiers have three options when
   ordered to suppress mass unrest. They may exit the regime by remaining
   in the barracks or going into exile, resist by fighting for the
   challenger or initiating a coup d'etat, or remain loyal and use force to
   defend the regime. We argue that existing accounts of civil-military
   relations are ill equipped to explain the diverse patterns in exit,
   resistance, and loyalty during unrest because they often ignore the
   effects of military hierarchy. Disaggregating the military and parsing
   the interests and constraints of different agents in that apparatus is
   crucial for explaining military cohesion during such crises. Drawing on
   extensive fieldwork we apply our principal-agent framework to explain
   varying degrees and types of military cohesion in three Arab Spring
   cases: Bahrain, Yemen, and Syria. Studying military hierarchy elucidates
   decision-making within authoritarian regimes amid mass mobilization and
   allows us to better explain regime re-stabilization, civil war onset, or
   swift regime change in the wake of domestic unrest.},

Abstract = {Non-incumbents face an uphill battle in their quest to raise sufficient
   funds to compete effectively against seated House incumbents and,
   alternatively, in competitive open-seat House contests. Interest group
   endorsements are thought to contribute to their electoral success, but
   whether endorsements help non-incumbent House candidates raise
   contributions from individuals, as a component of this success, remains
   unknown. Their heavy reliance upon individual contributions to finance
   their campaigns as well as the prominence of the groups making a large
   number of endorsements justifies an explicit test of this relationship.
   Using contribution data from the U.S. Federal Election Commission (FEC)
   between 2006 and 2012 paired with endorsement tabulations in both a set
   of regression and matching analyses, I uncover evidence that
   endorsements increase individual contributions to the candidate over the
   course of the election cycle. The results underpin the value of
   endorsements to non-incumbent candidates as well as their utility for
   the endorsing groups wishing to influence House elections.},

Abstract = {In Westminster-style parliaments the official report of debates, or
   Hansard, has come to be regarded as the definitive account of
   parliamentary proceedings. But the process by which speeches given in
   the House are crafted into Hansard reports is not widely known or
   understood. When discrepancies are spotted between spoken speeches and
   reported speeches, it is often assumed that a member has altered the
   record-a practice that can have serious consequences because it raises
   the question of whether there has been an attempt to deliberately
   mislead the House.
   Focusing on specific examples drawn from Hansard for the House of
   Commons, the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia, and the New Zealand
   House of Representatives, this paper shows how such claims can have
   political consequences, and notes that any changes are usually made by
   Hansard, not members, in line with standard editorial policies. The
   paper describes those policies at a generic level and suggests that
   there is a need for greater transparency about them.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {183-218},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {This article revisits the debate about the British eighteenth-century
   Country Party ideology and its influence on America. It points out that
   the Country Party tradition could best be understood as a libertarian
   resistance movement against the modern state. The article remedies the
   misrepresentations of the Country Party economic philosophy as feudal,
   agrarian, or anticapitalist. It reconceptualizes it as a philosophy of
   proverbial men of little faith, skeptical not of progress and modernity
   as such, but of the mercantilist regime created by the Walpole in
   England and emulated by Hamiltonian nationalists in America. The
   political and especially the economic philosophy of the British Country
   Party is compared with the Anti-Federalist and Jeffersonian doctrines in
   America, and the conclusion is reached that the Country Party thinkers
   and pamphleteers of both countries were not the slaves of romantic
   visions and republican virtues but the followers of Adam Smith, David
   Hume, and Jean-Baptiste Say.},

Abstract = {Conservative right-wing governments have been in power and implementing
   neo-liberal economic policies nearly without any interruption since
   1983. Nevertheless, neo liberal policies were interrupted between 1989
   and 1994 in terms of local governing. Social democratic candidates for
   local governments were elected in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir in the 1989
   local elections. It is important to draw attention to the differences
   and intersections of the policies implemented by these social democrat
   mayors whom elected for the period of 1989-1994 in these three main
   cities of Turkey and compare them to the collectivist governing
   experience of the 1970s and the social governing experience of mayors
   from AKP after 1999. These differences and intersections are related to
   the socio-spatial contingencies, political backgrounds of the three
   mayors and their approach to local governing as well as production of
   urban policies, political actors and power relations. This paper aims at
   debating three social democratic experiences of three mayors, which have
   their own differences, in three main metropolitan cities in Turkey
   between 1989 and 1994 in this framework.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to identify the international immunity and
   its type. We also sought to evaluate the immunity of international
   organizations from the perspective of international law in this study.
   International organizations have immunity in the implementation of their
   programs and tasks. In fact, one of the principles of public
   international law is immunity that prevents the presence of a foreign
   state in state courts. In some cases, there is a possibility of
   cancellation of immunity and in other cases withdrawal of immunity is
   derived from a political mission. These cases include accepting to solve
   the commercial dispute through arbitration because contrary to the
   authority of the state judge, judgment to address the dispute is not one
   of the government figures; therefore, government summoned to court of
   arbitration is not considered as a violation of state sovereignty. In
   practice, immunity has changed over the time. In other words, immunity
   has been modified over time. Research method used in this article is a
   review of the literature and interviews with experts who examine and
   compare the rules and regulations and the existing notes at home and
   abroad, about the immunity of international organizations. In the
   current situation, international general discipline is contrary to this
   subject that the government or organization holding immunity, while
   being aware of that, definitely accepts the condition of turning to a
   referee, which attracts the other party's confidence, and then refers to
   immunity in some stage of inspection or while implementing the sentence.
   The legal concept of immunity, in general, is the sense that its owner
   is immune from prosecution, law enforcement, and government officials
   and they will not be able to chase the holder of such immunity.},

Abstract = {Recent northern First Nation land claim agreements have created a new
   category of First Nation citizenship. Although many embrace the category
   as an essential aspect of First Nation sovereignty, others reject it as
   a colonial imposition that constrains the possibilities for indigenous
   politics. There does indeed appear to be a gap between the legal
   category of First Nation citizenship and northern indigenous peoples'
   ideas about political society. For one thing, the latter includes
   animals, while the former does not. In their recent book, Zoopolis,
   Donaldson and Kymlicka develop a model of animal citizenship. Although
   not primarily concerned with First Nation citizenship, they do assert
   the universality of their model, including its compatibility with
   indigenous ideas about proper human-animal relations. In this article, I
   assess those claims and show that, to the contrary, their model is in
   many ways antithetical to the knowledge and practices of northern
   indigenous peoples.
   Resume Des accords de revendication territoriale conclus recemment avec
   les Premieres Nations du Nord ont cree une nouvelle categorie, celle de
   citoyennete des Premieres Nations. Bien que cette categorie soit
   consideree par de nombreuses personnes comme un aspect essentiel de la
   souverainete des Premieres Nations, d'autres la rejettent, car il
   s'agirait d'une imposition coloniale qui limite les possibilites en
   matiere de politique autochtone. Il semble y avoir effectivement un
   hiatus entre la citoyennete des Premieres Nations comme categorie
   juridique et les idees que se font les populations autochtones du Nord
   au sujet de la societe politique. Entre autres, cette derniere notion
   inclut les animaux alors que ce n'est pas le cas pour la premiere. Dans
   leur ouvrage recent, Zoopolis, Donaldson et Kymlicka elaborent un modele
   de citoyennete pour les animaux. Bien que ces auteurs n'aient pas comme
   principale preoccupation la citoyennete des Premieres Nations, ils
   affirment l'universalite de leur modele, incluant sa compatibilite avec
   les idees des autochtones sur ce que devraient etre les relations entre
   les humains et les animaux. Dans cet article, j'analyse ces assertions
   et je demontre qu'au contraire, leur modele est a maints egards aux
   antipodes du savoir et des pratiques des populations autochtones du
   Nord.},

Abstract = {This article considers the possibility of mutually beneficial
   communication among groups when any group may choose to unilaterally
   join or exit an alliance. My main concern is the trade-off groups face
   between the informational benefits of associating with others in a large
   society versus the costs imposed by power sharing and preference
   diversity. When these costs are sufficiently high, groups may prefer
   exit to association. The results of this article characterize the
   associations of groups that can be sustained in equilibrium, and within
   those associations, the types of groups that choose to meaningfully
   communicate with others. The results demonstrate that there can be
   benefits or costs associated with the inclusion of preference extremists
   in a diverse society, whether or not those extremists choose to actively
   communicate with outgroups. The results also speak to institutional
   mechanisms for fostering communication across diverse groups.},

Abstract = {Local government election results are used to estimate a national
   equivalent vote that provides the basis for a general election forecast.
   By-elections provide the means for calculating weighted quarterly
   averages of national support. These show trends similar to those
   obtained by national polls. By-election results in the three month
   period leading to the general election contribute towards the national
   vote share calculation and seat distributions are determined by uniform
   national swing. Additionally, results from the main council elections
   from 2011 onwards are aggregated to the parliamentary constituency level
   and used to estimate each party's relative performance in key target
   seats. This information is used to fine-tune the final seat forecast
   which suggests a hung parliament is the most likely outcome. (C) 2015

Abstract = {This article examines how the political science department of a small,
   regional university (Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania) has tried
   to develop activities that will help internationalise the student body
   and the campus. The article examines, in an attempt to prepare and
   internationalise students, the departments' short-term study abroad
   opportunities. In particular, the article evaluates one course as a case
   study and proposes a new method aimed at trying to assess its efficacy.
   In doing so, this article will review the literature on the impact of
   study abroad, focusing on short-term study (or faculty-led) experiences
   and discuss the pedagogical motivations of such courses. Finally, the
   article will propose, and preliminarily test, a new method of assessing
   short-term study about courses. The conclusion of this article
   speculates on the final results and details the substantial barriers to
   replication and augmentation of these programmes.},

Abstract = {Between 1975 and 1979, approximately two million Cambodians died from
   exposure, disease, starvation, and execution under the Communist Party
   of Kampuchea (CPK), also known as the Khmer Rouge. The standard
   narrative interprets these murders as the brutal acts of a cadre of
   radical communist ideologues, bent on establishing a pure, despotic, and
   autarkic state. Using a Marxist approach to political economy, this
   paper challenges the standard narrative, finding that these killings
   were a consequence of the CPK's attempt to establish a system of state
   capitalism that exploited workers through the production of increasing
   surpluses. This analysis reveals the particular and deliberate
   structural arrangements that made the deaths of millions a justifiable
   consequence. In so doing, we seek to highlight the broader benefits of a
   Marxist analysis of political economy in the study of genocide; notably
   its emphasis on the materiality of violence and its ability to expose
   the forms of social organization that produce mass violence.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {145-166},

Abstract = {Recent experimental research suggests that ordinary citizens are capable
   of behaving in a democratic and deliberative way in controversial
   political debates, when given the right instructions. In this study, we
   test the potential of such instructions in contexts where levels of
   polarization, conflict and social marginalization are high. Using a
   randomized controlled experimental design, we test the effect of
   encouraging members of marginalized and conflict-affected communities in
   Colombia to live up to the deliberative ideal, including free
   participation, mutual respect, justification of arguments, and
   contributing to the common good. Results indicate that deliberative
   instructions have a positive effect on intervention levels, but fail to
   increase discourse quality. We also find that socio-economic differences
   (especially education and gender), as well as inter-group trust
   dynamics, explain much of the variation in discourse quality. Promoting
   deliberative democracy under unfavorable conditions might therefore
   require a combination of short-term policy measures aimed at increasing
   communal trust, long-term efforts to improve schooling levels, and
   ensuring constraint-free participation. There is, however, no treatment
   yet that can ensure deliberation success.},

Abstract = {Can Switzerland still be classified as an example of consociational
   democracy, characterized by power sharing and elite cooperation, by the
   second decade of the 21(st) century? Drawing on Lijphart's typology of
   consociational and centrifugal regimes, an analysis of the
   transformation of Swiss democracy reveals that while Switzerland
   continues to display institutional elements of power sharing, a
   polarizing and competitive trend can be observed in the governing style
   of the elite. Increasingly adversarial elite behaviour and a growing
   polarization within parliament and government as well as with regards to
   referendums indicate a growing shift toward centrifugal democracy.},

Abstract = {Drawing upon the theses of State racism (Michel Foucault), homo sacer
   (Giorgio Agamben), and safe citizenship (Cynthia Weber), and fieldwork
   data collected from a multiethnic primary school in Xinjiang, this paper
   examines the way in which the state agencies of the local government,
   the school and mainstream citizens design citizenship for Uyghurs, and
   how Uyghurs interpret and act upon their citizenship. The findings show
   why, and how, designed citizenship by the mainstream system for Uyghurs
   has failed to produce a desirably productive force for the prosperity of
   both the Uyghur community and society at large. The findings require
   reconsideration of what could be a win-win citizenship for both the
   state and the citizen.},

Abstract = {This article explores the diffusion of criminal justice policy in the
   American states. Drawing on policy design theory, I code newspaper
   coverage of 44 criminal justice policies adopted across state
   governments from 1960-2008, identifying the image and power of target
   populationsthe group singled out for special treatment under law. I test
   whether electoral pressure leads governments to disproportionally
   emulate innovations that reinforce popular stereotypes regarding who is
   entitled to policy benefits or deserving of policy burdens. I find
   strong support for this theory: State governments are more likely to
   adopt innovations that extend benefits to strong, popular, and powerful
   target populations or that impose burdens on weak and politically
   marginalized groups. This bias can be explained by pressures for
   responsive policy making, as my findings indicate that it is the
   national salience of the crime problembut not the competitiveness or
   timing of state electionsthat influences state adoption of popular law
   and order policy innovations.},

Abstract = {A strong correlation exists between inequality and religion, such that
   societies marked by high inequality are more religious than those with
   more egalitarian income distributions. What explains this correlation?
   Insecurity theory argues that high inequality generates intense
   insecurities, leading the poor to seek shelter in religion for both
   psychological and material comfort. This article develops an alternative
   perspective that reverses the chain of causality. It argues that
   religious institutions and movements frequently resist both the
   centralization of state power and socialist efforts to organize the
   working class. As a result, powerful religious movements constrain
   state-led efforts to provide social protection, increasing income
   inequality. Analysis of the historical record and contemporary data from
   19 Western democracies reveals strong evidence that past periods of
   church-state conflict shaped the size and structure of welfare state
   institutions and, by extension, contemporary patterns of inequality.},

Abstract = {The recent history of the Middle East is marked by military influence
   (both direct and indirect) over governance. Lebanon, however, has
   followed a different trajectory: although it was ruled by army commander
   General Fuad Shihab between 1958 and 1970, this represented a mediated
   solution to civil unrest. Here, Eduardo W Aboultaif analyses how the
   army has helped to preserve stability during periods of crisis, in the
   1950s and 2000s, by remaining neutral towards those confessional groups
   struggling for power - the hallmark of what became known as Shihabism.
   When it failed to do so in 1975, Aboultaif argues, the armed forces
   fractured along religious faultlines and the country descended into a
   vicious, protracted conflict.},

Abstract = {Do voters judge their national economy relative to economic performance
   abroad? In 2013 we took advantage of the German Bundestag election to
   test this hypothesis predictively. Nearly two months prior to the
   election, we published an election forecast relying on a theory-driven
   empirical model of election outcomes that draws on previous election
   outcomes; characteristics of the government and of voters; and, most
   originally, the relative economic performance of Germany ('benchmarked'
   growth) in comparison to the three other most important economies in
   Europe - France, the UK and Italy. Our forecast put the outgoing
   coalition government of CDU/CSU and FDP at 47.05 per cent of the popular
   vote deviating from the actual outcome of 46.3 by 0.75 points. This
   makes our forecast one of the most accurate in this election cycle.
   Despite one-and-a-half months of lead time, our forecast performed on
   par or slightly better than the last poll results issued only two days
   before the election.},

Abstract = {This article examines the political context, campaign, election results
   and outcomes of the 2016 Scottish Parliament election. The Scottish
   National Party (SNP) secured its third electoral victory, yet failed to
   achieve a widely predicted majority. With just two MSPs short of a
   majority, the SNP has ruled out any formal coalition with the opposition
   and will instead govern as a minority administration. The composition of
   the parliament's opposition also changed significantly. The Scottish
   Conservatives increased their share of the constituency and regional
   votes, and became, for the first time, the largest opposition party in
   the chamber. Scottish Labour suffered a severe electoral drubbing,
   losing 13 of its seats. The election was also important for the Scottish
   Liberal Democrats and Scottish Green Party. The latter increased its
   vote share and number of seats, leapfrogging the Lib Dems to become the
   fourth largest party in the chamber.},

Title = {Repression, spontaneity, and collective action: the 2013 Turkish Gezi
   protests},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Pages = {411-429},
Abstract = {Scholars have identified various conditions that influence the formation
   of spontaneous collective action. Certain types of opposition strategies
   and geographic conditions make it likelier for protesters to be able to
   overcome reactive repression and keep mobilizing after experiencing
   state violence. As such, it is still unclear why a small protest
   sometimes diffuses into an unforeseen mass wave of dissent. Through
   examination of Turkish civil society, this study introduces a framework
   to explain the emergence of the 2013 Gezi protest, which was the largest
   in the Adalet ve Kalkinma Partisi (Justice and Development Party)
   government-led era of Turkish politics. A sequence of mechanisms
   including viral diffusion, elite updating/cover-up, public outrage, and
   coordination are categorized and linked to previously identified
   antecedent conditions as well as Twitter activity of social movement
   organizations which took part in the protests. The framework advances
   our knowledge of repression backfire by identifying its causal
   mechanisms and classifying a configuration of conditions under which the
   phenomenon is likely to empirically take place.},

   ASSESSMENT OF IMPACT ON POLITICAL CHANGES},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {The article suggests a theoretical framework to analyze the impact of
   protest publics on the mechanism of political changes. An analysis of
   protests in Egypt and Turkey shows the non-linear nature of the
   political changes. It also highlights different roles that the protest
   publics could play in the mechanism of political changes: depending on
   the prevailing conditions and the actions of other actors, protest
   publics can build coalitions with other actors and provide democratic
   changes ({''}triggers{''} of democratic development) or protest publics
   can provide democratic alternative by developing democratic practices of
   civil participation. This trend is marginal, though, comparing with the
   dominant tendency towards strengthening of authoritarian regimes
   ({''}democratic innovators in authoritarian environment).{''} Authors
   raise further research questions of modeling the mechanisms of political
   changes in the conditions of the growing wave of democratization - in
   embedded democracies, as well as in consolidated democracies, in hybrid
   and authoritarian regimes, - on the one hand, and the crisis of
   traditional democratic institutions - representative democracy,
   political parties - on the other.},

Journal = {TOCQUEVILLE REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {37},

Pages = {77-101},
Abstract = {In this paper, I would like to present some remarks on the idea of a
   ``property-owning democracy{''}, first presented by James Meade in 1964
   as an institutional remedy to the rise of inequality and then developed
   by John Rawls in his Theory of Justice (1971) and in Justice as
   Fairness. A Restatement (2001). Far from being obsolete in the present
   state of increased and extreme inequalities as described by Thomas
   Piketty in his influential Capital in the XXIst Century, (2013), I will
   show that Rawls's focus on inequalities of capital, not only of income,
   is still relevant today. Only a wide dispersion of capital and property
   through a return to high levels of taxation can remedy the failure of
   Welfare State benefits to reduce inequalities. Rawls's argument is based
   on the need not only to fight poverty, but also to create economic
   conditions for civic and social inclusion. He advocates a
   quasi-republican conception of the person as citizen, not only as
   consumer, that echoes Bruce Ackerman's stakeholder society (1999). But
   he also, and more convincingly in my view, draws on Mill's conception of
   the individual as a self-developing being and argues that a
   property-owning democracy is the condition for her autonomous
   development.},

   Reform in Historical Perspective},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {707-728},
Abstract = {In order to understand reform in German federalism, this article applies
   the framework of ``dynamic institutionalism{''}. It explains change as a
   result of a particular pattern of constitutional policy emerging in a
   sequential evolution of institutions and responding to changing
   state-society relations. Historical legacies found expression in
   negotiations predominated by bargaining among governments, guided by
   legalist approaches of lawyers and court decisions and influenced by
   specialists in public administration. In this context, societal change
   affected the agenda but had limited impact on processes and outcomes. In
   consequence, the reform ended with many detailed constitutional
   amendments not amounting to substantial change. In a comparative
   perspective, German federalism may have its strengths, but its reform
   should not be regarded as a role model for other federations. Instead,
   it exemplifies the problematic consequences of a constitutional policy
   not sufficiently separated from normal intergovernmental policy-making
   and strongly embedded in a self-enforcing evolution of institutions.},

Abstract = {From the Eastern Enlargement onwards, the EU has related its geopolitics
   to the diffusion of distinctive legal and political principles, linked
   to the design of constitutional democracy. The EU attempts to promote a
   distinctive constitutional imaginary, which helps to define who is
   included in the European project, and who is not (or threatened with
   exclusion), and which gives the EU a certain political leverage also
   beyond its borders. In this paper, I will look into how the geopolitical
   approach of the EU, in particular in terms of enlargement and control
   beyond its borders, entails a distinctive democratic-constitutional
   narrative. Constitutionalization processes in the New Member States, but
   also beyond, might be said to contain dimensions of a form of ``informal
   imperialism{''}. This means that the EU and other relevant organizations
   (e.g. the Council of Europe) promote a distinct, even if not
   well-defined, constitutional template for member states to follow, in
   particular in newly acceding states. It involves in some ways a form of
   cultural or informal imperialism, and can be understood as a
   distinctive, post-national geopolitical politics.},

Abstract = {The companies that profited from the so-called ``commodities
   consensus{''} in Latin America are now facing a crisis due to the drop
   in the international price of agricultural products, which has forced
   them to re-adapt. Monsanto is among them, with its star product, the
   herbicide glyphosate (whose sale is tied to transgenic products
   resistant to the herbicide) that has faced for some years a series of
   challenges: with the expiration of the patent, Chinese companies are
   massively producing a cheaper generic glyphosate; the International
   Agency for Cancer Research cataloged it as a ``probable carcinogenic
   product for human beings{''}, therefore, several countries have
   prohibited its use and the commodities crisis has created a drop in
   consumption. To face this problem, Monsanto has developed a series of
   initiatives to come stronger out of this crisis: expanding its
   pesticides offer, establishing mega-merges, pushing governments to adopt
   favorable policies. This has caused serious impacts in Latin America
   where the transgenic plantations have expanded the most.},

Abstract = {This chapter aims to address what could be outlined in Slavoj Zizek's
   thought as his notion of political act. It starts initially from the
   view Zizek has about political parallax to show how in contemporary
   times we are witnessing a neutrality that makes it difficult to assume
   the political act as an exercise of daily conquest of political spaces
   through the word. On the contrary, Zizek suggests that, between
   antagonists, there is not a good halfway point, but rather a structural
   division that would involve political subjects to be loyal to this
   division, making them take sides. It is concluded that the political act
   is not a passage to the act of direct violence itself, but a form of
   symbolic violence that invites us to act, to take sides regardless of
   whether it fails or not. It is based on approving desire as an
   emancipatory act of the subject in relation to the big Other; on
   intervening non-explicit ideas provided by ideology; and on acting
   without any warranty - in case of failure, it is necessary to try
   again-. The chapter provides a current perspective on the political act,
   coupled with the possibility of promoting reflection among political
   movements that expect a place in contemporary politics, but above all,
   is a favorable text for individual reflection on utopias that arise
   without getting anywhere, or that reproduce what they criticize without
   knowing it.},

   in general has attracted growing interest in academic and
   political-institutional settings. This has led to deepen its analysis
   and generate debates about its features, its scope and its
   conceptualization. The so-called ``paradiplomacy{''} concept, widely
   distributed, made it possible to debate the issue. This article analyzes
   the main approaches from the field of International Relations and, from
   these inputs, an appropriate approach to study the reality of countries

Abstract = {This paper seeks to illuminate essential aspects in Placido Castro's
   thinking by looking at three of his key texts. The first piece deals
   with Ireland, the mirror of nations to which galeguistas looked at.
   Ireland's integration in the Commonwealth is regarded positively. Castro
   interpreted that integration secured the liberties of the Irish and, in
   turn, provided them with privileged access to the commercial and
   security structures of the Empire. By contrast, when emotional issues
   are discussed (for instance, the requirement for Irish MPs to swear
   allegiance to the British Crown) the force of nationalist claims gains
   salience. The second text identifies Scotland and Wales, in addition to
   Ireland, as Galicia's sister nations. The preservation of Celtic
   identity, another recurrent subject for galeguismo, is attributed to the
   uneducated people, the true guarantors of national essences. Finally,
   the third article gives account of Castro's performance at the 9th
   European Nationalities Conference (Berne, 1933) on behalf of Partido
   Galeguista - a landmark moment in the international recognition of
   Galicia.},

Abstract = {In the context of the current commodity boom, informal and illegal
   mining have become acute challenges to the Peruvian state. This article
   documents and explains the state's response to these challenges. After a
   stage of inaction (2004-2008), the Peruvian state initially reacted with
   a disarticulated response (2008-2011) before mounting a more coherent
   and organized response (2011-2015). Although the state's response to the
   challenge has been limited, it is has nevertheless resulted in an
   observable increase in state capacity. We propose that this phenomenon
   is better explained by factors external to the state (international
   pressures and domestic demands) rather than by processes triggered from
   within.},

Abstract = {The United States is a democracy that every four years elects a
   President. During the presidential campaigns, the issue of immigration
   has grown to become one of the most debated in recent times. It has been
   used to attract voters and to develop the political platform of every
   candidate. By an empirical analysis of the last four presidential
   campaigns and the current one of 2016, regarding immigration positions
   of the candidates and politicians, this article looks to find the
   connection -if any-with this issue and the Hispanic vote. Thus,
   candidates focus on these issues in order to gain new constituencies.
   The declarations and policies about immigration of the 2000, 2004, 2008,
   2012 and 2016 candidates will be analyzed in order to validate this
   premise.},

Abstract = {In this introduction, we provide an overall framing of the articles that
   follow by placing the Ukraine conflict which today embroils the West in
   confrontation with Russia, within an historical account of the
   geopolitical economy of contemporary capitalism and the dynamics of
   imperialism in the twenty-first century, taking particular account of
   the decline of US and Western power and the rise of other centres of
   economic and military power, which are able to resist and contest
   Western power. We pay particular attention to how today's geopolitical
   flashpoints, of which Ukraine is among the most critical, emerged to
   belie post-Cold War expectations of a ``peace dividend{''} and a
   ``unipolar{''} world, clearly distinguishing the US and the EU roles in
   these processes. Given the widespread tendency in the West to label
   Russia ``imperialist,{''} particularly after the integration of Crimea
   into the Russian Federation, we end our discussion with a consideration
   of this question which concludes that the term, while it continues to be
   an appropriate description of the pattern of Western actions, is not so
   for that of Russian ones.},

Volume = {29},
Number = {113},

Abstract = {Scientific literature about electioneering generally focuses on its
   historical evolution. The synchronic plurality of electoral practices is
   largely ignored, thus the fact that a campaign encompasses in reality
   diverse forms of electoral mobilizations is not well perceived. The
   article introduces a configurational analysis to explain differences
   among electoral campaigns as well as their unequal integration within
   national politics. Based on the British case and on fieldwork focusing
   on Labour and Conservative candidates, the article aims at understanding
   how they structure electoral mobilizations. Campaign styles vary
   according to the characteristics of the candidates, but depend also on
   the nature of the competition and the degree of integration to the
   central political game. Finally, by taking into account the trajectories
   of candidates as well as their personal or professional experiences, the
   configurational approach is a useful tool to understand how campaigns
   are effectively set up.},

Journal = {PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS},

Volume = {69},

Pages = {53-72},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article presents an analysis of the effectiveness of French
   immigration policy during President Nicolas Sarkozy's single term
   (2007-2012). Following a recent proposal, this article will explore the
   level of congruence between French legislator's objectives on
   immigration policy and the remaining stages of the policy process.
   Notwithstanding President Sarkozy's ambitious agenda, a persistent gap
   between restrictive objectives and the subsequent liberal outcomes from
   policy implementation has been detected by immigration studies. The
   analysis will suggest that French immigration policy attained a variable
   level of policy effectiveness throughout President Sarkozy's term. This
   investigation emphasises that policy inputs can be driven by political
   considerations involving the mobilisation of sections of the electorate
   in spite of the diminished feasibility of the proposals. Furthermore,
   the strong effects exercised by endogenous and exogenous political
   factors over President Sarkozy's plans will be highlighted in this
   article, in particular the agency of `domestic veto players'.},

Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},

Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {500-518},
Abstract = {This article examines the impact of German dependence on Russian gas
   supplies for Europe's ability to apply effective sanctions against
   Russia. It demonstrates that by focusing on the environmental dimensions
   of energy policy and a policy of rapprochement with Russia, Germany has
   neglected the security of supply implications of its dependence on
   Russian gas. The article argues that Germany's excessive energy
   dependence on Russia has limited the ability of the EU to challenge
   Russian revisionism by targeting its energy sector through sanctions.
   The article makes a number of energy policy recommendations which will
   be essential for Germany to avoid undue Russian influence on its foreign
   and security policies. The article concludes by exploring the utility of
   Neoclassical Realism in understanding Germany's approach to energy
   security. In doing so it highlights the dangers of allowing ideology to
   cloud a sober assessment of the imperatives of the balance of theat.},

Abstract = {The personal linkages between political parties and social partnership
   organizations are a major contributor to the stability of corporatist
   institutions in postwar Austria. This paper presents the most
   comprehensive and systematic analysis to date of individual interlocks
   between the Austrian government and the corporatist institutions
   (chambers and trade unions). Drawing on biographical information for all
   242 senior and junior ministers serving between 1945 and 2015, it shows
   that corporatist officials are more likely to be nominated to the
   cabinet under grand coalitions and single-party governments. They are
   also more likely to serve in portfolios dealing with matters related to
   social or economic policy. While the degree of interlock between cabinet
   and social partners varies over time, the data show no general decline
   in recent decades.},

Abstract = {How does the context in which a person lives affect his or her political
   behavior? I exploit an event in which demographic context was
   exogenously changed, leading to a significant change in voters' behavior
   and demonstrating that voters react strongly to changes in an outgroup
   population. Between 2000 and 2004, the reconstruction of public housing
   in Chicago caused the displacement of over 25,000 African Americans,
   many of whom had previously lived in close proximity to white voters.
   After the removal of their African American neighbors, the white voters'
   turnout dropped by over 10 percentage points. Consistent with
   psychological theories of racial threat, their change in behavior was a
   function of the size and proximity of the outgroup population. Proximity
   was also related to increased voting for conservative candidates. These
   findings strongly suggest that racial threat occurs because of attitude
   change rather than selection.},

Volume = {29},
Number = {115},
Pages = {9+},
Abstract = {Vigilantism covers a range of collective actions, often violent and
   usually illegal, whose proclaimed vocation is to maintain order and/or
   to render justice in the name of legal or moral norms. With this
   definition, our aim is not to freeze these practices in an irremovable
   concept. While presenting the literature and the debates around
   vigilantism, this introduction argues in favor of a dynamic analysis of
   citizens' participation in policing, attentive to the changes occurring
   along the way in the repertoire of action of the groups under study. Our
   aim, here, is also to open new research avenues that go beyond the
   dichotomy substitution/complementarity concerning the relations with law
   enforcement agencies.},

Title = {Economic performance and presidential vote for Obama: the
   underappreciated influence of race},
Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {30-46},
Abstract = {National economic conditions have a considerable influence on the
   outcomes of presidential elections. Studies have consistently found that
   there is a strong relationship between annual real disposable income and
   the vote of the president's party. Based on historical economic
   performance models, the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections went
   largely the way they was supposed to, with a generic Democrat being
   expected to win under the country's economic conditions in those years
   (as a challenger to the party controlling the White House in 2008 and as
   the incumbent party in 2012). On the face of it, therefore, models that
   predict incumbent vote share based on the country's economic performance
   seemed to be as accurate as ever, giving credence to those who argue
   that economic performance is critical in determining a presidential
   candidate's success or failure. These traditional economic performance
   models, however, fail to accurately account for the role of race in the
   2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. A number of studies have found
   that Obama lost a sizeable number of potential votes based on his race
   that he would have won if he were white. In fact, if one looks at
   national economic conditions and the vote of only whites (as opposed to
   all voters), 2008 and 2012 are outliers: Obama did significantly worse
   among white voters than previous economic models would predict. This may
   simply be a consequence of Obama's candidacy; a number of whites who
   would normally be willing to vote Democratic for president may not have
   done so because of Obama's race. But this also suggests that traditional
   economic performance models may fail to account for the increasing
   importance of race as the nonwhite share of the electorate grows. As a
   result, economic performance models may be poorer predictors of
   presidential vote choice than they have been in the past.},

Abstract = {Does American political representation work as predicted by theory? On
   average, political candidates diverge considerably in their ideological
   positioning, but do they diverge less on issues of particular salience
   to their local constituents? We combine data on congressional roll call
   votes, electoral outcomes, district demographics, and substantive
   information about bills to search for convergence in the places we would
   most expect to find it. Despite the predictions of prominent models,
   legislators diverge just as much even when their constituents have
   strong interests in a particular policy area. These results provide new
   insights into policymaking and political representation, and they help
   distinguish between different theoretical explanations for why candidate
   positions diverge.},

Abstract = {The philosophy of Open Government provides a new paradigm of innovation
   in public administration built around three key words: transparency,
   participation and collaboration. Greater transparency of information
   about the PA and its way of working should help to regain public
   confidence in the institutions, motivating people to take a more active
   part in decision making processes. It should also encourage them to
   support the institutions by inputting their own knowledge and abilities,
   consequently engendering a widespread spirit of collaboration between
   different public authorities and between them and the public, businesses
   and non profit organisations, in order to relaunching the economic value
   of the Public Sector Information (Huijboom, Van den Broek, 2011). The
   hypothesis behind this contribution, starting from an approach based on
   an interpretation of significant elements in public action (Moini 2013)
   and of their conceptual framework (Fischer 2003), is that through which
   open government, open data, social media, collective intelligence, and
   connectivity are key words in a new rhetoric of administrative
   innovation - summed up in the label ``government 2.0{''} - which refers
   to a form of public action easily seen to be drawn from the neoliberal
   paradigm (Jessop, 2002), even though subject to some variegated form at
   national level.},

Abstract = {INOGATE Programme is one of the instruments designed for the
   implementation of the energy policy developed by the EU and the
   countries of the East European, Caucasus and Central Asian regions. Its
   objectives include the formation of a common energy market, increasing
   the security of supply, diversification, transit and supporting the
   development of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources. Armenia,
   Azerbaijan and Georgia were implementing projects in the framework of
   the programme between 2009 and 2014 in selected thematic areas, at a
   different pace and with emphasis on different thematic areas. Armenia
   focused on the introduction of energy passports for houses, Georgia - on
   the development of an energy efficiency plan and Azerbaijan - on the
   establishment of procedures increasing the security of petroleum, gas
   and energy transit. Of the three countries, Georgia made the most
   significant and Azerbaijan - the least progress; this was due to the
   policy pursued by this country which, in common with Armenia, aimed a
   less strong relationship with the EU.},

Abstract = {The paper deals with a very topical issue which currently constitutes
   one of the major global problems of the world, and that is terrorism and
   its consequences for social and economic development of our society. For
   this reason, in this article, was created by analysis of strategic
   elements that are effective in combating terrorism. Part of the
   contribution is intended to define terrorism from a historical
   perspective, which we see as the perception and the overall focus of
   terrorism is changing due to the current global or regional problems.
   Currently, each region of the world, due to its economic potential,
   seeks to promote the fight against terrorism. In the world there are
   many organizations involved in protecting humans against terrorism. We
   are dealing with text mainly those that directly affect European Union.
   Another part of the article describes and defines the current strategy
   to fight terrorism in the Czech Republic. Czech legislation based on the
   basic regulation and standards to be followed by each Member State of
   Union. At the same time, most European Union states struggling in
   practice against this problem institutions and national churches, which
   operate at the national and transnational levels today because the state
   can't fight terrorism only at their national level. The main result of
   this analysis was to describe and define the various forms of protection
   of the population, which ensure peace and security throughout the
   European Union.},

Volume = {6},

Pages = {378-392},
Abstract = {Global conflicts, be they economic, political, cultural, or military
   ones, are big challenges in the age of world interactions. The article
   concentrates on conflicts and dangers of the future possible global
   state which can be the result of the current development of global
   capitalism. It tries to capture to the greatest possible extent these
   integrating trends, not only in order to clarify their shape and
   potentials over last recent decades, but also to show the thematic areas
   of the developmental processes of global conflicts. There is a need to
   deal with potential global tendencies in the form of planetary
   homogenisation, supranational authoritarian tendencies, and a world war,
   and to formulate possible normative solutions to these by a multi-level
   arrangement (local, national, macro-regional, and global levels). The
   article stresses that the analysis of negative and positive aspects of
   the global state presupposes its complex critical concept. It
   articulates the basis for a critical theory of (mis) recognition of the
   global state. In the end, the article indicates how, in the conflict
   zones and peripheries, the global poor as a potential new subject of
   social change can contribute to the positive development and solutions
   to the conflicts and dangers.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the impact of Internet on protest behavior. Using
   data from 49 countries obtained during the sixth wave of the surveys in
   the framework of the project World Values Survey, O.Koltsova and
   E.Kirkizh build regression models that allow to assess the impact on
   protests of various factors related to both the ``resources{''} and
   ``values{''} categories. The research study conducted by the authors
   shows that reading online news bears an independent effect on people's
   participation in peaceful demonstrations, which cannot be reduced to the
   influence of other factors, and this impact is robustly reproduced in
   different countries.},

   Created Crises},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {91-103},
Abstract = {Among the recent literature about leadership and crisis situations two
   main strands are to be observed: structuralist ones mainly treat
   political leaders as reactive agents who have relatively little room for
   maneuver, while constructivist ones put greater emphasis on the
   opportunities in interpreting crises. Our claim is that there is a third
   analytical possibility mainly neglected in recent literature that is
   even more voluntaristic than the constructivist approaches. In this
   scenario, there is no external shock; leaders do not only interpret, but
   also ``invent{''} crises. To make our claim plausible, we build a
   conceptual-descriptive typology of the potential relationships between
   crisis situations and agency. The typology is founded on Kari Palonen's
   differentiation between Machiavellian and Weberian types of contingency,
   but uses his originally conceptual historical argument for analytical
   purposes. To underpin our theoretical argument, we present short
   illustrative examples to all three types of crisis scenarios (the
   structuralist, the constructivist, and the voluntarist one).},

Title = {The case of Poland in the EU: democratic setbacks and the regression of
   the Rule of Law, the ``Copenhaguen dilemmas{''}},
Journal = {TEORIA Y REALIDAD CONSTITUCIONAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {38},
Pages = {101-142},
Abstract = {During the European legislatures 2009-2014 and 2014-2019 the EU has
   witnessed the challenge posed by the alarming signs of deterioration and
   decline of democracy in the EU. Not by chance this trend has coincided
   with the immersion of the Union in the worst crisis in its history that
   began in 2008 and has been called the ``Great Recession{''} of the EU or
   the European ``glaciation{''}. Over this period Hungary has been the
   best example of democratic backsliding in the EU but Poland has shown an
   equally worrying deterioration lately. Yet these are not, unfortunately,
   isolated cases but there is rather an increasingly widespread trend in
   Europe that has received, depending on the context, the name
   ``putinization{''} or ``orbanization{''}. The present article recounts
   the constitutional deterioration experienced by those two countries and
   the initiatives that have been launched from the EU to follow-up and
   contest those processes. The article emphasizes the ``anti-liberal{''}
   or ``iliberal `` features that characterize these democracies as well as
   those marks inherent to the rise of nationalism and intolerance and puts
   them in relation to other historical processes of democratic erosion in
   Europe, focusing on the dialectic democracy vs populism. The article
   also exposes the conflicts stemming from the so-called ``Copenhagen
   dilemma{''} and the rise of the extreme right across the EU and stops in
   some concrete cases such as the restrictions on the rights of refugees
   in Denmark or the limitations which have occurred in recent years in the
   field of civil liberties in Spain. The article concludes that this
   deterioration is linked to the `` great enlargement ``, which involved
   the accession to the EU of the Eastern European countries against the
   backdrop of a relentless financial and economic crisis that rapidly
   became in a social crisis and a truly crisis of values as a result of
   the austerity policies imposed by an unsatisfactory handling of the
   crisis itself. This has resulted in a challenge to the very idea of
   European integration coming from different ideological fronts. The
   article finally stops on the European response to the democratic
   backsliding described before by reaffirming its fundamental values and
   by enhancing their protection by implementing new mechanisms to ensure
   that the quality of democracy and the rule of law in the EU is improved
   complementing the national systems of judicial protection of fundamental
   rights legal common to the constitutional traditions of the EU Member
   States.},

Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {Throughout history societies have always pretended to immortalize
   through the window of the cities which for them is coated of importance
   and superior value. This need to create visible and notable places has
   persisted for thousands of years, from Mesopotamia to the present day,
   boosting civilizations to create structures ranging from religion
   through large walls representing power and security, to structures of a
   commercial nature or artistic. This expression is what we know today as
   the monumentality, urban attribute that is covered with great importance
   by virtue of being a trim and structuring element of the urban fabric, a
   visual planner, social, cultural, educational; ecological and identity
   assurance within the city.
   The monumentality besides being a multifunctional element of great
   significance for the city is an emerging and innovative collective
   right, but at the same time demanding within that public space where an
   endless number of humans confluence, intimate, collective,
   institutional, political, commercial and cultural; where social and
   psychological development of human beings occurs, which is the city.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Given the depth of research on negative advertising in campaigns,
   scholars have wondered why candidates continue to attack their
   opponents. We build on this research by considering real-world campaign
   contexts in which candidates are working in competition with each other
   and have to react to the decisions of the opposing campaign. Our results
   suggest that it is never efficacious for candidates to run attack ads,
   but running positive ads can increase a candidate's margin of victory.
   These results are conditioned by two factors: candidates must both stay
   positive and out-advertise their opponent. Second, the effects of
   positive advertising are strongest in areas where the candidate is
   losing or winning by a large margin-areas where they might be tempted to
   not advertise at all.},

Abstract = {Over the past half century, the Australian public has remained divided
   on the issue of whether Australia should retain the monarchy or become a
   republic. Clive Bean found that there had been remarkable stability on
   the issue and evidence of a long-term trend away from support for the
   monarchy with a sudden decline in 1992. This article adopts Bean's
   longitudinal cross-sectional methods to examine the social and political
   basis of public attitudes. This article analyses the Australian Election
   Study (1993-2013) to compare Bean's results and re-analyse earlier data
   from the National Social Science Surveys and Australian National
   Political Attitudes surveys (1967-90). Public opinion has been fluid and
   is now at a crossroads between the 1980s high and the 1990s lows. Cohort
   analysis suggests socialisation impacts long-term opinions. Gender and
   ethnic nationalism also influences opinion.},

Volume = {28},

Pages = {404-411},
Abstract = {In ``The Politics of Getting It Right,{''} Russell Muirhead has
   contended in this journal that democracy is valuable because of its
   procedural legitimacy rather than because of the epistemic values of
   ``getting things right.{''} However, pure procedural theories of
   legitimacy fail. Thus, if democracy is legitimate, it will have to be
   due partly to its (potential) epistemic advantages. There are two ways
   of thinking about these advantages. One approach, associated most
   prominently with David Estlund and Helene Landemore, equates the
   epistemic advantages of democracy with its ability to approximate a
   procedure-independent standard of correctness. The other, associated
   with Fabienne Peter, explicitly rejects that standard. Peter's view,
   however, is incapable of answering challenges against pure procedural
   theories of legitimacy.},

Abstract = {This article's goal is to explore the existence of `political citizens'
   profiles across three European cities (Turin, Cologne and Lyon) and to
   ascertain the role of an unstable occupational status on the repertoires
   of action deployed. For this purpose, a technique called latent class
   cluster analysis (LCCA) is applied to a large sample, including young
   precarious and regular workers (deployed as a reference group). This
   technique allowed us to derive five descriptive probabilistic profiles
   of `political citizens' and their repertoires of action in each city.
   The empirical findings underline the emergence of hybrid repertoires of
   action together with `single-issue' or `cause-oriented' forms of
   political participation. This study represents an attempt to encourage
   the dialogue between two strands of research in social sciences, namely
   sociology of work and political participation and to foster the
   formation of an innovative research agenda crossing these two fields.},

Abstract = {While conspiracies have always been with us, conspiracy theories are
   more recent arrivals. The framing of conspiracy theories as rooted in
   erroneous or delusional belief in conspiracies is characteristic of
   ``positive{''} approaches to the topic, which focus on identifying the
   causes and cures of conspiracy theories. ``Critical{''} approaches, by
   contrast, focus on the historical and cultural construction of the
   concept of conspiracy theory itself. This issue presents a range of
   essays that cut across these two broad approaches, and reflect on the
   problematic relationship between conspiracy theory and democratic
   politics.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Pages = {44-62},
Abstract = {Hayek's social theory is resolutely anti-conspiratorial: He consistently
   rejects conceiving complex orders as though they were designed or
   planned. His account of democratic politics, by contrast, treats it as
   conducive to conspiracy, organized deception, and ultimately
   totalitarianism. His epistemology of spontaneous order and his radical
   suspicion of democratic politics are connected: The decay of democracy
   is itself a complex consequence of popular misunderstandings of social
   order. However, since Hayek is unable to account for self-correction
   within democratic structures, his argument has the unanticipated
   consequence of leading him to an implicitly authoritarian position.},

Abstract = {In a context of declining commodity prices, the 2015 elections led to
   government alternation in Argentina. For the first time since
   democratization, the new president is neither Peronist nor Radical, thus
   opening up new possibilities for a change in the Argentine political
   system. In this article, we review the main electoral trends in the 2015
   race at the national, provincial, and municipal level. Additionally, we
   analyze the economic conditions surrounding these elections and the new
   challenges they pose for the incoming administration. Finally, we focus
   on the Peronist Party's gubernatorial defeat in the Province of Buenos
   Aires after a twenty-eight-year rule to illustrate the strategic
   behavior of Argentine voters.},

Abstract = {Can unconditional basic income policies be designed to generate the
   motivational conditions that make possible their own support?
   Unconditional redistributive schemes do not take formal precautions to
   deal with potential motivational problems that may affect their
   stability. For example, they are designed to give people the freedom to
   decide whether or not to participate in the job market. However,
   scholars like Philippe Van Parijs and Simon Birnbaum think that the
   promotion of an ethos of justice can potentially do the necessary
   motivational work to secure the stability of unconditional
   redistributive institutions. Their solution lies in changing people's
   behavior through an informal motivational mechanism rather than through
   a formal rule or institution. This paper argues against that
   `ethos-based solution.' It presents three reasons to distrust that
   solution. First, it argues that even broader and more inclusive ethoi of
   justice can become oppressive and violate people's freedom. Second, it
   suggests that the formal and informal strategies to generate that ethos
   may be difficult to implement, monitor, and control. Finally, it argues
   that the difficulties associated with implementing and developing that
   ethos of justice may lead us to either preserve an undesirable status
   quo or to implement suboptimal redistributive policies.},

   Violence against Women in Politics},
Journal = {POLITICA Y GOBIERNO},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {437-458},
Abstract = {Female politicians in Latin America experience myriad forms of
   gender-based abuse, from physical attacks to degrading sexual
   commentaries. Activists have framed this problem as violence against
   women in politics (VAWIP), an emphasis on women's political and
   electoral rights that reflects the political opportunity structure. In
   Latin America, broken criminal justice systems foment impunity,
   normalizing actors' use of violence to maintain political and
   patriarchal power. Citizens' rights to physical and emotional security
   are not protected by law enforcement, but women's rights to elect and be
   elected have received substantive protections from electoral
   institutions and electoral courts. Consequently, framing VAWIP as an
   electoral crime represents a clever activist strategy-but one that
   researchers cannot adopt without losing explanatory power. From an
   academic standpoint, VAWIP overlooks how widespread impunity results in
   the routinization of violence throughout state and society, leading to
   policy solutions narrowly tailored to punishing political parties and
   protecting elite women. Such reforms do little to address the underlying
   absence of the rule of law.},

Abstract = {The republican regime established in Brazil in 1889 generated a distance
   between Nabuco with the politics, at least until 1900 -when he accepts
   the post of envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary in
   Brazilian special mission to London as a Campos Salles (1841-1913)'s
   request. Nabuco's refugee in the royalist party and the reconversion to
   the Catholic faith increment assumptions about his theory about the
   republicanism. His point was to keep the acquaintance with the ideas of
   freedom, and harmonize them with the moral and aesthetic value legated
   by the religious frame. This study aims: (i) to evaluate the
   relationship between Joaquim Nabuco's (1849-1910) return to Catholicism
   and his refusal to the authoritarian and materialistic1890s' scientific
   liberalism. And (ii) to identify the points of contact between Nabuco's
   social Catholicism and the reaffirmation of social liberalism, regarding
   liberal classics of the liberal thought like Benjamin Constant and
   Alexis de Tocqueville.},

Abstract = {This article uses a case study from Queensland to demonstrate the court
   politics approach's potential to reinvigorate executive studies. Court
   politics focuses on webs of interdependence within the core executive.
   It examines the beliefs and practices of elite actors and their fluid
   and contingent relationships. This article examines the patterns of
   executive politics that prevailed under Premier Anna Bligh. It seeks to
   answer three key questions. First, why is court politics a useful
   approach to studying the Australian core executive? Second, what is the
   nature and extent of court politics in Australian state governments?
   Finally, recognising that local traditions shape the beliefs and
   practices of political elites, how does the court politics approach need
   to be modified for application in Australia?},

Abstract = {This articles analyzes how Uruguay, a country that historically grounded
   its collective identity on civil premises, attempted to reconstruct it
   after that vision was shattered by the mounting political violence of
   the 1960s-70s and the civilian-military dictatorship that ruled the
   country from 1973 to 1985. At the basis of this process, the article
   identifies the ongoing debates and demands by sectors of society to come
   to grips with the legacy of authoritarianism in a way that restored
   legal accountability, truth and justice as basic to core national
   principles. It claims that this process prompted a critical vision of
   earlier understandings, which has enabled the coexistence of opposing
   worldviews without eroding democracy, unlike in the past. The Uruguayan
   case is of particular comparative relevance for societies where
   contestation often spills over into political polarization, civil wars
   and human rights violations.},

Abstract = {In 2011, the coalition government enacted the Fixed-term Parliaments
   Act, which constrains the prime minister's discretion to dissolve
   parliament. This article argues that the Act not only reflects the
   secular decline of majoritarianism in the UK, but is also contributing
   to its further erosion. While this makes the legislation controversial,
   its repeal would be unlikely to secure a return to the majoritarian
   politics of the 1950s and 1960s. Moreover, in the absence of voter
   choices that regularly produce single-party majorities, a return to
   flexible election timing may not be appropriate.},

Abstract = {This article examines how increased tensions between Russia and the West
   in the wake of the Ukraine crisis impact the conflict management work of
   the OSCE. It first looks at Russian perspectives of the OSCE and focuses
   on how these changed in the post-2014 period. It then proceeds with an
   overview of implications resulting from geopolitical tensions between
   Russia and the West that could positively or negatively affect the role
   of the OSCE in conflict management in the long term. The article ends by
   laying out 4 scenarios on how the situation and the OSCE could evolve
   and argues that in the near future a continuation of the status quo is
   most probable.},

Abstract = {Arild Underdal has been at the center of an important community of
   scholars studying global environmental governance. Since the 1990s that
   community, along with many other scholars globally, has offered
   important insights into the design and management of international
   institutions that can lead to more effective management of environmental
   problems. At the same time, diplomats have made multiple attempts to
   create institutions to manage the dangers of climate change. This essay
   looks at what has been learned by both communities-scholars and
   practitioners-as their efforts co-evolved. It appears that despite a
   wealth of possible insights into making cooperation effective very few
   of the lessons offered by scholars had much impact during the first two
   decades of climate change diplomacy. Indeed, basic concepts from
   cooperation theory and evidence from case studies-many developed in
   Arild's orbit-can explain why those two decades achieved very little
   real cooperation. The new Paris agreement may be changing all that and
   much better reflects insights from scholars about how to build effective
   international institutions. Success in the Paris process is far from
   assured and scholars can contribute a lot more with a more strategic
   view of when and how they have an impact.},

Abstract = {The association of Machiavelli's teaching with the advice of possessing
   one's own weapons has become axiomatic in the interpretation of his
   work. Nonetheless, the apparent simplicity of this formula implies an
   inadequate interpretation of Machiavelli's text. His frequent
   self-contradictory statements on the subject, as well as the stories he
   tells in his books, deny in certain cases the accuracy of the advice of
   possessing one's own weapons. We intend to analyze Machiavelli's
   understanding of the foundations of power (if it relies simply on
   weapons or if an element of another order intervenes), and the
   development of our reading will reveal new dimensions such as the
   relationship with representation and its figures, the importance of
   appearance and the scene of the spectacle of power, the question of the
   legitimacy of power, and the place of religion and philosophical
   knowledge.},

   in Spain one of its most economically developed regions - Catalonia -
   envisages a rise of the regional identity. Against the backdrop of
   economic problems generated by the crisis of 2008-2014 the autonomous
   communities of Spain, including Catalonia, came across the rise of
   socio-political problems, particularly the growing distance between the

   that although there are few people who passionately defend European
   integration today, those that do are increasingly resorting to arguments
   that depend simultaneously on invoking and rejecting collective memories
   of intra-European conflict derived from the `emotive' period of European
   integration in the 1940s to shore up the increasingly challenged
   legitimacy of the European Union today in its hour of greatest crisis.},

Abstract = {While the role o f institutionalized parliamentary opposition in

   quality o f parliamentary democracy, opposition has been inadequately
   researched and the actual behaviour o f opposition in a particular

   Traditional functions o f parliamentary opposition - to propose, oppose,
   expose and depose have been in highly politicized circumstances in
   post-Socialist countries frequently intended to block the government's
   proposals and to delegitimize coalitional government. The paper presents
   the particular model o f government-opposition relation in Slovenia
   where opposition was using constitutionally designed means o f control,
   being at the same time over equipped with possibility to demand a
   referendum on matters which have been decided in the parliament what
   made the legislative process controversial and futile. After the change
   o f constitution in 2013 the opposition has had to change its strategies
   and adopt a more cooperative attitude.},

   central even in historical institutionalist approaches which ``take time

   sometimes seen to augur in favour of single-case and single-outcome
   studies. However, if Simeon's suggested approach is to reflect the major
   advances that have occurred since he wrote, it will require more fully
   and more explicitly combining the power of the comparative method with
   the powerful insights generated by a logic of intertemporal causal
   mechanisms unfolding over time.},

Abstract = {Using election results as our point of departure, this article places
   the 2016 presidential election in historical perspective. Trump's
   victory was an ``expected{''} outcome, as races following two-terms of
   one party rule usually go to the opposition party. Trump also ran close
   to fellow Republicans competing for Congress despite his unusual
   relationship with many of those in the party he captured. Trump's
   victory in the presidential contest proved remarkably economical. He
   lost most of his votes relative to Romney in 2012 in places where it did
   not matter, while his opponent ran up the score in the states she
   already had locked down. We further measure the increasing geographic
   concentration of each major party's electoral support and consider how
   this relates to the controversy over the Electoral College.},

Abstract = {This study examines accommodations of `national' minorities in the
   context of territorial neutrality and territorial democracy in American
   federalism and critiques Kymlicka's criticism of the United States as
   the foe of peripheral nationalism. Aside from the imagined nationalism
   of the white American South, peripheral nationalism has not been
   politically viable in the United States. Territorial democracy permitted
   territorially based cultural pluralism that facilitated immigrant
   assimilation while asymmetrical territorial governance arrangements
   accommodated `national' minorities not necessarily desiring statehood.
   Secession, therefore, is not a credible threat in American federalism.},

Volume = {9},
Number = {10},
Pages = {103-112},

Abstract = {The most important criteria for realization of justice are independence
   and impartiality of judge when he makes a decision; it means that judge
   must see himself in a situation that he is not afraid of anything, and
   he should consider merely God, law and conscience in decision-making.
   Judge must have many conditions to sit in this position, and the
   judgment is perhaps the only position that he must has all these
   conditions together. The most basic tool of an independent judge is his
   knowledge and justice, and when knowledge and justice place beside an
   independent character, judicial process will be complete. In the Iranian
   constitution it has been reflected in Articles 156, 164 and 170 which
   show judge's independence. But beside independence, despotism of judge
   in decision-making should be noted. Despite basic difference between two
   words of ``independence{''}and ``despotism{''}, there is also a tiny
   likeness that both of the words have same meaning of making decision
   without involvement of other's comment, but the root and origin of each
   word is different. Also it should be emphasized that consulting have not
   any conflict with independence of judge, but according to the advice of
   Sharia in verses and traditions of Islam, consultation is necessary for
   intellectual enhancement and development of people, especially the
   judge, who determines dignity, life, property and honor of people by his
   decision and his independence may convert into despotism and arrogance,
   without consulting. Constitution and normal laws have consider some
   solutions in various principles and articles to prevent despotism and to
   protect independence of judge in Iranian law that this issue can lead to
   a fair judicial system in Iran.},

Abstract = {In this paper I study strategic voting behavior in the Argentine Senate
   election for the City of Buenos Aires in 2013. I estimate and analyze
   the voter transition matrix between the primary and general elections
   using a Bayesian hierarchical model for ecological inference, utilizing
   a rich data set of ballot box data. The results show that strategic
   behavior is not widespread among the electorate in Buenos Aires. In
   particular, at least 75 \% of voters who had the opportunity to avoid
   vote wasting by behaving strategically did not. I also find high levels
   of vote wasting when analyzing other provinces during the same election
   cycle. These results suggest that these electorates might be composed of
   a mixture of voters with strategic and expressive motivations, where the
   expressive factions dominate.},

Abstract = {Until the 1970s neither Australian nor New Zealand political studies
   gave much attention to issues of diversity. This reflected both the
   makeup of the profession and the majoritarian nature of the political
   systems that was the major object of its attention. We argue that
   feminist organising on both sides of the Tasman had led to greater
   pluralism within the discipline. Using a comparative institutional
   approach, we trace the relationship between organising within the
   professional associations and the acceptance of greater diversity of
   approach and standpoint. We find, however, that while both countries'
   Associations have become somewhat more inclusive, a hierarchy of
   knowledge still exists that may prove an obstacle to feminist and
   Indigenous political scientists joining discipline-based departments and
   programmes.},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of evidence in the National Rifle
   Association and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence's firearm
   policy debate proximate to the December 14, 2012 Sandy Hook school
   shooting. The groups' member-directed policy narratives are
   operationalized with The Narrative Policy Framework (NPF), and new
   categories of evidence for the framework are developed. Analysis of
   2,535 paragraphs of member newsletters indicates the groups display
   different patterns of narrative components. Evidence is associated with
   narrative elements, and that narrative strategy has a significant, but
   mixed relationship with evidence. Most importantly, findings indicate
   that evidence frequently co-occurs with characters, leading us to
   conclude that evidence has a buttressing, or supportive, role in policy
   narrative closely associated with character attributions. The findings
   expand the understanding of evidence in contentious policy debates and
   offer a new component for NPF theory.},

Abstract = {The presence of women justices in the highest constitutional courts
   varies significantly across countries, yet there is little existing
   research that engages this substantial cross-national variation. Using
   an original data set of women's representation in the constitutional
   courts in fifty democracies combined with qualitative case studies, we
   assess the effect of the selection mechanism on this variation and find
   that the existence of a sheltered versus exposed selection mechanism is
   a critical determinant of women's presence. That is, when the selectors
   are sheltered from electoral accountability, they are less likely to
   select women as judges because they do not benefit from credit claiming.
   When the selectors are exposed and can claim credit, however, the unique
   traits and visibility of the highest court generate an incentive to
   appoint women.},

Abstract = {How can we retain the political category of citizenship, a concept
   instituted firmly at the heart of European politics since the French
   revolution while shedding its anti-progressive baggage of exclusivity?
   Cityzenship, we argue, is one such possibility. It is the right to the
   city, the urban commons, extended to all residents, regardless of
   origin, identity or legality, based on the principle of rightful
   presence,' as expressed in slogans like No One Is Illegal.' But
   membership in an urban commons, we believe, is more than
   non-discriminatory access to public services guaranteed under sanctuary
   city mandates. The urban commons include public infrastructures as well
   as public spaces, places of culture and education, cafes, the street and
   the street corner along with the capacity to make and unmake these
   spaces. Access to the urban commons is organized not only via rights and
   laws, but also through what Sara Ahmed calls atmospheric walls,' which
   although difficult to grasp are techniques for making spaces available
   to some more than to others.' Whiteness, masculinity, and class
   privilege are good examples of immaterial walls with material effects.
   With the help of affect theory, we discuss one instance of a cityzenship
   act - an off-space sculpture biennale held in a public park in Berlin -
   that breaks through the atmospheric walls of Western urbanism to offer,
   if only for a moment, an unmarked space for hospitality and solidarity.},

Abstract = {Slavery has long stood as a mirror image to the conception of a free
   person in republican theory. This essay contends that slavery deserves
   this central status in a theory of freedom, but a more thorough
   examination of slavery in theory and in practice will reveal additional
   insights about freedom previously unacknowledged by republicans. Slavery
   combines imperium (state domination) and dominium (private domination)
   in a way that both destroys freedom today and diminishes opportunities
   to achieve freedom tomorrow. Dominium and imperium working together are
   a greater affront to freedom than either working alone. However, an
   examination of slavery in practice, focusing on the experiences of
   American slaves, demonstrates that republicanisms' acknowledged
   strategies for freedom-seeking, acquiring insulation from domination
   through law and through norms, do not encompass the full range of
   options. Slaves also seek freedom through physical absence, economic
   activity, and culture. The account of slavery and freedom developed here
   suggests republican accounts of freedom should either give up their
   focus on thresholds of freedom, or consider the possibility of a plural
   conception of freedom that extends beyond just freedom as non-domination
   to include freedom as collective world-making, or both.},

Abstract = {This study offers a contextual explanation for discrepancies in women's
   rates of election between European national legislatures and the
   European Parliament (EP). Many European Union (EU) member states elect
   more women to the EP than to their national lower legislative houses.
   However, the margin of difference between women's presence in the EP and
   these national legislatures varies widely across member states. Using
   data for the EU-27, the study corroborates previous research in showing
   that institutional accounts offer limited leverage in explaining these
   varying gaps. Instead, it argues that the discrepancy between women's
   descriptive representation at national and European levels in each case
   is the result of contextual factors: voters, parties, and upwardly
   mobile politicians' valuation of the EP and EP service moderates the
   translation of the national pool of potential female candidates into EP
   officeholders.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {10},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In order to discourage people from breaching a contract and also to
   compensate the injured party for any losses, the law provides several
   remedies for breach of contract. One of these remedies is price
   reduction. In this study, we aims to compare the rules of Iranian law
   for price reduction remedy with those provided by Convention on
   Contracts for the International Sale Of Goods (CISG), and English law.
   English law has set detailed rules for rewarding damages for breach of
   contract, while Iranian law has generally-defined rules. The legislator
   has not determined not only the types of damage, but also the criteria
   for assessment of the damage. The remedies provided for price reduction
   in the CISG for breach of contract has been adapted to requirements of
   international trade, while In Iranian law there is no clear rules for
   this purpose, except three rules including a) Giving property to the
   buyer instead of money, (b) Compensation for loss of legitimate business
   involved to the buyer, and (c) Compensation for delayed payment to the
   buyer.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {1},

Abstract = {Using the case of China, this paper illustrates how single-party regimes
   utilize personnel power to manage the strained relationship between the
   central and subnational governments. After explaining the sources of
   central-local tension in the reform-period China, I present descriptive
   statistics to show how the center stepped up the rotation of provincial
   leaders as an instrument of centralized political control. Departing
   from existing studies that see the selective appointment of outsiders as
   a strategy to tightly control unruly provinces, I argue that the
   center's decisions are also conditioned by the imperative to grant
   provincial discretion essential for local economic development and by
   the bargaining element inherent in the decision-making process. The
   relevant hypotheses are tested on an original dataset of provincial
   leaders. Uncovering the logic of provincial leader rotation is not only
   important for understanding the evolving balance of power between
   China's center and provinces but also have profound policy implications.},

Abstract = {In most democracies, lawmakers tend to be vastly better off than the
   citizens who elect them. Is that because voters prefer more affluent
   politicians over leaders from working-class backgrounds? In this
   article, we report the results of candidate choice experiments embedded
   in surveys in Britain, the United States, and Argentina. Using conjoint
   designs, we asked voters in these different contexts to choose between
   two hypothetical candidates, randomly varying several of the candidates'
   personal characteristics, including whether they had worked in
   blue-collar or white-collar jobs. Contrary to the idea that voters
   prefer affluent politicians, the voters in our experiments viewed
   hypothetical candidates from the working class as equally qualified,
   more relatable, and just as likely to get their votes. Voters do not
   seem to be behind the shortage of working-class politicians. To the
   contrary, British, American, and Argentine voters seem perfectly willing
   to cast their ballots for working-class candidates.},

Abstract = {In political philosophy, economic theory and public discourse, there is
   a seemingly endless debate on what the essence of equality and freedom
   is and what relation between the two is essential to a good political
   order. Views range from the conviction that too much socio-economic
   equality jeopardises freedom to the position that a certain level of
   equality is necessary for the proper realisation of freedom. Building on
   these conflicting normative claims, we look at data from more than 50
   established and emerging democracies for a period of more than 20 years
   to investigate whether there is indeed a trade-off between freedom and
   equality or whether they are mutually reinforcing. In the process, we
   distinguish between two types of equality - political and
   socio-economic. Our findings suggest that there is a positive
   relationship between freedom and both types of equality - even if we
   control for the level of economic development.},

Volume = {14},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The aim of this review article is to explore some theoretical issues
   regarding the role played by elites in the change and continuity of a
   country's strategic culture. Despite the growing interest in the issue
   of strategic culture and change, current approaches still show some
   noteworthy shortcomings, particularly related to the role played by
   elites during the process. Based on Ann Swidler's works on culture, this
   article suggests that, contrary to the idea shared by many in
   strategic-cultural studies, who believe that strategic action is a
   conscious activity, a strategic act need not be entirely explicit and
   conscious.},

Abstract = {The study of European integration has traditionally focused on
   organisational growth: the deepening and widening of the European Union
   (EU). By contrast, this article analyses organisational differentiation,
   a process in which states refuse, or are being refused, full integration
   but find value in establishing in-between grades of membership. It
   describes how the EU's system of graded membership has developed, and it
   explains the positioning of states in this system. The core countries of
   the EU set a standard of good governance'. The closer European countries
   are to this standard, the closer their membership grade is to the core.
   Some countries fall short of this standard and are refused further
   integration by the core: their membership grade increases with better
   governance. Other countries refuse further integration because they
   outperform the standards of the core countries: their membership grade
   decreases as governance improves. These conjectures are corroborated in
   a panel analysis of European countries.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {399-416},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article claims that the political theory of Martinican-bom
   psychiatrist Frantz Fanon offers important resources for working through
   current problems in democratic theory. Political theorists investigating
   questions of revolution often place paradoxes of constituent and
   constituted power at the center of their research. Fanon, on the other
   hand, interrogates whether the proper object of revolution is the
   restoration of a prior form of life or the foundation of a new political
   world. Arguing against the tendency to bifurcate Fanon's work into
   discontinuous stages, I advance the claim that worldliness operates as
   the central concept that establishes the continuity of Fanon's oeuvre
   and that anchors his conception of colonization. This interpretive claim
   is crucial since Fanon's theorization of colonialism as worldlessness
   authorizes his ultimate rejection of negritude as a politics of
   restoration and his embrace of revolution as a foundational project of
   world building.},

Abstract = {The question of who should utilize the war power has been debated from
   the founding of the republic and the core issues while couched in
   different terms, and while war has become much more technologically
   advanced, remain the same. The fundamental question is one of what the
   President can do, and what Congress should do. I attempt to primarily
   address the question of what Congress should do with regard to the war
   powers rather than what the President can do because the scope of
   presidential war powers has been extensively researched and written
   about in the scholarly literature. Instead I address what from an
   institutional structure and policy perspective Congress ought to do with
   relation to the war powers and their execution.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this article is to examine how Habermas' account of
   the transformation of the public sphere is used in the study of
   political change in the Arab states of the Middle East. The study aims
   to demonstrate that while Habermas' motif may provide several
   constructive pathways forward for the study of transformation in this
   regional context, its numerous shortcomings leave it susceptible to
   conceptual overstretch. With the aim of showing this, the article is
   divided into three sections. The first section shows how the concept has
   been applied. The second engages critically with the prominent account
   of the Arab public sphere by reflecting on (1) its methodological
   assumptions, (2) its empirical claims and (3) its own political role.
   The third section explores the shortcomings of Habermas' account and how
   these present difficulties when making empirical claims about political
   action and transformation in the Arab states of the Middle East.},

Abstract = {In this article, I present results from a conditional logit model of
   vice presidential selection that predicts the selection of vice
   presidential candidates for both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in
   2016. Examining contested major party vice presidential nominations from
   1960 through 2012, the model finds media exposure, political experience,
   military service, age, and demographic (gender/racial/ethnic) diversity
   to be significant factors in the selection process. In the end, the
   model correctly predicts 15 of the 21 (71.\%) contested major party
   nominations during this period. For 2016 the model correctly and
   convincingly predicts Mike Pence as Donald Trump's selection, but
   incorrectly predicts Cory Booker as Hillary Clinton's pick. This reduces
   the overall percentage of correct predictions from 1960 to 2016 to
   69.6\% (16 of 23), but the approach taken here still represents a more
   appropriate way for social scientists to think about what factors drive
   vice presidential selection.},

Title = {Evaluating discourses of dissent: Questions of Moralitat and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {320-344},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article contends that the language of dissident movements should be
   analyzed through the lenses of two modes of moral reasoning in order to
   evaluate the potential success of those movements. These two modes are
   characterized as the differences between Moralitat and Sittlichkeit,
   Moralitat as a type of moral reasoning based in universal principles,
   Sittlichkeit based in local manners and customs. Both types of reasoning
   can be observed in most dissident movements, and this article argues
   that dissident movements will not be successful without a certain
   balance of both types of moral reasoning infused in the processes of
   engaging citizens, mobilizing action, justifying strategy, and ensuring
   representation. This article explores several historical discourses,
   including anti-communist dissidents in Eastern Europe, Gandhi, and Aung
   San Suu Kyi. These cases demonstrate both the differences in these two
   modes of moral reasoning, and the various successful ways they can be
   used together as discourses of dissent. Conclusions are drawn for the
   sake of application to global dissident movements more generally.},

Abstract = {The counter-mobilization hypothesis long ago fell on hard times. Despite
   its inherent plausibility, the notion has suffered from the lack of
   solid empirical testing and use in a wide variety of contexts.
   Nevertheless, counter-mobilization merits attention since it remains at
   the heart of pluralist theory. Without a clear response to competing
   interests, organizational representation of interests is a problematic
   concept. In this paper, we revisit the counter-mobilization hypothesis
   in the context of two groups often said to be key players in the culture
   wars - religious right and LGBT organizations - in a time period,
   2001-2010, where we expect there to be responses to the other's actions.
   Examining group counts in the states, we find evidence of
   counter-mobilization in the classic sense Truman intended. Moreover, we
   find a link between legislative polarization and the mutual presence of
   these groups that reinforces the relevance of this concept.},

Abstract = {Field experiments and regression discontinuity designs test whether
   voting is habit forming by examining whether a random shock to turnout
   in one election affects participation in subsequent elections. We
   contribute to this literature by offering a vast amount of new
   statistical evidence on the long-term consequences of random and
   quasi-random inducements to vote. The behavior of millions of voters
   confirms the persistence of voter turnout and calls attention to
   theoretically meaningful nuances in the development and expression of
   voting habits. We suggest that individuals become habituated to voting
   in particular types of elections. The degree of persistence appears to
   vary by electoral context and by the attributes of those who comply with
   an initial inducement to vote.},

Abstract = {This article explores the extent to which devolution within England can
   address the general malaise that is often described as the English
   Question'. It considers how far the devolution genie might be considered
   out of the lamp. It takes as its basis three broad arguments for
   devolutionan economic case, a case concerning public service reform and
   a democratic argument for the decentralisation of powerand for each of
   these three it explores the theoretical underpinnings for the argument,
   how things are currently playing out in the current political context
   and what we might expect to see in the future. The article concludes
   with some suggestions as to how debates about the English Question might
   play out in the years ahead.},

Abstract = {This article proposes that the role of cities in immigrant integration
   be reconsidered through the prism of urban citizenship, looking at how
   local policies co-regulate immigrants' status, rights and identity. It
   argues that urban citizenship connects two dominant understandings of
   citizenship, as city governments are under pressure to reconcile the
   normative perspective of formal membership of the state with the claims
   for rights expressed by excluded parts of the urban citizenry. A case
   study of an inclusive way of regulating citizenship in Barcelona
   illustrates how a citizenship perspective can cast light on the specific
   ways in which cities regulate immigrant citizenship in interaction with
   higher levels of government, and highlights some of the levers cities
   possess to modify the boundaries between inclusion and exclusion of
   immigrants locally.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, the trope that classical Muslim thinkers anticipated
   or influenced modern European thought has provided an easy endorsement
   of their contemporary relevance. This article studies how Arab editors
   and intellectuals, from 1882 to 1947, understood the twelfth-century
   Andalusian philosopher Ibn Tufayl, and Arabo-Islamic philosophy
   generally. This modern generation of Arab scholars also attached
   significance to classical Arabic texts as precursors to modern European
   thought. They invited readers to retrospectively identify with Ibn
   Tufayl and his treatise, Hayy ibn Yaqzan. Comparisons of Ibn Tufayl to
   European thinkers, and re-presentations of Hayy ibn Yaqzan as the
   precedent or genesis of European thought, facilitated these editors'
   global imaginaries, anti-colonial projects and political fantasies. This
   article tracks these projects and fantasies through the afterlife of
   Hayy ibn Yaqzan from early printings and generalist surveys to later
   editions and studies, as Ibn Tufayl's significance became sutured into
   his imagined importance for Europe, and for going beyond Europe.},

Abstract = {Estimating the ideological positions of political elites on the same
   scale as those of ordinary citizens has great potential to increase our
   understanding of voting behavior, representation, and other political
   phenomena. There has been limited attention, however, to the fundamental
   issues, both practical and conceptual, involved in conducting these
   joint scalings, or to the sensitivity of these estimates to modeling
   assumptions and data choices. I show that the standard strategy of
   estimating ideal point models using preference data on citizens and
   elites can suffer from potentially problematic pathologies. This article
   explores these issues and presents a technique that can be used to
   investigate the effects of modeling assumptions on resulting estimates
   and also to impose restrictions on the ideological dimension being
   estimated in a straightforward way.},

Abstract = {This paper takes the ratification of the U.N. Declaration on the Rights
   of Indigenous Peoples as its departure point. Reactions to the
   Declaration have thus far been mixed. According to advocates, these
   events signal a new consensus' that brings to an end the nation states'
   history of oppression of indigenous peoples'. According to critics,
   however, we have uncritically assumed an alliance between human rights
   and Aboriginal rights initiatives. This paper draws on these conflicting
   accounts, the theories of Ranciere, and a discussion of a current
   Canadian court case to offer an assessment of the political
   possibilities of the UN declaration. Overall we argue that the value of
   the Declaration rests on our interpretation of the political process by
   which these rights are enacted. The possibilities of rights-based
   politics are always contextually dependent. In some instances a human
   rights frame can represent radical repositionings and rearticulations
   while at the same time always risking the possibility of co-optation.
   The acts of politics, in particular acts of dissensus, are the key
   factors that will impact whether the Rights of Indigenous Peoples lead
   to transformation or to the reinforcement of the status quo.},

Abstract = {Domestic welfare reform and the management of international migration in
   Britain have been described by David Cameron as two sides of the same
   coin'. Heightened conditions and sanctions for the benefit-dependent
   domestic population, both in and out of work, are being harnessed as a
   means of promoting labour market change and reducing demand for
   low-skilled migrants - often EU workers, whose own access to benefit is
   being curtailed. Arguments about the post-national expansion of rights
   and associated cosmopolitan debate implicitly measure migrants rights
   against a normative model of citizenship as the yardstick of full social
   inclusion, but with little attention to how far citizenship itself falls
   short of this promise. Taking Britain as a case study, this paper
   considers how the concept of civic stratification can further advance
   analysis of the link between domestic welfare, migration and human
   rights in a context of intensifying controls for both migrants and
   citizens.},

Abstract = {Carl Schmitt's use of the friend-enemy distinction to define the
   political is intimately connected to the question of how to define who
   is a friend and who is an enemy. This article shows that Schmitt bases
   it on the perceived threat posed by another. Because the political is
   social, this means that the political decision is intimately connected
   to war, which leads Schmitt to offer a tripartite analysis of war
   grounded in different forms of enmity called classical, real or
   absolute. While a number of commentators have suggested that Schmitt's
   insistence that the political is the most intense antagonism should lead
   him to connect the political with absolute enmity, I show that the
   Schmittian political is and must be located against a real enemy. This
   not only clarifies an issue in Schmittian scholarship but also provides
   insights into how warring states should treat their enemy.},

Abstract = {When Theresa May became Prime Minister in July 2016, she joined a list
   of eleven previous UK takeover leaders in the past 100 years. While the
   popular image is of Prime Ministers arriving in power after a general
   election victory, more than half of the Prime Ministers who governed
   since 1916 have acceded as takeover leaders' through an internal party
   process. This article analyses how such takeover leaders perform,
   concluding that May is likely to face greater obstacles and enjoy fewer
   advantages than if she had been popularly elected. Takeover leaders have
   less time in power and less chance of winning subsequent elections, and
   are generally rated as worse-performing.},

   intellectuals, writers and artists wanted to contribute to the
   construction of a new Chile, not without it confront divergent views and
   proposals, promoted interesting debates, some more intense than others.
   Cormoran journal (1969-1970) is an essential instrument able to account
   for this discussion, since it served as a device intervention in
   political and cultural debates of important national and international
   leading figures. Its proposal, articulated by Enrique Lihn and German
   Marin were decisive in proposing a new relationship between art and
   politics and confronted, at the same time, some tendencies that expected
   to instrumentalize art from ideological proposals that they did not
   respond to the particular nature of the process developed during the

Abstract = {This article investigates the extent to which restrictive asylum and
   visa policies trigger an unintended behavioural response of potential
   and rejected asylum seekers. Based on our analysis of bilateral asylum
   and visa policies on migrant flows to 29 European states in the 2000s,
   we find evidence of a significant deflection into irregularity at work.
   Our estimates suggest that a 10\% increase in asylum rejections raises
   the number of irregular migrants by on average 2\% to 4\%, and
   similarly, a 10\% increase in short-stay visa rejections leads to a 4\%
   to 7\% increase in irregular border entries. We identify significant
   nuances in the impact of restrictive asylum and visa policies on the
   number of apprehensions at the border' versus on territory'.},

   Effects on Public Opinion},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {603-634},

Abstract = {Growing evidence shows that mass opinion varies by interview language,
   yet modest theory exists to explain this result. I propose a framework
   where language impacts survey response by making some political concepts
   more mentally accessible. I claim that concepts vary by how associated
   they are with certain languages, which means people are more likely to
   acquire a construct when it is tied to the tongue one speaks. Hence,
   recalling concepts from memory should be easier when the language a
   construct is linked to matches the tongue one interviews in, thereby
   intensifying people's opinions. I test my theory by manipulating the
   interview language in two U.S. surveys of English/Spanish bilingual
   Latino adults. I generally find that language influences the
   accessibility of concepts. For example, subjects report higher opinion
   levels for concepts that are tied more to their interview language, such
   as American identity among English interviewees. Subjects who interview
   in English are also less likely to refuse completing items measuring
   knowledge about U.S. politics, and more likely to answer them quickly.
   Items reflecting constructs that are highly labile (e.g. anti-Obama
   affect) or very crystallized (e.g., partisanship) do not display these
   patterns. I then rule out that language effects are mostly mediated by a
   heightened sense of anxiety, anger, pride or efficacy that emerges when
   bilingual subjects interview in one of their languages.},

Abstract = {The right to petition Parliament for redress of grievances spans many
   centuries. For much of this time, petitions served a key role in
   bringing the concerns of the people directly before Parliament for
   consideration and debate. In the Australian Parliament, petitioning has
   long been in decline. This led to reforms in 2008, including the
   establishment of a Petitions Committee and an expectation that Ministers
   will respond to petitions within 90 days. However, these have had
   limited success, and the process remains moribund. By contrast, other
   jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom, Scotland, Canada, and several
   Australian states and a territory have reformed their petitioning
   processes with greater success. This article examines the right to
   petition in Australia's federal Parliament with a view to determining
   whether reforms like those undertaken in other jurisdictions should be
   adopted.},

Abstract = {This article reports findings for a decomposition of the roll-call
   voting record of the U.S. Congress to determine the effect of the level
   of aggregation on the observed dimensionality of the policy space. In
   doing so, we identify some but certainly not all of the ways in which
   the aggregation of the voting record affects the observed dimensionality
   of the policy space. For the 1955 to 2008 period (84th-110th
   Congresses), we apply optimal classification (OC) to votes aggregated to
   the level of the individual bill and policy area to measure
   dimensionality. We examine the marginal proportional reduction in error
   (MPRE) across dimensions. Our results demonstrate that complexity in
   voting patterns of individual bill episodes is the norm, that
   aggregating to higher levels reduces the observed dimensionality, and
   that the liberal-conservative dimension appears more dominant in more
   highly aggregated analyses. These results call into question many of the
   conclusions from the theoretical and empirical literature on the U.S.
   Congress that uses a unidimensional model.},

Abstract = {Scholars often mention the centrality of parties for the democratic
   political system. Indeed political parties are indispensable
   institutions for the linkage between state and society, and should not
   remain absent in any comparative analysis of citizens' political
   attitudes. Yet, only rarely do scholars study how parties shape people's
   opinion about democracy. This article seeks to amend this lacuna and
   examine empirically how party level characteristics, specifically the
   nature of a party's candidate selection procedure, relate to the level
   of satisfaction with democracy among citizens. The authors constructed a
   cross-national dataset with data on the selection procedures of 130
   political parties in 28 country-sessions to examine whether citizens
   that vote for democratically organized parties are more satisfied with
   the way democracy works in their country. Additionally, this
   relationship is examined more closely in Israel and Belgium, two
   countries where candidate selection procedures show substantial
   variation and where politicians have made a strong claim for intraparty
   democratization. Both the cross-national as well as the country-specific
   analyses indicate that democratic candidate selection are indeed
   associated with greater satisfaction with democracy.},

Abstract = {The paper focusses on different processes to elaborate the public memory
   of political violence. This is done through the analysis of the street
   acts to commemorate two crimes of state terrorism which occurred during
   the dictatorship in Chile on the same day but at different places.
   Considering their elements of theatricality, the evocated memories and
   the means to exercise them in the present are approached as `` exform/
   s{''}, negotiating between exclusion and inclusion and dissidence and
   power. It will show how some are more underground and peripheral
   memories that are always in movement and somewhat uncomfortable, while
   others, symbolized in the memorials that evoke them, are more central
   and moderate.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how the degree of electoral competition
   affects parties' policy positions. It follows a growing body of research
   on party positioning in multiparty competition that regards elections as
   signals for parties that have to choose their positions and issue
   strategies. In this article we argue that previous elections provide
   information about the competitiveness of the upcoming election. The
   expected degree of electoral competition affects parties' future policy
   positions since with increasing competitiveness of an election, parties
   have higher incentives to move toward a vote-maximizing position.
   However, what constitutes a vote-maximizing strategy varies between
   parties. While large mainstream parties have an incentive to moderate
   their positions, small and niche parties choose more extreme positions
   to distinguish themselves from their mainstream competitors. Applying a
   novel measure of electoral competitiveness, we find that the degree of
   electoral competition indeed determines parties' policy shifts, but that
   this effect is moderated by party size.},

   whereas others worry about its detrimental effects on the legitimacy and
   quality of democratic decision making. So far, however, we lack
   systematic knowledge about the causal effect of compulsory voting on
   public policy. We argue that sanctioned compulsory voting mobilizes
   citizens at the bottom of the income distribution and that this
   translates into an increase in support for leftist policies. We
   empirically explore the effects of a sanctioned compulsory voting law on
   direct-democratic decision making in Switzerland. We find that
   compulsory voting significantly increases electoral support for leftist
   policy positions in referendums by up to 20 percentage points. We
   discuss the implications of these results for our understanding of the
   policy consequences of electoral institutions.},

Abstract = {Taking into account the European public sphere and the EU democratic
   deficit theories, and utilizing the European elections as an evidence,
   this article demonstrates that despite appearances the European public
   sphere is showing signs of Europeanization. In the last European
   electoral campaign, the electorate has gained a more direct voice in the
   selection of the President of the European Commission. For the first
   time, EP parties (or party groups) have selected candidates for this
   position, hence structuring the electoral campaign and giving visibility
   to such candidates, as suggested by the European Parliament resolution
   document issued on 4 July 2013. Through political communication
   approaches, the article explores the impact these guidelines had in the
   domestic electoral strategies. It does so drawing on a comparative
   perspective approach. Descriptive content analysis tools are utilized to
   examine the online edition of articles related to the European election
   campaign in five European newspapers: The Guardian, Le Monde, El Pais,
   La Stampa, and Suddeutche Zeitung. The research focused on (i) coverage
   of European campaign, (ii) main issues and topics of the electoral
   debate, (iii) visibility of European and national leaders, and (iv)
   impact of Eurosceptic perspective in the European election debate.
   Special attention is given to comparing the different journalistic
   approaches about gender balance and Euroscepticism. The results of this
   comparative analysis show a strengthening of the Europeanization of the
   public sphere.},

Abstract = {The state of the national economy often directs voting. But how do
   citizens form perceptions of a complex and abstract macroeconomy? This
   study examines whether exposure to unemployment in citizens' immediate
   residential surroundings shapes their perceptions of the national
   economy. Using novel data tapping the official proportion of unemployed
   people residing within radii between 80 and 2,500 meters of an
   individual's place of residence, we confront common methodological and
   theoretical challenges in existing work. Findings show that citizens do
   rely on cues from their residential microcontexts when forming
   perceptions of the national economy. Furthermore, we provide evidence
   that measures of unemployment in more aggregate contexts are not only
   poor reflections of what individuals are likely to experience in their
   immediate neighborhood but also seem to capture a different mechanism
   related to local media exposure.},

Abstract = {Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) constitutes a strategy commonly
   considered as a novelty regarding the attention of social problems. Very
   often it consists on corporate programs linked to a charitable and
   caring mission according to which enterprises should be able to act
   responsibly and committed with equality and social justice.
   Our proposal intends to settle some reflection points over the
   implications of corporate programs and their significance in late
   capitalism context, trying to problematize the discussion and attempting
   to construct critical-reflexive analysis as opposed to lobbyist and
   promotional propaganda from corporations and economic groups. On that
   intention, a brief review of the origin context of CSR in Argentina is
   presented, along with a case analysis regarding some characteristics
   from social programs of an important oil company settled in San Jorge
   Gulf, northern Santa Cruz.},

Abstract = {The focus of this article is an empirical examination of the effects of
   participatory online processes on acceptance of binding decisions,
   analysed in the context of a unique internet-mediated participation
   process at a German university. Based on platform log data, a survey of
   those affected and observations of the decision-making process it is
   shown that such procedures can enable effective, inclusive and
   transparent participation that results in a high quality of the final
   decision and which translates into high satisfaction amongst those
   affected. Achieving such results through traditional decision-making
   processes represents a significant challenge, still, also the online
   participation process is not fail-safe and only a minority of people
   participate. Despite the favourable context of the university the
   reported results are exemplary for the viability using of electronic
   means of participation within other organisations and contexts, such as
   political parties.},

Abstract = {This work analyzes the visions of democracy behind current assessments
   of the impact of ICT in our political systems, as well as in the
   institutional strategies proposed to improve its democratic character.
   The starting point, the popular discourse on e-democracy, presupposes
   that the development of online participatory processes in
   decision-making generates positive effects that automatically enhance
   the democratic quality of the system. But this approach provides us with
   a very limited perspective to think about ICT impact on our democracies.
   This evaluation should be undertaken from a more complex perspective;
   one that encompasses the multiple interactions between citizen
   participation processes, organizations and institutions, which is
   ultimately rooted in a specific model of democracy.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},

Abstract = {Research on party membership development commonly reports figures
   aggregated to the country level and/or using only a few time-points.
   While these choices may be appropriate for certain research questions,
   they nevertheless hide major differences between parties and conceal
   short-term fluctuations. Additionally, they are inappropriate for
   studying individual party trajectories. This is necessary, however, to
   better describe and ultimately explain the phenomenon of membership
   decline. The article analyses in total 1653 observations across 47
   parties in six western European countries between 1960 and 2010 to test
   hypotheses pertaining to individual party membership development. Using
   multilevel modelling and time-series analyses, the results show what
   aggregated data with few time-points cannot: membership decline is by
   far not a universal phenomenon. Additionally, membership decline appears
   to be part of a party's life-cycle. The more consolidated parties are,
   the fewer members they have. Few differences between party families are
   observable.},

Abstract = {Parties in advanced democracies take ideological positions as part of
   electoral competition, but some parties communicate their position more
   clearly than others. Existing research on democratic party competition
   has paid much attention to assessing partisan position taking in
   electoral manifestos, but it has largely overlooked how manifestos
   reflect the clarity of these positions. This article presents a scaling
   procedure that better reflects the data-generating process of party
   manifestos. This new estimator allows us to recover not only positional
   estimates, but also estimates for the ideological clarity or ambiguity
   of parties. The study validates its results using Monte Carlo tests, a
   manifesto-drafting simulation and a human coding exercise. Finally, the
   article applies the estimator to party manifestos in four multiparty
   democracies and demonstrates that ambiguity can enhance the appeal of
   parties with platforms that become more moderate, and lessen the appeal
   of parties with platforms that become more extreme.},

Abstract = {This article aims to contribute to explanations why ethnic minority
   women outnumber ethnic minority men in national parliaments of European
   immigration countries. Extending the intersectional lens it asks: which
   ethnic minority candidates are recruited and selected? Drawing on nine
   elections (1986-2012) in the Netherlands, I find that the success of
   ethnic minority women candidates is not related to a structural
   advantage: it changes over time and across and within groups. How gender
   and ethnicity intersect is informed by generation, (parental) birth
   country, a group's political starting position and how political parties
   in power incorporate gender or ethnic diversity.},

Volume = {28},

Abstract = {The international system has undergone profound changes. Many of those
   changes have visible non-state actors; which in the past were limited by
   the territorial control and flow control exercised by governments. In
   addition, in the case of Central America's political-military conflicts
   of the 1970s and 1980s the invisibility of those actors was increased.
   These changes created new spaces for action that were controlled by the
   government. On the other hand, the virtual development favored
   communication and increased media presence of non-state actors. This
   enabled different groups to have more influence on social, economic and
   political dynamics, affecting the security issue. Two key factors are
   added: an increase in violence and a loss of legitimacy and credibility
   of the authorities. Hence, increasingly areas where governance is
   weakened and even disappeared; which is then exploited by transnational
   organized crime groups. The development of these groups in Central
   America has allowed them to begin to assume social roles and even be
   legitimized in some communities and social sectors. That is why it is
   ``a non-political insurgency.{''}},

Abstract = {When studying sensitive issues, including corruption, prejudice, and
   sexual behavior, researchers have increasingly relied upon indirect
   questioning techniques to mitigate such known problems of direct survey
   questions as underreporting and nonresponse. However, there have been
   surprisingly few empirical validation studies of these indirect
   techniques because the information required to verify the resulting
   estimates is often difficult to access. This article reports findings
   from the first comprehensive validation study of indirect methods. We
   estimate whether people voted for an anti-abortion referendum held
   during the 2011 Mississippi General Election using direct questioning
   and three popular indirect methods: list experiment, endorsement
   experiment, and randomized response. We then validate these estimates
   against the official election outcome. While direct questioning leads to
   significant underestimation of sensitive votes against the referendum,
   indirect survey techniques yield estimates much closer to the actual
   vote count, with endorsement experiment and randomized response yielding
   the least bias.},

Abstract = {This study explores the effect of opportunistic election timing on the
   incumbent's electoral performance. While the existing literature leads
   to contradictory predictions about the ability of incumbent governments
   to benefit from strategically timed elections. We advance the
   theoretical debate by presenting the first cross-national comparative
   analysis of this question, drawing on an original data set of 318
   parliamentary elections in 27 Eastern and Western European countries. In
   order to identify the effect of opportunistic election calling, we rely
   on instrumental variable regression. The results demonstrate that
   opportunistic election calling generates a vote share bonus for the
   incumbent of about 5 percentage points and is thereby likely to affect
   electoral accountability.},

Abstract = {Based on different mechanisms of intervention deployed by the United
   Nations to intrastate conflicts - peace enforcement, peacemaking,
   peacekeeping and peacebuilding - it is possible to assume that, in
   specific cases, the role of the UN in the field contributed to
   perpetuate the levels of the violence. Such elucidative argument is
   justified in accordance to the analysis provided in both missions
   promoted by the institution in Sierra Leone - the United Nations
   Observer Mission in Sierra Leone, UNOMSIL (1998-1999); and the United
   Nations Mission in Sierra Leone, UNAMSIL (1999-2005). To discuss this
   argument and substantiate it, this research was divided into two parts:
   a critical analysis of both UNOMSIL and UNAMSIL. In each peacekeeping
   mission, the research focused on a chronological analysis based on the
   documents published by the both UN missions, such as reports, statements
   and letters regarding their security, humanitarian, political and
   economic issues. This division is necessary to understand not only the
   role of the UN in the field, but how this same international system can
   influence and also be considered responsible for maintaining and
   prolonging violent conflicts, while its mission is to promote a world
   peace.},

Abstract = {The topic of this paper is the analysis of conceptual narrative frames
   behind the news. The paper is theoretically based on the assumptions of
   text linguistics and cognitive linguistics with the reference to the
   achievement of the informative language function that should be
   predominant in media messages. Yet, journalists do not only mediate
   information or their own attitudes shaped by rational and analytical
   discourse, but mediate conceptual narrative frames as well. The paper
   presents the analysis of the usage of conceptual narrative frame of
   Bonnie and Clyde in Croatian and German newspapers when crimes with man
   and woman involved are reported. The given narrative's conceptual frame
   is analysed by using the qualitative content analysis of the randomly
   chosen newspaper article. The results indicate that all the texts which
   use the narrative of Bonnie and Clyde share only one common concept, and
   that is the participation of a man and a woman in a certain activity,
   independent of whether it is the text which contains the elements of
   historical facts of this narrative or the respective mythical narrative
   is deconstructed in the text.},

   requires a true refunding of institutions with an axis in the
   strengthening of personal and institutional capabilities, that meet the

Abstract = {This paper investigates the political and economic consequences of
   signing preferential trade agreements (PTAs) in authoritarian countries.
   Based on the Heckscher-Ohlin model of international trade and theories
   of inequality and regime transition, this paper argues that dictators
   sign PTAs as a means of consolidating their authoritarian rule.
   Specifically, PTAs help dictators reduce economic inequality by
   enriching poor laborers and thereby attenuating the threat of regime
   collapse. We support our theory with the data from seventy-odd
   authoritarian regimes from 1960 to 2006, and contribute to ongoing
   debates about the effects of both income inequality and economic
   globalization on autocratic resilience.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the role of religion in shaping the norms of
   citizenship from a cultural perspective for an East Asian country that
   exhibits fundamental differences in social contexts from Western
   advanced democracies. Using data drawn from the Taiwan Social Change
   Survey, we find that the Eastern religions of Buddhism, Taoism, and Folk
   Religions are important for explaining the formation of the concept of
   being a good citizen. This study further examines the relationships
   between citizenship norms and various conventional and unconventional
   types of political participation. The empirical results herein suggest
   that duty-based citizenship and engaged citizenship have significant
   differences in their effects on political participation.},

Abstract = {This paper revisits and rebuts the mainstream view that Brazil and
   Argentina were led to form the Southern Common Market to end more than a
   century of rivalry and competition. We find the elements characterizing
   an interstate rivalry diminishing in the nineteenth century through the
   promotion of peaceful settlements and strategic alliances while those
   that could prompt security concerns disappeared years before the
   Southern Common Market was formed. Except for diplomatic disputes over
   the distribution of shared water resources, a disagreement settled in
   1979, the decades preceding the Treaty of Asuncion were typified by
   security alliances, co-operation on economic complementarity and the
   promotion of bilateral institutions. We find little evidence for the
   implied security motivations being proposed in the literature. Rather,
   the establishment of the Southern Common Market was driven primarily by
   Argentina's and Brazil's desire to improve economic performance and
   advance political leverage through the promotion of a common stance in
   global affairs. This view challenges a common component in integration
   theory that, as applied to the European Union and elsewhere, asserts the
   privileged role of security concerns as prime driver for integration.
   This matters because there is a misapprehension that affects both the
   theory about integration as well as the formulation of policy
   prescriptions for South America.},

Abstract = {Crowdsourcing platforms offer a source of inexpensive data for research.
   At their fingertips, researchers have a round-the-clock workforce to
   fill out surveys, participate in experiments, and content-analyze text,
   among other tasks that generate social science data and help support
   research. Thanks to its low cost and convenience, crowdlabor has quickly
   and uncritically become a mainstream tool in our discipline. While such
   platforms have been evaluated on their aptness to generate high-quality
   data, surprisingly little has been said about the economic or political
   implications of their usage. Among other aspects, this article
   problematizes the ``state of legal exception{''} in which crowdlabor
   markets operate, their tendency to rely on a pool of economically
   vulnerable workers and the asymmetrical employment relations they
   create. Rather than offer an easy solution, I aim to open up a
   conversation about this unique set of challenges in order to acknowledge
   and address them.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {42},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Many countries include candidate photographs on ballots to facilitate
   autonomous, correct voting. However, the possible unintended
   consequences of these aspects of ballot design have not been
   sufficiently considered. We argue that photographs have the potential to
   increase ethnic voting, particularly by priming individuals to consider
   identity when making their electoral decisions. We conducted an
   experiment days prior to the 2011 Ugandan elections, in which subjects
   marked mock ballots including, or excluding, candidate photographs. We
   find that photographs increased ethnic voting, and our evidence
   indicates a priming effect, while ruling out learning as a likely
   alternate explanation. Subtle stimuli at the end of a campaign can
   affect ethnic voting in developing countries by altering identity
   salience. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {How do competing motivations influence the decisions of justices to
   author concurring opinions? Justices must balance their desire to shape
   the law and public policy toward their preferred position with the need
   for strong and stable coalitions. We construct a theoretical model of
   cooperative behavior that explicitly accounts for the competing
   individual- and group-level considerations of U.S. Supreme Court
   justices. Our theory identifies conditions specific to justices,
   coalitions, and cases that make the authoring of a separate opinion
   attractive to justices. We test these expectations using data from 40
   years of justice votes within some 4,500 cases. The results of our
   empirical analyses support our theoretical expectations and show that
   the choice of a justice in the initial majority to write separately is
   conditional on characteristics of the justices and the coalition. We
   also highlight the important implications of our findings for the study
   of judicial decision making and policymaking more generally.},

Abstract = {The idea of a European social citizenship is being developed by the EU
   to provide a minimum safety net. Questions about social citizenship are
   of fundamental importance in people's everyday lives. Social assistance
   is a central dimension when studying social citizenship. Before
   discussing in terms of a European social citizenship, we should
   determine whether we have a social citizenship at the national level. We
   therefore analyse the Swedish welfare state, one of the most mature
   welfare states in the EU. We conclude that the social right to social
   assistance is not part of modern citizenship, nor does it follow the
   formal principles of legal citizenship rights. The law presupposes a
   considerable amount of discretionary power at the local level when it
   comes to identifying the deserving poor; something that goes against the
   definition of a legal citizenship right. The right to social assistance
   is still a reproduction of the old poor-relief logic.},

Abstract = {The idea that parties make promises to voters during election campaigns
   and then attempt to fulfil those promises if elected to government is
   central to the theory and practice of democracy. This study examines how
   economic conditions affect the fulfilment of parties' election pledges
   in Ireland. We formulate and test propositions relating to two aspects
   of economic conditions that negatively affect the likelihood of pledge
   fulfilment. The first is that parties do not adjust pledges to
   prevailing economic conditions, and the second is that they do not
   accurately anticipate future economic conditions. We test these
   expectations with evidence on the fulfilment of 3681 pledges made by
   Irish parties in the period 1977-2011, which is one of the largest
   country-specific datasets on pledge fulfilment currently available.
   Given the considerable variation in economic conditions faced by Irish
   governments in this time period, these cases offer a particularly
   powerful test of the impact of economic conditions on pledge fulfilment.},

Abstract = {Since the 1990s, the United Nations has issued three agendas for global
   development cooperation. China's attitude toward these agendas has also
   undergone three phases: from cautious passivity at first, to active yet
   restrained involvement, and to fully embracing them. On January 1, 2016,
   the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) replaced the Millennium
   Development Goals (MDGs) as the primary goals for global development
   cooperation in the next 15 years. But there are substantial differences
   between the SDGs and MDGs, which will inevitably exert significant
   impacts on China's domestic development and its involvement in
   international cooperation. In its response, China should carefully
   examine its strengths and constraints before making a comprehensive
   national strategy for sustainable development, so as to advance domestic
   structural reforms and facilitate its commitment to the implementation
   of the SDGs. Meanwhile, China should actively push forward international
   collaboration in line with its opening-up policy, including South-South
   and South-North cooperation, as well as new mechanisms for trilateral
   cooperation. All these efforts will contribute to the establishment of
   new global partnerships for common development and the fulfillment of
   the SDGs.},

Abstract = {What explains regulators' preferences concerning the Single Supervisory
   Mechanism (SSM)? The paper answers this question by providing an
   alternative account of the creation of the SSM using an institutionalist
   perspective. It is argued that the creation of the SSM does not simply
   reflect the material interests of governments and domestic financial
   firms, but that regulators' positions were also significantly affected
   by the institutional environment in which they operated. Two
   characteristics of domestic supervisory governance are identified: the
   institutional responsibilities of banking regulators (microprudential
   and/or macroprudential) and the fragmentation of supervisory and
   monetary policies. The empirical analysis demonstrates the relevance of
   these factors for shaping regulators' preferences both within and across
   countries.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes various presuppositions behind the principle of
   absolute openness, which the philosophers of difference hold as the
   general principle of conflict resolution. Close attention is paid to the
   issue of identity. To prevent and resolve conflicts, these philosophers
   propose that others should be recognized by letting them be themselves.
   In agreement with works on conflict resolution by scholars from other
   disciplines such as cognitive and social psychology, sociology,
   anthropology and international relations, these philosophers see the
   process of identification as critical to understanding antagonism. They
   analyze this process using the logic of identity, which leads to the
   principle of absolute openness. It is shown through Paul Ricoeur's
   philosophy that the presuppositions underlying their understanding of
   the logic of identity are problematic. Ricoeur's idea of recognition
   through narrative is then explored and suggestions of how it may help
   resolve identity conflicts are discussed.},

Abstract = {Do citizens respond to policy-based information signals about government
   performance? Using multiple big datasetswhich link for the first time
   large-scale school administrative records and individual validated
   voting behaviorI show that citizens react to exogenous school failure
   signals provided by No Child Left Behind. These signals cause a
   noticeable increase in turnout in local school board elections and
   increase the competitiveness of these races. Additionally, I present
   evidence that school failure signals cause citizens to vote with their
   feet by exiting failing schools, suggesting that exit plays an
   underexplored role in democratic accountability. However, performance
   signals elicit a response unequally, with failure primarily mobilizing
   high propensity citizens and encouraging exit among those who are white,
   affluent, and more likely to vote. Hence, while performance signals spur
   a response, they do so only for a select few, leaving many others
   behind.},

Abstract = {Since devolution in 1999 and the establishment of a Scottish Government
   able to engage directly with the Scottish diaspora, a distinct diaspora
   strategy has been developed. It has tended to have an overly economic
   focus, in contrast with other countries like Ireland, which have adopted
   a more flexible approach, embracing cultural and heritage groups within
   the `ancestral diaspora'. Research within Scottish diaspora
   organisations suggests that Scotland would benefit from a strategy which
   acknowledged in a more direct way the contribution which heritage groups
   can make to the homeland, for example through conservation projects,
   ancestral tourism or simply by being ambassadors for the country. It
   would also benefit from being less centrally managed, thereby giving
   diaspora organisations a more participative role.},

Abstract = {Due in part to the influence of Michael McConnell, free exercise
   exemptionism is generally thought to be compatible with, if not dictated
   by, the founders' church-state political philosophy. This article
   rejects that position, arguing instead that America's constitutional
   tradition offers two distinct conceptions of religious liberty: the
   founders' natural rights free exercise and modern moral autonomy
   exemptionism. The article aims to distinguish these two approaches by
   clarifying how they are grounded upon divergent philosophical
   understandings of human freedom and by explaining how they advance
   different views of what religious liberty is, how it is threatened, and,
   accordingly, how it is best protected. The article also attempts to
   demonstrate how our modern approach expands the protection for religious
   liberty in some ways but limits it in others.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes recent developments in environmental activism, in
   particular movements focused on reconfiguring material flows. The desire
   for sustainability has spawned an interest in changing the material
   relationship between humans, other beings, and the non-human realm. No
   longer willing to take part in unsustainable practices and institutions,
   and not satisfied with purely individualistic and consumer responses, a
   growing focus of environmental movement groups is on restructuring
   everyday practices of circulation, for example, on sustainable food,
   renewable energy, and making. The shift to a more sustainable
   materialism is examined using three frameworks: a move beyond an
   individualist and value-focused notion of post-materialism, into a focus
   on collective practices and institutions for the provision of the basic
   needs of everyday life; Foucault's conceptions of governmentality and
   biopolitics, which articulate modes of power around the circulation of
   things, information, and individuals; and a new ethos around vibrant and
   sustainable materialism with an explicit recognition of human immersion
   in non-human natural systems. These frames allow us to see and interpret
   common themes across numerous, seemingly disparate initiatives focused
   on replacing unsustainable practices and forging alternative flows.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the various uses of Machiavelli's `figure and
   thought during the French Revolution, precisely from Directory to
   Consulate. In this period Machiavelli is not only a medium to
   delegitirnize political enemies because considered a symbol of a
   politics ruthless, but he is also a weapon used to try and save the
   Revolution. The apologists of 1789 principles, who consider Machiavelli
   a champion of political realism, use his name to oppose Jacobins and
   justify a strong executive power. In this context, an unknown author and
   playwright named Antoine Serieys publishes a strange dialogue between
   Machiavelli and Saint \_Justto legitimate the new bonapartist regime.},

Abstract = {This article examines the perceived discrimination of immigrants - a
   group for whom experiences of discrimination can be damaging for their
   long-term commitment and identification with the national core group.
   Taking its point of departure in the literature on national identity,
   the article argues that perceived discrimination should be strongest
   among immigrants in host national societies with an exclusive
   self-image. This hypothesis is examined by use of multilevel regressions
   on cross-national survey data from 18 Western European countries. It is
   found that where exclusive attitudes are widespread in the host
   population, the percentage of immigrants who perceive themselves to be
   part of a group discriminated against is significantly greater, all else
   being equal. In addition, there is a cross-level interaction effect of
   host national inclusivity and ethnic minority identity which suggests
   that individual-level determinants of perceived discrimination do not
   work' in the same way in normatively different contexts. In terms of the
   implications of these findings, the article points to the importance of
   contextualising individual-level accounts of perceived discrimination,
   with particular focus on the power of a society's attitudinal milieu to
   affect individual feelings of inclusion and exclusion.},

Abstract = {Most studies that aim to measure the influence of ideology on
   policymaking use the share of cabinet seats held by left versus right
   parties, manifesto data, expert judgments, or ideology scores as ways to
   operationalize ideology. These measures, however, cannot systematically
   capture the content of policy debates, ideological arguments used, or
   how these arguments change over time. Based on the concept of framing,
   this article presents an alternative methodology to study the role of
   ideology in welfare retrenchment proposals across countries and over
   time. By identifying recurring arguments, welfare frames' within which
   reform debates play out can be identified and compared over time.
   Applying this methodology to 578 New Zealand parliamentary budget debate
   speeches from 1970 to 2012, this article finds that there is more
   overlap in the welfare arguments used by both Labour and National in
   1984 and 2000 - years when the Labour Party was in government. Thus
   instead of welfare frames being defined strictly along ideological party
   lines as Labour versus National, they might also be defined in terms of
   a multi-party in power' frame versus a multi-party in opposition' frame.
   In other words, whichever party is in power may matter more to welfare
   retrenchment debates than traditional party positions.},

Abstract = {It is argued within this article that the marginalisation of climate
   change as a significant economic challenge within the current downturn
   has led to highly problematic strategies of economic recovery. This
   article aims to highlight the role of carbon-intensive and debt-fuelled
   consumerism in instigating both the financial and environmental
   degradation of recent times, and discusses the appropriate role of
   consumption within an economic recovery more sensitive to broader
   economic challenges. It is argued that when a more holistic
   understanding of the recent economic and environmental outcomes is
   adopted, it is clear that recent consumption patterns which have acted
   as a central driver of economic growth has produced deleterious
   financial and environmental consequences and should now be considered
   unsustainable. Yet these consumption patterns have been entrenched by
   the policies undertaken to revive growth. Only alternative models of
   consumption and growth constitute credible responses to the current
   crisis.},

Journal = {POLITICAL QUARTERLY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {87},
Number = {2},
Pages = {148-156},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Employment and labour market regulation initially appeared as one of the
   solid red lines in the UK's renegotiation of the country's place in the
   EU. The basic argument is that the UK's more deregulated labour market
   would sit uneasily in the more organised models, based on statutory
   instruments or collective bargaining, found on the continent. While
   there is a legitimate problem here, EU employment regulations appear
   manageable from the point of view of business, while unions see them as
   important tools for socially responsible economic restructuring. Most of
   UK employment case law is now deeply entangled with EU law; labour
   market regulations have, on the whole, become part of the way of doing
   business in the Single Market; and a simple cost-benefit analysis
   appears impossible because some costs are not quantifiable and the costs
   of others are reduced when taken as a bundle. Labour unions agree that
   transposition of European law needs to be done taking into account local
   sensitivities, while internationally oriented companies do not see EU
   regulations on the whole as detrimental to business. Importantly,
   though, the costs and benefits of EU employment regulations are not
   symmetrically distributed across different companies: large companies
   are better able to reap the rewards and accommodate the costs of
   operating in the Single Market than smaller companies.},

Abstract = {The present essay discusses how a society can make decisions on specific
   issues according to how flexible or rigid it is in accepting new ideas
   and trends. Then, it explains how Athenian society abandoned war in
   favor of a grand peace strategy during the second half of the 4th
   century BCE. To achieve this, two visionary Athenian policymakers,
   Eubulus and Lycurgus, introduced fiscal expansionary policy programs
   which proved beneficial for the majority of the citizens. Through
   expansionary public works programs, Athenian citizens were now able to
   make decisions based on rational choices, based on a wider economic
   prospective. They could now gain more during periods of peace (as
   traders, shipowners, ``industrialists{''} etc.), providing compensation
   to the poor.},

Abstract = {Although Cuba was, along with Bolivia, one of the two Latin American
   countries where Trotskyism had the largest presence in the labor
   movement, its history was long ignored, in part because of the growing
   adaptation of the leadership of the Cuban revolution to Stalinism, and
   partly due to the uncritical identification of the main international
   Trotskyist tendencies with Castroism, which made them overlook this
   adaptation. In this paper we will review the history of Cuban Trotskyism
   during the period under consideration, which opens with the triumph of
   the Cuban revolutionaries in 1959, and show the connection between the
   repression and eventual banning of the Cuban Trotskyists and the
   marginalization of the supporters of ``Che{''} Guevara in the state
   apparatus, as a result of the growing pressure of Stalinim, which was in
   turn a product of the alignment of Cuba with the Soviet Union in the
   context of the Cold War.},

Abstract = {Many formal models suggest that parties or candidates should locate at
   the electoral mean. Yet, there is no consistent evidence of such
   convergence across political systems. Schofield's (2007) Valence Theorem
   proves that when valence differences across parties are large, there is
   non-convergence to the mean. Convergence to the mean depends on the
   value of the convergence coefficient, c. When c is high there is
   significant centrifugal tendency acting on the parties and when c is low
   there is a significant centripetal tendency acting on the parties. In
   this paper we apply the stochastic valence model of elections in various
   countries under different political regimes and use the convergence
   coefficient of these elections to classify political systems. Our
   results show that the convergence coefficient varies across elections in
   a country, across countries using the same political system and across
   political regimes. For countries using proportional representation,
   namely Israel, Turkey and Poland, the centrifugal tendency is very high
   and parties move away from the mean. In the majoritarian polities of the
   United States and the UK, parties are located at the mean, as the
   centrifugal tendency is very low. In anocracies, the autocrat imposes
   limitations on how far from the origin the opposition parties can move
   but the equilibrium is fragile.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2016},

Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {In recent years, most armed conflicts have taken place in Muslim
   countries. Are Muslim countries more war-prone? Not necessarily, if we
   look at data for the whole period after World War II. But in the
   post-Cold War era, most wars are civil wars and Muslim countries have a
   disproportionate share of these. This is not mainly because conflicts
   among Muslims have increased, but because other conflicts have declined.
   Muslim countries are also overrepresented among countries with high
   levels of other forms of internal violence, including non-state
   conflict, one-sided violence, highly repressive human rights policies,
   and countries that practice capital punishment. They also have a higher
   than average participation in interstate conflicts. This is not a
   ``clash of civilizations{''}-most of the victims are Muslims. We list
   several hypotheses, apart from religion itself, for why this pattern has
   emerged, including colonial history, interventions from major powers,
   and economic and political development. Finally, on a more optimistic
   note, while many Muslims are exposed to violence, four of the five
   countries with the largest Muslim populations do not currently
   experience civil war.},

Abstract = {The UK has influenced some major EU policies, such as the creation of
   the single market and enlargement. But how influential are the UK
   government and British MEPs in the day-to-day EU legislative process? To
   answer this question, this article analyses recent data from the Council
   of the European Union and the European Parliament. The evidence is
   mixed. In the Council, in recent years the UK government has been
   outvoted more often than any other EU government, yet UK officials
   remain well connected `behind the scenes'. In the European Parliament,
   British MEPs are now more likely to be on the losing side than are the
   MEPs of any other member state, yet British MEPs still win key committee
   chairs and rapporteurships. The evidence suggests that if the UK votes
   to remain in the EU, Britain's political elites will need to re-engage
   with Brussels politics if the UK is to avoid becoming further
   marginalised from mainstream EU politics.},

Abstract = {It must be said that the family foundation is based on agreement,
   dedication, recognition of others rights and to respect them, observing
   the principle of sacrifice and patience in adversity. If a couple could
   not compromise with each other, regardless of its reason, this important
   foundation will be decomposed and agreement in family will strengthen
   the power of family. By provocation of differences, family will lose its
   function and disagreements will show up that may lead to divorce. In
   Iran legal system, the only foundation that can be said has similarities
   with physical separation, is the foundation of `Uddah' after revocable
   divorce. In the period of said `Uddah', the couple has some
   responsibilities of marriage, but there is no force of coexistence and
   coition. Special docility with meaning of responding to sexual needs of
   couple is not among the joint task.},

Abstract = {Although the literature on congressional change has established that the
   parties in Congress have become increasingly polarized over time, this
   conclusion is limited to the study of members' voting behavior. The
   analysis of another legislative practice, bill cosponsorship, reveals
   that while House members have associated increasingly with their
   same-party colleagues, senators continue to build bipartisan
   relationships through bill cosponsorship. I attribute this difference to
   the unique structure of each chamber and the influence that
   institutional rules and norms exert on legislators' decision-making
   processes. While House members rely on across-the-board party loyalty to
   get ahead, senators must maintain connections to colleagues from both
   parties in order to achieve their career goals.},

Abstract = {While behavioural economics has become part of mainstream economic
   theory, showing systematic deviations from the standard homo economicius
   in normal environments, there has been little exploration of behaviour
   in the extreme - such as conflict, disasters or war zones. This has led
   to the underdevelopment of behavioural theory examining the choices or
   motivations of individuals within these environments, resulting in
   sub-optimal models and policy. This work provides an entry point for the
   application of behavioural economics within conflict zones, specifically
   the examination of decision-making of non-combatant individuals.
   Additionally, it provides insight into the related disaster research
   field, detailing current studies, overview methodological approaches,
   approaches and limitations. Concluding with a general discussion and
   potential implications for policy.},

Abstract = {The UK's negotiating position in the area of `economic governance'
   started from the assumption that there is a deep dividing line between
   insiders and outsiders of the `euro zone'. To protect the outsiders, the
   UK government did not ask for a veto, but for a safeguard mechanism that
   can postpone a decision in the euro area. This is exactly what David
   Cameron achieved in the negotiations with Council President Tusk. This
   article explains why the UK demands were so modest. Key is the peculiar
   situation of the UK being the major financial centre for a currency
   union to which it does not belong. Hence, the UK taxpayer needs
   protection from the City, and EU membership has helped to provide this.
   There is not much else a UK government could ask for.},

Abstract = {The way in which free movement of people has become the central issue of
   the British government's renegotiation and referendum campaign on the
   UK's relationship with the European Union (EU) risks obfuscating at
   least three central issues: why immigrants are coming to the UK; what
   impact EU migrants are having on the UK; and what can be done to
   effectively regulate such inflows. It is, however, not just the
   eurosceptics and the British government, but also `in campaigners' and
   other EU member states, who risk perpetuating a number of widely held
   misconceptions about free movement and immigration for political
   reasons. Buying into such myths risks undermining attempts to have a
   more honest and more evidence-based debate about immigration and migrant
   integration.},

Title = {Punishing personal and electoral corruption: Experimental evidence from
   India},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {A growing literature examines the effect of corruption on political
   behavior. However, little attention has been paid so far to the fact
   that politicians engage in it for various reasons and with different
   welfare consequences. In this article, I argue that voters judge corrupt
   politicians differently depending on what the money is used for. I show
   results from a survey experiment in India in which respondents heard
   about a politician who accepted money for a political favor. One
   treatment group was told that the politician used the money to
   personally enrich himself (personal corruption), while the other group
   was informed that he used it to buy votes (electoral corruption).
   Respondents who received the vote buying treatment were clearly and
   consistently less likely to agree with a series of potential
   punishments. This suggests that the overall welfare consequences of
   corrupt exchanges are an important factor when voters decide how to
   judge offending politicians.},

Abstract = {One of the most important developments affecting electoral competition
   in the United States has been the increasingly partisan behavior of the
   American electorate. Yet more voters than ever claim to be independents.
   We argue that the explanation for these seemingly contradictory trends
   is the rise of negative partisanship. Using data from the American
   National Election Studies, we show that as partisan identities have
   become more closely aligned with social, cultural and ideological
   divisions in American society, party supporters including leaning
   independents have developed increasingly negative feelings about the
   opposing party and its candidates. This has led to dramatic increases in
   party loyalty and straight-ticket voting, a steep decline in the
   advantage of incumbency and growing consistency between the results of
   presidential elections and the results of House, Senate and even state
   legislative elections. The rise of negative partisanship has had
   profound consequences for electoral competition, democratic
   representation and governance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The current research has the purpose of analyzing Turkey's approach
   toward Latin America and the Caribbean region through the prism of soft
   power theory, and through a specific case study, i.e. Turkey-Cuba
   relations. The working assumption is that Turkey has been able to
   increase its presence and influence in the region, thanks to a
   particular soft power-oriented approach known as multi-dimensional
   policy, which reflects both new behavior and new agents. An analysis of
   Turkey-Cuba relations will not only help to improve the literature about
   Turkey's foreign policy on a subject which has not yet been adequately
   examined, but will also underline features and peculiarities of Turkey's
   soft power, such as the emerging ``Mosque Diplomacy.{''}.},

Abstract = {Why do national organisations proliferate in practically all areas of
   policymaking and organisational life, and why are they involved in
   supranational networks and organisations? The article approaches this
   mystery by exploring how organisations are built and used as authorities
   in domestic policymaking. The empirical focus is on the establishment of
   the institution of children's ombudsman and its uses in influencing
   Finnish child policy. The theory developed in the article suggests that
   organisations are accumulations of authority, here termed epistemic
   capital, which is the primary reason that they are established and
   sustained. Once these are institutionalised, various actors can use the
   authority of organisations to legitimate their policy objectives. The
   case of independent children's rights institutions shows how this
   mechanism operates in child policy. The Finnish office of the ombudsman
   for children has worked actively to become an established ontological
   and moral authority in child policy, and it has also attempted to
   utilise the mandate and authority of the United Nations and the
   Convention on the Rights of the Child to pressure the state into more
   child-friendly policy decisions.},

Abstract = {We still do not fully understand why attitudes toward the European Union
   differ among citizens. In this study, we turn to the Big Five
   personality traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion,
   Agreeableness and Neuroticism as antecedents of European Union
   attitudes. In a national survey, we focus on attitudes toward widening
   and deepening of the European Union, trust in European Union
   institutions, identification with the European Union and negative affect
   experienced toward the European Union. We theorize that the Big Five
   traits are heterogeneously associated with the different European Union
   attitudes. We confirm that the Big Five traits are indeed associated
   with some but not all European Union attitudes. Accordingly, personality
   is expected to shape how citizens' respond to changes in the
   institutional set-up of the European Union.},

Abstract = {Since 9/11, several states have initiated military conflicts in the name
   of fighting terrorism. However, studies indicate that the costs of
   terrorism are insignificant compared to the damage created by war. This
   raises the question: Why do states initiate costly wars when the risk
   posed by terrorism appears marginal? This study presents two
   explanations. First, we argue that while terrorists frequently fail to
   achieve their strategic objectives, terrorists can accomplish tactical
   objectives and may transition to insurgencies by seizing control of
   pockets of territory. States may respond by initiating preventive wars
   to stop terrorists from consolidating control over their strategically
   valuable territories (e.g., resource-rich areas). Second, rival states
   may opportunistically exploit terrorist violence by declaring that the
   government is a weak state. This allows rivals to seize portions of the
   government's territory under the cover of fighting terror. We test these
   hypotheses using post-Cold War African dyads from 1990 to 2006.},

Abstract = {Cross-border welfare rights for citizens of European Union member states
   are intensely contested, yet there is limited research into voter
   opposition to such rights, sometimes denoted welfare chauvinism'. We
   highlight an overlooked aspect in scholarly work: the role of
   stereotypes about beneficiaries of cross-border welfare. We present
   results from an original large-scale survey experiment (N=2525) among
   Swedish voters, randomizing exposure to cues about recipients' country
   of origin and family size. Consistent with a model emphasizing the role
   of stereotypes, respondents react to cues about recipient identity.
   These effects are strongest among respondents high in ethnic prejudice
   and economic conservatism. The findings imply that stereotypes about who
   benefits from cross-border welfare rights condition public support for
   those rights.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the relationship between latent predispositions
   and political campaign communication. We propose that political values
   are decisive in a voter's calculation of which parties she may consider
   voting for, constituting his or her party set. Furthermore, we argue
   that the theory of issue ownership contributes to explaining the choice
   of party within the party set. In addition to investigating salient
   single issue ownership, we relate issue ownership to parties presenting
   voters with comprehensive policy packages and study the effect of
   cumulative issue ownership, that is, issue ownership in several policy
   areas. We test the hypotheses using data from the Norwegian Election
   Study of 2009. Our findings support our expectations: stable elements
   affect which parties are included in the party set, and issue ownership
   affect the choice between the parties within the set. However, political
   values also affect the choice between parties in the set. Finally, our
   data show that cumulative issue ownership has a greater effect than
   issue ownership of one particularly salient issue. The final section of
   the article discusses the implications for the theory of issue ownership
   in general and the model presented in this article in particular.},

Abstract = {In this research I examine the effect of the military on Syrian politics
   and the uprising of 2011. I consider the military's will to protect the
   Assad regime in the context of the ``army-party symbiosis{''} that has
   been composed in the historical process. I rename this symbiosis as a
   power bloc because of Assad's designation of the military to be used not
   only against external threats but also to protect his regime against the
   Syrian opposition. The political and economic reforms implemented by
   Bashar Al-Assad did not affect this power structure, which is the source
   of the military's will to suppress the uprisings of 2011. The armed
   organizations which emerged during the civil war, whether they are named
   as terror organizations or not, will be a challenging factor not only in
   the resolution of the Syrian crisis but also for the reorganization of
   the Syrian army.},

Title = {Partisan Cohorts, Polarization, and the Gingrich Senators},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},
Pages = {296-325},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Although the Gingrich Senators thesis solves a vexing issue, a broader
   theoretical question remains: Why does the House have a polarizing
   effect on its members that seems to persist even after a representative
   wins election to the Senate? In the first section, I propose that
   lawmakers learn partisan norms in the House and simply continue those
   extreme behavioral routines after switching chambers. And in the second
   part, I test possible sources of this effect. Results show that senators
   who came from the House display greater ideological extremism if they
   (a) served in the House within an extreme partisan cohort and (b) won
   election to the Senate after representing a partisan district. In
   contrast, serving within a polarized chamber and during periods of
   divided party control have no long-term effects on a senator's
   ideological extremism. Robustness checks reveal that the effect of a
   senator's House partisan cohort persists even when we control for
   his/her ideological extremism before winning election to the House as
   well as selection effects caused by electoral dynamics. Additional
   analyses show that the partisan cohort effect is the largest determinant
   of partisan learning, exists throughout most of congressional history,
   is strongest when the parties are homogeneous, and persists for much of
   a senator's career. As a whole, the results show that the House's effect
   on Senate polarization is not due to a single person or a function of
   chamber polarization. Rather, the Housification of the Senate is a
   consequence of cohort socializing effects and is observable throughout
   congressional history.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the socio- political profile and the governmental
   career of the junior ministers who held office in Portugal between 1976
   and 2011, putting the focus on the differentiation between individuals
   with and without prior political experience. Contrary to what is
   indicated in the literature, the results of this investigation reveal
   that most of these individuals are politically inexperienced and have a
   short and occasional governmental career. There are, however, important
   differences if we consider their political background, which confirms
   the relevance of the distinction between political and non-political
   junior ministers.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship offers compelling evidence on the negative impact of
   income inequality on satisfaction with democracy. This article studies
   whether the impact of inequality on evaluations of the democratic
   process varies for different groups in the population and over time. The
   central argument is that the impact of inequality is conditional on
   individual characteristics and experience. Young adults and members of
   the 1990s generation should be more sensitive to income inequality
   compared to older generations. To answer this question, we use
   cumulative six-wave data from the European Social Survey (2002-2012),
   matched with income inequality estimates from the Standardized World
   Income Inequality Dataset (2014). Results from a series of mixed-effects
   models reveal that higher levels of income inequality are associated
   with lower levels of satisfaction with democracy, but with a
   disproportionate negative influence on young adults compared to older
   citizens and also on the 1990s cohort compared to all other cohorts.},

Abstract = {To forecast the May 7, 2015 British General Election, we develop party
   popularity models based on Continuous Monitoring Survey (CMS) data from
   April 2004 to February 2015. Our models predict party vote shares three
   months prior to the election, using previous support levels, national
   economic evaluations, macro-partisanship and political measures. Our
   Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) methodology allows us to predict
   support for the Tories, Labour, Liberal Democrats and ``other{''}
   parties, separately, yet simultaneously, by constraining total support
   for all parties to 100\%. Our model, estimated with data from February
   2015, predicts that Labour will win the highest vote share in Great
   Britain, but that no party will win a majority of seats in parliament.

Abstract = {The turmoil that characterized the ruins of the century-old colonial
   Sykes-Picot order undermined the security environment for Ankara and
   Jerusalem alike. The geopolitical great power conflict will unfold
   turbulently in what was Syria and Iraq. Concurrently, cyber technology
   provides actors with new tools to achieve the desired effect and gain
   power. Israel has allegedly utilized original cyber power for strategic
   purposes in Syria and Iran. Russia, now entrenched in Syria, has created
   cyber power and has been effectively using it for a long time. In this
   article, the author argues that in order to remain a pivotal regional
   power, Turkey must drastically boost its sovereign cyber security. Given
   Turkey's deteriorating security environment, its strained bilateral
   relations with Israel and the US, and especially the escalation risk in
   tensions with Russia, Turkey will be hard pressed to drastically bolster
   its sovereign national cyber security on its own.},

Abstract = {The article represents the first systematic study of the reactions of
   political parties and the media as well as national and transnational
   civil society actors to the rise and inclusion in government in 2000 of
   the Austrian right-wing populist Freedom Party (FPo). Specifically, it
   investigates the effectiveness of strategies aimed at ostracizing
   populist actors versus defanging them through incorporation in public
   office. The article finds that turning the FPo into a pariah has not
   been effective in moderating the party or curbing its success.
   Incorporation in public office has been more effective, however, leading
   to the near collapse of the FPo and the split of the party. Yet, the
   cause for such an outcome may be found less in the strategy itself by
   imposing some intrinsic mechanism of moderation but rather in the
   incompetence and inexperience of populist party politicians unfamiliar
   with public office. Exclusionary strategies have also the undesirable
   effect of playing into the narrative of populist actors of being
   persecuted by the political establishment thereby offering them another
   means of mobilization. The article concludes that the revival of the FPo
   shows that no strategy can yield lasting success unless the demand-side
   causes underlying radical right-wing populism are addressed.},

Abstract = {This article offers an institutional explanation for the strikingly
   similar configuration of macroeconomic policy responses of advanced
   capitalist economies to the Great Recession. In recent decades, advanced
   economies have adopted a common structure of macroeconomic governance,
   which organizes macroeconomic policymaking around monetary policy
   operated by autonomous central banks and sets limits on politicians'
   policymaking discretion. During the Great Recession, this macroeconomic
   governance allowed central banks to enact unconstrained monetary
   expansion and governments to enact constrained fiscal expansion. The
   argument here is empirically substantiated by focusing at how
   macroeconomic policies in response to the Great Recession have evolved
   in Australia and Sweden, as well as by looking at parallel developments
   in the United Kingdom and the United States.},

Abstract = {Rural mainstreaming reviews policies to ensure people in all parts of a
   country receive comparable policy treatment. Rural proofing is the
   method used to ensure that rural mainstreaming is correctly carried out.
   This article offers a critical analysis of rural proofing. It examines
   English policies in this area and questions how applicable similar
   policies might be in an Australian context. We argue that while rural
   proofing intuitively feels like a positive development for a country
   rich in rural and remote areas, there are many complexities to importing
   a policy designed for a different social and spatial context. In
   Australia, this is almost certain to render attempts to implement the
   English rural proofing concept futile. Indeed, we contend that this
   concept can potentially lead to the marginalization of rural issues. We
   conclude by identifying some of the complex questions our argument
   identifies which should be addressed by Australian policy makers before
   designing specific policies.},

Abstract = {Similarities between the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front
   (ZANU-PF) and the African National Congress of South Africa pose the
   question whether South Africa faces a `Zimbabwean future'. In seeking to
   address this question, authors have compared the two parties in terms of
   `party dominance' and `electoral authoritarianism'. However, this paper
   proposes that despite the utility of such approaches, greater
   explanatory power is provided by the notion of `competitive
   authoritarianism' as developed by Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way.
   Application of their approach suggests that although the ANC's
   organisational ways and character emulate those of ZANU-PF, it is
   constrained as a ruling party by South Africa's stronger linkage to the
   West and remaining Western leverage over South Africa in spite of the
   rising influence of Russia and China.},

Abstract = {As Northern Ireland seeks ways to deal with the memory of the conflict,
   artefacts associated with the period that can be ascribed with an aura
   of historical authenticity are placed on public display as yet another
   means to employ the past. These artefacts become another element of the
   media machine of commemorative projects, touchstones to the past, and
   agents in contemporary political activities. This paper considers the
   methods employed by In Their Footsteps, an artefact-based initiative
   organised by groups and families seeking justice for conflict related
   losses. It takes the format of a memorial exhibition with objects, text
   and imagery intended to garner support for the political ambitions of
   their justice campaign. By critically investigating the methods employed
   by this initiative, insights are given to the use, meaning, symbolism
   and contribution of artefact display to the social processes of
   commemoration.},

Abstract = {Today Russia is often being criticized for new legislative initiatives
   in the field of Internet communications. Laws in this area are often
   negatively perceived by online community and critics and are the cause
   of misunderstanding between the government and society. Russia, however,
   is not the only country that has attempted to regulate its online
   sphere. World practice shows that many states are seeking to regulate
   virtual life of society. Such initiatives are indeed useful and
   necessary. The world today is shifting to a new reality where virtual
   space will play an increasingly important role, but it will raise many
   dangers and challenges that are needed to be solved at the legislative
   level. The regulation of the Internet is at the junction of legislation
   and politics as it is directly concerns the interests of society, the
   rights and freedoms of the individual, so it is impossible to resolve
   these problems in isolation from political science and sociology. This
   article contains a brief review of the legislation in the field of
   Russian Internet and in some countries, and represents an attempt to
   determine a necessary level of government intervention in the Internet
   and the level of its regulation.},

Abstract = {Political marketing needs to consider specific factors when dealing with
   a democratization process such in the Romanian and Eastern European
   case. The emergence of democratic institutions and practices creates an
   amalgamated and diverse context for political marketing strategies.
   Different historical stages of communication, marketing, and elections
   practice have produced after 1989 a landscape where it is easy to
   confuse political marketing orientations of political parties. An
   investigation is carried on how political organizations have addressed
   marketing instruments and how the need to survive and achieve power has
   altered the meaning of what we call political marketing exchange.},

Title = {When trust matters-a multilevel analysis of the effect of generalized
   trust on political participation in 25 European democracies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Pages = {178-197},
Abstract = {Generalized social trust has been argued to have positive effects for
   both individuals and society, but despite solid theoretical arguments in
   favour of different contextual effects, the empirical evidence remains
   scant. We here examine whether and how the effect of generalized trust
   on the propensity to become politically active is moderated by the level
   of generalized trust in society. We inspect two different causal
   mechanisms: The rainmaker effect, which entails that the effect of
   generalized trust is weaker at the individual level when there is a high
   level of generalized trust in society; and the sunmaker effect, which
   entails that the effect of generalized trust is strengthened by a high
   level of generalized trust in society. We examine the links for three
   forms of political participation: voting, institutionalized
   participation, and non-institutionalized participation. The data come
   from the fourth round of the European Social Survey from 2008
   {[}European Social Survey. (2008). Data file edition 4.0. Norwegian
   Social Science Data Services, Norway-Data Archive and distributor of ESS
   data], and we include 47,489 respondents in 25 democratic countries. The
   results from a series of multilevel logistic regressions suggest that
   the effect of generalized trust varies depending on the level of
   generalized trust in the surrounding community but the causal mechanisms
   differ for different kinds of political participation.},

Abstract = {In this article, we analyze the impact that the evolution of the middle
   classes has had on political representation in Chile. Based on a
   description of the transformations of Chilean social structure in recent
   decades, we review the conceptual frameworks available on the subject,
   from modernization theories and the rise of new masses - particularly
   the one that ``emerged{''} from poverty - to the forming of new critical
   citizens. We state that the heterogeneity of Chilean middle classes has
   challenged the discredited representation system. We observe more
   efficient representation channels developing for medium-high-income,
   educated, and consolidated sectors in contrast to new social policy
   demands from emerging and vulnerable sectors, focusing more on
   consolidating their economic status than on improving representation
   channels.},

Year = {2016},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-22},
Abstract = {This article examines transitions between presidential, parliamentary
   and semi-presidential systems in democracies. Using two major datasets,
   it identifies nine such transitions in eight different countries: Brazil
   1961, France 1962, Sri Lanka 1977, Slovakia 1999, Moldova 2000, Turkey
   2007, Kenya 2008, Kenya 2010, and the Czech Republic 2012. Findings from
   a close examination of these cases include the following: most
   transitions involve the semi-presidential regime type; serious crises
   precede the transitions in nearly all the cases and change is often used
   as a means of solving these crises; electoral volatility and turnover in
   government precede most transitions; change serves different functions
   in different political contexts, ranging from facilitating acceptance of
   anti-establishment executives to implementing power-sharing deals; and
   once achieved, regime change becomes an almost permanent fixture on the
   political agenda, with debates escalating rather than dying down.},

   from most of English-writing researchers on how they understand Central
   European political regimes. Whereas the latter group of political
   analysts usually refers to these regimes as semi-presidential, their
   counterparts in Central Europe generally claim that these regimes are
   parliamentary. Our article is an analysis of the two contradicting
   approaches on the nature of democratic regimes in Central Europe. This
   examination is carried out in the context of the Czech Republic, Poland
   and Slovakia. Major changes in the position of president took place in
   these countries. This is why the question of the nature of their
   political regimes is a frequent subject of both discussions and
   analyses. This difference is explained by different theoretical as well
   as methodological approaches.},

Abstract = {Euroscepticism became one of the prominent themes of political actors'
   research in the last decades based on the strengthening position of
   Eurosceptic parties within the EU and national political arenas. Such
   development was further strengthened by the EU-enlargement in 1995, 2004
   and 2007 and also with the recent development (global and European
   financial crisis, migration crisis). The aim of the article is to
   analyse the development and programme standpoint of the Czech
   liberal-conservative political stream. We use the concept of
   Euroscepticism, presented in the works of Szczerbiak and Taggart, and
   Kopeck and Mudde as the theoretical framework, and develop this concept
   based on Petr Kaniok's new typology. In the first part of our analysis
   we discuss the development of the Eurosceptic faction within the Civic
   Democratic Party (ODS), and changes in the party's position towards the
   EU. We also understand the Eurosceptic faction within the ODS, with
   Veclav Klaus as its supporter and think tanks related to him, as the
   incubator for the establishment of the Party of Free Citizens (SSO) in
   2009. In the second part of the analysis we focus on the party's
   programme and its position within the European political arena. Our
   analysis also includes a discussion about most visible proclamations of
   the party leaders, against the EU and the European integration process.
   Our analysis is framed with the general debate about the
   liberal-conservative party family and its development at the EU level.},

Abstract = {25 years after his death, Louis Althusser's writings continue to stir up
   controversy. This article analyzes an issue that aroused criticism
   during the 1960s, an extremely polemical moment within his intellectual
   production: the relation between science and ideology. Is it plain
   opposition? Are science and ideology two clearly differentiated
   structures? Does science mean the end of ideology? Does science
   represent the truth and ideology a mere error? The article thoroughly
   studies Althusser's publications during the period of the 1960s in order
   to shed light on his thinking regarding this topic.},

   Bastos},
Journal = {REVISTA ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {63-83},
Abstract = {This article aims to analyze the political and intellectual trajectory
   of brazilian deputy Aureliano Candido Tavares Bastos (1839-1875) from a
   study that focus on his biography and discusses his major works. The
   choice of this author is due to the fact that he occupied a prominent
   position in the history of Brazilian Political and Social Thought as an
   interpreter of his time. The political program of Tavares Bastos sought
   to join an ethic of conviction and an ethic of responsibility, combining
   in a practical plan and order a set of principles that guided his
   political praxis. To understand the work of Tavares Bastos, we need to
   think into a political realism field because the society and the
   Brazilian State were taken as objects of analysis and political
   intervention. According to Tavares Bastos, the source of the national
   problems had a political nature and referred to the political and
   administrative centralization. His political ideas aimed to implement
   some deeply reforms in the imperial state combining with the liberal
   platform derived from his american psyche with an appropriate proposal
   to the national reality. In general, we can say that the ``social
   problem{''} figured as one of the central ideas that guided the
   political thought of Tavares Bastos that since the academic writings
   showed his preoccupation with slavery and the social problems of
   Brazilian society. We try to think Tavares Bastos as the political and
   ideological mentor of the generation of 1870 to bring to the public
   debate a number of issues that influenced the members of this
   generation, such as the abolition of slavery, immigration, political
   administrative decentralization, federalism, land reform, public
   education and the creation of labor laws. In the first part of the
   article, we discuss the political biography of Tavares Bastos
   emphasizing his history as a public man, whether in politics, as in the
   intellectual area. Then we draw a general overview about Tavares Bastos,
   his main ideas and works.},

   conflicts along the Ethiopia-Kenya border},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {57-83},
Abstract = {In this paper, the interplay between various competing orders among
   three ethnic groups on the margins of the Ethiopian state that have
   overlapping presence along the Ethiopia-Kenya border is analysed. The
   paper probes into complex and intertwined causes of inter-group
   conflicts by going beyond the commonly asserted resource scarcity and
   ethnicity assumptions, arguing that any attempt to establish sustainable
   peace becomes futile without assessing inter-group conflict within a
   context including historical, environmental, political, economic,
   cultural and institutional dimensions. The paper also conceptualises the
   state as an active player in inter-group relations, as it plays a
   fundamental role in instigating and/or resolving conflicts based on its
   political, economic and strategic interests. Taking the case of
   inter-group conflicts among three groups inhabiting border areas along
   southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya, and by employing actor-oriented
   perspectives, the paper argues that the involvement of competing
   interests and claims on the side of the Ethiopian state, local
   communities and individuals, both in the instigation of conflicts and
   peacebuilding processes further complicates the situation. It concludes
   that inter-group conflict and attempts at peacebuilding in the region
   are to a large extent influenced by national political dynamics, changes
   in traditional institutions and cross-border relations.},

Abstract = {This article provides a sociopolitical critique of contemporary Mental
   Health First Aid (MHFA) discourses. The concept of psychocentrism,
   adopted as an analytical tool, critiques the problematic nature of MHFA
   premises and practices that automate, expedite, enforce, and normalize
   the global movement to psychiatrize human distress. Contesting MHFA's
   international image as a benevolent, individual crisis intervention
   model, this essay discusses MHFA as a technique of neoliberal
   governance, moral surveillance, and social control, responsible for
   reinvigorating the psychiatric profession while dividing and demoting
   the populace.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {At the beginning of this century, the European Union engaged in a
   discussion on the necessity to shift to softer modes of governance, less
   detrimental for state sovereignty, which prompted lively academic
   debates. But how much has actually changed in the day-to-day practice
   has not been systematically analysed, and the severe economic and
   financial crisis experienced by European countries has radically changed
   the conditions in which EU policies are elaborated. Reviewing recent
   evidence, this article questions the dichotomy between old and new
   governance and shows that the crisis has led to a `hardening' of EU
   regulation in key policy areas, while in others the Commission has
   proved to be able to use its `soft powers' in ways that buttressed its
   influence. As a result, the shift to soft governance has not been as
   radical as one might have thought.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {645-666},
Abstract = {The article analyses the role of the German political parties as actors
   of federal change. Parties perceive federal processes through their own
   organizational lenses, giving priority to electoral logics, programmatic
   ideas or territorial interests. Each of the three reform steps in the
   German case was shaped by a specific blend of the three logics. Looking
   at the sequences of reform, the analysis shows that parties have
   remained central for organizing federal processes but have become less
   capable of arriving at cohesive and unified party positions. There have
   been struggles over which of the strategies was to prevail both within
   individual parties and across the party divide. The territorial power
   balances within parties, the timing of the reform, that is, the
   constellation of political majorities at federal and regional levels in

Abstract = {This conversation with the fourteenth Dalai Lama-the spiritual-political
   inspiration of the displaced Tibetan community-revolves around questions
   of why a practitioner of the Buddha Dharma would like to call himself
   Marxist, and also his views on the violence of both Marxist praxis and
   religion. The Dalai Lama splits Marxism into, on the one hand, violent
   paranoid statecraft, and, on the other, the moral principle of equal
   distribution. He aligns with the latter. He also displaces other-worldly
   religion to this-worldly moksha; he calls it spirituality. The
   conversation brings to dialogue the possible political consequences of a
   this-worldly spirituality and the possible spiritual consequences of a
   reflexive Marxism keenly attuned to experiences of human suffering.},

Abstract = {Depictions of the politics of crisis in advanced societies (what crisis
   is and what can be done) continue to pit different strands of political
   science and heterodox political economy against each other. Economic
   sociologist Wolfgang Streeck's contributions to these controversies have
   emphasised `embeddedness', or the need for economies to incorporate
   non-functional or deliberated elements which allow functional and
   market-focused processes to play themselves out. Streeck's recent
   writings on debt-induced crisis nonetheless accept too much orthodox
   liberal disquiet: most fatefully, a contempt for politics based on what
   seems to be an untenable assertion - that rich societies have hit the
   limits of their capacity to increase taxation. Capitalism has entered an
   `end point', he claims. This article presents, again, contrary evidence
   and offers suggestions for a revised heterodox understanding of
   capitalism's current malaise.},

   investigate the imaginary hovering Peasant Reserve Zones from the
   perspective of peace building in the territories. From this and under a

   Colombia was analyzed, the relationship with the established and
   instituting imaginary and its possible relationship to community
   development framed in peace. The ultimately led to the observation of
   institutional newsletters analysis, noticas, interviews with
   agricultural leaders of ANZORC, ASODECAS, CO-ORDOSAC, ASCAMCAT, ACTH,
   ACVC and examination of the missions and visions of their organizations,
   to glimpse what moves the instituted imaginary and if the peasant
   imagination can or configured as institutive in relation to the
   formation of community as prospects for peace.65},

   Critical Theory and Intersectionality},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {38},
Number = {4},
Pages = {465-475},
Abstract = {One of the great obstacles to liberation and social change is the
   one-dimensional focus of many liberation movements. By
   ``one-dimensional,{''} we mean the narrow reductionist approach to
   social change by many oppressed groups. In this article, we examine
   Marcuse's notion of catalyst groups and connect that to the concept of
   intersectionality. We argue that critical theory must become a theory of
   intersectionality. While various forms of oppression have their own
   distinct logic of operation and specific target group, the continuation
   of each form of oppression is supported by other forms of oppression.
   One of the goals of this plenary was to help participants focus on the
   theme of the conference, critique and praxis, by envisioning new
   possibilities for theory, critique, praxis, and pedagogy in our time. To
   this end, we attempted to rethink Marcuse's notion of one-dimensional
   thinking by linking it with Rene Girard's concept of mimetic rivalry and
   the black feminist concept of intersectionality.},

Abstract = {L.Fishman analyzes shifts in the ideology of the main political forces
   in the modern world, assuming that another ``Great transformation{''} of
   the world capitalist system is taking place now, and it will inevitably
   demand a new format of ideological consensus. According to the author's
   conclusion, this new format of ideological consensus will imply reaching
   an agreement on the most broad criteria of social subjectivity and
   receiving rent for ``being socially important{''}, which is expressed in
   the participation in social activities (due to the impossibility to
   participate in the production of goods and services in its traditional
   interpretation). This might probably lead to the increasing influence of
   communitarianism (as an alternative to neo-liberalism), whose rhetoric
   is based on the appeal to the middle level values, with public good
   being at the top of the list. At the same time, public good can be
   easily interpreted with nationalist color, as a benefit for some local
   community, although it can also be interpreted in a more universal
   manner, which is consistent with leftist views.},

Journal = {POLITY},

Volume = {48},

Pages = {5-28},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The central goal of most American politics scholarship and, indeed, of
   much of modern political science is to foster more precise accounts of
   political and social life, that is, accounts that reduce uncertainty
   about politics and society. Drawing on Marx's call for a ``ruthless
   criticism,{''} this article outlines the contours and promise of a more
   disruptive American politics. Rather than reduce uncertainty about
   politics and society, disruptive scholarship unveils points of tension
   at which they are contingent and mutable in a sense, rendering them more
   uncertain. In the process, I argue, this scholarship articulates
   important possibilities for democratic and egalitarian change. To
   illustrate the promise of disruptive research, I examine the American
   politics literatures on intersectionality and policy feedback, both of
   which have a significant but often underappreciated capacity to reveal
   crucial points of sociopolitical tension. I conclude by suggesting how
   scholars of U.S. politics might better develop the disruptive potential
   of their collective work.},

Abstract = {Since the Euromaidan, reformers inside and outside the country have been
   trying to make the disreputable Ukrainian police a citizen-friendly
   institution. The foundation for this reform has been laid: in 2015 a new
   policing law was passed and a patrol police introduced. However, some
   factors complicate the implementation of the reforms: resistance from
   old cadres who do not benefit from reforms; the institutional, economic,
   and military environment in Ukraine; as well as the general difficulties
   international police reformers face in achieving positive outcomes.},

Abstract = {The September 2015 elections in the regions of Russia resulted in
   victories for the major pro-government party, United Russia, in 11
   regional legislative elections and brought success to incumbent chief
   executives in 21 gubernatorial elections. The performance of United
   Russia was better than in the previous series of regional elections,
   which is particularly important given that in many respects, the 2015
   regional elections served as a rehearsal for the 2016 national
   legislative races. The results of the elections generally attested to
   the efficiency of political and institutional manipulation tools
   developed by the Russian authorities in recent years.},

Abstract = {The article presents the results of a comprehensive analysis of a
   referendum as an institution for decision-making in organizing an
   electoral system. The empirical analysis of data on 105 electoral
   referendums held in 1866-2015 in 33 countries reveals that such
   referendum does not always deserve being called an institution of direct
   democracy. The format and method of conducting a referendum often makes
   it an instrument of external legitimization of a decision that has
   already been made or manipulation of the political process.
   Nevertheless, the accumulated experience makes it possible to identify
   specific conditions, under which electoral referendum can serve as an
   effective institution of public participation in managing elections. An
   adequate wording of the question that is put to a vote and an active
   role of the public in organizing a referendum are the two most important
   conditions.},

   fulfil several other conditions that have not attracted such attention
   of scientific analyses, as have the three basic conditions; those
   conditions are economic consolidation, the rule of law, the existence of
   an organised civil society, an efficient country bureaucracy and a
   relative autonomy of political society ( Linz and Stepan, 1996: 14-18).
   Chapter put an emphasis on the processes of democratic consolidation in
   the former Yugoslav republics in the period since the volatile and
   violent breakup of socialistist Yugoslavia twenty-five years ago. It is
   clearly evident from various democratic consolidation measurements that
   most of former Yugoslav republics have so far not been successful in
   reachin the level of consolidated democracies and that democratisation
