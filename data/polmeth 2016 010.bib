Title = {Comparative Analysis of Qarun Story in Quran and Bible},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {8, SI},
Pages = {99-107},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {As a symbol of wealth, Qarun life is amalgamated with arrogance and
   rebellion in three Surahs of Quran: Al-Qasas (Stories), Al-Ankabut
   (Spider) and Ghafir (Forgiver). In Al-Ankabut and Ghafir just one Ayah
   (line) is dedicated to Qarun story, but Al-Qasas portrays his pride and
   intoxication of unlimited wealth which was followed by him forgetting
   God and kindness with others, and lastly his death in seven ayahs. Based
   on Quran, Qarun is from Moses (peace be upon him) tribe but he oppressed
   his own people. He was very wealthy and believed his wealth was just the
   result of his competency and merit. His people benevolently advised him,
   and also God reminds him and all those who are like Qarun that there
   were some even more powerful and avarice people than Qarun him but all
   died. Yet he again refused to donate his wealth and began to show off,
   and the worldly minded wished they had been in his place. Then God's
   torment was descended and he commanded the earth to devour Qarun and his
   house. Bible, like Quran, describes his fate in ``Ishah 16, Journey of
   Numbers{''} under the Hebrew name of ``Qarun bin Izhar bin Kohath bin
   Levi{''}: ``Qarun is Moses cousin, but as he was jealous of Moses and
   Aaron, he rebelled against Moses with collaboration of Dathan, Abiram,
   and Oan and 250 of leaders of Bani Israel. After that earth opened its
   mouth and devoured Qarun, Dathan and Abiram. Afterward a fire came from
   Lord and burnt the remaining of his companions. Here in this study we
   are going to compare these texts as nowadays it is necessary to discuss
   these natters enabling us to unite followers of holy religions and
   preventing discord.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The aim of this research is to evaluate the components and to state the
   form conditions of check issuing in statute of two countries of Iran and
   England. Due to the wide use of check and prevalence of its use as a
   payment instrument, and even the instrument for obtaining reputation
   such as promissory note and draft, the issuer should be familiar with
   the form conditions of check issuing to prevent possible problems caused
   by lack of knowledge. Since today these documents play a major role in
   communicating and business transactions, and strength most of deals.
   This led to prevalence of using aforementioned documents in
   establishment of trade exchanges, so that it can be said that these
   documents are an inseparable part of business transactions. The results
   obtained from the other researches and studies indicate that form
   conditions of check issuing are almost identical in Iranian and British
   Laws, that observing some of them is necessary, and if they are not
   observed, commercial document of the check will not have the necessary
   validity. Of mandatory form conditions include the date of issuing check
   include: Check issuing date, mentioning the word of check, unconditional
   order of payment of the amount check, check amount, mentioning the name
   of drawee on the check, mentioning the name of Mohil, indicating the
   place of check issuing, indicating the name of the holder, signature of
   check. In this study form conditions of issuing electronic check have
   also been investigated.},

Abstract = {Insulting religious beliefs and sanctities in some cases will intersect
   with freedom of speech. In this case, offenders have raided religious
   beliefs of other people under the guise of freedom of speech and insult
   them by poisoned arrows. While opponents thinkthis is the right while
   opponents think, this is the right which can be limited and undoubtedly
   insulting religious sanctities and religious beliefs, is considered as
   the boundary for this human right. Way of boundaries between these two
   challenging concepts is the foundation of this study that leads to
   preventation of spearding the freedom of speech to make insulting and
   not so much that sanctities circle and religious beliefs can be extended
   that no place for free speech and thinking and criticism can be
   remained. This study investigate the relationship between the crime of
   insulting religious sanctities and freedom of speech in Iranian law and
   international instruments on human rights using descriptive and

Journal = {BALTIC JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN STUDIES},

Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {58-75},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper seeks to analyse the directive on the application of
   patients' rights in cross-border healthcare. Two years after the
   transposition, it is time for first evaluations of its application,
   performance and perception. The analysis consists of three major
   elements: reconstruction of the legal scope and subject matter of the
   new legislation, conclusions of the evaluative reports monitoring its
   implementation and performance as well as the public opinion polls
   revealing the EU citizens' perception of its details. These three
   components combined together deliver a picture of the state of play
   about the pan-European cross-border patients' mobility. The bottom-line
   conclusions negatively verify the supposition present in some earlier
   literature on patients' cross-border mobility that the directive has a
   transformative potential leading towards the creation of truly
   competitive pan- European medical market. After two years of its
   operation, there is still no increased patients' mobility across EU
   internal borders observed. As regards the speculations for the future,
   there are only some weak symptoms identified and they may result in
   intensified cross-border mobility for healthcare.},

   democracy. Today, democracy will appear in the form of parliamentary and

   terms of structure, has a unicameral system, but its legislative power
   is not simple. As a result, the legislature also enjoys wide powers and
   can withstand the abuse of executive power. The present study aims to

Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {51},
Number = {4},
Pages = {539-559},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In recent years there has been a renewed interest in the political
   recruitment to non-elective public offices of the state. Such
   appointments can help entrench party organizations, cementing their
   position within the state and can also emerge as an instrument to
   provide parties with leverage over (and crucial information within) the
   increasingly fragmented and delegated processes of policymaking.
   Portugal has been conceived as a country with appointments deep into the
   administrative hierarchy, mainly motivated by partisan considerations.
   These accounts overlook the different rationales for patronage. This
   article aims to re-examine accounts on the (many) faces of patronage, by
   empirically exploring the logics of recruitment on three inter-related
   dimensions. First, to what extent different hierarchical levels are
   associated to different patronage functions. Second, by analysing the
   extent to which different moments of the governing period are associated
   to different faces of patronage. Third, by assessing the impact of party
   competition on patterns and logics of recruitment to the civil service.},

Abstract = {International organizations and national governments deliver billions of
   dollars in development assistance each year to citizens in ongoing
   insurgencies. Existing work shows that development assistance shapes
   insurgent violence, yet underspecified mechanisms and a failure to test
   all competing explanations have hampered knowledge cumulation. This
   article proposes a new theory of insurgent territorial loss to argue
   that development assistance should increase overall violence by
   insurgents, and indiscriminate violence in particular. Anti-poverty
   subsidies incentivize information sharing with the government,
   increasing incumbent territorial control and forcing insurgents to rely
   on increased and more indiscriminate violence to recapture territory. A
   difference-in-differences identification strategy combined with matching
   tests all existing mechanisms against one another in the context of a
   conditional cash transfer program in Colombia. The empirics provide
   support for the territorial loss mechanism, while competing explanations
   do not find support. Development assistance frequently produces welfare
   gains yet may also lead to increased insurgent violence.},

Abstract = {Gender studies in Germany is not a fully integrated aspect of political
   science training. Only very few of the about 70 political science
   institutes include gender research in their teaching programmes. This is
   surprising given that there are a number of factors that support a
   stronger institutionalisation of gender studies, such as the size of the
   German political science community, an increase in female faculty, and
   equal opportunity policies that have been adopted by the German
   Political Science Association. This article discusses the restrictive
   factors that impact upon gender studies within Germany and compares a
   2009 study on the mainstreaming of gender topics in B.A. and M.A.
   programmes in political science with a more recent 2014 survey. The
   findings of this study point to the fact that while there have been some
   overall trends, there nonetheless remain a number of barriers to
   improving the position of gender studies, not least the small size of
   many institutes. Indeed, the survey reinforces the position whereby
   teaching tends to concentrate on what are regarded as the `important
   topics, while gender becomes, at best, secondary. This reflects a
   broader finding that demands for more women in academia are easier to
   implement than the need fora gender mainstreaming of the political
   science curriculum.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Mainstreaming gender in political science education requires
   legislation, structures, instruments, and critical actors, not to
   mention a favourable political context for putting the issue on the
   agenda. This article examines these issues in the Spanish context with
   particular reference to the opportunities afforded to the mainstreaming
   of gender in higher education as a result of the European Higher
   Education Area and the policies pursued by the Socialist Zapatero
   government (2004-2011). Upon the back of these initiatives,
   undergraduate gender and politics studies were introduced for the first
   time in Spanish universities, having from the most part until then been
   the reserve of interdisciplinary Masters programmes on gender. While the
   opportunities to embed gender within political science education have
   been opened up, this process of mainstreaming has also been
   characterised by resistance. These issues are unpacked through a case
   study of the development of the gender and politics network within the
   Spanish Association of Political and Administrative Science, as well as
   through reference to the project of a pioneering textbook on
   mainstreaming gender in political science.},

Journal = {FRENCH POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes transformations in the backgrounds of French Members
   of the European Parliament and in their paths of access to the EP. This
   subject makes sense not only in relation to the European political and
   parliamentary space but also to the French political field. Our
   contribution is based on a prosopographical survey of all MEPs elected
   in France since 1979 and on new methods of analysis of the political and
   social trajectories: sequence analysis and optimal matching analysis.
   These methods allowed us to place electoral careers and their dynamics
   at the center of our analysis. The resulting analysis objectivizes the

Abstract = {This study examines the relationship between Islam and democracy with
   emphasis on the issue of whether and how Islam has bearings on
   democratic adjustment speed. Using comprehensive data on 17 Asian
   countries from 1996 to 2010, the study demonstrates that religion is a
   significant factor for determining democracy. Results indicate that the
   level of democracy in Islamic countries is generally lower than that in
   non-Islamic countries. However, the level of democracy in Islamic
   countries exhibits an upward trend, whereas that in non-Islamic
   countries displays a downward trend. Moreover, when benchmark variables
   are controlled, democratic adjustment in Islamic countries is faster
   than in non-Islamic countries. Hence, despite the current lower level of
   democracy in Islamic countries, the results of this study refute the
   conventional wisdom that Islam hinders democracy. Instead, Islamic
   countries are highly malleable and exhibit a potential for faster
   democratic development compared with non-Islamic countries. Results
   further suggest that Islamic countries can effectively promote democracy
   by improving education, minimizing the gender gap, controlling
   population growth, or becoming an oil exporter similar to non-Islamic
   countries. However, Islamic countries likely own an additional unique
   advantage in effectively improving democracy - that is, promoting
   urbanization. This aspect is in contrast to non-Islamic countries where
   urbanization plays no role in determining democracy.},

Abstract = {Recent studies suggest there is a direct trade-off between transparency
   and efficiency in legislative politics. We challenge this conclusion and
   present a bargaining model where one particular kind of transparency -
   the publication of legislative records - works to overcome problems of
   incomplete information. We also present empirical findings from
   legislative activities in the Council of the European Union from 1999 to
   2014 and from 23 interviews with senior officials in Brussels. Our
   results show that increased transparency, in the form of publication of
   legislative records, does not lead to gridlock or prolonged
   negotiations. On the contrary, recordings of governments' positions help
   facilitate decision-making as it increases credibility of policy
   positions. This, in turn, lowers risk of negotiation failure and screens
   out marginal amendments.},

Abstract = {Justice is the ideal of human social life which can bestow the society
   order and stability and open up the way of sublimity. Resorting to the
   justice mechanisms, a peaceful collective community together with
   balance and equilibrium of different interests and conflicting wills
   become possible. Here the issue is the establishment of role of
   distributive justice in balance of general affairs of society along with
   acceptance of the notion of equal distribution of facilities, resources,
   rights and wealth among all people without any bias and prejudice and
   just because of intrinsic generosity of human kind in the first place,
   and establishment of the system of redistribution of resources for
   removing any practical injustice in society in the second place.
   Applying such theory has a direct relation with the preserving of the
   fundamental human rights through which the rights are distributed
   according to the being human and capabilities and virtues within a fair
   competition and in this way the threats to the fundamental human rights
   are decreased. The right of keeping a healthy environment can also be
   guaranteed under this theory.},

Abstract = {This work investigates the theory of the spontaneous order and
   methodological individualism as a paradigm of social philosophy. This
   paradigm explores the origin and the evolution of society in a way that
   is essentially different from traditional moral and political
   philosophy. Indeed it provides an analysis of power that is not based on
   sovereignty but on individuals and social relations. As a result, it
   aims to investigate human action in different spheres of society as a
   common field of enquiry. The perspective adopted in this essay proves
   the need for a strong interdisciplinary disposition for social
   philosophy, whose specific task will be to combine different fields of
   knowledge and research into a common approach to social reality.},

Abstract = {The Ukrainian crisis altered the security paradigm in Europe by forcing
   NATO to revise its stance towards Russia, as it employed a wide array of
   military and non-military tools and tactics called ``hybrid warfare.{''}
   To counter Russian hybrid warfare in future, the NATO Alliance
   implemented functional and structural changes known the Readiness Action
   Plan (RAP) and endorsed the New Strategy on Hybrid Warfare. This paper
   will study Russian hybrid warfare activities and the preparedness of an
   Alliance shaped by the RAP and the New Strategy on Hybrid Warfare. It
   discusses whether this new NATO will be able to deter Russia from
   resorting to hybrid warfare against a NATO ally. While the Alliance has
   enhanced its military capabilities to a great extent, the Allies'
   ability to achieve consensus on a response is the factor most likely to
   deter and dissuade Russia from engaging in hybrid warfare.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},
Pages = {517-532},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Recently, economic accountability theory as a means by which to hold
   political leaders accountable in the industrialized world has been
   generalized in transitional democracies. The theory advances how mass
   publics in young democracies evaluate and assess the performance of
   chief executives based on sociotropic or pocketbook economic evaluations
   and the occurrence of pivotal political events. The study finds that
   self-placement on poverty among Filipinos and primordial assessments of
   hunger are predictors of presidential approval. Pivotal political events
   involving attempted coups, corrupt practices and executive level
   malfeasance are not likely to affect presidential approval ratings over
   time. Furthermore, changes in the national economy have no association
   with Philippine presidential approval ratings from 1986-2009. The
   results of the study suggest that political and economic theories of
   accountability as applied to the developing world should be reassessed
   by taking into account the non-institutionalization of party systems,
   strong executive structures, and the politics of personalism, patronage
   and patrimonialism.},

Title = {Institutional constraints, legislative activism and policy change: The

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {55},
Number = {3},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This article presents a study of how institutional constraints affect
   legislative activism and how legislative activism in turn affects policy
   change through an analysis of the European Union's legislative process.
   The argument revolves around the key role of theEuropean Commission in
   advancing policy change, and emphasises that the Commission can
   successfully push for increased policy change by increasing its
   legislative activity when the institutional opportunity space widens.
   Using a novel panel dataset covering eight policy sectors from the
   period 1984-2012, the article shows that the number of legislative
   proposals significantly affects the extent of regulatory reform in the
   EU. The rise in the number of legislative proposals, in turn, is
   affected by the extent of gridlock between the EU's legislative bodies.
   These findings show that the Commission steps up its legislative
   activity when the institutional opportunity space allows for greater
   policy change.},

Abstract = {Israeli-Palestinian conflict is one of the most complex and longest
   conflict in history. The problem which officially recognized with UN
   resolution 1947 and creation of two countries, was the initial point of
   consistent and continuous conflict. This is the beginning of wars,
   creation of movement, contracts and peace projects. Mentioning these
   contracts and plans and investigating the importance of its provisions
   could answer to the lack of permanent peace as well as the most
   important cases of parties. Some of these projects include the Camp
   David proposal, Fahd, Fez, Reagan, Mubarak, Madrid, Oslo, Maryland,
   Sharm el-Sheikh. Each one, according to political and its historical
   position is accepted, rejected, or partially accepted by the parties
   that led to the creation of the conditions and obligations for the
   parties of the conflict. Despite all the peace plans and agreements,
   parties did not agree on a comprehensive plan for the establishment of
   lasting peace in the region the. In fact, it seems as long as there is
   no determination beyond the interests of the Palestinian-Israeli groups
   and parties there, getting to the ultimate goal which is the sustainable
   peace, is elusive and this destructive cycle of war and peace will
   continue.},

Journal = {LEGISLATIVE STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Volume = {41},
Number = {3},
Pages = {715-738},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Stemming from ambition theory, a vast body of studies has demonstrated
   how politicians' pursuits of different goals can explain their
   behaviors. Among other goals, politicians strive for re-election or to
   attain a better office. However, little is known about the way
   politicians prioritize these goals. This article uses the phenomenon of
   legislative party switching to address this void and examines how
   hierarchy between goals determines legislator strategies. The study
   exploits the 2008 Romanian electoral reform, which rendered the
   electoral system more candidate centered. Drawing on data from more than
   3,900 individual-level observations over the period from 1996 to 2012,
   this article shows how vote incentives alter the trade-offs between
   re-election and office motivations. The findings suggest that
   politicians will pursue office goals only if the goal of re-election is
   to be achieved.},

Abstract = {How do governors affect party discipline at the National Congress? In
   this article, we evaluate governor's influence on national legislators'
   behavior, within the context of a federal State such as Argentina.
   Through an analysis of roll-call data, we determine that governors do
   influence on legislators' behavior on a way that when they keep one
   voice in relation to their position on a particular issue, the
   discipline is much stronger than when they have conflicting opinions,
   even more so among deputies than senators. Findings reinforce the under
   covered importance of considering governors a key role player on
   national Executive-Legislative relation and party discipline.},

Abstract = {Beliefs in conspiracy theories about controversial issues are often
   strongly influenced by people's existing beliefs and attitudes. We
   leverage a prominent football-related controversy - the US National
   Football League's ``Deflategate{''} scandal - to investigate how factual
   perceptions and conspiracy beliefs vary by fan loyalties to sports
   teams. Using an original survey sample, we explore two key drivers of
   conspiratorial beliefs about the scandal. First, we analyze how beliefs
   about Deflategate vary by respondents' loyalties towards the New England
   Patriots. We find that beliefs are not only highly polarized by team
   loyalty but that the gaps are largest among more interested and
   knowledgeable fans, suggesting that individuals are processing the
   information they receive in a highly motivated fashion. Second, we find
   that individuals who endorse unrelated political conspiracy theories are
   also more likely to endorse two key conspiratorial claims about
   Deflategate. However, priming group solidarity and elite resentment -
   two possible motivations for the prevalence of conspiracy theories
   around controversial issues like Deflategate - does not have a
   significant effect.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article addresses an understudied question in the comparative
   political economy of migration. How have trade unions shaped the
   attitudes of their members toward immigration? Unions are at the core of
   left-wing politics in most European countries, and support for
   immigration is usually a left-wing position. However, many of the core
   constituents of unions are those whose interests are most likely to be
   adversely affected by an increase in the supply of labour. The article
   shows that the pattern of European trade union leaders becoming
   supportive of open immigration policies has solidified over the past
   decade. It then provides evidence that this rhetoric has shaped the
   attitudes of union members and that the effect has become stronger over
   time. Finally, it shows that the effect is robust to the exclusion of
   countries where self-selection into unions on the basis of ideology is
   likely to be strongest.},

Abstract = {Political scientists interested in studying the political implications
   of citizens' cognitive abilities often turn to readily available
   ``intelligence ratings{''} in the American National Election Studies
   (ANES). These ratings are generally thought to represent respondents'
   cognitive abilities, albeit imperfectly. I hypothesize that these
   ratings do not reflect more-objective tests of cognitive ability, and
   instead better capture considerations related to the political subject
   of the interviews and other contextual factors. In the 2012 ANES, which
   contained a cognitive ability test ({''}Wordsum{''}), I find that
   political engagement and demographic factors but not actual measurements
   of cognitive ability are associated with interviewer intelligence rating
   scores. In bivariate analyses, verbal intelligence and interviewer
   ratings are moderately correlated with one another, consistent with
   conventional wisdom. But this correlation is a spurious one, as the same
   is also true for political engagement, education, and household income.
   Further, in multivariate models, Wordsum scores were neither
   statistically nor substantively predictive of interviewer ratings. The
   results suggest that interviewer ratings are better understood as
   proxies for political engagement, not cognitive ability. I conclude by
   arguing that the growing importance of studying cognitive ability in
   political science makes it necessary to include more-objective verbal
   intelligence tests more frequently in public opinion surveys.},

Abstract = {This article discusses older women's participation in local political
   parties in the London area. Its analytical framework draws on
   intersectionality as a perspective together with feminist political
   science and political gerontology. Empirically, it refers to research in
   seven parliamentary constituencies, based primarily on semi-structured
   interviews, focusing on roles, activities and contribution; underlying
   motivation; and experiences of marginalisation or exclusion. A complex
   picture emerges with effects of gender and age-mediated, especially by
   political party and location. Experiences are found to differ in
   different stages of old age, but there is no simple pattern of
   cumulative disadvantage for older women.},

Abstract = {Within the recent discussion among Croatian political scientists and
   sociologists about the egalitarian syndrome theory proposed by Josip
   Zupanov in the 1970s, two issues arose that are particularly important
   for economists. First, is the egalitarian syndrome an obstacle to
   economic development or is it a mere response to given development
   problems? Second, if the egalitarian syndrome is a set of cultural
   norms, how strong is their influence on the dynamics and level of
   economic development? These topics have not been addressed in the recent
   discussion among sociologists.
   Introduction of additional variables into the analysis of the link
   between inequality and social changes shows that particular cultural
   norms, such as the desire for redistribution, may influence social
   development, but the direction and strength of this impact are
   uncertain. Two variables are important in this regard: the pace of
   cultural changes and the level of their endogeneity or exogeneity in
   relation to economic development. Zupanov did not analyse the impact of
   these variables, but assumed a kind of cultural determinism. This was
   also the approach taken by contemporary proponents of his theory.
   Without incorporating the egalitarian syndrome theory into a broader
   theoretical framework which would define and test the relationship
   between cultural norms, their changes and economic development, it will
   not be possible to determine whether the values of egalitarianism as
   measured by Stulhofer and Buric represent obstacles to social
   development.},

Abstract = {This article examines the National Congress of Productivity and Social
   Welfare experience and rediscusses some of its characterizations. It
   argues that this iniciative was not just an intent to change laboral
   relations, but also constituted the culmination of a sociopolitic
   strategy that aimed, on the one hand, to modify interaction parameters
   of the socioeconomic actors on the productive level and the symbolic
   place that they occupied in the ``organized community{''}, and, on the
   other hand, to legitimate under productivity guidelines the Peronist
   state economic intervention. From the revision of documents and
   discourses of the period it is shown that this Congress was part of a
   strategy that, through a particular modus operandi, tried to make that
   the participation of the socioeconomic actors in the State improved
   effectiviness of the economic policy in the context of the
   industrial-distributive substitution model.},

Abstract = {The modern complexity of network attacks and their counter-measures
   (cyber operations) requires detailed planning. This paper presents a
   Network Attack Planning ontology which is aimed at providing support for
   planning such network operations within the cyber domain. The amount of
   cyber information is increasing constantly and the time that information
   stays relevant and valuable in decreasing similarly. Thus semantic
   technologies can contribute towards the intelligent processing of
   information in this ever-changing environment. An ontology enables the
   representation of semantic information. In additional, automated
   reasoning can enrich the representation by inferring unknown
   relationships. The inferences that can be made with the automated
   reasoning capabilities of ontologies provide a unique insight into the
   relationships between network targets and attacks, compared to
   traditional databases.},

Abstract = {This study examines the economic effects of military coups on the
   Turkish Economy between the years 1950-1984 by employing a special
   statistical method, called Hybrid Spline Regression Technique, which is
   appropriate for this particular case. Throughout these years, the army
   took over the economic and politic administration of Turkey three times.
   All these experiences caused a shift away from democracy, and caused
   sharp declines in the Turkish economy. This phenomenon created the
   general impression that each coup pulled Turkish economy 10 years back.
   It is possible to clearly see this in the economic data of the country.
   Therefore, the 1950-1984 period, generally known as the `era of coups,'
   has been the subject of many previous studies. However, all of these
   studies employed classical statistical methods, which were not as
   successful as Spline Methodology in determining the economic cost of the
   coups. For this reason, we first aimed to evaluate this period and to
   detect the economic cost of military interventions by determining the
   loss in the Gross National Product of Turkey. Subsequently, we presented
   an alternative statistical tool for researchers working on similar
   economic data by using the spline regression technique.},

Abstract = {This article takes a new idea, normative behaviourism', and applies it
   to global political theory, in order to address at least one of the
   problems we might have in mind when accusing that subject of being too
   unrealistic'. The core of this idea is that political principles can be
   justified, not just by patterns in our thinking, and in particular our
   intuitions and considered judgements, but also by patterns in our
   behaviour, and in particular acts of insurrection and crime. The problem
   addressed is cultural relativism', understood here not as a meta-ethical
   doctrine but as the apparent fact' that people around the world have
   culturally varying intuitions and judgements of a kind that lead them to
   affirm different political principles. This is a problem because it
   seems to follow (1) that global agreement on any substantial set of
   political principles is impossible and (2) that any political theory in
   denial of this fact' would be, for that reason, deeply unrealistic. The
   solution to this problem argued for here is that if domestic political
   principles (i.e. principles intended to regulate a single state) could
   be justified by normative behaviourism, and in reference to culturally
   invariant behaviour, then an international system supportive of such
   principles is justifiable by extension.},

Abstract = {``The Great Society{''} denotes, variously: a slogan or shorthand, a
   utopia, a means, an end, an era, and a set of normative claims. This
   article tracks the changing meanings of The Great Society in order to
   clarify and formalize scholarly claims about the Johnson administration.
   Employing Edward Sapir's conception of ``condensation symbols{''} and
   Keith Donnellan's distinction between ``referential' and
   ``attributive{''} descriptions, I create a typology of six Great
   Societies and trace the origins and deployment of these six meanings
   through qualitative textual analysis of presidential speeches,
   newspapers, and scholarly writings. Attributive uses of the term gave
   way to referential uses in the late 1960s, as radical movements and
   practical implementation problems eclipsed utopian visions of a great
   society. The analysis illuminates Johnson's character and contributes to
   the literature on the rhetorical presidency by demonstrating the
   importance of context, ambiguity, and the attribution of descriptive
   content to political slogans.},

Title = {What Kind of Thing Is Land? Hannah Arendt's Object Relations, or: The

Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {44},

Abstract = {Informed by D. W. Winnicott's object relations theory, and focused on
   the role of Things in constituting the world that is the object of
   Arendtian care, this essay examines Hannah Arendt's treatment in The
   Human Condition of two liminal examples, cultivated land and poetry,
   that hover on the borders of Labor, Work, and/or Action. Cultivated land
   could belong to Work because cultivation leaves a lasting mark on the
   land, but it is assigned to Labor because land, once it is left
   uncultivated, returns to nature, Arendt says. Poetry could belong to
   Action, which is the realm of meaning-making speech, but it is assigned
   to Work because, Arendt argues, poetry's memorability ultimately depends
   on its writtenness and, once it is written, it becomes a Thing possessed
   of the object permanence characteristic of Work's objects. But
   (un)cultivated land also has a textualized form; it, too, can be written
   down as, for example, in the form of mapping. Why does Arendt not
   consider this? What possibilities of political thought or action (beyond
   the mere reassignment of land cultivation from Labor to Work) might have
   been opened had she done so? Working through these questions with
   particular reference to colonial cartography (in which uncultivated
   land, deemed fallow, has a particularly political resonance), and
   reading Kafka's The Castle (cited by Arendt elsewhere) alongside Brian
   Friel's Translations, this essay explores practices of participatory
   mapping and land sabbatical that might make of land a Thing in Arendt's
   sense. Noting the Biblical origins of land sabbatical and that Arendt's
   move in the Work section from cultivated land to text/poem retraces
   George Steiner's diasporic journey From Homeland to Text, I suggest that
   The Human Condition, commonly called Arendt's most Greek text, may have
   a Jewish unconscious.},

Abstract = {As a more globalized world has exerted new pressure on the conduct of
   the state, more fluid concepts of citizenship have appealed to people as
   corrective to state-individual relations. However, there is a vast and
   understudied life-world in which people decide what they are entitled to
   and on what grounds, and because of this deficiency we do not know what
   people talk about when they bring up citizenship. For this task, I draw
   upon my fieldwork findings at a Taiwan eco-village, Tau-Mi, to
   demonstrate that when we engage with cultural contexts ethnographically,
   we discover that citizenship, rights, and grassroots mobilization are
   being reimagined through complex local conditions that are historically
   rooted. By doing so, I not only reconsider the boundaries of the
   political, essential for state-individual relations, but present a case
   study of how we may approach a `native' theory of citizenship.},

Abstract = {According to the opinions of the experts in the field of law,
   recognition of crimes and fighting against them is a social need
   combined with favorable political consequences that result in the
   acceptance and legitimacy of all political systems. The present article,
   with the descriptive-analytic method and application of all library
   resources, attempts to examine the designated policy of legal system of
   Iran in response to violent crimes. The results of the study indicate
   that the legislative-criminal policy of Iran includes different stages
   of prosecution, investigation and trial and even criminalization and
   sentencing. Populist criminal policy has been always considered in the
   Iranian legal system that instances of it can be observed in the act of
   intensification of punishments for the perpetrators of embezzlement,
   bribery and fraud. But in the late eighties and early nineties populist
   criminal policy emerged in the form of plans, bills and even multiple
   rules and unfortunately this trend is growing. At the end, it should be
   noted that in the populist legislative policies, due to lack of causal
   connection between the actions, the expected results are often not
   achieved and ineffectiveness of this policy on crimes and incapacity and
   inefficiency of this criminal policy is clear and obvious. It is hoped
   that the findings of this study can pave the way for further efforts in
   understanding and adopting wise policies and strategies to deal with all
   kinds of crime.},

Pages = {134-151},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {How should the content and justification of action-guiding normative
   principles' in political life be responsive to social facts'? In this
   article, I answer this question by sketching a contextualist methodology
   for identifying and justifying principles for guiding international
   institutional action, which is based on an original account of the
   regulative role and conceptual structure of principles of political
   legitimacy. I develop my argument for this approach in three steps.
   First, I argue that a special non-utopian category of normative
   political principles has the regulatory role of helping solve collective
   action problems that emerge in practice among actors engaged in shared
   institutional projects. Next, I argue that analysis of such normative
   political principles can be helpfully framed by what I call a collective
   agency conception of political legitimacy. Finally, I draw out the
   implications of these claims to show how the content and justification
   of normative political principles should vary across institutional
   contexts, in response to a particular set of motivational and empirical
   social facts. This contextualist methodology has useful applications to
   international politics insofar it can help to account for the widespread
   intuition that standards of political legitimacy for institutions may
   vary both across domestic and international levels and among
   international institutions operating in different functional domains.},

Abstract = {Poles constitute the largest immigrant community in the Republic of
   Ireland and, according to the 2011 census, more than 2.5 per cent of its
   population. Polish has become the country's second most commonly spoken
   language. Notwithstanding efforts by immigrant organisations, most
   notably Forum Polonia, and efforts by Polish candidates to contest local
   government elections in 2009 and 2014, the current picture is one of
   chronic under-representation. Bloemraad's model of structured
   mobilisation' suggests two principal routes for immigrant political
   incorporation: (i) mobilisation via the ethnic community itself (ethnic
   organisations and community leaders) and (ii) mobilisation via
   mainstream actors (political parties). In respect of the first, we
   examine efforts by the Polish community in Ireland to mobilise voters
   and garner support for Polish candidates in the 2014 local elections. In
   respect of the second, we draw on 10 years of longitudinal research on
   responsiveness by Irish political parties to immigrants. 2014 witnessed
   a sharp decline in efforts by political parties to reach out to
   immigrants entitled to vote compared to 2009. This institutional
   response, we suggest, had much to do with justifiable perceptions that
   immigrants were unlikely to mobilise, register to vote in large numbers
   or exercise their franchise.},

Abstract = {Does the Tea Party affect how lawmakers vote? Given the possible
   spurious effect of a representative's ideology, we leverage natural
   variation in the Tea Party's existence and examine this question through
   the lens of party switching. Like when lawmakers change parties,
   representatives who (1) joined Tea Party Caucus and (2) had a large
   volume of Tea Party activists in their district underwent a significant
   shift to the right in the 112th Congress. We believe these findings
   support both legislative-centered and extended network theorists. An
   additional analysis reveals that, unlike Democrats and non-Tea Party
   aligned Republicans who also shifted to the extremes in the 112th
   Congress, Tea Party Republicans did not ``bounce back{''} in the 113th
   Congress. Lastly, we find no equivalent rightward shift in comparable
   conservative caucuses or among Republicans with similar ideologies and
   districts. In the end, although the Tea Party is not a ``party{''} in
   the classic sense of the word, we claim that it is having ``party
   like{''} effects in Congress. In the conclusion section, we discuss the
   implications of these results for the stability of the current two-party
   system. Given our findings, a major realignment or split within the
   Republican Party would not be surprising.},

Abstract = {The lack of an overall gender gap in British voting behaviour hides
   considerable gender gaps within birth cohorts. This is not due to a
   gradual realignment of the gender gap related to modernisation, but
   instead to a gendered process of government socialisation. Men are
   especially supportive of the party that was in power during their
   formative years, particularly if it was in power for a sustained period
   of time. This is not consistently the case for women, and this gender
   difference produces political generations not only characterised by
   higher support for the party in power during their youth but also by
   gender gaps in voting behaviour. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {This article focuses on two research questions: Which interest groups
   (IGs) participate in the Chilean legislative process? How successful are
   the different types of IGs in getting what they want from legislative
   decisions? On the basis of the main findings of academic research on
   IGs, we identified three hypotheses about their participation and
   success in the decision making process. In order to test them, we
   created a database consisting of 571 bills that had passed through the
   Chilean parliament between 2006 and 2014, which contains information
   regarding the content and type of bills and the IGs that participated in
   the discussion of those bills. We found that Chilean business IGs are
   the most active of any type of IG. Second, as expected, in the Chilean
   case the participation of business interest groups is more intense in
   legislative bills dealing with economic issues. In this context, we
   found that their participation diminished and/or fell into line with
   that of other group types when the issue areas under scrutiny were not
   economic. Third, our preference attainment study on 30 law-making
   processes shows, contrary to our expectation, that the policy success of
   business IGs is lower than that achieved by other groups.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I examine the systemic effects of campaign spending,
   looking at outcomes at the level of the legislature rather than the
   individual seat. Using a difference-in-differences design, I show that
   state-level corporate campaign contribution bans have a large effect on
   electoral outcomes at the legislature level. A 1 percentage-point
   increase in the Democratic (or Republican) party's share of all
   contributions in an electoral cycle is estimated to increase its share
   of the legislature by roughly half a percentage point. Policy outcomes
   as well as campaign finance reforms occur at the legislature level;
   understanding the systemic rather than individual-level effect of
   campaign spending is therefore directly relevant. Aggregating estimated
   effects of individual-level campaign finance would not produce this same
   estimate owing to spillovers and other strategic dynamics. Taken
   together, the analyses suggest that contribution bans have important
   electoral effects and thus point to the systemic effects of campaign
   spending.},

Abstract = {Among the variety of readers of Etienne de La Poetic through history,
   many were in Geneva, where the text was published very early on. The
   great author from Geneva, lean JacquesRousseau, may have known this text
   since his early years. The article analyzes the influence that La Boetie
   may have had on the first text of Rousseau, Le Dfccours sir les Sciences
   el les Arts, drawing on previous analyses by Miguel Abeusour. This
   reading of Rousseau with La Boetie in mind also builds on the famous
   article Leo Strauss dedicated to the first Dzscours of Rousseau, but
   reaches `fundamentally opposite conclusions. This article, closer to the
   understanding that Ernst Cassirer had of Rousseau, attempts to explore
   this potential relationship between Rousseau and La Boetie and to
   understand where this can lead us in our view of a different Rousseau.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a conservative interpretation of some aspects of
   Bruno Leoni's thought. It relates the theory of the law as individual
   claim to Nash bargaining solution, and to the anti-contractualist idea
   of society as man's natural condition: Leoni's conservatism amounts here
   to a technique for the preservation of a social cooperative order.
   Leoni's conception of power as an exchange between individuals is
   interpreted as the foundation of a conservative theory of political
   obligation. Leoni's evolutionary doctrine of the juridical order is
   evaluated in respect to conservatism as a theory of social change, and
   to Hayek's epistemology, with its notion of complex phenomena and
   spontaneous orders. Eventually, Leoni's criticism of democracy is
   connected to John C. Calhoun's reflections on the evils of mass
   democracy and majority rule.},

Abstract = {Even after a quarter-century of debate in political science and
   sociology, representatives of configurational comparative methods (CCMs)
   and those of regressional analytic methods (RAMs) continue talking at
   cross purposes. In this article, we clear up three fundamental
   misunderstandings that have been widespread within and between the two
   communities, namely that (a) CCMs and RAMs use the same logic of
   inference, (b) the same hypotheses can be associated with one or the
   other set of methods, and (c) multiplicative RAM interactions and CCM
   conjunctions constitute the same concept of causal complexity. In
   providing the first systematic correction of these persistent
   misapprehensions, we seek to clarify formal differences between CCMs and
   RAMs. Our objective is to contribute to a more informed debate than has
   been the case so far, which should eventually lead to progress in
   dialogue and more accurate appraisals of the possibilities and limits of
   each set of methods.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the impact of niche party success on the
   policy agendas of mainstream parties. Following from the expected
   electoral effects of issue politicization, the success of radical right
   and green parties will cause different reactions from mainstream
   parties. While mainstream parties emphasize anti-immigrant positions in
   response to radical right success, green party success will have the
   opposite effect for environmental issues. Since green parties constitute
   issue owners, their success will make established parties de-emphasize
   the environment. Analyzing time-series cross-section data for sixteen
   Western European countries from 1980 to 2011, this article empirically
   establishes that green and radical right parties differ in their effect
   on mainstream party behavior and that their impact depends on the
   ideological position and past electoral performance of the mainstream
   parties.},

Abstract = {Accounts that focus on the ``southernization{''} of the Republican Party
   and the subsequent conservative ascendance in American party politics
   emphasize the role of race and civil rights issues, or battles over sex
   and gender, but none analyze the significance of family in shaping this
   partisan rightward shift. Meanwhile, literatures in fields other than
   party politics have engaged family more centrally, highlighting the
   rising salience of parents to legal and political development. This
   article connects and contributes to these literatures by analyzing the
   impact of parenthood and family on political parry development. I
   demonstrate the increasing salience of ``parents{''} as a political
   ideal in late twentieth-century policy discourse, reveal an overarching
   organic family frame in which it was used, and trace this frame to
   Southern domestic ideals and to the growing importance of the South to
   the Republican Party. In so doing I provide a ``family-centered{''}
   account of the late twentieth-century conservative ascendancy and
   suggest the centrality of family - and parenthood - in defining it.},

Abstract = {The interest in procedures for political decision-making has grown
   tremendously during recent decades. Given the intense scholarly debate
   and the implementation of greater opportunities for citizen
   participation in many democracies, there has been surprisingly little
   interest in citizens' conceptions of democracy understood as their
   preferences concerning the processes by which the political system
   works. Some recent attempts do, however, suggest that it is important to
   expand the study of public opinion from policy output to decision-making
   processes, and that there are coherent patterns in citizens'
   expectations of the way in which political decisions come about. What is
   not clear, though, is whether citizens' different conceptions of
   democracy have repercussions for how they engage in politics. Using the
   Finnish National Election Study of 2011 (Borg and Gronlund 2011), this
   article explores the relationship between citizens' conceptions of
   democracy and patterns of political participation. Results demonstrate a
   distinct association between citizens' ideals and the actions they take.},

Abstract = {After 24 years of constitutional rule in Brazil, what can be learned
   about the interaction between pressure groups and the Brazilian Federal
   Supreme Court (FSC)? Which are the political actors who achieve the best
   results? What issues are judged more by the FSC? Does the FSC favor a
   specific topic or decisions are made regarding the plaintiff over the
   subject matter? If it were the case, who and what are the privileged
   ones by its decisions? This article analyzes the interaction between
   civil society and the Judiciary, based on observation of the use of
   Direct Unconstitutional Action (DUAs). The paper also assesses the
   industrial lawsuits, filed in stf jurisdiction by the National Industry
   Union (CNI) and argues that: (1) the powerful groups received most
   success when proposing DUAs; (2) while there was a low probability of
   success, the groups gained benefits from bringing the conflict of
   interest to Supreme Court; and (3) the judicialization of pressure
   groups' interests is a complementary and coordinated strategy with
   groups advocacy in the legislative arena.},

Abstract = {Foucault's discussions of parrhesia provide fertile ground for raising a
   number of classical and pertinent issues in political theory related to
   critique, citizenship, and political authority. Foucault situates
   parrhesia in his analytical grid of power/knowledge/ethics, which maps
   political participation and experience, and he looks at how those who
   pursue or contest political power articulate and integrate these three
   facets of politics, which might well pull in opposite directions. Power
   concerns the ability and the audacity to face up to important political
   tasks and to take action at the right time authoritatively and with
   resolve. Knowledge is vital for telling the truth from a partisan
   viewpoint and for making informed and balanced decisions. Ethics
   concerns the trustworthiness of those who either exercise or criticize
   political power and touches upon their dedication, sense of judgement,
   and personal integrity. The personal integrity of the citizen acting
   politically as well as his or her responsibility to the political
   community are among the main issues to be raised in relation to these
   themes. The same goes for the issues related to the nature of the
   political community, its institutional set-up and its culture, and
   whether it is authoritarian and marked by hierarchy and obedience or
   democratic and egalitarian. Thus, parrhesia captures some of the most
   vital dimensions of political life of how to exercise the political
   power of authority in a way that is both truthful and trustworthy.
   Foucault's discussions of parrhesia shed light on the democratic
   challenges and possibilities related to political power as
   governmentality.},

Abstract = {To allow researchers to investigate not only whether a paper's methods
   are theoretically sound but also whether they have been properly
   implemented and are robust to alternative specifications, it is
   necessary that published papers be accompanied by their underlying data
   and code. This article describes experiences and lessons learned at the
   Quarterly Journal of Political Science since it began requiring authors
   to provide this type of replication code in 2005. It finds that of the
   24 empirical papers subjected to in-house replication review since
   September 2012, only four packages did not require any modifications.
   Most troubling, 14 packages (58\%) had results in the paper that
   differed from those generated by the author's own code. Based on these
   experiences, this article presents a set of guidelines for authors and
   journals for improving the reliability and usability of replication
   packages.},

Title = {Lying or Believing? Measuring Preference Falsification From a Political
   Purge in China},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {49},
Number = {5},
Pages = {600-634},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Despite its wide usage in explaining political dynamics of
   non-democracies, preference falsification remains an empirical myth for
   students of authoritarian politics due to the challenge of measurement.
   We offer the first quantitative study of this phenomenon in a
   non-democratic setting by exploiting a rare coincidence between a major
   political purge in Shanghai, China, and the administration of a
   nationwide survey in 2006. We construct two synthetic measures for
   expressed and actual political support and track their changes before
   and after the purge. We find that the purge caused a dramatic increase
   in expressed support among Shanghai respondents, yet the increase was
   paralleled by an equally evident decline in actual support. We interpret
   this divergence as evidence for preference falsification and conduct a
   number of robustness checks to rule out alternative explanations. We
   also show that falsification was most intense among groups that had
   access to alternative information but were vulnerable to political
   sanctions.},

Volume = {46},

Abstract = {This article addresses two aspects of social network influence on
   voters' electoral choices that are not well understood: the role of
   party systems as institutional contexts and the relationship between
   social pressure and information sharing as mechanisms of influence. It
   argues that in the cleavage-based multiparty systems of Western Europe,
   discussant influence at elections occurs in two stages. First,
   discussants place social pressure on voters to opt for parties from the
   same ideological camp. Secondly, by providing information, discussants
   influence which parties voters eventually choose out of these restricted
   `consideration sets'. The study tests these assumptions using a panel
   survey conducted at the 2009 German federal election. The first
   proposition is clearly confirmed, and the evidence supports the second
   proposition, although less unequivocally.},

Abstract = {this paper, we will question the political consensus that, from the end
   of the decade of 1970, diagnosed the flaws of the process of
   politicization of chilean subaltern classes, that led to the break-down
   of democracy, the failure of the Unidad Popular project and that
   culminated in military dictatorship. By means of the analysis of the
   subaltern chilean classes' practices of power, we account for the
   profound transformations in the political culture of the time, that
   called the Commitment's Satate into question and that expressed itself
   on the debate and reach of Popular Power in the process of the chilean
   route to socialism.},

Abstract = {This essay corrects and updates one that was originally published in
   Qualitative \& Multi-Method Research and, in a condensed version, in
   three other APSA Organized Section newsletters. Our research into IRB
   policy has shown that many political scientists are not familiar with
   some of its key provisions. The intent of the essay is to increase
   awareness of the existing policy's impact on political scientific
   research and, in particular, on graduate students and junior faculty. We
   remain concerned that at present, faculty are leaving discussions of
   research ethics to IRBs (and their counterparts worldwide), whereas
   these Boards largely focus on complying with the regulatory details of
   governmental policy. Even though this essay seeks to clarify the latter,
   we remain convinced that research ethics ought to be vigorously taken up
   within disciplinary and departmental conversations.},

Abstract = {Turkey may feel comfortable in its position of regional power. However,
   this rise requires that Ankara direct its attention to the post-Soviet
   area. Traditional rivalry with Russia and normalization of relations in
   the Caucasus region will present the most important obstacles for
   engagement with post-Soviet nations. This all comes at a time of
   significant change in regional dynamics, affecting neighboring states
   and their regional strategies. In order to reach out to the post-Soviet
   space, Turkey will have to direct economic resources and political
   commitments to the region, which is dominated by Russia and China.
   Nevertheless, with the involvement of Iran, India, and Pakistan in
   Central Asia, the cost of neglecting the regional participation will be
   high for Ankara.},

Abstract = {The lecture looks at the problem of democratic legitimacy. It
   concentrates on the eroding reliability of contemporary, democratic
   policymaking, which is involved in a conflict between two different
   formulas of legitimacy the logic of self-regulation, originating in the
   notion of the market and the idea of public judgment, and the logic of
   public debate. It begins by posing the following question: is democratic
   policymaking based on reliable `truths' that can ensure a sense of
   purpose and security, or is it involved in a drama of contingent, petty
   manoeuvring? However, the focus of this lecture is not on day-to-day
   practical matters. It is intended to embrace the cultural and
   philosophical premises of current political dilemmas. Political matters
   are connected to more fundamental questions, referring to the
   predicament of late modernity.},

Abstract = {What are the effects of judicial action and policy implementation on
   attitude change? The previous literature indicates that attitudes may
   change, but there is some debate about its direction. According to some
   theories, legislation or litigation should strike a backlash, resulting
   in greater disapproval of the issue. Other perspectives contend that
   these acts reflect consensus, legitimate, or polarize the issue. We
   analyze panel data on attitudes toward same-sex marriage and feelings
   toward lesbians and gay men. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court made
   historic decisions on same-sex marriage, and residents in some states
   had same-sex marriage legalized. Given this variation, we decompose the
   multiple pathways attitudes change among residents in different policy
   contexts over time. We find that residents of states that had same-sex
   marriage policy introduced had the greatest reduction of anti-gay
   attitudes. We consider consensus and legitimacy as most applicable and
   provide minimal indication of backlash or polarization.},

Abstract = {State attorneys general, situated at the intersection of the state and
   federal governments, are increasingly the subject of scholarly inquiry.
   Yet, little work examines what prompts them to participate as amici. The
   decision to participate as amici reveals important information about how
   state actors attempt to shape outcomes at the federal level. We
   investigate how the broader policy-making environment facilitates and
   constrains AG amicus brief initiation and joining. Analyzing all orally
   argued Fourth Amendment cases from 1970 to 2009, we find the
   characteristics of the policy-making environment shape AG amicus
   activity. Initiation is predicted by institutional resources; whereas
   joining is the product of legal case facts and institutional resources.
   Because prior research notes larger attorney general coalitions are more
   successful, we highlight the complexity of amicus participation by state
   actors and speak to the conditions under which state actors can mobilize
   large coalitions to shape federal search and seizure case law.},

Abstract = {This article evaluates the impact of partisanship, globalization and
   postindustrialism on provincial revenues since 1980. It is often argued
   that the first of these no longer has an effect, while the second and
   third erode fiscal capacity. These arguments are assessed with
   multilevel models, hitherto little used for macro-level estimations in
   political science. This approach is particularly suited to testing these
   influences. The study finds that partisanship is, in fact, strongly
   associated with provincial revenues. Globalization and postindustrialism
   have a more muted effect, though alternative estimations support
   somewhat different conclusions regarding the former. The social
   preconditions of partisanship's impact, moreover, deserve more
   attention.
   Resume Cet article evalue l'impact de l'esprit de parti, de la
   mondialisation et de la desindustrialisation sur les revenus provinciaux
   depuis 1980. Parmi ces facteurs, la litterature suggere que le premier
   n'a plus d'effet, alors que les deuxieme et troisieme minent la capacite
   fiscale des Etats. Ces arguments sont examines a l'aide de modeles
   multi-niveaux, une approche particulierement bien adaptee a l'etude de
   ces facteurs, bien que traditionnellement peu utilisee dans les
   estimations de donnees de niveau macro en science politique. L'etude
   conclut, d'une part, que l'esprit de parti et les revenus provinciaux
   sont fortement associes. D'autre part, l'article demontre que la
   mondialisation et la desindustrialisation ont un effet moindre, bien que
   d'autres estimations fournissent un portrait plus nuance concernant
   l'impact de la mondialisation. Enfin, les conditions sociales
   determinant l'effet l'esprit de parti meritent une plus grande attention
   de la part des chercheurs.},

Abstract = {Scholars have devoted considerable attention to understanding how
   individuals' political and economic attitudes shape their views toward
   government policies designed to alleviate growing income inequality in
   the United States. However, much less attention has been paid to the
   question of how religion shapes Americans' attitudes toward income
   inequality and redistributive policies. Using data drawn from the 2013
   Economic Values Survey conducted by the Public Religion Research
   Institute (PRRI), we explore the role that religion-including religious
   affiliation, the degree and nature of religiosity, the nexus of politics
   and religion, and interpretations of biblical text-plays in structuring
   individuals' attitudes toward government redistribution policies. We
   find that religious affiliation and participation do not meaningfully
   shape attitudes toward redistributive policies; however, identification
   with the ``religious right{''} and specific interpretations of scripture
   do influence how Americans think about redistribution. These findings
   provide evidence that standard treatments of religion focusing primarily
   on affiliation and religiosity may have somewhat limited explanatory
   power with regard to attitudes about issues that fall outside of the
   standard ``culture wars{''} framework, at least relative to the
   explanatory power of more specific expressions of religious belief.},

Abstract = {Parliamentary processing of European Union (EU) matters in Finland has
   been characterized as consensual and pragmatic, with little if any
   public conflict between the political parties. The main goal is
   understood to be to achieve parliamentary unity or at least broad
   consensus, which can arguably be translated into additional influence in
   EU-level bargaining. But the outbreak of the euro crisis and the 2011
   Eduskunta elections triggered a major domestic politicization of Europe,
   which also affected parliamentary behaviour. EU issues are now debated
   more often in the full chamber, while voting has become more common in
   the EAC, with the losing opposition minority adding its dissenting
   opinions to the EU reports of the committees. Drawing on Eduskunta
   records and interviews with members of parliament (MPs) and civil
   servants, three hypotheses about the driving force behind this
   politicization are formulated: conflicting logics of appropriateness
   among MPs, the strategic incentives of the Finns Party, and frustration
   about euro crisis decision making.},

Volume = {69},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Scholarship in the area of group identity has expanded our understanding
   of how group consciousness and linked fate operate among racial and
   ethnic minority populations in the United States. What is yet to be
   tested is whether the measures employed adequately capture the
   multidimensional theoretical constructs associated with group
   consciousness across racial and ethnic populations. To address this
   question, we make use of the 2004 National Political Study (N = 3,339)
   and apply principal components analysis and exploratory factor analysis
   to assess whether measures used for both group consciousness and linked
   fate are interchangeable, as well as whether these measures are directly
   comparable across racial and ethnic populations. We find that the
   multidimensional approach to measuring group consciousness is a sound
   strategy when applied to African Americans, as the dimensions fit the
   African American experience more powerfully than is the case for
   non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, and Asian populations. Our analysis
   suggests that scholars interested in exploring group identity among the
   African American population have fewer analytical concerns in this
   regard than those working with other populations where the underlying
   components associated with group consciousness appear to be operating
   differently.},

Abstract = {The 2012 presidential election was closely contested with the media
   predicting that the unemployment rate announcement just before the
   election would be the deciding factor. If a single economic indicator
   could buoy up job approval ratings, delivering positive economic
   statistics to the voters would be a rational re-election strategy for an
   incumbent. In contrast, this paper presents a model in which voters do
   not immediately convert each economic statistic into a performance
   evaluation. Only after many ``rehearsals{''} do voters convert
   statistics into a positive or negative evaluation. I take the case of
   Japan and use a survey experiment and an inverse probability weighting
   (IPW) estimator to assess whether short-, medium- and long-term
   performance evaluations form based on voter perception of economic
   conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article is based on an in-depth study of three cases (Barcelona,
   Pamplona and Bilbao) and it tries to present a more current portrayal of
   urban movements from a theoretical perspective. To that aim, it brings
   into the same analytical framework the contributions of both the
   American and European schools study of social movements. A proposal is
   presented that gives applied content to this sui generis political actor
   by taking into account variables such as the structure of political
   opportunity (EOP), organizational forms, repertoires of action and
   discursive frameworks. We believe that urban movements have evolved
   gaining more access to the political system. They have benefited from
   the new opportunities offered by local governance (EOP) and have
   encouraged participatory processes. These participatory processes, built
   from the communitarian methodology (repertoires) are intended to promote
   a democratic management of the city ( speech), by means of network logic
   (organization) which seeks to restructure the society, as a first step
   towards increasing their influence on urban policies.},

Abstract = {The Euro crisis has a strong impact on European Union (EU) politics and
   the EU polity. Crisis-related issues were debated across Europe and
   governments and EU institutions introduced several institutional
   instruments which are meant to make EU economic governance more
   effective. This paper investigates the scope, timing and divisiveness of
   political contestation, i.e. politicisation, in the German Bundestag and
   the frames on which political parties relied in their debates on
   crisis-induced institutional innovations in the German Bundestag. To
   account for these patterns, the paper relies on institutional theories
   and theories of party competition. Empirically, it draws on written
   protocols of debates and parliamentary questions in the Bundestag. A
   case study of Germany and the Bundestag does not lend itself to broad
   generalisations. Yet, as argued in the article, it is an unlikely case
   for politicisation and a politically important case.},

Abstract = {Why does Mexico's mixed legislative system diverge from Duverger's Law?
   Rather than rehash cultural and historical explanations, we suggest two
   institutional factors - a fused ballot and compulsory voting laws - may
   explain this divergence. Cross-national evidence controlling for these
   factors suggests Mexico is not an outlier and that the fused ballot
   encourages multiparty district competition. The results also suggest
   ways reforms could bring competition closer toward Duvergerian
   expectations.},

Abstract = {The article reconsiders an assumption on which political science relies:
   the similarity between one's place of residence and place of vote.
   Drawing from ethnographic, historical and statistical data, it
   emphasizes the continuous presence of non-resident voters and elected
   representatives in French small mountain communities. It analyzes the
   mobility of those who do not vote in their municipality of residence but
   in the one in which they are ``natives{''} and the political
   mobilizations that support it.},

Booktitle = {DISSENT, REVOLUTION AND LIBERTY BEYOND EARTH},
Series = {Space and Society},
Year = {2016},
Pages = {111-124},
Abstract = {Extraterrestrial habitats impose limits on human freedom through
   confinement, isolation, and a dependence for survival on advanced
   communal technology. Is it possible purposefully to design such
   habitats, or elements of them, to maximise freedom, even to enable
   `safe' revolutions against corrupt central authorities? But to plan an
   artificial environment to ensure `liberty' for others is probably itself
   an oppressive act, in that some freedom of choice of those others must
   be removed. In the long term a solar system filled with diverse
   communities of all kinds may provide refuge for the oppressed. In the
   short term the most effective technological enablers of personal liberty
   may be a suite of key inventions, possibly simple ones, that allow the
   possibility of individual mobility and escape. This is never a perfect
   solution; small isolated communities may themselves be unhealthy.
   However, if one is not contained, one cannot be oppressed.},

Abstract = {Identifying narratives within the news media is a challenging task. In
   this research note, we utilize the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF) to
   identify news media narratives and characters (heroes, victims,
   villains) on hydraulic fracturing in two local Colorado newspapers. We
   find the victim is the public and the villain is most often the oil and
   gas actors. Furthermore, the two newspapers present heroes differently:
   the conservative newspaper presents oil and gas industry actors as
   heroes while the liberal newspaper presents environmental organizations
   as heroes. This research note demonstrates the potential of the NPF to
   evaluate media reporting of contentious issues.},

   users are more interested in and engaged in politics in general and less

Abstract = {This study examines the impact of using Twitter in the classroom on
   student political efficacy, interest, and engagement. Millennials use
   the virtual world to build social relationships and to obtain
   information. By envisioning the virtual world as a means to increase
   civic engagement, political science instructors can use technology to
   draw upon social networking, iterated interaction, and information
   sharing. Because taking political science and civics courses can boost
   civic engagement, students who are drawn to political science courses
   are more likely to already be interested in politics and have an
   increased knowledge. Therefore, what we demonstrate is that, while
   Twitter in and of itself does not independently foster civic engagement,
   employing it as a pedagogical tool taps into and strengthens the
   predispositions of students in political science classes, namely
   political interest and efficacy. Our results contribute to a fresh and
   much needed discussion in political science literature about ways to
   increase civic engagement of Millennials.},

Abstract = {Democracy is a form of social organization based on popular sovereignty.
   The rise of democracy has run in parallel to economic growth in society
   and this system of government has been increasingly adopted in other
   countries (Inglehart, 2005). The same concept has been defined over time
   in different ways according to their historical characteristics.
   According to Kluckhohn (1958), humans react to external stimuli as well
   as to their own interpretations of stimuli as per a cognitive framework
   defined by the culture in which the individual is inserted. This
   research is aimed at learning how values influence the concept that
   young Spaniards have of democracy and determine how these affect each
   dimension, factor or element in which the study of this type of social
   organization can be divided. In order to carry out this research we are
   using data from the sixth round of the European Social Survey (ESS)
   conducted in 2012. The sample consists of two groups, one with
   individuals aged 18 to 30 and a second group with people over 30 years
   of age. Results indicate that democracy - and its elements-is not an
   ideal concept, or it should not be seen as an invariable, objective
   concept, external to citizens. It is rather an adaptive and evolving
   instrument, consubstantial to each individual's vital experience and
   society's in its whole in which values have a joint function between the
   macro and the micro-social groups.},

Abstract = {The motion to table plays a prominent role in many scholarly accounts of
   policymaking in the Senate. Scholars have argued that it is used with
   several other motions to allow majority party leaders to bias policy
   outcomes on the chamber floor. Others maintain it provides bill managers
   with a means of more efficiently managing the floor. We examine how the
   motion was utilized both prior to and during the development of Senate
   floor leadership. Our evidence suggests that in the absence of such
   leaders, majority party members used the motion to defend the floor from
   both opposing and fellow party members.},

   shows the origin of matter, based concepts wandering about the topic and
   the questions are to clarify the matter; then, it refers to the fields
   of action of collective action, the analysis categories and dimensions
   that should be considered to refer to these topics. In general, it
   relies on the basic positions of some Latin American researchers who
   have worked this subject, from this, the criteria for identifying the
   epistemic place from which to make their approaches are established.},

Pages = {369-393},
Abstract = {Rising powers gain economic and political clout and challenge the
   post-Cold War world order. Located in a relatively peaceful region away
   from global conflict zones, Brazil has fought no war with its neighbours
   in 150 years, and with limited military capabilities, Brazil differs
   from its BRICS peers as a non-militarised emerging power. Based on Nye's
   soft power concept, this article examines Brazil's soft power
   characteristics (preference for diplomacy, peaceful conflict resolution,
   use of force as a last resort; actions as agenda-setter, bridge-builder,
   Southern interests' supporter, pro-multilateralism, etc.). This paper
   compares Brazil's role conception to its role performance to conclude
   that Brazil projects itself as a soft power broker.},

Abstract = {The aim of this work is to analyze some discourses and practices which
   surrounds the debate about the prostitution. The fundamental idea which
   I argue is that prostitution, until the appearance of the neoliberal
   capitalism, has had an exclusively patriarchal nature. However, when
   neoliberal economic policies begin to be applied globally, prostitution
   stops to be only a patriarchal practice and becomes into a fundamental
   economic sector for the international economy and especially for the
   criminal economy. Thereby prostitution should be analyzed in the frame
   of the political economy. Likewise, I explain that prostitution is a
   social phenomenon that develops within the frame of three systems of
   control: the patriarchal, the neoliberal capitalist and the
   racial/cultural.},

Title = {Carrying a heavy load: Mayan women's understandings of reparation in the
   aftermath of genocide},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2-3, SI},
Pages = {265-283},
Abstract = {Drawing on extensive testimony from Ixil women survivors of sexual
   violence, the 10 May 2013 verdict in the genocide trial of former de
   facto Guatemalan head of state and army general Efrain Rios Montt
   highlighted the perpetration of sexual violence as an integral component
   in the attempt to destroy the Maya Ixil as an ethnic group and thus
   evidence of genocide. Acknowledging that sexual violence was a weapon of
   genocide in Guatemala contributes to a critical analysis of how the
   racialized violence targeted against the country's indigenous peoples
   was gendered, and enables the women and men who are survivors of these
   crimes to seek redress. However, narrating sexual harm within
   justice-seeking processes is not without complication, and trials alone
   cannot respond to survivors' demands for justice and social repair. This
   article examines how fifty-four Maya Q'eqchi', Kaqchikel, Mam and Chuj
   women who are survivors of sexual violence make meaning of the everyday
   struggles to rethread their lives in the aftermath of genocide. The
   article uses data from a four-year participatory action research (PAR)
   project conducted by the authors with this group of Mayan women,
   including a series of workshops that used creative techniques-drawing,
   collage, dramatization and body sculptures-to elicit more complex and
   contestational stories than those emergent from a more linear narrative
   approach to understanding harm suffered and efforts for redress.
   Analysis of these data confirms that these Mayan women survivors have
   woven their understanding of reparation from three main threads: their
   experiences of loss and harm; their recognition of the Guatemalan
   state's duplicity; and their protagonism in justice-seeking processes.
   The article concludes by arguing that women survivors' desire for repair
   requires attention to the deep-seated impoverishment that they highlight
   as the heavy load of gendered violence they carry with them.},

Abstract = {Freedom - his exercise and ownership-has been a central theme in the
   thinking of the social sciences throughout its existence. However, each
   school of thought has defined and addressed his study from different
   points of view. For this reason, this research presents and contrasts
   studies of three of the most influential writers of the twentieth
   century: F. Hayek, Isaiah Berlin and J. Rawls. This doctrinal opposition
   will allow to conclude that liberal freedom swings between
   autoderminacion and recognition. Through the major original texts of
   these three authors and others and using an analytical - comparative
   methodology are achieved outline the different contours of liberal
   freedom and its links to self-determination and due recognition.
   Similarly, it is possible to open and a debate on the different
   projection of freedom in today's liberalism.},

Abstract = {Does the size of a community influence political participation? Using
   spatial analysis, we investigate this question for the absolute level
   and change in local electoral turnout and invalid voting, using
   municipality-level data (N=588) from the 2006 and 2012 local elections
   in Belgium. The population size of a community has a clear negative
   effect on political participation, while area size matters far less and
   has a positive association. Compulsory voting in Belgium keeps young
   people showing up at elections, but with a higher likelihood of spoiling
   their vote. One of the main negative influences on participation is
   computer voting instead of paper and pencil ballots. Clear differences
   between the language communities in Belgium remain, after controlling
   for other community variables.},

Abstract = {This paper departs from the hegemonic notion of truth-the cognitive
   notion of truth-and arrives at four other notions of truth in Marx,
   Gandhi, Heidegger, and Foucault. It puts the four to a possible
   dialogue. It argues that one can get a glimpse of the cusp of Marxism
   and spirituality in the dialogue among the four. The work at the cusp,
   in turn, renders Marxism asketic and the spiritual phronetic. Thinking
   at the cusp also inaugurates the possibility of an anti-Oedipal future
   for Marxism and a this-worldly present for spirituality.},

   the votes of almost one out of 14 Greek voters and then global media and
   public attention. How did an extreme right groupuscule invade the
   political terrain of an EU-10 member state? Existing attempts to account
   for this phenomenon point to demand-side explanations, related to the
   political turmoil that followed the notorious debt crisis and the
   accompanying austerity measures. These explanations, however, fail to
   account for the genesis of this trajectory. We delve into this exact
   question, focusing on the election that marked the emergence of the
   Golden Dawn and permitted further electoral penetration. Combining
   qualitative and quantitative methods, we show that the party took
   advantage of favourable political circumstances developing a grassroots
   network of protection that helped it enter the central political arena.},

Abstract = {Within Australia's federal system, responsibility for preventing,
   preparing for, responding to and recovering from natural disasters is
   shared between the three tiers of government. Intergovernmental policy
   and funding arrangements are premised on shared responsibility and aim
   to foster individual, business and community resilience. These
   arrangements underpin Australia's international reputation for
   effectiveness in its management of natural disasters. The capacity of
   the diverse networks that comprise the disaster management system to
   coordinate and deliver in the preparedness and response phases of a
   disaster, and to provide relief in the immediate aftermath, has been
   developed over time and tested and refined through the experience of
   frequent, severe disaster events over recent decades. Less well
   developed is the system's ability to support economic recovery in
   disaster-affected communities over the longer term. This paper presents
   case studies of regional communities affected by two of Australia's most
   expensive and deadly natural disasters-the 2009 Victorian bushfires and
   the cyclones and floods that struck the state of Queensland in
   2010-2011. It highlights significant gaps in policy and funding
   arrangements to support recovery and offers lessons for aligning
   recovery within a resilience framework.},

Abstract = {This article synthesizes the main economic, social and political events
   that took place in Paraguay during the year 2015. Framed within the
   context of an economic slowdown, non-conventional political
   participation gained strength through social mobilizations that showed
   the Paraguayan citizen's greater capacity to articulate their demands
   and achieve their collective goals. On the other hand, the elections at
   the municipal level displayed an electoral realignment; they showed the
   widespread historical control of the incumbent party throughout the
   territory but also highlighted the potential of electoral alliances
   among opposition parties. The democratic responsiveness of Paraguay's
   political system remains in question, facing growing challenges due to
   its historical shortcomings and the increasing demands of the citizens.},

Abstract = {Whistle-blowing is usually regarded as a way to identify abuse and
   wrongdoing on the part of governments and corporations. In this paper we
   show how, at a micro level, whistle-blowing can be used as a designer
   tool to prevent opportunistic behavior, that takes the form of collusion
   or blackmail, on the part of members of a simple hierarchical structure.
   We focus on a three-layered principal-supervisor-agent structure and
   show how the principal can use whistle-blowing as a way to prevent the
   supervisor and the agent from colluding to the detriment of the
   principal.
   To understand our mechanism we need to explicitly define the penalty a
   party has to incur for walking away from a collusive agreement.
   Rewarding whistle-blowing creates incentives for the uninformed
   colluding party to walk out of the side deal and report to the principal
   that collusion took place. This threat clearly reduces the informed
   party's incentive to participate in side deals. It also serves as a
   potential blackmail threat between the colluding parties. However,
   careful use of whistle-blowing allows the principal to eliminate
   opportunities for blackmail.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the relationships between literature and cinema in
   the work of Guillermo Cabrera Infante. So there are two interrelated
   themes. In the first is suggests the reading of a trade of the century
   XX, a book usually understood as a set of critical film, as a gender
   hybrid, close to the trial and to the autobiography. The Paratext and
   footnotes of page of the author are critical. The second part is a
   review of the three scripts that Cabrera Infante wrote for film starting
   from the notion of text film.},

Abstract = {Religion and ethnicity is widely associated with the unrelenting
   Taliban-led violence in Pakistan. Their shari'a rhetoric coupled with a
   sympathetic politicoreligious constituency compounds the terrorism
   landscape for the general audience. Besides, less academic treatment of
   the phenomenon entailing analysis of its wholesome dimensions further
   constrains its understanding. Conceding the fact that religion pervades
   all aspects of contemporary conflict, this article argues that the
   present setting is neither rooted in the ethnicity nor in the religion
   literally as the conflict formation variables; it is instead governed
   since its inception by dynamics germinating from Pakhtunwali (a social
   code of conduct of tribal Pashtun), mainly its retributive imperative.
   It specifically investigates the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan's rent
   seeking, greed and hypocritical behavior, which, it contends, lies in
   the selective perversion of Pakhtunwali permeated also by the nuanced
   influence of foreign fighters. The peace advocates' claim for potential
   success in dialog with Taliban is therefore considered as misleading.
   Drawing upon an adapted theoretical framework, the article attempts to
   empirically demonstrate the viability of these assertions.},

Abstract = {This article examines representations of American Indians in a Swedish
   family magazine from the 1860s/1870s, tying these `Indian stories' to
   perceptions carried by emigrants to the Americas. It argues that these
   representations conveyed a certain notion of the colonial process that
   allowed Swedes to both participate in and disavow the more unsavoury
   aspects of what the magazine called `race wars'. An emerging discourse
   of innocence connected popular images with debates about emigration and
   scholarship in racial biology, which allowed both Swedes and
   Swedish-Americans to view themselves as modern and unconnected to the
   burdens of a colonial past.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to study a specific aspect of the Communist
   foreign propaganda policy in Latin America: its cultural influence
   through the export of films. Renewed after Stalin's death, Soviet
   cultural propaganda concentrated on gaining the favour of foreign
   public. Particularly in Argentina, several propaganda techniques were
   implemented. Although the export of films was just one of them, it soon
   became very successful thanks to the collaboration of a local cultural
   mediator, the film distribution company Artkino Pictures, as well as its
   owner and founder, Argentino Vainikoff. His expertise in the field
   actually gained him a new business deal with Czechoslovak filmography,
   which somewhat contested USSR imagery. In all, here with the aid of oral
   history as well as contemporary press analysis we argue that Artkino's
   role in the import of an idealised imaginary of Communism was crucial
   and had a particularly strong impact on middle-class citizens of the
   cultural and artistic regional centre that Buenos Aires was in the 1950s
   and 1960s, and from where all Latin America, as the Soviets soon
   acknowledged, could be reached.},

Abstract = {The possibility that today's drones could become tomorrow's killer
   robots has attracted the attention of people around the world.
   Scientists and business leaders, from Stephen Hawking to Elon Musk,
   recently signed a letter urging the world to ban autonomous weapons.
   Part of the argument against these systems is that they violate the
   public conscience provision of the Martens Clause due to public
   opposition, making them illegal under international law. What, however,
   does the US public think of these systems? Existing research suggests
   widespread US public opposition, but focused on support for autonomous
   weapons in a vacuum. This paper uses two survey experiments to test the
   conditions in which public opposition rises and falls. The results
   demonstrate that public opposition to autonomous weapons is contextual.
   Fear of other countries or non-state actors developing these weapons
   makes the public significantly more supportive of developing them. The
   public also becomes much more willing to actually use autonomous weapons
   when their use would protect US forces. Beyond contributing to ongoing
   academic debates about casualty aversion, the microfoundations of
   foreign policy, and weapon systems, these results suggest the need for
   modesty when making claims about how the public views new, unknown
   technologies such as autonomous weapons.},

Title = {RESTRUCTURING PUBLIC ACTION IN ROME Neoliberalization and the
   relationships between public and private actors},
Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {596-613},
Abstract = {The paper explores the changes in public action that have occurred over
   the last twenty years in the city of Rome, focusing on two case studies
   which represent an example of policy restructuring and depict the new
   role attributed to private initiative and investments, to the detriment
   of public roles and public property. The paper debates the interpretive
   utility of the concept of neoliberalization for understanding these
   processes of change.
   The first case study regards the privatization of a public utility in
   charge with providing water and energy; the second one focuses on the
   valorization of a public real-estate property. Both cases highlight
   processes of marketization and commodification, depicting a neoliberal
   mode of public action, widely regarded as the obvious response to the
   inefficiencies of more traditional administrative action. The
   theoretical conceptualization of neoliberalization allows one to
   approach these changes as part of a more organized and coherent
   framework, and as important moments in the neoliberalization process in
   Rome. The contextually specific and path-dependent form of this process
   can be better understood by looking at the strong alliance between
   political and private actors, in particular, those who are linked to
   real estate and land properties. This strategic relationship, in
   existence since the end of the 19th century, keeps on shaping public
   action and influencing political decisions. KEYWORDS: neoliberalization,
   urban policy, public services, urban planning, valorization of public
   properties, public and private relationships.},

Abstract = {The links between environmental degradation, renewable resource
   scarcity, and conflict are still poorly understood. One reason for this
   is the positivist-rationalist bias which is characteristic of the
   mainstream literature on socio-environment conflicts but has largely
   remained unaddressed so far. Many studies are therefore unable to
   utilize insights from environmental sociology, constructivist conflict
   research, and political ecology. Drawing on this literature and
   discourse theory, the article develops a constructivist understanding of
   socio-environmental conflicts. The proposed framework highlights the
   relevance of discursively constructed identities, situation assessments,
   and interests for understanding the dynamics of such conflicts. The
   plausibility of the framework across different contexts is demonstrated
   by a discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian water conflict and forest
   conflicts in northern Thailand.},

Abstract = {It has become broadly accepted that causal ideas affect institutional
   reforms. Now the key question is why such ideas matter. In the
   literature on ideas, uncertainty is presented as an important
   precondition for the impact of ideas. This article develops the argument
   that uncertainty makes causal ideas matter, because the ideas help
   decision makers manage uncertainty by linking problems to solutions. The
   more uncertainty about what is at stake and the consequences of
   different choices decision makers face when deciding on institutional
   reforms, the more causal ideas shape their choices of new institutional
   models. The hypothesis is probed in a cross-sectoral (telecommunications
   and electricity) and cross-national (Great Britain and Germany) analysis
   of liberalization reforms from 1980 to 2000. The analysis provides some
   support for the hypothesis, but also calls for its further development.},

Abstract = {Quarter of a century after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the
   Russian Duma, lower house of Parliament, still has a low representation
   of women. The article seeks to examine the causes for this phenomenon.
   It examines the factors that have been found to be responsible for the
   gender gap in parliaments across the world. It will then present this
   evidence in the light of the Russian experience to understand what lies
   behind the low level of representation of women in Russian national
   parliament. A mix of political, socio-economic and cultural factors will
   be analysed in detail to find the causative aspects, analysing the
   inter-linkages between these various factors in play.},

Abstract = {Investigation of the problems of modernization in the context of
   contemporary globalization megatrend is an urgent theoretical task. In
   today's Russia, we are witnessing an arbitrary manipulation of the
   modernization concept in political discourse coming from the common
   sense, which entails a danger of being detached from the reality of
   development strategies. In this respect, a comprehensive scientific
   analysis of the current phase of modernization, characterized by
   cultural diversity and multi-vector policy, undertaken by a philosopher
   and sociologist Valentina Fedotova, whose works help to find landmarks
   in a new system of coordinates, seems timely. The essay reveals the
   innovative nature of Fedotova's theory, which includes the concept of
   ``third modernity{''} as a ``new modern time for non-Western
   countries{''}, concept of ``national modernization{''} and original
   analysis of modernization typology. Special attention is paid to
   demonstration of heuristic possibilities and practical significance of
   her approach to the study of modernization processes through prism of
   cultural factor. The essay also lays out issues and future directions
   for further investigation of modernization processes, including the task
   to analyze the traditions in their development, taking into account
   patterns of intercultural interaction, exploration of the peculiarities
   of political culture of a certain country in the analysis of the ways of
   transformation of political and social institutions, etc.},

Abstract = {In the study of Irenology, in 2003, Fernandez Herreria proposed the
   concept of the Intercultural Peace, interpreted as a balance between
   Interior, Social and Gaia Peace. Our interest in this approach, the
   search for answers to questions about the overlap of the multi- and
   intercultural concepts, and about the practice of intercultural peace in
   the context of the loss of identity in the native and immigrant
   population, made us to get establish contact with different cultures. In
   Ecuador, we found rich documental information on the studied subject.
   Following the qualitative study methodology, we dida biographical
   interview with Ruth Moya, an expert in cross-cultural research and
   advisor for Intercultural Education Bilingual Programs in Latin America.
   The analysis of the state of the question and the interview allowed
   establishing parallelisms between the theoretical foundation of
   Intercultural Peace and the practice of the Sumak Kawsay indigenous
   Philosophy. As a future projection this research proposes the
   development of the anthology of diverse cultural wisdom about peace in
   order to strengthen the empirical, methodological and theoretical
   knowledge of Intercultural Peace.},

Journal = {OSTEUROPA},

Volume = {66},

Abstract = {The state is considered a key political risk for foreign investors in
   Russia. But companies can be forced from the market by competitors using
   unfair methods. This is seen in the case of Swedish mobile operator
   Tele2. The reason for this double risk is a social order in which an
   elite coalition has secured economic privileges while competitors are
   granted only limited access. Property rights are no more protected from
   political intervention than the political world is from corruption by
   powerful economic interests. Russia does not need ``more{''} state or
   ``less{''} state, but a state based on the rule of law.},

Abstract = {This study proposes a public evaluation of the Law 6/2014, approved by
   Italian Parliament to counteract a longstanding waste emergency in the
   area known as Land of Fires, in the provinces of Naples and Caserta,
   Campania region. The authors intended to explore, together with its
   recipients and from a sociological perspective, a state law, its impact,
   and the complex and interactive link between health and popular
   mobilization. It is intended, therefore, to propose a concrete idea of
   evaluation that is not impose from above and managed by neutral
   evaluators (technical experts). Based on in-depth work field, the
   evaluation process described here is configured as a non-hierarchical
   participative act, realized through a methodology aimed at encouraging
   self-control practices, taking possession of their own context by
   subjects that are not evaluated but rather co-evaluator, within a space
   of negotiation that can also become a field of conflict, open to
   different interpretations.},

Title = {THE OFFICIAL HISTORICAL NARRATIVE AS A PART OF IDENTITY POLICY OF THE
   RUSSIAN STATE: FROM THE 1990s TO THE 2000s},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2016},
Number = {6},
Pages = {139-158},
Abstract = {The article explores a particular aspect of the identity policy of the
   Russian state - an evolution of the official historical narrative
   describing a genealogy of the nation. It is highly important for
   legitimization of the political regime as an ``explanation{''} of
   continuity between collective past, present and future. The research is
   based on the theoretical frame that conceptualizes a historical
   component of identity politics and reveals factors that influence its
   structure in the contemporary Russian context. The author argues that
   there were two large periods in the development of the official
   narrative based on different conceptions - that of ``the new Russia{''}
   and of ``the thousand-years-long Russia{''}. These periods roughly
   coincide with presidency of Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin - Drain
   Medvedev. The construction of the new narrative maintaining the Russian
   identity was complicated by a necessity to match two principally
   different cultural models of political work at the past - that of
   ``coping with a difficult past / collective trauma{''} and aimed at
   consolidation of the nation / nation-building. There were different
   approaches to this political task in different periods. In the 1990s the
   official narrative had integrated discourse about ``trauma and crime{''}
   as a part of legitimization of the post-Soviet transformation, but it
   could not manage to consolidate the nation. In the 2000s the choice was
   made for apologetic principle of work with collective past which
   resulted in the eclectic construction that marginalizes the topic of
   ``trauma and crime{''}. In the 2010s we can see some attempts to make
   the official narrative more consistent which bring ambivalent results.
   On the one hand, in the context of the current international conflict
   the apologetic conception of the national past is securitized as a
   ``weapon{''} against the foreign and domestic enemies. On the other
   hand, a new round of discussions about the national history opens some
   windows of opportunities for actors struggling for ``coping with
   difficult past{''} agenda.},

Abstract = {The Spanish transition, the political process through which Spain ceased
   to be a dictatorship to become a democracy, was accompanied by the
   dissolution of the National Movement, the institutional support for the
   chain of the Movement Press from its beginnings, in April 1977. This
   fact, among others, contributed to the /Sur/, the regional reference
   newspaper for the chain in Andalusia, evolving both structurally and
   ideologically to adapt itself to the new political regime.
   This study applies content analysis to editorials, articles and columns
   published by the newspaper between 1975 and 1978, exploring the process
   through which the regional newspaper edited in Malaga abandoned its
   propaganda function with regard to the Government, considering it
   undemocratic, and supported the PSOE, presenting it as the best
   alternative to the UCD in the Spanish Executive, thus taking on its role
   as a political agent.},

Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-77},
Abstract = {This article explores the conceptualization of `reconciliation' within
   modern Northern Irish nationalist discourse. I argue that the case of
   Northern Irish nationalism adds a new dimension to those understandings
   that remain currently underappreciated within the literature. The
   article charts how reconciliation becomes operationalized as a
   restrictive politics both despite and because of it being framed in a
   language of pluralism, restoration and openness. While this process
   points towards the constitution of a political and ideological
   community, the concept of reconciliation also precipitates contestation
   and competition - not simply over memory but over a moral vision of the
   (violent) past. As such, I argue that reconciliation is not so much
   about the past but about ideological reframing(s). The case of Northern
   Irish nationalism, then, suggests that those reframings - a closing down
   and an opening up of debate - take place simultaneously within the
   rhetoric of reconciliation.},

Abstract = {Recent years have witnessed major changes to German migration policy,
   including most notably policy concerning labour migration. The
   restrictive approach associated with the end of active recruitment in
   1973 has been gradually abandoned. Since 2000, a variety of
   liberalisation measures have been pursued, facilitating legal labour
   migration and making German skilled migration provisions fairly liberal
   by international comparison. Though this would appear to mark a radical
   departure from the past, unlike the post-war era, the focus rests firmly
   on the recruitment of skilled immigrants. This article adopts a
   comparative political economy (CPE) angle in analysing recent policy
   developments, arguing that employer preferences typical of a coordinated
   market economy (CME) are being articulated and help shape the policy
   agenda. A brief comparison of the CMEs in Austria and Sweden is pursued
   to explore the promise of a CPE approach. In empirical terms, the
   article seeks to address the question in what fashion organised business
   manages to shape the agenda. In theoretical terms, the article seeks to
   assess the utility of a CPE-inspired approach for the study of migration
   policy making.},

Abstract = {In the wide critical reviews that the enterprise of Begriffsgeschichte
   has triggered, the difficult relationship that conceptual history - in
   its Koselleckian declination - entertains with systemic theory has
   remained maybe underexposed until now. Moving from the tension between
   experience and historicity in Koselleck, the article reflects on the
   tensions that the historical-conceptual structure reveals as soon as it
   comes into contact with the problems of historical semantics that
   accompany the Luhmannian attempt of operating, in the register of second
   order observation, a temporal dislocation and a de-paradoxification of
   the paradox activated by Derrida's differance, as constitutive of
   historicity. The blind spot at the bottom of Luhmannian gaze cuts out
   the borders of the ``history{''} continent along the lines of the
   shipwreck of the classic semantics of modernity.},

   the paper is to identify the uses, abuses and oblivions that the

   commemoration of the Colombia Bicentennial. Therefore, by adopting an
   interpretative and comparative approach based on different sources the
   paper is structured around the idea of a struggle between the history
   known as official and those elements of memory that have been forgotten
   or silenced. Furthermore, according to E. Jelin there is even a tendency
   to mobilize such a struggle during relevant holidays.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},

Volume = {26},

Abstract = {In this article, we are interested in the extent to which federalism is
   able to deal with peripheral protest through shared rule channels.
   Shared rule as a key dimension of federal states has not thus far
   received adequate academic attention. Empirically, we analyse the use of
   all cantonal initiatives in Switzerland over the past 25 years as a
   particular instrument of shared rule, subsequently focusing on two
   peripheral regions with successful regionalist parties, Ticino and
   Geneva. We find that regionalist parties contribute towards radicalizing
   peripheral demands in search of attention from the centre. This leads to
   the mainstreaming of peripheral demands by pulling other parties along.
   We conclude that shared rule properly designed gives even the most
   peripheral regions a voice in national decisions, but that regionalist
   parties may also use shared rule instruments to mobilize their
   electorate at home to fight their non-regionalist competitors.},

Abstract = {As Min argues, any defense of democracy must include an epistemic
   element. But this does not mean that the will of the majority always
   tends to be right. It means only that we cannot identify in advance a
   minority that is likelier to get it right than everyone else. This fact
   is consistent with the possibility, even the likelihood, that the
   majority will more often be wrong than right. Those who find themselves
   in the minority should not be cowed into submission by the overall
   epistemic advantage of democracy: in any given case, a dissenter from
   the majority view may be right. Likewise, institutions such as parties
   are crucial in allowing minorities-and majorities-to persevere. Not only
   parties, but practices of dissent and opposition more broadly, are
   inseparable from the epistemic case for democracy.},

   the development of the ``China Dream{''} concept, officially introduced
   by China President Xi Jinping in 2012. The article also covers the
   issues of its implementation in Chinese domestic and partly foreign
   policy. Major differences between the ``China Dream{''} and previous
   concepts are pointed out; a special attention is drawn to the special
   features of the new general line in politics. The author describes a new
   stage of reforms in China, demonstrates the logic of the Chinese
   government and shows the connection between the conducted reforms and
   the new concept. Various opinions and points of view concerning the
   ``China Dream{''} concept (expressed both by experts and in the ruling
   Chinese Communist Party) have been also compared.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {517-543},
Abstract = {Robust political economy is the attempt to theorize about political
   institutions in such a way as to guard against the knowledge and
   incentive problems that we can expect will threaten the public good in
   the real world. An implication of this attempt is the need to reason
   symmetrically about whether a proposed institution is liable to be as
   prone to failure due to knowledge and incentive problems as the
   situations it is designed to address. Another implication is that one
   should be wary of ad hoc institutional or policy proposals, that is,
   proposals that are not grounded in systematic tendencies to mitigate the
   knowledge and incentive problems. With these implications in mind, I am
   not convinced that the alternative institutions, conceptions of the
   state, and conceptions of social justice defended by my critics meet the
   test of robustness that, I maintain, can best be met through
   decentralization of power down to the level of the individual.},

Title = {POSSIBILITIES OF SPATIAL APPROACH IN ANALYSIS OF ETHNOPOLITICAL
   CONFLICTS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2016},
Number = {6},
Pages = {127-138},
Abstract = {The article analyzes the possibilities of use of spatial approach in
   applied and conceptual analysis of ethnopolitical conflicts. The
   `spatial' turn in social sciences de facto hasn't yet affected this area
   of research. But it's obvious that the spatial approach in consideration
   of its unrealized cognitive potential may be helpful in study of this
   type of conflicts in multiethnic societies. While constructing
   multi-dimentional model of political space in studying diversified
   phenomena of political life and multi-level political process, the
   researcher can separate ethnic borders, distinctions and distances
   between individuals and between communities, and thereby reveal and fix
   an ethnic component of political conflicts, observe and forecast its
   dynamics. The use of the category of ``political identity{''} and the
   identification of identity spaces in spatial analysis of ethnopolitical
   conflicts allow to analyze dynamics of (ethno)territorial communities
   construction, to study phenomena and process of the politicization of
   ethnicity and ethnic cleavages, the public policy of formation of
   competitive and contentious identities in plural societies for assessing
   the peculiarity of conflict dynamics and degree of its localization,
   validity of conflicting parties claims over disputable issues and their
   readiness to compromise. Detecting the degree of leadership and
   influence of various political actors in the political spaces of
   different levels in analysis of ethnopolitical conflicts gives a chance
   of defining and typologizing conflicting parties and participants,
   estimating degree of the conflict asymmetry and studying the activity of
   its external participants and their role in conflict dynamics,
   transformation and management. Using the category of political space the
   spatial analysis at micro- and macro-level and in diverse measurements -
   subnational, national, transnational and global, the researcher can
   detect, explore and appraise degree of influence of external
   participants of the conflict, which aren't the conflicting parties and
   whose activities sometimes are kept silent about or intentionally hided.},

   war face punishment from two sources: internal audiences and opponents.
   I hypothesize that leaders who bear responsibility for involvement in
   the war have a higher expectation of punishment from both sources
   following unfavorable war performance, and thus, have incentives to
   continue the fight in the hope of turning the tide and avoiding the
   negative consequences of defeat. These incentives, in turn, make leaders
   who bear responsibility more likely to fight to an extreme outcome and
   less likely to make concessions to end the war. These propositions are
   tested on an original data set identifying all rebel and state leaders
   in all civil conflict dyads ongoing between 1980 and 2011. Results
   support the hypothesized relationships between leader responsibility and
   war outcomes.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the effects of the increased role of party
   organizations in the recruitment and funding of congressional candidates
   in the US House post-1994. The recent uncertainty over which party will
   gain majority control of the House has transformed the role of party
   organizations in House campaigns. Despite the new resources devoted to
   each competitive seat in the House we find minimal changes in the
   overall competitiveness of US House elections. Additionally, the vast
   majority of potentially competitive seats do not draw a high quality
   challenger. Our results suggest that if parties recruited more quality
   candidates in the full range of these conceivably winnable seats this
   effort could produce more competitive seats or more seat turnover in the
   House.},

Pages = {422-433},
Abstract = {This essay offers a socialist feminist postcolonial interpretation of
   the Anthropocene concept as used in recent ecocriticism. In contesting
   the rigid positioning of Humanity over Nature, the paper draws on the
   Marxist psychoanalytic theory of non-identity in Theodor Adorno (1973)
   and Julia Kristeva (1973, 1977, 1978). Making an ecofeminist
   contribution to the new field of environmental humanities, it engages
   critically with the perspective of prominent US scholar Timothy Morton
   (2012). Its embodied materialist argument is that contemporary
   Eurocentric institutions, science, and philosophies are indeed shaped by
   affect as Morton believes, but not in the way that he envisages. In
   addition, it is suggested that the socialist feminist postcolonial
   politics of ecofeminism is already challenging the inevitable
   universality of the Anthropocene by building an Earth Democracy with
   epistemologies of care. It is concluded that understanding the
   Anthropocene notion, a phenomenon that is profoundly gendered, requires
   more than thinking in ``deep geological time.{''} Ultimately, all
   ecological awareness will demand a capacity for thinking in ``deep
   libidinal time.{''}},

Abstract = {The paper tests the hypothesis about the similarity of the social origin
   of the commanders of volunteer battalions that distinguished themselves
   with the beginning of the military operations in South-East Ukraine. On
   the basis of a comparative analysis of the biographies of more than 50
   Ukrainian and ``Novorossiyan{''} commanders, the authors show that the
   latter, at the very best case, belong to the lower middle class. The
   results of the research conducted by the authors make us look with a
   critical eye at some of the major tenets of the popular theories of
   democratization and modernization that explain transition to democracy
   by the extension or maturation of the middle class. On the one hand,
   this reflects the specificity of the post-Soviet space, where the other,
   less privileged social groups play a vital role in the political regime
   transformation rather than ``the angry citizens{''}. On the other hand,
   this allows us to put the political processes unfolding in South-Eastern
   Ukraine into the global processes.},

   the mediated peace talks on the conflict in eastern Ukraine - the Minsk
   Process. Drawing from the author's insider perspective, it sheds light
   on the unique aspects of the framework compared to classical mediation
   processes. It argues that, due to its connectivity with high-level
   diplomacy as well as its ability to adapt to a constantly evolving
   conflict, the Minsk Process represents a valuable, flexible, at times
   untypical, mediation framework.},

   Presidents' Trajectories of Rising Notability (1960-1999)},

Abstract = {Composed primarily of regional business leaders, the population of
   French professional football club presidents is particularly rich for
   sociological study. Coming from modest families and typified by lower
   educational levels, these men escape the most common modes of elite
   social (re)production. While access to dominant positions was
   overwhelmingly determined by the educational system and/or family
   legacies in France in the latter half of the twentieth century, they
   represent an atypical population characterized by the originality of the
   path its members took to achieve an eminent position. While the
   literature has thus far focused on cases of social mobility through
   education, this article highlights another, very different modality of
   ascension based on other advantages and other circuits of legitimation.
   By showing that these rising businessmen's access to national visibility
   results from a long trajectory of increasing notability with strong
   local rootedness, the article aims to both give an account of
   little-studied forms of social mobility and provide some elements for
   characterizing a group that has been overlooked in the literature: the
   business petite-bourgeoisie.},

Title = {The Counterrevolutionary Campus: Herbert Marcuse and the Suppression of
   Student Protest Movements},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {38},
Number = {4},
Pages = {516-532},
Abstract = {With the recent surge of college protests against various forms of
   economic, political, social, and racial injustice, there have been
   persistent and pernicious reactions from other students, administrators
   and public figures that function to undermine the emancipatory impulses
   animating these demonstrations. The reactions are often justified under
   the banners of tolerance, chastising students to listen instead of
   protest. This article, focusing on Marcuse's concepts of repressive
   toleration and counterrevolution, evaluates the reactionary responses to
   these events, as well as the critical potential of this fledgling
   student sensibility, a burgeoning refusal represented by protest events
   at American universities. We maintain that many of the calls for
   tolerance are actually demands for silence and belong to a wider
   counterrevolutionary phase of late capitalism observed by Marcuse.
   Bedrock liberties are dialectically inverted whereby speech and
   toleration are repressively deployed against demands for justice. This
   article concludes by arguing that it is crucial to the success of this
   resurgent sensibility for justice-and progress toward a radical
   socialist movement that coincides with the emancipatory vision of
   Herbert Marcuse-that the counterrevolutionary character of the responses
   are demystified.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {61-93},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the challenges to democratic representation in
   contemporary Chile, with an institutional focus. I argue that the
   post-authoritarian model of politics was deeply constrained by
   institutions and practices inherited by democratic authorities and
   reinforced by the model of transitional politics and its series of
   informal institutions, which first facilitated, but then hindered
   democratic performance. While this does not point to a
   regime-threatening crisis, there are deep challenges to representation
   and a desire for a different model of politics that is more capable of
   resolving conflicts and satisfying citizen demands. I posit that, until
   now, Chile's formal and informal institutions have privileged stability
   over representation, accountability, and legitimacy. Consequently, it
   has fallen to social movements to set the agenda for change aimed at
   addressing Chile's deeper problems of political and social inequality. I
   argue that institutional reforms are a necessary, yet insufficient,
   antidote to current challenges of representation.},

Abstract = {Recent interest in communism as an idea prompts reconsideration of
   Walter Benjamin's conception of a ``communist'' aesthetic politics. In
   spite of Benjamin's categorical condemnation of aestheticized politics,
   his ``artwork essay'' is better read as both explicit condemnation of a
   particular (regressive fascist) type of aestheticized politics and
   implicit commendation of another (progressive communist) type. Under the
   modern conditions of the technological reproducibility of art, and mass
   politics, the character of and relationship between the cultural value
   spheres of politics and aesthetics also changes. Benjamin analyzes
   dialectically the actuality of the fascist response to modern mass arts
   and politics in which technology and society are misaligned, and the
   potentiality of a communist response that would bring about a collective
   interplay of humanity and technology.},

Abstract = {Mediation and dialogue facilitation are at the heart of the Organization
   for Security and Co-operation in Europes's (OSCE) engagements, and have
   become widely-recognised as being among the most effective means for the
   prevention, management and resolution of conflicts both, in terms of
   costs and results. 1 The OSCE has however started with a different set
   of mechanisms to settle conflicts, such as the Valletta mechanism or the
   Conciliation Committee. This article examines these mechanisms and
   elaborates on the reasons why they have never been applied. It further
   describes the evolvement of new instruments, in particular, its
   mediation and dialogue facilitation capacities. Further, the OSCE has
   institutionalised an explicit mediation support capacity to provide
   adequate assistance, similar to the UN and the EU. Without a doubt, the
   OSCE can be clearly regarded as a mediator. The article presents the
   OSCE'S different roles of being a mediator and its struggle for
   principles like inclusivity and efficiency, or impartiality and
   neutrality. The stocktaking of mechanisms and instruments and the OSCE'S
   role as a mediator concludes with the Organization's weaknesses and
   strengths, and respective recommendations for further development.},

   societies},
Journal = {CIVIL WARS},

Volume = {18},

Pages = {255-280},
Abstract = {There is currently a lack of knowledge about how elites rule post-civil
   war societies without strong state institutions. This paper argues that
   elites oftentimes overcome such institutional deficiencies by engaging
   in governance through brokerage. According to this perspective, elites
   outsource central state functions to influential broker figures. This is
   particularly true when dealing with war-affected groups that possess
   much violent agency. By functioning as social membranes, brokers can
   help elites and war-affected groups to redefine a new social contract.
   Liberia is employed as an example to illustrate the paper's central
   arguments.},

Abstract = {The essay explores some of the processes through which the ``working
   class{''} emerged both as a collective subjectivity and as a field of
   social science inquiry and public policies in 19th century France.
   Starting from the 1831 Canuts revolt, widely recognized as the stepping
   stone of the European workers' movement, the first part retraces the
   process of the `making' of a social and political subjectivity by
   stressing the relevance of its linguistic and discursive dimension. The
   second part examines the emergence of the empiric method of the modern
   social sciences through new strategies of inquiry on urban misery, which
   progressively focuses on the `working class' and on labour conditions as
   a field of knowledge, rights, and governmental practices.},

Pages = {36-50},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article explores the relationship between competitive
   authoritarianism and popular protest. Building upon comparative regime
   analysis and social movement research, it argues that this hybrid regime
   type facilitates popular protest by providing opposition forces with
   considerable institutional resources to organize themselves and confront
   regime elites, along with grievances that provide strong incentives for
   popular challenges. In turn, popular protest may trigger regime crisis
   and extract important concessions from regime incumbents. In the long
   run, popular politics strongly shapes the interests, identities and
   capacities of regime elites and opposition forces, as well as the
   regime's formal and/or informal institutions, and may lead to government
   change and/or regime change. Evidence is provided from Serbia under
   Miloevi, which experienced massive opposition protest campaigns in 1991,
   1992, 1996-1997, 1999 and 2000, which resulted in regime change.},

   police forces. Even though there are not many essays about this issue,
   the existing ones emphasize the lack of cooperation, the abuse by police
   forces and, to a lesser degree, the formal cooperation between these
   social actors (Goubaud, 2009; IsDP, 2010.).This review essay analyzes
   some of the main trends on this topic. We emphasize police legitimacy
   among youth, youth resistance to police abuse, and the criminalization
   of youth by police forces and judges. The scholarship reviewed in this
   essay describes the relationships between police forces and youth in
   some cities, particularly in urban neighborhoods and outskirts. Most of
   these studies agree in the conflictive character of these relationships
   and warn about their implications for the construction of safe cities
   and the recognition of young people as rights bearing subjects (IsDP,
   2010; Vanderschueren eta., 2011). This essay is structured around three
   recurrent topics in the literature: legitimacy, conflictive interaction,
   and police abuse. Most of the studies reviewed are centered on
   adolescent men; we have almost not found studies that differentiate
   between genders. Therefore, to understand the variations between men and
   women is part of a pending research agenda.},

Abstract = {Economic, cultural and political systems formerly bounded by the borders
   of nation states are increasingly globalized. Politicians, civil society
   and other societal actors engage in publically debating issues related
   to globalization. Whether conflicts consolidate to form a stable
   cleavage depends among other factors on the extent to which they become
   ideologically underpinned. As the basis for such an underpinning, we
   identify philosophical debates about justice between globalists and
   statists and between universalists and contextualists as raw material
   that political entrepreneurs active in the public sphere can draw upon.
   On this basis, we identify four major bones of contention that could
   provide the core of such ideological underpinning: the permeability of
   borders; the allocation of authority between levels; the normative
   dignity of communities; and the patterns of justification. One ideal
   typical combination of those four components can be labelled
   cosmopolitanism-combining arguments from globalists and universalists;
   another communitarianism, combining statist and contextualist arguments.
   The more these two ideal types feature as political ideologies in public
   debate, the more do debates about globalization solidify into a new
   cleavage. We develop a conceptual framework which can subsequently be
   used in support of empirical research analysing the ideological
   foundations of globalization conflicts.},

Abstract = {The study of the component of the political legitimacy in particular
   from the perspective of Islamic-Iranian intellectual trends during the
   third to eight centuries A.H. shows the drawing of a pyramid-shape
   society either from the viewpoint of political philosophy or other
   trends. In this case, the views of Farabi, Avicenna, Khajeh Nasir and
   other thinkers can be referred to, such that it will be possible to
   establish a common attribute among the ideal king society, philosopher
   king and Imam or Sultan within the framework of Iranian-Islamic
   political thought. Of course all thinkers consider some distinguishing
   features for the head and ruler based on their own thoughts and
   analyses. However, accepting the belief of ``Imamate{''}, {[}The Shia
   Islamic Doctrine], the Shiites placed the concept of legitimacy within a
   specific framework based on the rule of grace and also Qur-anic exact
   text. Imam is the legitimate ruler and he is the one who has been
   determined and appointed based on the exact text from the predecessor of
   Ali (a.s.), from the generation of Fatemeh (s) and from the branch of
   Hussein ibn Ali, so if it occurs, it is legitimate, i.e. it is based on
   religious laws. Keywords: political},

Abstract = {On the eve of the Constitutional Convention, James Madison developed a
   new theory of republicanism, one that would allow union on a scale
   previously thought impossible. The extended republic, buttressed by
   constitutional safeguards republican in nature, would, he argued,
   protect the rights of minorities without compromising the majority's
   right to rule. But Convention delegates, unimpressed with Madison's new
   theory, gravitated toward constitutional safeguards more mixed-regime in
   nature and so produced a constitution incompletely republican. This
   article examines the three minority interests that most occupied the
   delegates' attention: small states, all states, and southern states;
   further, it employs three criteria for determining the presence of
   republican or mixed-regime protections: strength of constitutional
   barrier, cohesion of defenders, and duration of defense. The article's
   conclusion reflects on the consequences of a constitution partly
   republican and partly mixed-regime.},

Abstract = {Literature discussing the factors in government and parliament that
   cause of gridlock is limited in examining cases that occur in contexts
   where the democratic principle of `inclusion' expands. This paper
   analyzes the legislative gridlock revealed in the process of the South
   Korean government's efforts to pass the Bill of Financial Consumer
   Protection, beginning in July 2012, from the perspective of overlapping
   political conflicts among multi-scalar actors. Research shows that the
   government's desire to reform financial supervisory governance created
   two cleavages among the multi-scalar actors because of their long-held
   political interest in the Bill. The conflict intensified as the
   cleavages overlapped and were presented as one big issue in the history
   of Korea's financial supervision, which directly facilitated the
   gridlock. This paper identifies academic implications to advance the
   study of gridlock and its policy implications, including the need to
   develop an inter-scalar mediator, which has negative effects on the
   quality of democracy.},

Abstract = {The 2014 European Parliament elections were held against the backdrop of
   the worst economic crisis in post-war Europe. The elections saw an
   unprecedented surge in support for Eurosceptic parties. This raises the
   question of whether the crisis, and the EU's response to it, can explain
   the rise of Eurosceptic parties. Our analysis of the 2014 European
   Election Study demonstrates that the degree to which individuals were
   adversely affected by the crisis and their discontent with the EU's
   handling of the crisis are major factors in explaining defection from
   mainstream pro-European to Eurosceptic parties in these elections. This
   suggests that far from being second-order national elections concerned
   only with domestic politics, European issues had a significant impact on
   vote choices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Several political and academic circles have considered microfinance to
   be an important tool to promote economic development and the reduction
   of poverty. It became a worldwide phenomenon, and the practice
   disseminated in many developing countries such as Brazil. Even as many
   authors sing the praises of microfinance-in particular the success in
   developing countries-the actual experience has fallen short. The goal in
   this article is to provide a critical analysis of the recent practices
   of microfinance in Brazil. The article also presents the general
   characteristics of microcredit in Brazil within the context of the
   broader development strategy pursued, in particular since stabilization
   and the inception of neoliberal policies in the mid-1990s. It is argued
   that microfinance plays an insidious role, making market-friendly
   solutions for social problems more acceptable.},

Abstract = {Many studies have shown that individual religiosity is related to a
   Christian Democratic vote. Recently, studies from sociology of religion
   have reported the rise of holistic spirituality. This paper is the first
   to examine the effects of holistic spirituality on party choice. In
   addition, it critically assesses the assertion that conventional
   religiosity prevents individuals from affiliating with Green parties.
   Our results show that spirituality is related to a higher probability of
   choosing Green parties. Moreover, conventional religiosity increases the
   probability that moderate left voters will prefer a Green party to a
   Social Democratic party. This result shows that there is common ground
   between the electorates of Green and Christian Democratic parties, thus
   creating possibilities for new political coalitions. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {Variations in presidential leadership in France},
Journal = {FRENCH POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {505-526},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The centerpiece of this analysis is about the variations in presidential
   leadership of the seven French presidents under the Fifth Republic. The
   analysis of the political conditions of the method of government aims to
   locate the type and the nature of the presidential leadership of each of
   the seven French presidents. The acquisition of presidential leadership
   effectively starts with the way leaders win office. They are elected by
   direct universal suffrage, and they have therefore a strong legitimacy.
   To the extent that presidential leadership is conceived as a special
   activity in terms of a president's ability to identify goals, to
   mobilize support and to bring about substantive change, these skills
   enable a president to perform these different tasks and to fulfill a
   successful leadership role. Developing and maintaining close
   relationships with other political actors provide the principal
   resources of a president. In France, the appointment of the prime
   minister, ministers and advisors is important, as well as relations with
   the high civil service. But, above all, the relations between the
   president and public opinion are of major importance in terms of
   authority and power. Finally, the reputation of a president depends on
   the ability to solve the problems facing the country. It is measured by
   opinion polls that provide the level of satisfaction felt by public
   opinion with regard to the policy of the president. Applying the concept
   of leadership through the three factors of skills, relations and
   reputations helps to understand the performance of French presidents.
   Only General de Gaulle was able to demonstrate a high level of
   leadership. He had a very strong presidential style, with great
   qualities of communication. Some even talked about his charisma. The
   leadership of General de Gaulle's successors suffered from the
   comparison. It seems that the most recent presidents are victims of the
   weakness, even perhaps the collapse, of their leadership.},

Abstract = {This paper explores and compares, through the use of qualitative
   techniques, the new perceptions of insecurity generated over the last
   years among the neighbors of two urban neighborhoods in Peru and the
   respective neighborhood protection mechanisms implemented in response.
   On the one hand, the Ronda Urbana of the Agua de Pajaritos neighborhood
   in Huamachuco district, La Libertad department, and on the other hand,
   the security grilles and watchmen of the La Huerta neighborhood, in
   Rimac district, Lima department. While both neighborhoods take place in
   different urban environments, in both cases we find common
   characteristics that allow us to approach to eh insecurity perceptions
   and the visions about security provision, sometimes contradictory to the
   ideal about civic coexistent in modern cities.},

Abstract = {The Schengen Agreement is widely regarded as one of the greatest
   achievements of internal integration by the European Union. Free
   movement of people, goods, and capital in the Schengen Area is a great
   experiment in the whole history of human kind. However, not all of the
   European Union Member States are involved, or totally involved in this
   process. Some countries like the UK and Ireland chose to opt out. Other
   countries which newly joined the EU like Romania, Bulgaria, and Croatia
   are still striving to meet all the conditions. Even within the Schengen
   states, old states and new states have different authorities in several
   aspects such as visa policies. The Schengen Agreement is helping the
   European integration. However, different states have chosen different
   relationships with it and caused three categories of states: associated
   Schengen State, new Schengen State, and semi-Schengen State. Therefore,
   Schengen is an ``imperfect integration'' caused by differentiation. The
   purpose of Schengen is to unite European countries. However, it
   alienated some countries from others.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {132-146},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {In his recent book The Royalist Revolution: Monarchy and the American
   Founding, Eric Nelson provides an ingenious and imaginative argument
   that aims at nothing less than replacing the present standard
   interpretation of the constitutional history of the American Revolution
   with a new one that stresses the Royalist thinking of the major American
   revolutionaries. Unfortunately, however, Nelson's account does not
   uncover any phenomena of which previous historians were unaware, nor
   does it present a more compelling explanation of the phenomena that it
   treats. The apparent turn to ``Royalism{''} among American intellectual
   leaders in the early 1770s is much more plausibly understood as a
   reaction to assertions of parliamentary sovereignty than as a genuinely
   held political principle, and the constitutional changes of the 1780s
   are more plausibly understood as rational responses to the excesses of
   democracy in the years following the Declaration of Independence than as
   attempts to revive the royal prerogative.},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Several studies have noted a surge in political dissatisfaction but
   there is no agreement on the consequences for democracy. This
   disagreement is often treated as a question of degree of dissatisfaction
   but can also suggest the existence of different kinds of political
   dissatisfaction. This article therefore examines the existence of
   difference kinds of political dissatisfaction and the link to protest
   participation, since this is frequently tied to political
   dissatisfaction. The data used comes from the fourth round of the
   European Social Survey from 2008 and includes 25 democratic European
   countries and with 47489 respondents. The results suggest the existence
   of three distinct and discrete types of political disatisfaction. Only
   one of these is linked to protest, a behaviour frequently performed by
   satisifed citizens. These results show the potential of treating
   political dissatisfaction as a problem of kind rather than degree.},

Abstract = {The popularity of European Radical Right Populist parties (RRPs) has led
   to investigations into the distances between RRPs' and other parties'
   stances regarding immigration. This article adds to this literature by
   investigating the distance between RRPs and the other parties on a wider
   variety of typical RRP policy and style issues. Based on an Expert
   Survey organized in 2010, we consider ideological (immigration,
   nationalism, law and order) and style (anti-establishment, populism)
   dimensions. Furthermore, we examine to what extent characteristics of
   other parties and RRPs (ideological position, electoral success, being
   in office) are associated with these distances. Our results show that
   right-wing (neo-)conservative and Christian-democratic parties are
   closest, while green and socialist parties are furthest to RRPs
   regarding ideological dimensions. The opposite is found for the style
   dimensions. Additionally, we show that the other parties'
   characteristics, rather than those of RRPs, are associated with
   ideological and style distances between RRPs and other parties.},

Abstract = {The Economic Freedom Index published by the Heritage Foundation ranks
   South Africa at 72nd out of 178 countries in terms of economic freedom
   in 2015. This index classifies South Africa as moderately free in terms
   of its level of economic freedom. While the country may be in the middle
   of the pack on the Economic Freedom Index, it is also often classified
   as one of the most unequal societies in the world. South Africa is often
   seen in the top five unequal countries globally with a high
   Gini-coefficient, and when using the Palma index (measuring the ratio of
   income share between the top 10 per cent and bottom 40 per cent), South
   Africa can also be classified as highly unequal. Therefore a
   contradiction seems to exist. While South Africa ranks as economically
   moderately free on one hand, the country is also regarded as one of the
   most unequal societies in the world, on the other hand. It is this
   contradiction that brings to the fore a contested ideological
   construction of economic freedom within its political narrative premised
   on a view that the promise of democracy had not delivered. This article
   presents a critical discourse analysis of the contested interpretations
   of economic freedom through the lens of securing liberation and the
   promise of democracy in South Africa: a promise built on the Freedom
   Charter's construction of a democratic South Africa.},

Abstract = {Proprietary value is one of the conditions related to the considerations
   (price and sold object) in a sale contract. Property has been defined by
   legal experts in several ways including the idea that property should
   have the capability to be changed to money, to have value, and to be
   demanded by human will. According to Article 348 of Civil Code of the
   Islamic Republic of Iran, the sale of something that is not (describable
   as) property or which can bring no reasonable profit is null. In this
   regard, time and place circumstances play an important role in the
   determination of proprietary value. Famous legal experts and jurists
   have proposed different ideas about proprietary value so that the
   criterion for identification of proprietary value of a good has been
   regarded either religious or customary. This article tries to introduce
   proprietary value, time and place circumstances, and different ideas
   about proprietary value as a condition for contracts.},

Title = {Which members? Using cross-national surveys to study party membership},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {22},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Reports of party membership have documented steep declines in formal
   enrollment in many countries, but numbers alone tell us little about the
   systemic causes or likely implications of such drops. Existing
   cross-national surveys can help illuminate the extent and consequences
   of these changes. Unfortunately, they are difficult to use for this
   purpose because differences in question wording and institutional
   differences in the meaning of party membership produce unstable results.
   This paper proposes to overcome these obstacles by using behavioral
   measures of party membership in survey-based studies of party
   membership. We demonstrate that such measures produce results which are
   more consistent across surveys and therefore more meaningful. We then
   illustrate their utility by using a behaviorally-qualified measure to
   study how party membership decline has affected parties' ability to
   mobilize grassroots partisan participation. Our analysis also shows that
   even though reported party membership declined from the 1990s to the
   2000s, there was surprisingly little change in this decade in the number
   of politically active partisans.},

Abstract = {Judicial system of a society is responsible for consolidation and
   durability of its citizen's mental and physical, personal and social
   health and judges bear decision making about citizens' life, the
   freedom, rights, duties and estates. One of the items contained in
   United Nations' charter is creating the conditions which in it, it is
   provided justice, respect to human's rights and basic freedoms without
   any discrimination. With this purpose, countries' judicial system should
   have full safety and in order that anti-corruption laws find run
   opportunity, it is natural that at first judicial system should be safe
   from corruption.
   Writers in this study are paid to investigate reasons and fields of
   judicial's corruption to achieve available best procedures in countries'
   internal courts and judicial system with the aim of offering global
   standards and it is introduced available tools to qualitative increase
   of supervision and establishment of judicial's security. After reviewing
   available national and international standards, this article is paid to
   offer solutions in the direction of judicial system safety's promotion
   of Islamic Republic of Iran, assuming that the results of such approach
   will be increasing of public welfare and trust toward Islamic
   government.},

Abstract = {Telesforo Monzon (1904-1981) was a prominent leader of the Basque
   Nationalist Party (PNV) and member of the Basque Government during the
   Second Republic, the Civil War and the post-war period. From the 1960s
   on, he supported the radical nationalism of ETA and eventually became
   one of the main leaders of Herri Batasuna. This article analyses
   Monzon's political and ideological evolution, looking for clues to
   explain its complex and apparently contradictory development. The
   article argues that is was a union between nationalism and religion, on
   the one hand, and a populist conception of politics, on the other hand,
   which provided the continuity that allowed Monzon to evolve from being
   an adherent of Sabino Arana's nationalism to supporting ETA's radical
   version.},

Abstract = {The paper aims to investigate the role of Fernando Henrique Cardoso's
   ideas about globalization in choosing the diplomatic guidelines for his
   role as Minister of Foreign Affairs (1992-1993) and President of Brazil
   (1995-2002). Taking advantage of the historical institutionalist
   approach of Skopcol (1979) and Gourevitch (1986) about the influence of
   ideological factors on policy choices and Hermann's (1980) theory on the
   role of leadership in foreign policy, the article analyzes behaviors,
   preferences, goals and strategic calculations of the main political
   actors in Brazil's international integration after the Cold War. The
   options of Fernando Henrique Cardoso to strengthen the Brazilian
   alignment with developed countries, improve the relationship with global
   markets, renew international credentials and expand possibilities at the
   regional level guided his presidential diplomacy. In this mission,
   Cardoso was aided by auxiliary able to interpret, vocalize, strengthen
   and implement his main external ideas and choices. The relation between
   political thinking and international practice, permeated by institutions
   capable of historically delimit the objectives, goals, alliances,
   coalitions and strategies of the political actor, is of great importance
   for understanding Brazilian foreign policy dilemmas in a period of rapid
   transformation. In this sense, the presidential diplomacy of the Cardoso
   years, reflecting the parallel movements of State modernization and
   economic opening, is a relevant issue to understand Brazil in the 1990s.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the impact of constitutional rules on parliamentary
   dissolution, government termination and duration with a particular focus
   on the likely effects of UK's Fixed-term Parliament's Act (2011). In the
   UK debate, expectations about the Act diverge. This article evaluates
   the plausibility of these contrasting views by combining evidence from a
   comparative analysis of European cabinets with a counterfactual analysis
   of the Act's effect on the strategies of UK politicians. The evidence
   from both analyses indicates that fixing the term of parliament is
   likely to render parliaments more stable, but may also have the
   unanticipated effect of making governments more vulnerable to failure
   and replacement.},

Abstract = {Theories of ecological citizenship seek to conceptualize political
   agency while taking into account humanity's embeddedness in nature. This
   essay intervenes with contributions from an author distant from
   discourses about environmental politics, but with insights to offer
   them. George Orwell's writings respond to a problem continuously
   articulated in the history of ecological thought: the estrangement from
   the conditions of one's existence. In doing so, he provides a literary
   case study of ecological moral reasoning, a practice whereby the virtues
   of ecological citizenship are cultivated. Such virtues are cultivated by
   confronting the conditions of one's existence in embodied terms,
   incorporating that experiential knowledge, and contributing to practices
   of self-government using it. This essay presents Orwell's case, explains
   its relevance to the contemporary discourse on ecological citizenship,
   and concludes by suggesting that it also provides resources for
   empirical social scientists seeking to operationalize ecological
   citizenship theory by way of a moral sociology of the environment.},

   This paper offers a country study of Hungary, focusing on both internal

   de-Europeanization process as a serious divergence from mainstream EU
   developments due to the socio-economic and political crises of the past
   quarter-century. Hungary has become a defective or Potemkin democracy:
   since the 2010 elections the formal institutions of democracy have been
   nothing more than a facade for nondemocratic, authoritarian rule.},

Title = {Are Group Cues Necessary? How Anger Makes Ethnocentrism Among Whites a
   Stronger Predictor of Racial and Immigration Policy Opinions},

Abstract = {Research shows that group conflict sets ethnocentric thinking into
   motion. However, when group threat is not salient, can ethnocentrism
   still influence people's political decision-making? In this paper, I
   argue that anger, unrelated to racial and ethnic groups, can activate
   the attitudes of ethnocentric whites and those that score low in
   ethnocentrism thereby causing these attitudes to be a stronger predictor
   of racial and immigration policy opinions. Using an adult national
   experiment over two waves, I induced several emotions to elicit anger,
   fear, or relaxation (unrelated to racial or ethnic groups). The
   experimental findings show that anger increases opposition to racial and
   immigration policies among whites that score high in ethnocentrism and
   enhances support for these policies among those that score low in
   ethnocentrism. Using data from the American National Election Study
   cumulative file, I find a similar non-racial/ethnic anger effect. The
   survey findings also demonstrate that non-racial/ethnic fear increases
   opposition to immigration among whites that don't have strong out-group
   attitudes.},

Abstract = {We develop a model of adaptive learning with social comparisons. Actors
   are more likely to choose actions that recently yielded satisfactory
   payoffs; satisfaction is evaluated relative to an aspiration level that
   reflects previous payoffs and possibly other players' payoffs. This
   captures the phenomenon of social comparison via reference groups. We
   show that if agents compare themselves to those who are receiving higher
   payoffs then in stable outcomes all payoffs must be equal. If, however,
   agents' aspirations are driven by less ambitious social comparisons then
   very unequal distributions can be stable. We apply our general results
   to collective action problems in socio-political hierarchies and derive
   conditions for stable exploitation. Finally, we develop a computational
   model, which shows that increases in payoff inequality make outcomes
   less stable.},

   elections: Comparative lessons from Brazil},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {43},
Pages = {104-114},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article seeks to understand how concurrent presidential and
   gubernatorial elections in strong federal systems affect electoral
   coordination and coattails voting between national and subnational
   levels of government. We seek to determine whether the nationalizing
   effect of presidential elections can overcome the strong incentives for
   regionalization that can arise in federal systems. We use individual
   level survey data and time-series cross-sectional electoral data from
   Brazil, a federal country with decentralized electoral institutions that
   has recently adopted concurrent presidential and gubernatorial
   elections. We find that the congruence between national and subnational
   elections increases when elections are temporally proximate and the
   effective number of presidential candidates is low. In short, the
   coattails effect can not only operate ``horizontally,{''} by shaping
   national legislative elections, but also ``vertically,{''} by shaping
   subnational elections. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Key theorists and scholars of democracy have focused on understanding
   and enhancing the institutions and practices that shape decision-making.
   Indeed, the most influential contemporary normative accountthe
   deliberative versionthough increasingly adapted to the complex realities
   of contemporary politics, retains a tight focus on the conditions of
   legitimate will formation. This remains the core underpinning of the
   normative impetus for innovation and reform in contemporary democratic
   politics. Yet missing from even the adapted deliberative account is
   detailed consideration of what happens after will formation. I turn here
   to the policy and administration literature to show how the inescapably
   attritional and opaque policy process can magnify asymmetries that
   theorists and scholars of contemporary democracy, chief among them
   deliberative democrats, ought to be much better attuned to. I argue that
   in failing to consider these problems adequately, contemporary
   democratic thinkers, scholars, and reformers risk lending legitimacy to
   institutions and practices that might sustain the very biases they are
   mobilized against. As such, I identify institutional innovations and
   governing practices that can embed aspects of democratic deliberation
   downstream in the policy process in order to counter distortions and
   rebalance asymmetries. I conclude by calling for theorists, researchers,
   and reformers to explore the value of these institutions and practices,
   and to expand the repertoire of governing mechanisms available to
   counter the distortions that occur through the policy process.},

Abstract = {The idea and practice of ``social philosophy{''} began to be used in the
   Italian academic milieu only in recent years with a delay of several
   decades if compared to other Western countries. The notion of social
   philosophy started to be considered in Italy as a concept itself and as
   an independent field of inquiry only in the late 90's. The first book of
   collected articles on this theme was published in 2001 with the title
   Thinking society. The idea of a social philosophy. Over years social
   philosophy has been fully recognized in Italy as an epistemologically
   relevant frame, thanks to specialised studies, courses and conferences.
   Fifteen years after the first study, the present contribution is aimed
   at developing further reflections upon the existing relationship between
   social philosophy, politics, social criticism and public discourse in
   the light of problems of mutual concern, which seem to require new
   interpretation apparatuses beside national borders. To this end, the
   contribution will be divided into three sections: 1. National
   genealogies of social philosophy. 2. The link between social philosophy
   and critical theory. 3. Social philosophy and global public discourse.
   In the conclusions, the inter-disciplinary and trans-cultural validity
   of social philosophy will be stressed as well as its capacity to
   overcome a monolithic idea of philosophy, as a strictly academic
   discipline will be enlightened. Social philosophy is not only focussed
   on the understanding of pathologies but to the conceptualisation of
   potentials for change. It has both critical and pragmatic features,
   aimed at transforming distorted relationships in the both public domain
   and private sphere.},

   Change towards Increasing Equality},
Journal = {JAPANESE JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {Gender (jenda)' is a troublesome loanword in Japan. While this term has
   been prevalent in feminist and scholarly circles, it has evoked
   confusion in the government and stimulated a backlash from the
   ultra-conservatives against gender equality. Japanese reactionaries have
   attacked the concept of gender because of their anxiety about cultural
   destruction - I thus call them the old guard'. Focusing on a dispute
   over the term gender' between feminists and the old guard, this paper
   examines the changes in the term's usage and meanings in the Japanese
   political context. I first shed light on Japan's reaction to the newly
   arrived term gender', outlining different attitudes towards gender
   between the feminist/scholarly circles and the government. Secondly, I
   discuss the old guard's condemnation of the concept of gender, in which
   they distort its significance in order to diminish its positive impact
   on society. I then scrutinize the old guard's reasons behind their
   attack on the concept of gender. My findings reveal that the old guard,
   whose political cause is to protect traditional Japanese culture,
   asserts that gender equality damages this culture. Moreover, I refute
   their emphasis on Japan's uniqueness, demonstrating that Japanese
   women's traditional virtues under the patriarchal family system are not
   peculiar to Japan. To gauge how the concept of gender has been
   interpreted politically, I highlight legislative debates about the term
   gender'. In doing so, I elucidate the extent to which the concept of
   gender has infiltrated Japanese society through the dispute.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on which mechanisms enabled the eurozone to escape
   from gridlock. At present, the EU is in a state of profound and multiple
   crises. Nonetheless, it managed to bring about a medium-term
   stabilisation of its banking system and economic governance, and a
   systemic implosion has so far been prevented. Considering that crucial
   regulations in the financial markets and economic governance are not a
   new idea but had been politically blocked for many years preceding the
   crisis, it is a major political science puzzle how and why the reforms
   were actually possible in an acute crisis. Drawing on Fritz W. Scharpf's
   theory of the joint-decision trap, the article evaluates if, how and
   under what conditions crisis situations actually make a difference. Can
   crises possibly introduce dynamics that at times help overcome
   stalemate? Nine EU policies are being considered. The conclusions
   discuss insights for the EU's overall system development.},

Abstract = {Drawing from the literature on deliberative conditions, we analyze
   thirty years of verbatim transcripts of the Federal Open Market
   Committee (FOMC). The transcripts provide a rare opportunity for the
   systematic empirical analysis of deliberative conditions. The importance
   of the FOMC, and its recent policy failures, makes the case particularly
   interesting. Deliberative scholars argue that deliberation should occur
   in a setting where participants are free and equal. Using a unique set
   of deliberative measures, our model shows that FOMC members do enjoy
   deliberative freedom. In contrast, we find inequalities in rates of
   participation. Some deviation from equality may be reasonable. However,
   we demonstrate a sustained pattern of gender inequality in participation
   that could in turn influence the FOMC's policy choices and which is
   difficult to justify on any grounds.},

Abstract = {The eurozone crisis has altered the party political landscape across
   Europe. The most visible effect is the rise of challenger parties. The
   crisis not only caused economic hardship, but also placed considerable
   fiscal constraints upon a number of national governments. Many voters
   have reacted to this by turning their back on the traditional parties
   and opting instead for new, or reinvigorated, challenger parties that
   reject the mainstream consensus of austerity and European integration.
   This article argues that both sanctioning and selection mechanisms can
   help to explain this flight from the centre to challenger parties.
   First, voters who were economically adversely affected by the crisis
   punish mainstream parties both in government and in opposition by voting
   for challenger parties. Second, the choice of specific challenger party
   is shaped by preferences on three issues that directly flow from the
   euro crisis: EU integration, austerity and immigration. Analysing both
   aggregate-level and individual-level survey data from all 17 Western EU
   member states, this article finds strong support for both propositions
   and shows how the crisis has reshaped the nature of party competition in
   Europe.},

Title = {Incumbency effects in US presidential campaigns: Language patterns
   matter},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {43},
Pages = {95-103},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Incumbent U.S. presidential candidates have been overwhelmingly
   successful over the past 150 years. Attempts to explain this success
   rate have examined both structural advantages enjoyed by incumbents and
   differences in rhetorical and linguistic style in campaigning, although
   it is less clear why incumbency conveys an advantage here. This article
   finds that the language used by U.S. presidential candidates over the
   past twenty years has an underlying structure associated with electoral
   success: 1. speech patterns of incumbents differ notably from those they
   used in their first-term campaign; and 2. speech patterns of winners are
   different from those of losers. Both differences are consistent, and can
   therefore be postulated to indicate strength of influence. The resulting
   inductive model of influential language is characterized by: increased
   positivity, complete absence of negativity, increased abstraction, and
   lack of reference to the opposing candidate(s). The greatest intensity
   of model language is used by incumbents in their second campaign and the
   least by losers in a first-cycle open campaign. Language improvement by
   incumbents occurs rapidly, suggesting that it is the result of changing
   self-perception rather than a conventional learning process. This
   finding has broader implications, suggesting that both success, and the
   presence of competing groups trying to make similar arguments, improve
   the quality of the influencing language used. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Turkey has become the major refugee-hosting country due to the
   displacement of Syrian refugees since 2011. In order to mitigate the
   impact of the refugee crisis, the focus is increasingly shifting from
   humanitarian aid to livelihoods support. For this purpose, the ILO
   Office for Turkey has introduced a comprehensive strategy as an approach
   to the Syrian refugee crisis within the framework of the wider UN
   response. The ILO's strategy aims to support the livelihood
   opportunities for Syrian refugees and host communities, to facilitate
   their access to the labor market, and to promote decent work
   opportunities for both through vocational, skills development, and
   entrepreneurship courses in cooperation with governmental institutions,
   employers', and workers' organizations.},

Abstract = {In 2015, Kazakhstan celebrated 550 years of Kazakh statehood. The
   extraordinary interest in these events, both among Kazakh officials and
   some members of the international community, has a clear political
   message. It underscores Kazakhstan's independence from Russia regardless
   of Kazakhstan's entering the Eurasian Union in 2015. The celebration
   also underscores the fact that the borders of present-day Kazakhstan
   have historical roots and are not just a recent ``gift{''} from Russia.
   Some Russians living in Kazakhstan, and even some ethnic Kazakhs,
   protested the 2015 interpretation of Kazakhstan history and the
   relationship it implies between Kazakhstan and Russia. Ironically,
   Moscow provided no help for these protestors, and actually helped Astana
   deal with the Russian Nationalists. The reason was simple: the rise of
   Russian Nationalism could create problems not just for Astana but also
   for Moscow.},

Abstract = {There are currently millions of people with Alzheimer and other dementia
   related conditions. Considering relatives and caregivers among others,
   this means additional millions of people affected. Despite expansive
   research also on the impact on welfare and health-care systems, the
   question of dementia from a democratic perspective has been neglected
   thus far. However, the current situation and projected developments
   require us to reflect on how participation and inclusion are
   fundamentally challenged for citizens with dementia. Consequently, the
   following explores pressing theoretical implications and emerging
   democratic deficits for societies where, constrained by conventional
   forms of participation, a rapidly increasing number of citizens are
   excluded from political processes. Furthermore, as will be illustrated,
   non-conventional and participatory oriented concepts could even
   exacerbate rather than ameliorate inclusion and participation. Finally,
   I further hope to prompt reflection on possible avenues to enhancing
   representation and inclusion, ensuring `vote and voice' to an ever
   growing group of citizens.},

Abstract = {This study examines the decline in voter turnout among young voters
   between the 2008 and 2012 elections. Our findings suggest that those
   young voters who dropped out of the electorate in 2012 were more likely
   to express feelings of alienation, as measured by the American National
   Election Studies indices of trust and efficacy. Such ``dropout{''}
   voters were also more likely to have voted for Barack Obama in the 2008
   election. These findings are crucial, as the level of alienation in the
   2016 election appears to be even higher, and may influence the outcome
   of the election.},

Abstract = {Deutsche Zusammenfassung Lobbygruppen stehen in einem politischen
   Wettbewerb miteinander, wobei in manchen Themenfeldern ein sehr starker
   Konkurrenzkampf herrscht, wahrend die Rivalitat in anderen Bereichen
   eher gering ist. Dieser Artikel geht der Frage nach, wie sich diese
   unterschiedliche Intensitat des Wettkampfs auf das Lobbyverhalten von
   Interessenorganisationen auswirkt. Basierend auf Daten einer Umfrage
   unter Deutschen und Schweizer Interessengruppen konnte festgestellt
   werden, dass sowohl direktes Lobbying bei Politikern (Insider Lobbying)
   als auch indirekte Einflussnahme uber die Medien und die offentlichkeit
   (Outsider Lobbying) mit der Intensitat des Konkurrenzdruckes zunimmt.
   Allerdings zeigt sich auch, dass Insider Lobbying starker von dieser
   Zunahme betroffen ist, dass also Organisationen bei erhohtem Wettbewerb
   insbesondere den direkten Zugang zu Entscheidungstragern suchen.
   Englische Zusammenfassung Lobby groups face direct competition from each
   other, yet the level of competition they face varies and depends on the
   political issue area they compete in. This article investigates the
   question, how these differing intensities of competition affect the
   lobbying behavior of interest organizations. Based on data stemming from
   a survey among Swiss and German interest groups, this article
   establishes that the intensity of competition among lobby groups
   positively influences both directly lobbying politicians (inside
   lobbying) but also exercising influence indirectly via the media and the
   public (outside lobbying). Yet it is also demonstrated that the inside
   lobbying benefits more strongly from higher competition levels, hence
   interest organizations look for ways to directly influence politicians
   first when they are faced with stiffer competition.},

Abstract = {Ethnic fragmentation is largely presumed to be bad for democracy.
   However, many African countries belie this claim, as democracy has
   recently sprouted in several of its multiethnic states. We argue that
   African countries that have demographic patterns where the largest
   ethnopolitical group is at least a near-majority and is simultaneously
   divided into nested subgroups produce Africa's most democratic
   multiethnic societies. This large-divided-group pattern, which has gone
   largely unnoticed by previous scholars, facilitates transitions to
   democracy from authoritarian rule. The large group's size foments the
   broad-based multiethnic social agitation needed to pose a genuine threat
   to a ruling autocrat, while its internal divisions reassure minorities
   that they will not suffer permanent exclusion via ethnic dominance under
   an eventual democracy. We support our claim with cross-national
   quantitative evidence on ethnic fragmentation and regime type.},

Abstract = {The Scottish Parliament election in 2016 produced two surprising
   results: it represents a reversal of SNP/Labour party fortunes so
   complete that we now take it for granted, but the SNP did not achieve a
   widely-expected majority; and, the huge surge of support for the
   Scottish Conservatives was enough to make it (easily) the second largest
   party. A mistaken sense of inevitability of the result - another SNP
   majority - helped produce a dull campaign and keep alive the prospect of
   a second referendum on Scottish independence. This article has four main
   sections: putting the 2016 election in recent historical context;
   considering the implications of consistently high SNP support on the
   constitution; highlighting key issues in the election campaign; and,
   examining the SNP's policy agenda from 2016.},

Abstract = {South Africa is experiencing record levels of protest. Interpretations
   of protest fall into two groups. First, there is the argument that
   protests represent only limited rebellion and that though unruly, they
   are a mechanism for political re-engagement. A second understanding
   links new social movements that address general grievances to wider
   hegemonic challenges. This article addresses the issue of whether these
   upsurges in militant mobilization threaten or complement democratic
   procedures. The article draws from a study of two protest hotspots in
   Durban.},

Title = {An Analysis of the Post-War Community Relations between Buddhists and
   Muslims in Sri Lanka: A Muslim's Perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Pages = {42-54},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Sri Lanka is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious country comprising four of
   the world's major religions: Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Christianity.
   Buddhists are the predominant ethnic group, constituting 70.19\% of the
   total population, while Muslims make up the second largest minority in
   the country. There are many records in the history to prove well the
   cordial relationship between Buddhists and Muslims in Sri Lanka.
   However, in the past couple of years, particularly during the aftermath
   of the civil war, tension may be observed in the relationship between
   these two religious groups. This is due to a campaign undertaken by a
   several Buddhist nationalist groups whose intensions are to create a
   division among these respective societies. These groups have been
   carrying protests against Muslim social, cultural and religious aspects,
   including issuing Halal certification, slaughtering of cattle,
   conducting prayer services, etc. Moreover, they have disseminated
   misinterpretations about Muslims and Islam with derogatory speeches
   among the Buddhist public, for the purpose of accomplishing above
   division. Given the above backdrop, this paper attempts to determine the
   post-war relationship between Muslims and Buddhists in the country,
   including major interrupting factors, through analyzing Muslims' point
   of views. According to the results, there is no remarkable fluctuation
   in the relationships between Muslims and Buddhists, and Muslims have
   posited that there are several social, cultural and religious practices
   them that act as significant barriers to maintaining a better community
   relationship with Buddhists, such as slaughtering of cattle for meals.
   Therefore, almost all of the Muslims have been demanding proper
   guidelines regarding the slaughtering of cattle, the Niqabs (face cover
   of Muslim women), and other factors related to interrupting a better
   interaction with the Buddhists for better cordiality, within the context
   of Sri Lanka.},

Abstract = {Today human right is of great importance. The existence of different
   minorities such as lingual, ethnic, racial, and religious minorities
   with different tendencies derived from different civilizations and
   cultures has brought about social and cultural varieties and differences
   in each country and also the emergence of this variety has resulted in
   the development of variety in a specific culture and ceremony in
   different countries. On the other hand, each country as a member of
   international society has to observe norms and principles accepted by
   international society. In other words, although preparation of
   constitution of each country depends on exclusive qualification of the
   country's people and government, it does not mean they are free in each
   law because international legitimacy of each country's government and
   constitution depends on observation of the accepted principles and the
   governing rules in international law. The subject of minorities was
   first introduced in Vienna Congress and today different minorities live
   in different countries. In international documents and treaties, a
   precise definition of minority has not been provided. The present
   article seeks to interpret minority rights according to international
   law and investigate minority rights in international law by using
   international documents.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Twelve governments recently signed the much-anticipated Trans-Pacific
   Partnership (TPP), sparking heated debate about its merits. As a primary
   motivation for this first ``mega-regional{''} agreement, US President
   Barack Obama argues that the TPP is a way for the USA, and not China or
   someone else, to write the global trade rules of the future. This begs
   some important questions, namely which country or countries really did
   write most of the TPP and thus whose agenda for 21st century trade might
   it advance? To answer these questions, we compare the recently-released
   text of the TPP to the language in the 74 previous trade agreements that
   TPP members signed since 1995. Our text-as-data analyses reveal that the
   contents of the TPP are taken disproportionately from earlier US trade
   agreements. The ten preferential trade agreements (PTAs) that most
   closely match the TPP are all US PTAs. Moreover, the contents of
   controversial chapters, such as the one on investment, are drawn even
   more heavily from past US treaty language. Our study and findings apply
   power-based accounts of international institutions to a landmark new
   agreement, and portray a more active, template-based process of
   international diffusion.},

Abstract = {This article presents the results of a scientific research on Mexican
   lemon. Its overall objective is to make a description of the behavior of
   lemon exports for the four major exporting countries, which include
   Mexico, Argentina, Spain and Turkey during the period from 2000 to 2012.
   After a theoretical review, the main economic indicators of major lemon
   exporting countries were identified; after that, it was established the
   general hypothesis of this research which is: Revealed Comparative
   Advantage of Mexican Lemon grew, compared to Spain, Argentina and
   Turkey, during the period 2000-2012. Results obtained identified the

Abstract = {The aim of this work is to present in a first moment the recent dataset
   of presidential crises and presidential falls in Latin America, offering
   then a brief reflection about the last three episodes of presidential
   instability and its consequences: Honduras (2009), Ecuador (2010) e
   Paraguay (2012). We argue that this cases can be seen as a new model of
   political action of conservative and anti-democratic elites in the
   region, that have adopted a strategy of illegal coups against leftist
   presidents. These groups have learned that the political system of Latin
   American countries often returned to equilibrium after turbulent periods
   only after the fall of presidents, identified as the main sources off
   the problems in their respective nations. Therefore, a quick and
   objective tactic has been designed: actions of the opposition sectors of
   Congress and Armed Forces conducted on an extraconstitutional way, but
   without social mobilization in the streets.},

Title = {EXTENDING THE SPATIAL ANALOGY: HYPERSPATIAL DIAGRAMS OF PARTY

Abstract = {In his 2011 Presidential Address to the American Political Science
   Association, Henry E. Brady argued that spatial diagrams are fundamental
   to the discipline and that ``elaborating and refining these spatial
   diagrams is an important agenda item for political science.{''} This
   article tests the limitations of spatial diagrams of party competition.
   It explores the use of the spatial analogy in politics, identifies the
   limitations o f existing spatial diagrams, and shows that the geometric
   concept of hyperspace can be used to overcome these limitations. The
   central argument is that hyperspace, or space with four or more
   dimensions, allows us to extend the spatial analogy and to transcend the
   limitations of spatial diagrams. Four- and five-axis radar charts
   provide rough approximations of hyperspatial diagrams, and they capture
   important differences between parties that two- and three- dimensional
   diagrams obscure. The article concludes by suggesting other applications
   of hyperspace in political science.},

Abstract = {A viable alternative to today's hegemonic model of legal teaching
   requires a new reading of both legal knowledge and Law Schools. The
   current scenario is so dire that maintaining the status quickly ceases
   to be defensible as a choice. Law schools play a key role here once they
   are the actors shaping future actions. Having as a theoretical framework
   the debates on student-centered methodologies, this paper aims at
   offering some alternatives to the traditional classroom based on the
   cooperation among all players involved in the teaching-learning process.},

Abstract = {The article studies the realist theory of legal interpretation developed
   by the Italian legal theorist Riccardo Guastini. The Italian author is a
   leading scholar of the school of analytical philosophy of law produced
   in Italy and is nowadays one of the most influent researchers of the
   legal interpretation in the European legal science. Guastini proposes a
   realist theory on legal interpretation, which has been set forth
   basically as a skeptical theory on the interpretive activity in the
   realm of law. The article analyzes the key theoretical assumptions of
   the methodological realism elaborated by the author and exposes
   critically the framework of his theoretical approach on the subject. At
   last, it proposes a set of criticisms to the author conceptions that
   aims at demonstrating the need of improving and correcting some of his
   main theses.},

Abstract = {Prior research has demonstrated a preference among partisans for
   like-minded news outlets, a key mechanism through which the media may be
   polarizing Americans. But in order for source reputations to cause
   widespread selective exposure, individuals must prioritize them above
   other competing attributes of news content. Evaluating the relative
   influence of various contributors to media choice is therefore critical.
   This study pits two such factors, source reputation and topic relevance,
   against one another in conjoint survey experiments offering randomly
   paired news items to partisans. Making a news source's reputation
   politically unfriendly lowers the probability that an individual chooses
   an item, but this negative effect is often eclipsed by the positive
   effect of making a news topic relevant to the individual. In many
   popular modern news consumption environments, where consumers encounter
   a diverse mixture of sources and topics, the ability of source
   reputations to contribute to polarization via partisan selective
   exposure is limited.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to analyse citizens' attitudes towards
   governmental accountability in 24 European countries and to examine the
   influence of contextual and individual factors on perceptions of
   accountability. Using as a dataset the 2012 European Social Survey, the
   results show that citizens respond positively when the media provides
   reliable information on which to judge the government, when individuals
   perceive that governments perform well, when individuals live in more
   extensive and generous welfare states and when they live in countries
   where the rule of law is firmly established. In addition, the findings
   also provide evidence that compared to politically left-wing citizens,
   right-wing supporters have, on average, a higher perception of
   governmental accountability. In particular, the findings show strong
   positive evaluations of right-wing governments by right-wing voters in
   comparison with left-wing governments by left-wing voters.},

Abstract = {Created in 1926, the International Leninist School (ILS) as a mechanism
   for the formation of political cadres for the parties of the Communist
   Intrnational, worked as an important structure of the Komintern, whose
   main objective was ``bolshevisation{''}, ideological homogenization of
   national communist parties. Its contribution to the preparation of
   cadres of the ``professional revolutionaries{''} for Latin American
   parties corresponded to the level of importance and political weight of
   the parties in the region. In the ILS was formed a militant Marxism,
   whose sources were the historical experience and strategic interests of
   the Russian Communist party and the Soviet state, applies to the
   Latin-American realities. The functioning of the ILS was due to the
   bureaucratic logic of the superior organs of the Komintern and the
   administration of the school. The ILS and its students were used in the
   internal struggles in the direction of the Komintern and in the national
   parties. Despite the flaws inherent in the style and form of studies on
   the ILS, its graduated student took an important step in the development
   of the communist movement in Latin America.},

Title = {A Comparative Study of Executive Guaranty of Arbitration at
   International Law (International Court of Arbitration and the New York
   Convention) and Iranian Law},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {The present study is an attempt to analyze the executive guaranty of
   arbitration at international law within internal Iranian law and the
   international law. The present research findings show that within
   internal law in case the arbitration verdict is not carried out
   voluntarily then its obligatory administration is under the support of
   law and has legal executive guaranty. But arbitration privilege at
   administration stage is not limited to the fact that any arbitration
   verdict is to be performed without any questioning but a significant
   aspect of this privilege is to prevent the administration of a verdict
   which is altered or creased and openly against the facts or the law. In
   international law the international commerce chamber arbitration system
   is the most important international trade arbitration system in
   contemporary period and has always been the influential forerunner in
   international arbitration and has had a significant role in the
   development and expansion of arbitration method of settling
   international trade disputes. Both the chamber arbitration rules and
   arbitration verdicts which are issued under the chamber arbitration
   framework are among the most important legal resources in terms of
   international arbitration and are considered as the constructive and
   formative factors of international arbitration procedure. It should be
   mentioned that commerce chamber arbitration organization lacks the
   executive tools to execute the arbitration verdicts. But in spite of
   that on the basis of arbitration rules article 35 the arbitration
   authority and the chamber arbitration court makes attempts to execute
   the verdict and the purpose is mostly the official measures rather than
   judicial or administrative. Principally, the execution of arbitration
   verdicts depend on state rules and regulations where from the
   identification and administration of verdict is requested.},

   carried out in the recent past for the Learning and Skills Council (LSC)
   and Jobcentre Plus, and outlines the key factors that led to their
   success. The LSC project involved one of the largest in-depth surveys of
   Muslim women's attitudes towards work, and their views on life in
   Britain, that has ever been undertaken. The Jobcentre Plus project was a
   highly successful and innovative employment training initiative for
   ethnic minority women piloted in Sheffield, the very kind of `targeted'
   approach that Mr Cameron has claimed his government's new language

Abstract = {This article investigates the efficacy of a form of electoral innovation
   unique to the island-state of Singapore, the Nominated Member of

   light of the changing political landscape. A comparative perspective
   will be employed and broader conclusions on electoral engineering will
   be reached, especially for democratizing countries. Contrary to
   conventional scholarly wisdom, I argue that the NMP scheme can actually
   boost democratic representation in the country, considering the changing
   political landscape in the state previously dominated by a hegemonic
   party. This is via two ways: firstly, NMPs could better represent the
   voices of the people at the margins of society and, secondly, they could
   be better positioned to raise issues that are deemed too `sensitive' to
   be raised by opposition parties. NMPs can enhance democratic governance
   by promoting deliberation, accountability, and representation.},

Abstract = {Recently, the Winter Olympic Games in Russia and the Federation
   Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup in Brazil have
   drawn attention as much for politics as the excitement of the
   competitions. Russia's pursuance of discriminatory homosexual policies
   made it the target of international rights groups; Brazil's exploitation
   of the poor for the sake of hosting the World Cup led to several
   high-profile protests ahead of the event. These large-scale
   international sporting competitions provide a ready-made platform for
   naming and shaming states that may have dubious human rights records.
   The question remains as to whether or not the shaming of these host
   states by international groups effectively changes a state's behavior.
   This paper argues that states facing increased global media attention
   while hosting an event are likely to substitute repression of physical
   integrity rights with repression of civil and political rights in an
   effort to maintain favorable appearances internationally. However, I
   find support for both physical and expressive rights improving in states
   when shaming is conditioned on the selection to host an international
   sporting event.},

Abstract = {We examine the effect of a sudden influx of government spending, the
   2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) on support for the
   president's party. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find
   that stimulus spending had a modest positive effect on Democratic vote
   share but only in counties that were already Democratic leaning. In
   Republican counties, by contrast, government spending had a small, but
   significant negative effect on Democratic vote share. That is to say,
   ARRA polarized already partisan places. These results have important
   implications for the study of voter responsiveness to government
   spending and the measurement of the political effects of policy
   visibility.},

Abstract = {The 2008 global financial crisis came with fears-and, for some,
   hopes-that a new wave of public mobilization would emerge in
   industrialized countries. Especially throughout the European Union (EU),
   the epicenter of the crisis, large protests were expected. Yet, the
   energy with which social groups mobilized against the proposed austerity
   measures quickly fizzled. This article provides new evidence for why
   this was the case. In line with Neo-Keynesian theory, we argue that the
   interest rate adjustments and political announcements of the European
   Central Bank (ECB) limited the potential for mass unrest in the member
   states of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) affected by the crisis.
   We provide evidence for our argument with yearly panel data and a new
   original data set of monthly political protests between 2001 and 2013.
   Our analyses support the hypothesis that the ECB was able to
   successfully assuage dissatisfaction with the limited reform options of
   the Eurozone member states in the wake of the Eurocrisis.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to review the development of political
   science, as an academic discipline, in Mongolia. The article is composed
   of the following parts: The first part provides an overview of
   Mongolia's de jure recognition as an Inner Asian ``buffer state{''} in
   the early Cold War era. The second part describes the Communist
   ideological disciplines (such as scientific socialism) that were used to
   study politics and political systems in Mongolia during the Cold War
   era. The third part presents the process of democratization in post-1990
   Mongolia, and its impact on the development of political science. The
   fourth part examines the focus points of contemporary Mongolian
   political science, presents the profiles of pioneering scholars, and
   describes the institutional changes, academic departments, professional
   associations, and doctoral degree councils in this field. Finally, the
   fifth part introduces the currently active Mongolian political
   scientists, their social environment, and their research fields. The
   conclusion of the article examines the prospects of political science
   development in Mongolia.},

Title = {Partisanship and Preference Formation: Competing Motivations, Elite
   Polarization, and Issue Importance},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {383-411},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {An enduring and increasingly acute concern-in an age of polarized
   parties-is that people's partisan attachments distort preference
   formation at the expense of relevant information. For example, research
   suggests that a Democrat may support a policy proposed by Democrats, but
   oppose the same policy if proposed by Republicans. However, a related
   body of literature suggests that how people respond to information and
   form preferences is distorted by their prior issue attitudes. In neither
   instance is information even-handedly evaluated, rather, it is
   interpreted in light of partisanship or existing issue opinions. Both
   effects are well documented in isolation, but in most political
   scenarios individuals consider both partisanship and prior opinions-yet,
   these dynamics may or may not pull toward the same preference. Using
   nationally representative experiments focused on tax and education
   policies, I introduce and test a theory that isolates when: partisanship
   dominates preference formation, partisanship and issue opinions
   reinforce or offset each other, and issue attitudes trump partisanship.
   The findings make clear that the public does not blindly follow party
   elites. Depending on elite positions, the level of partisan
   polarization, and personal importance of issues, the public can be
   attentive to information and shirk the influence of party elites. The
   results have broad implications for political parties and citizen
   competence in contemporary democratic politics.},

Abstract = {Divided government has become the norm in American national politics.
   But its pattern redivided beginning in the 1990s from one of Republican
   presidents and Democratic Congresses to one of Democratic presidents and
   Republican Congresses. Drawing on oral history interviews with campaign
   and administration officials from the Clinton administration, this
   article explains how Bill Clinton forged a winning strategy for
   Democratic presidential candidates while contributing to the weakening

Abstract = {Scholars and practitioners alike are increasingly concerned about
   growing and differential rates of nonresponse in exit polls. In this
   paper, I examine how exit poll sponsorship affects response intentions.
   I leverage an experiment imbedded in a nationally-representative
   probability sample telephone sample that probed respondents about exit
   poll participation intentions. The survey, fielded by Opinion Research
   Corporation for CNN in November 2006, randomly varied whether
   respondents were informed the exit poll would be conducted by the
   ``television networks,{''} specifically, or generically, by ``some
   organizations.{''} The results reveal that respondents are significantly
   more likely to report they would be likely to participate in exit polls
   when television networks are explicitly identified as sponsors. These
   effects are robust across a series of specifications and do not appear
   to be moderated by key observable attributes including age, gender,
   race, partisanship or educational attainment.},

Abstract = {The goal of this article is to explore the discursive construction of
   social citizenship of various labor market actors during crisis. Using
   the newspaper data from nine countries we conduct a quantitative and
   qualitative study of the rights and duties attributed to employees,
   employers, and outsiders in the labor market. We find that the
   attribution of rights to all groups prevails and the most frequent are
   the claims supporting employees' rights. In a context of crisis
   severity, we find three distinct groups of discourse on rights and
   duties in the labor market sphere. A severe crisis created conditions
   for labor organizations to claim the rights of employees. A moderate
   crisis created the ground for the state to (re)call the rights of the
   outsiders. In countries in which crisis was present in the discourse,
   rather than in real terms, a window of opportunity emerged for markets
   and employers to claim their freedoms and rights.},

Abstract = {When countries face balance-of-payments crises, their policy responses
   vary widely. This article argues that the choice between the two main
   options of internal adjustment (i.e., austerity and structural reforms)
   and external adjustment (i.e., exchange-rate devaluation) depends on how
   costly each of these strategies is for a country overall. Although the
   choice of adjustment strategy is thus structurally determined, the level
   of political conflict associated with crisis management depends on both
   the national vulnerability profile and partisan interests. Moreover,
   irrespective of the adjustment strategy, all governments design the
   specific reforms in ways that shelter their own voters. Empirically,
   this article uses qualitative case studies and survey data to examine
   the significant variation in crisis responses, crisis politics, and
   distributive outcomes of the 2008-2010 global financial crisis in eight
   Eastern European countries. The article concludes with a discussion of
   the implications of the Eastern European experience for crisis politics
   in the Eurozone crisis.},

Abstract = {Nannies are paid childcare providers employed in private households. In
   Northeastern cities, they vary by many personal characteristics,
   including race, ethnicity, immigrant status, and education. This study
   compares the identity work of two groups of nannies: one composed of
   immigrant women of color and the other composed mainly of US-born white
   women. Building upon existing research on the difference between
   precarious work and precarious working conditions in domestic work, this
   study finds that immigrant women of color respond to disrespect and
   discrimination by defending the respectability of their work and their
   personal dignity. In contrast, US-born and white women respond to the
   stigma of doing socially devalued work by distancing themselves from
   their work. The implications of workers' agency and identity on
   organizing and social movements are considered.},

Abstract = {Since the first global summit on climate change was held in 1992, the
   international community has managed to adopt a series of agreements and
   action plans to coordinate efforts of all countries to tackle the
   existing and potential challenges caused by climate change. Yet due to a
   lack of legally binding mechanisms and the huge discrepancy between
   developed and developing countries in their respective responsibilities,
   little progress has been made in international climate negotiation over
   the past decade. With the joint endeavor of major greenhouse gas
   emitters, especially emerging economies like China, the first-ever
   universal, legally binding global climate deal, the Paris Climate
   Agreement, was adopted in December 2015, setting up the legal framework
   of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) and relevant
   international institutions to combat climate change on a reinterpreted
   principle of ``common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR).{''}
   Conducive as it is to the institutions and working model of global
   climate governance, the agreement will attach more responsibilities to
   developing countries including China. Having developed a strong
   resolution and given many open international commitments to assume more
   responsibilities in combating climate change, China should develop a
   green-growth approach while providing more public goods for the
   international community, so as to make its best contributions to future
   global climate governance.},

   US-EU partnership has become increasingly important not only to the US
   and the EU, but also for the world's security and prosperity. As global
   trends (including globalization, a shift towards the Asia-Pacific
   region, Western influence currently on the wane, and a multi-polar world
   in the making) are shaping the geostrategic environment around the US
   and the EU and posing new threats to global stability, the US-EU
   partnership has become more necessary than ever. The US and the EU are
   both economic superpowers and have the most powerful militaries in the
   world. Their cooperation and coordination are needed to deal with
   challenges posed by continued poverty in Africa, ongoing violent
   conflicts in the Middle East, Russia's re-emergence as a world power,
   and instability in Asia.},

Abstract = {In 2005 Southern Sudan emerged from a long period of protracted civil
   war. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement marked the beginning of a period
   of post-war peacebuilding concentrating on statebuilding. However, since
   2005, the much-needed gradual process of building a unified nation and
   inclusive national identity has been largely neglected. Instead, there
   has been emphasis on achieving `peace-through-statebuilding' that has
   contributed to a highly exclusive social, economic, and political order
   dictated by the leadership of the dominant rebel movement turned
   government, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A). This
   essay reflects on peacebuilding interventionism, and state- and
   nationbuilding in Southern Sudan since 2005. It argues that this overall
   process dictated by the SPLM/A leadership, focusing on security and
   state, excluded the majority of Southern Sudanese from the peace
   dividend and economic and political opportunities. Further, the
   exclusive top-down SPLM/A-centric view of the nation marginalized part
   of the population and contributed to the continuing political
   instability and armed violence orchestrated by the leading individuals
   and other military men.},

Abstract = {We build on previous theories of junior minister allocation and
   coalition oversight by incorporating a novel theory of strategic changes
   in the issues covered in party manifestos. We argue that parties use
   junior ministerial appointments to oversee their coalition partners on
   portfolios that correspond to issues emphasized by the parties'
   activists when the coalition partner's preferences deviate from the
   party's. The findings, based on a data set of more than 2800
   party-portfolio dyads in 10 countries, show significant support for
   these expectations. We find that party leaders who successfully
   negotiate for junior ministers to particular portfolios are most
   concerned about checking ideologically contentious coalition partners in
   areas of concern to activists. The results also illustrate the
   usefulness of our dyadic approach for the study of junior minister
   allocation.},

Abstract = {In light of the instability of several Central Eastern European
   democracies following their accession to the European Union, most
   dramatically embodied by the constitutional revolution' taking place in
   Hungary since April 2010, this paper offers a critical reading of the
   dominant, rational-institutionalist model of democratic consolidation.
   Drawing on the Hungarian case, it argues that the conditions set out by
   this model are insufficient for ensuring a democratic regime against
   erosion. On this basis, the paper considers additional elements to
   understand Fidesz's reforms: the importance of deeper commitments to
   democracy among the leadership of mainstream parties, and the pivotal
   role of party strategies of citizen mobilization in the consolidation of
   young democracies. Drawing on these insights, the paper argues for
   approaching democratic consolidation as an agent-led process of cultural
   change, emphasizing the socializing role of mainstream parties'
   strategies of mobilization in the emergence of a democratic political
   culture. The last section concludes with methodological and empirical
   considerations, outlining a three-fold agenda for future research.},

Abstract = {This article captures the nature of legislators' ambitions and explores
   to what extent their career paths within a context of party competition
   lead to progressive versus static ambition. The findings show that their
   previous career path and retrospective loyalty towards the party
   influences which offices they seek. Progressively ambitious legislators
   also seek offices in less competitive environments, but this finding
   holds for the regional executive branch or the presidency. An additional
   robust finding shows that ideologically conservative legislators tend to
   be statically ambitious. This is a first step towards mapping out
   ambitions in Latin America by drawing on cross-national data.},

Abstract = {Direct democracy is sometimes described as a ``gun behind the door,{''}
   but how do legislators react when voters pull the trigger? Leveraging
   the high-profile referendum defeat of a controversial law passed by the
   Ohio legislature, I examine how legislators respond to voter
   disaffection. Using interest groups to ``bridge{''} votes before and
   after the election, I show that the measure's defeat induced moderation
   on the part of the Republican legislative majority, while leaving the
   behavior of opposition Democrats largely unchanged. The results suggest
   that direct democracy has the potential to restrain legislative excesses
   and alleviate polarization in state legislatures.},

Abstract = {What novel leverage for understanding the social world do set-theoretic
   comparative methods (STCM) offer? I have argued that although important
   methodological ideas underlie this method, many STCM techniques converge
   with existing quantitative tools of statistical modeling. Unfortunately,
   STCM scholars have often obscured this crucial point by instead
   emphasizing stark differences from quantitative tools. Here, I further
   develop two key arguments about these convergences by addressing the
   astute commentaries offered by Thiem et al. and Schneider: (a) Regarding
   necessary and sufficient conditions, STCM's procedures for incorporating
   cases from a 2 x 2 table may yield erroneous conclusions that can easily
   be avoided by using more conventional techniques. (b) Regarding causal
   complexity, STCM and statistical interaction terms often provide the
   same information. These arguments demonstrate that STCM scholars have
   yet to establish distinctive advantages of their methods over
   statistical modeling. Furthermore, alternative qualitative tools offer
   considerably more promise than does STCM.},

Title = {Party competition over decentralisation: The influence of ideology and

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {55},
Number = {2},
Pages = {340-357},

Abstract = {Under what conditions is decentralisation a salient issue for state-wide
   political parties? It is argued in this article that the extent to which
   state-wide parties emphasise decentralisation depends on their strategic
   considerations: on their overall ideology, on the electoral incentives
   created by the context in which they compete, and on the interaction
   between the two. The results of the analysis of party manifestos in 31
   countries since 1945 are as follows. First, parties that pay greater
   attention to cultural matters relative to economic matters tend to talk
   more about decentralisation. Second, the systemic salience of
   decentralisation also encourages parties to talk more about
   decentralisation. Third, the larger the regionally based ethnic groups
   within a country, the more salience all state-wide political parties
   will attach to decentralisation. Finally, only parties that put greater
   relative emphasis on cultural matters tend to respond to the electoral
   threat of regionalist parties. The influence of territorial diversity on
   the salience of decentralisation thus works through two channels and is
   partly conditioned by political parties' ideological profile.},

Abstract = {Considerable evidence has been generated to establish that ideological
   congruence, that is, a close matching of government policy positions
   with median left-right voter opinion, generally prevails in liberal
   democracies. Based on a cross-national analysis of election survey data,
   this article challenges that view and elaborates an alternative
   perspective. In this perspective, nonpolicy or valence considerations
   strongly influence vote choices and electoral outcomes in a directional
   sense-sometimes favoring the Left overall, sometimes the Right. Partly
   as a result, government positions typically deviate substantially from
   median opinion, forming a pattern that is clearly bilateralist or
   two-sided rather than center-concentrated.},

Abstract = {Data access and research transparency (DA-RT) is a growing concern for
   the discipline. Technological advances have greatly reduced the cost of
   sharing data, enabling full replication archives consisting of data and
   code to be shared on individual websites, as well as journal archives
   and institutional data repositories. But how do we ensure that scholars
   take advantage of these resources to share their replication archives?
   Moreover, are the costs of research transparency borne by individuals or
   by journals? This article assesses the impact of journal replication
   policies on data availability and finds that articles published in
   journals with mandatory provision policies are 24 times more likely to
   have replication materials available than articles those with no
   requirements.},

Abstract = {How do we explain the steep increase in women's higher educational
   attainment that began in the mid-twentieth century and has continued,
   unchecked, in subsequent decades? Although many point to the emergence
   of feminism and the creation of Title IX in the 1970s as the origins of
   this trend, I argue that two federal student aid programs-the National
   Defense Education Act of 1958 and the Higher Education Act of
   1965-helped set the stage for women to surpass men as the recipients of
   bachelor's degrees. Using historical analysis of primary and secondary
   resources, I present two related case studies that demonstrate the
   central role that unique political contexts and nondiscriminatory
   program administration have played in lawmakers' capacity to promote
   equal opportunity through public policy. This study suggests that
   women's increasing college degree attainment has important, but
   frequently overlooked, public policy roots.},

Abstract = {Disappointment is often identified as a pathology of modern politics;
   citizens expect much of politicians, yet governments are ill-equipped to
   deliver outcomes commensurate with those expectations. The net result is
   said to be a widespread disappointment; a negative balance between what
   citizens expect of government and what they perceive governments to
   deliver. Yet little attention has hitherto been paid to which kinds of
   citizens are particularly disappointed with politics, and why. This
   article offers one of the first empirical analyses of political
   disappointment. Drawing on a survey conducted in Britain, it provides a
   quantitative measure of political disappointment and explores its
   prevalence among citizens. It then considers which social groups might
   be more prone to disappointment than others. In particular, it explores
   whether certain groups are more disappointed by virtue of holding very
   high expectations of government or very low perceptions of government
   performance. The article concludes by considering what strategies might
   be open to policy makers to alleviate political disappointment.},

Abstract = {Resume Cette etude examine l'hypothese qu'il existe un lien entre
   l'usage de la langue francaise chez les neo-Quebecois et leurs relations
   aux communautes politiques quebecoise et canadienne. L'etude examine
   separement la premiere et la seconde generation de neo-Quebecois
   appartenant a une minorite visible. Conformement aux autres etudes sur
   le sujet, la presente recherche montre qu'un plus grand usage du
   francais est associe a une plus forte preference pour la communaute
   politique quebecoise. L'etude suggere egalement que la frequentation de
   l'ecole francophone est associee a une plus forte preference pour la
   communaute politique quebecoise. Dans les deux cas, les relations sont
   observees autant chez la premiere que chez la seconde generation.
   Neanmoins, les resultats montrent que meme lorsqu'ils ont frequente
   l'ecole francophone et qu'ils font usage de la langue francaise dans
   leur vie quotidienne, les neo-Quebecois affichent une preference pour la
   communaute politique quebecoise plus faible que celle observee chez la
   population majoritaire francophone.
   Abstract This study examines the link between new Quebecers' use of the
   French language and their relationship with the Quebec and Canadian
   political communities; more specifically, the study examines the case of
   first and second generations of visible minorities living in Quebec. As
   in earlier studies, the findings indicate that new Quebecers who use
   French more frequently in their daily lives have a more positive
   relationship with the Quebec political community. Similarly, new
   Quebecers who attended French schools express a more positive
   relationship with the Quebec political community. In both cases, the
   relationships are observed for first and second generations of new
   Quebecers. However, even when they use French in most spheres of life
   and attended French schools, new Quebecers still express a weaker
   preference for the Quebec political community than other French-speaking
   Quebecers.},

Abstract = {This study rigorously compares the effectiveness of online mobilization
   appeals via two randomized field experiments conducted over the social
   microblogging service Twitter. In the process, we demonstrate a
   methodological innovation designed to capture social effects by
   exogenously inducing network behavior. In both experiments, we find that
   direct, private messages to followers of a nonprofit advocacy
   organization's Twitter account are highly effective at increasing
   support for an online petition. Surprisingly, public tweets have no
   effect at all. We additionally randomize the private messages to prime
   subjects with either a ``follower'' or an ``organizer'' identity but
   find no evidence that this affects the likelihood of signing the
   petition. Finally, in the second experiment, followers of subjects
   induced to tweet a link to the petition are more likely to sign
   it-evidence of a campaign gone ``viral.'' In presenting these results,
   we contribute to a nascent body of experimental literature exploring
   political behavior in online social media.},

Abstract = {The role of Parliament in the context of the Westminster legacy is well
   understood at a rhetorical level. However, the pragmatic realities of
   politics combined with the naturally pragmatic nature of the Australian
   polity introduce an important question as to the extent that
   parliamentary form overrides substance in practice. This includes the
   conduct of the oversight role of the parliament.
   This paper responds to the 2016 APSG conference question ``Are
   parliaments little more than a stage for a ritual but symbolic battle,
   or are they a genuine actor in the policy process?{''} through
   examination of the operation of budget estimates committees in
   Australia. Are these annual or semi-annual estimates hearings used to
   critically examine the estimated and actual expenditures and operations
   of government, as intended? Or are they more often used for political
   point-scoring by parliamentarians, and considered irrelevant to policy
   development and implementation by senior officials?
   These questions are examined via a close analysis of Hansard in the
   context of scrutiny of public finances. Annual scrutiny by parliament of
   budget documentation, particularly by budget estimates committees, is
   one of the ways in which governments are held to account for budget
   management and public expenditure. In Australia to date, the existing
   research literature has focussed on the federal parliament, and the
   Senate budget estimates process in particular.
   This paper contributes to the existing literature by examining three
   state-level parliamentary budget estimates committees over a five year
   period, and considers the nature of the questions asked by the
   parliamentary members. It was found that although there was an expected
   focus in the questions asked regarding specific budget decisions and
   fiscal targets, there was also a considerable focus on operational and
   other matters unrelated to the budget documents being examined.
   Variances were also apparent between jurisdictions, with different
   committee structures likely contributing to these differences.},

Abstract = {Social scientists have often neglected, or not sufficiently explored,
   the role of political factors in shaping state capacity. When they did,
   they mostly focused on key institutional features of political regimes,
   especially democracy. In this paper, we broaden this approach: besides
   the institutional traits of democracy, we analyze how governments and
   their ideologies influence state capacity. In particular, we assess the
   impact of democracy and executives' partisanship on a composite index of
   state capacity, based on political order, administrative ability, and
   extractive capacity. To this end, we apply a pooled cross-sectional
   time-series model to 18 Latin American countries between 1995 and 2009.
   Our findings suggest that, in recent years, state capacity in the region
   was significantly affected by both democratic features and the
   ideological bearing of elected governments.},

Abstract = {Existing research on policy diffusion focuses almost exclusively on
   ``successes{''} where many jurisdictions adopted the policy or policies
   under examination. Some have speculated that this ``pro-innovation
   bias{''} compromises scholars' ability to draw valid inferences about
   the factors that influence the diffusion process. We argue that the
   study of interstate compacts in the United States provides an analytic
   opportunity to assess whether these concerns are warranted because it
   allows us to examine an entire universe of cases with unusually wide
   variability in their adoption patterns. Based on a pooled event history
   analysis of the interstate compacts that are open to all fifty states,
   we conclude that the tendency to limit diffusion research to widely
   adopted policies affects the results of previous studies. Specifically,
   it appears to lead scholars to systematically overestimate the impact of
   geographic diffusion pressures and policy attributes, and to
   underestimate the importance of professional associations and the
   opportunity to learn from previous adoptions. In sum, the longstanding
   concerns about a pro-innovation bias in diffusion research seem to be
   warranted.},

Abstract = {In this paper we investigate to what extent perceptions of economic
   conditions, policy-oriented evaluations, and blame attribution affected
   Californians' involvement in political activities in 2010. We use a
   statistical methodology that allows us to study not only the behavior of
   the average citizen, but also the behavior of ``types'' of citizens with
   latent predispositions that incline them toward participation or
   abstention. The 2010 election is an excellent case study, because it was
   a period when citizens were still suffering the consequences of the 2008
   financial crisis and many were concerned about the state's budgetary
   crisis. We find that individuals who blamed one of the parties for the
   problems with the budget process, and who held a position on the 2010
   Affordable Care Act, were often considerably more likely to participate.
   We also find, however, that the impact of economic evaluations,
   positions on the health care reform, and blame attributions was
   contingent on citizens' latent participation propensities and depended
   on the class of political activity.},

Abstract = {Physical appearance, both our own and that of others, is a common
   influence on social interactions. In this article, we consider whether
   appearance also plays a role in how we come to understand politics. As a
   test, we use American National Election Study survey data, which
   includes the interviewer's subjective ratings of respondents' appearance
   and perceived political knowledge. We bolster the ANES results with a
   pair of survey experiments where subjects evaluated randomly assigned
   potential political discussion partners. Our results show that more
   attractive individuals are viewed as more knowledgeable and more
   persuasive, and are more likely to be sought out by others for political
   information. In addition, more attractive individuals (even the
   relatively uninformed) are more likely to report attempting to persuade
   others. These findings have implications for our understanding of how
   citizens identify political experts, the potential for the spread of
   misinformation, and the political judgments citizens make.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to our understanding of the development of the
   federal aspect of the Electoral College by analyzing how and why states
   adopted the general ticket method currently used by all but two states.
   I examine early state experimentation with methods of choosing
   presidential electors, at a time when several prominent founders viewed
   the district system as the most principled method. I also focus on
   developments after the 1824 election, when Congress rejected a
   constitutional amendment requiring states to adopt the district system
   and the general ticket system grew in popularity. I show that it was in
   the course of these debates in the 1820s that the general ticket system
   acquired a new principled defense: that it best represented state
   majorities in the presidential selection process. This analysis enhances
   our understanding of one of the political safeguards of federalism, by
   explaining the entrenchment of state authority over the mode of choosing
   electors as well as adoption and justification of the general ticket
   system.},

   and member state governments established a number of measures aimed at
   enhancing coordination of budgetary and economic policy. The development
   of these measures came with considerable political conflicts. This

   in the German Bundestag contributed to these conflicts by employing
   their information and control instruments. Differences in level of

   strategic behaviors. The article contributes to political science

Abstract = {With the increase of ethnic conflicts and ethnic groups' mobilizations
   for ethno-nationalism to secure and share state power, the concept of
   decentralization has also been getting attention in ethnically plural
   countries, and many of them have taken advantages of adopting
   decentralization policies for the empowerment of diverse groups in their
   state cum nation-building process. Similarly, the requests and supports
   for the adaptation of different forms of decentralization as to
   accommodate number of political and administrative demands and claims
   emerging from different ethnic groups within a country has also
   increased in the recent past. This has induced the researcher and
   international actors to develop different definitions, interpretations,
   and objectives for decentralization on its ethnic diversity
   accommodation perspective. This paper attempted to conceptualize the
   decentralization as a tool for ethnic diversity accommodation through
   reviewing the existing literary definitions, explanations and with
   researchers' interpretive arguments. The finding reveals that
   decentralization initiatives, like other impacts, in number of ways,
   contributes to accommodate rights, interests, needs and claims of
   competing ethnic groups, especially of ethnic minorities and accommodate
   them within the larger political system and their local attachments.
   However, the success of this process highly depends on the mechanisms
   adopted for sharing powers and responsibilities; the nature, subject and
   decree of decentralized power; and the willingness of authorities to
   allow the groups to exercise those powers, with other factors.},

Abstract = {Triangle relationships usually occur between three parties that are
   neither friends nor allies. The subtle nature of the triangle, wherein
   change of one pair of bilateral ties impacts the other two
   geopolitically, is determined by many factors, among which pursuit for
   balance of power in the changing landscape of geopolitics is usually the
   most decisive. In this context, the interactions among China, the U.S.
   and India in recent years seem to have brought up the birth of a new
   triangle in international politics. It is the U.S. that pushed for this
   interactive formula in the first place when India's role and function as
   a counterweighing element was perceived. The dynamics have remained
   unchanged since the U.S. decided to make a nuclear deal with India
   despite various difficulties. However, China, the subject against which
   India was seen as a counterweight, is trying to keep itself away from
   the game in order to diminish the impacts of these interactions. Dealing
   with the other two nations separately, China continues to work on
   improving and redefining China-India relations not because of closer
   U.S.-Indian ties, but rather, because of its perception of India's
   status as both its close neighbor and another rising power. This
   particular situation puts India in a position to play its own balancing
   game to maximize its self-interests. India's pursuit for global power
   status will be promoted by its attempts toward achieving economic growth
   and military buildup. In both areas, India is likely to obtain more
   leverage in keeping a balanced approach to handling China and the U.S.
   In that sense, the geopolitical model between the three is already
   taking shape, if only perceptually, though it is still far away from
   substantial operation in real politik terms. Given the different sizes
   and power statuses of China and India, the U.S. may find it difficult to
   manage its relations with both nations, and the future of the triangle
   will thus remain largely uncertain.},

Abstract = {States and aid agencies use employment programs to rehabilitate
   high-risk men in the belief that peaceful work opportunities will deter
   them from crime and violence. Rigorous evidence is rare. We
   experimentally evaluate a program of agricultural training, capital
   inputs, and counseling for Liberian ex-fighters who were illegally
   mining or occupying rubber plantations. Fourteen months after the
   program ended, men who accepted the program offer increased their farm
   employment and profits, and shifted work hours away from illicit
   activities. Men also reduced interest in mercenary work in a nearby war.
   Finally, some men did not receive their capital inputs but expected a
   future cash transfer instead, and they reduced illicit and mercenary
   activities most of all. The evidence suggests that illicit and mercenary
   labor supply responds to small changes in returns to peaceful work,
   especially future and ongoing incentives. But the impacts of training
   alone, without capital, appear to be low.},

Abstract = {Human rights can be understood as formal norms related to existing
   legislations as well as the result of public reasoning, when claims of
   validity coming from the bottom up are politically juridified. Yet,
   where does the ``significance{''} of human rights come from? Does the
   ``feeling{''} toward the violation of human dignity rise only from the
   mobilization of radical spheres in the public space, or does it have
   origin in other places, like in the intimacy of the household? In order
   to understand ex negativo the genealogy of the ``sense{''} of the
   violation of human rights as a counter-factual allegation that
   immanently refers to daily life experiences, this article considers the
   interaction between sentiment of fear and pretense of human rights,
   comparing images and imaginaries of modern political theory with the
   stories of traditional folk/fairy tales. Namely, philosophical
   representations of terror and literary narratives of monsters have a
   common ``private{''} genealogy, as it shines through the hidden
   relationship existing between imagination, imaginary, and fantasy.
   Therefore, the character of the ``wolf,{''} as politically
   conceptualized by Thomas Hobbes and fictionally represented in fairy
   tales, will be taken as a conceptual and figurative medium, able to
   underline the semantics of violence. My thesis is that fantastic
   narratives implicitly evoke forms of violation of human rights that
   political philosophy has denied for centuries because of the incapacity
   to conceptualize unspeakable offenses. Fairy tales tell the truth,
   albeit under camouflaged ``bodies{''}: they are a disguised reminder of
   the perdurance of domestic violence in the household, seamlessly
   perpetuated against women and children over centuries. Any criticism
   toward the abuse of human rights should not forget the heuristic
   significance of fairy tales and the place where they seem to be
   peacefully narrated to children: within the domestic space of the
   family.},

Abstract = {In government, the SNP has accentuated stability, public provision, and
   integration in health care and focused energy and patience in neglected
   `Cinderella' policy areas such as mental health, public health, and
   health inequalities. This approach is not dissimilar to the policies of
   previous devolved Scottish governments. It makes Scotland an unusual
   kind of NHS system-one with stability and long-term focus on issues that
   are not obvious political winners. The SNP's successes in health come
   from building on, holding firm to, and developing this distinctively
   Scottish style of health policy.},

Abstract = {Since coming to power in 2007 the SNP have had to govern in two
   significant shadows. The first shadow is that of the financial crisis
   and the austerity programme of the UK's coalition government. The second
   shadow is that of ongoing constitutional change. This article considers
   both the economy and the constitution. It argues that, whilst the SNP in
   office have taken some measures to mitigate the effects of the crisis
   and the policies of the UK coalition government, they have introduced a
   number of policies that represent a triumph of style over substance. The
   article also raises questions about the additional powers that will be
   coming to Holyrood, especially regarding the practicalities of these
   powers and their ability to allow the Scottish Government to create a
   dramatically different welfare system to that in operation in the rest
   of the UK.},

Abstract = {The end of the Cold War witnessed the proliferation of competitive
   authoritarian regimes in the third world and more particularly in
   Africa. Levitsky and Way, the founders of the concept ``competitive
   authoritarianism{''}, maintain that although elections have regularly
   been held, their typical feature remains a blending of competition with
   varying degrees of authoritarianism. Yet, in their competitive
   authoritarianism trajectories, the United Republic of Tanzania is
   considered stable authoritarian. This article advances two arguments:
   (a) Tanzania, as a union of two countries, Tanganyika and Zanzibar,
   exhibits a case where organisational party strength varies across
   territory, thereby affecting electoral competitiveness and manipulation
   by the ruling regime, and (b) as a consequence, Levitsky and Way do not
   effectively capture the linkage and leverage factors concerning
   Tanzania.},

Title = {Throwing the rascals out? Problems of accountability in two-party
   systems},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {55},

Abstract = {This article critically examines the concept of `accountability' as it
   is understood in two-party systems and majoritarian democracy - namely
   the ability of voters to remove governments that violate their mandates
   or otherwise perform poorly. Voters' capacity to `throw the rascals out'
   is one of the main normative appeals of two-partism and the
   single-member plurality (SMP) electoral system. However, this article
   uses a spatial model to show that in at least two types of situation
   voters are left in a bind when confronted with a mandate-breaking
   governing party: (1) when both major parties undertake unexpected
   non-centrist shifts in opposing directions after an election, leaving
   centrist voters with an unappealing choice; and (2) when a governing
   party that had won an election on a non-centrist platform undertakes a
   post-election shift to the centre, leaving its more radical supporters
   dissatisfied. In each case, voters have four imperfect options: punish
   the governing party by throwing the rascals out, but in doing so vote
   for a party that is ideologically more distant; abstain, and withdraw
   from the democratic process; vote for a minor party that has no hope of
   influencing government formation, but which might detach enough votes to
   allow the ideologically more distant major opposition party to win; and
   forgive the governing party its mandate-breaking. All of these options
   represent accountability failures. The problems are illustrated with two
   case studies from two-party systems: the United Kingdom in the mid-1980s
   and New Zealand in the period 1984-1993. In both instances, many voters
   found it difficult to `throw the rascals out' without harming their own
   interests in the process. The article concludes that accountability may
   sometimes be better achieved if voters can force a party to share power
   in coalition with another party in order to `keep it honest' instead of
   removing it from government completely, as can happen in multi-party
   systems based on proportional representation. Thus, although two-partism
   based on plurality voting is normally regarded as superior to
   multi-partism and proportional representation on the criterion of
   accountability, in some instances, the reverse can be true. The article
   therefore undermines a core normative argument advanced by supporters of
   majoritarian democracy and SMP.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the ways in which gender relations are
   articulated through a particular communicative urban infrastructure,
   such as names of public spaces and public art. We argue that their
   selective design and distribution suggest meanings beyond functional
   purposes (to serve as orientation points or as national commemorative
   sites) and co-constitute gendered power relations. Reading the patterns
   of signification, formulation and positioning of names, plaques and
   statues in Zagreb, through our raft of statistical analysis, mapping,
   and ethnographic walks, we show that the urban signage of the capital of
   Croatia, in a time of increased debates about gender equality and
   identity, continues to uphold the patriarchy inherited from earlier
   periods of city growth, namely the late 19th/early 20th centuries and
   mid-20th century. Our spatial analysis concerns not only the frequency
   but also spatial distribution and forms of representation of women in
   the names of public spaces and commemorative plaques and statues. The
   research presented here suggests that Zagreb's public urban signage
   significantly prefers men to women as actors in public space and
   nation's history. We discuss our findings from the perspective of
   critical and constructivist approaches in cultural studies and
   contextualise them with reference to the ways in which contemporary
   urban spaces are said to be `mediated cities'.},

Abstract = {How does national crisis management affect the electoral fortunes of
   coalition governments? Drawing on micro-level data from just before the
   2009 federal elections in Germany, this article investigates how voters'
   evaluation of specific policies against the global financial crisis
   affected approval of and voting intentions for the then-governing grand
   coalition. We find that voters in favour of the two most prominent
   anti-crisis policies, the car-scrap bonus and the public guarantee for
   banks, were more likely to approve of and to vote for the two incumbent
   parties. These evaluations of specific policies influenced individuals'
   vote choice in addition to their assessments of the economic situation
   more generally and in addition to party identification. This suggests
   that even in the greatest economic turmoil with blurred political
   responsibilities, government parties can win or lose voters through the
   implementation of specific economic policies.},

Abstract = {This article reports on an attempt to forecast the outcome of the 2013
   election to the German Bundestag. In contrast to the predominant
   academic approach to forecast incumbent vote shares from measures of
   government popularity, economic conditions and other fundamental
   variables, we entirely relied on data from published trial heat polls.
   Opposite to common practice in the news media, we did not take isolated
   polls as election forecasts in their own right. Instead, we used
   historical data to assess empirically the relationship between polls and
   election outcomes, and combined extrapolations from current polls in a
   Bayesian manner. The forecast was published one month ahead of the
   election. The retrospective evaluation of our method was added after the
   election. While our method is parsimonious and provides a large lead
   time, the performance at the 2013 election was underwhelming. We offer
   additional suggestions how the approach can be improved in future
   scenarios.},

Abstract = {This article realizes a systematic organization and analysis of the
   decisions taken by the Spanish Constitutional Court concerning the
   measures adopted by the Generalitat of Catalonia conducive to the
   attainment of independence by this Autonomous Community since 2013. The
   decisions analyzed here are final judgements and procedural judicial
   orders that have established relevant constitutional jurisprudence, as
   much on substantial issues directly affected by the Catalonian
   independence process - the sovereignty of the Spanish nation, the
   primacy of the Constitution, the referendum - as on other peripheral
   issues. The Constitutional Court concludes that neither the mentioned
   activities of the Generalitat of Catalonia conducive to the attainment
   of independence by this Autonomous Community, nor the legal instruments
   used so far for this purpose may be accepted within the framework of the
   Spanish Constitution of 1978 and the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia,
   which is a constitutional offspring.},

Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {219-248},
Abstract = {Previous research suggests that female candidates do not face
   fundraising barriers; however, female politicians consistently report
   that fundraising is more difficult for them than their male colleagues.
   Using a regression discontinuity design to hold district characteristics
   constant, we study whether there is a gender gap in campaign fundraising
   for state legislators from 1990 to 2010. We find that male candidates
   raise substantially more money than female candidates. Further, male
   donors give more money to male candidates, while female donors,
   political parties, and PACs give approximately equally to men and women.
   At the same time, men face challengers who raise more money;
   consequently, male and female incumbents do not differ in the proportion
   of the overall district money that they raise in their next reelection
   bid. These results suggest that there are gender inequalities in
   campaign finance, but they may not have immediate consequence for
   women's representation.},

Abstract = {We argue that when it comes to assessing a country's economic
   performance, institutional stability is more important than specific
   institutional design features. Applying this general framework to the
   subfield of judicial politics, we contend that a) judicial stability is
   a determinant of economic growth, and b) this result is autonomous of
   judicial independence. After empirically evaluating the impact of
   judicial stability and judicial independence on the rate of economic
   growth in sixteen Latin American countries over the twentieth century,
   our findings show that there is sufficient evidence to support our
   hypotheses and to encourage further research on the differences between
   judicial stability and judicial independence.},

Abstract = {Since the Maidan protests in late 2013, women have played crucial roles
   in all sectors in the conflict in Ukraine: politics, civil society,
   reconciliation efforts, and armed fighting. The conflict has offered new
   challenges and opportunities for their emancipation, influence, and
   empowerment, but also for growing violations of their human rights.
   Despite their activism, women and gender issues remain underrepresented
   in the Minsk process for the resolution of the conflict, despite ongoing
   efforts by international organizations and pressure from civil society.
   International and national support for women's participation in dialogue
   and cooperation has increased, but needs to be sustained and expanded to
   new grassroots groups and women leaders for more visible impact. The
   article reflects the author's personal observations on how women's roles
   have evolved in the Ukrainian crisis by drawing on her field experience,
   meetings, interviews, and reports by international and national
   organizations.},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates how party leaders (frontbenchers) and
   backbenchers use their access to UK Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) to
   represent the policy agenda. Building on comparative research on
   parliamentary questions and agenda-setting as well as taking account of
   the particular context of PMQs, we argue that party leaders and
   followers draw attention to different kinds of policy topics with the
   express purpose of influencing the government. Based on a content
   analysis of over 9,000 questions between 1997 and 2008, we demonstrate
   how the posing of questions affects subsequent agenda, varying according
   to whether questions come from the front or backbench, from government
   and opposition and from different parties. The findings demonstrate that
   PMQs helps both the opposition and backbenchers draw attention to issues
   that the government and opposition party leadership does not always wish
   to attend to.},

Abstract = {At the end of June 1914, revolutionary-minded young people murdered the
   heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne and his wife in
   Sarajevo. The assassination was the culmination of a series of terrorist
   acts that the youth movement Young Bosnia had planned and carried out
   against representatives of the Dual Monarchy since 1910. The attacks
   were an expression of the increasing tensions between the South Slavic
   national movements and the imperial centres of Vienna and Budapest, but
   also between the South Slavic movements themselves. Among the assassins,
   personal and political frustration blended to form an implacable hatred
   of Austria. The rest was provided by the consumption of radical writings
   that glorified violence, appealed for revolutionary action, and heralded
   a better order on earth after the overthrow of the alleged tyrants. The
   Sarajevo assassination triggered a spiral of escalation that within four
   weeks led to the First World War.},

   such as travel bans and control orders, in the counter-terrorism
   context. On the basis of a review of the use of these measures in three
   selected states (the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands), the
   paper provides a critical assessment of the use of administrative
   measures in counter-terrorism. It identifies situations in which the use
   of administrative measures might be justified, and assesses the impact
   of the use of these measures on the protection of human rights. In
   conclusion, the paper recommends that limits and safeguards be
   established around the use of administrative measures in

Abstract = {Feminist thought is a constitutive part of political thought and its
   history. It is both a method of inquiry, a voice and a stance on the
   world, a claim of women's political centrality, and a paradoxical
   critique of modern political and philosophical thought. As unexpected
   objection, feminist discourse constantly stretches the borders of the
   political canon and produces critical political theory, imposing the
   redefinition of the categories used to interpret the present and the
   past. Going through six centuries of history, from the reappropriation
   of tradition in XV century to the tension with neoliberalism in XX.
   century, protofeminist and feminist discourse constitutes in time a
   constant interruption of the monologue of Western patriarchal
   civilization, showing its centrality in the production, crisis and
   redefinition of political and social order. Thus, feminist discourse is
   an essential source of the history of political thought.},

Abstract = {Why do so few working-class Americans go on to hold political office?
   This paper uses data on state legislatures to assess several common (and
   often untested) explanations. Contrary to the widespread view that
   workers are less likely to hold office because they are less qualified,
   I find no relationship between the qualifications of workers in a given
   state and their representation in the state legislature. The shortage of
   the working class in office appears to have far more to do with
   structural characteristics of the political landscape such as parties,
   interest groups, and institutions. Scholars who want to understand why
   there are so few working-class Americans in political office - and
   people who want to do something about it - should probably focus on
   these kinds of ``demand-side{''} forces, not on the supposed
   ``supply-side{''} shortcomings of the working class.},

Abstract = {The extent of human cooperation depends on the institutional arenas
   wherein people interact. Scholars from the Ostrom school have been
   particularly interested in how behavior in common property institutions
   differs from private property. Using a model of reciprocal motivations,
   I hypothesize that common property institutions elicit less cooperation
   than private property institutions in post-Communist Bulgaria. To
   investigate this hypothesis, this article reports on a series of
   experiments that examine the effects of common and private property in
   the trust game. The results indicate that common property institutions
   in Bulgaria elicit less cooperation than private property.},

Abstract = {In the context of international affairs, two group of countries receive
   a particular attention of the academic and political analysis:
   Traditional Middle Powers and Emerging Middle Powers. Traditional Middle
   Powers are represented by industrialized, democratic and egalitarian
   countries with a high level of social and political development and
   considered ``good international citizens{''}, as long as they help to
   preserve the order established by the hegemonic powers (as an example,
   Australia, Canada, Japan). The concept of Emerging Middle Powers referee
   to countries with a great economic performance and international
   projection but unconcerned about welfare policies, specially, because
   they not present a consolidated democratic political system and an
   adequate level of social equality, as the case of the BRICS (Brazil,
   Russia, India, China and South Africa). In this complex scenery, it is
   possible to find a group of countries unnoticed by the international
   political theory, which is located in an intermediate point between
   Traditional and Emerging Middle Powers. They are characterized by the
   existence of policies orientated to link economic growth and good
   quality of life that is reflected in their high level of Human
   Development (HDI). Therefor, we evidence the need to construct a
   conceptual identity for this group of countries to give them a
   political-institutional profile in the new world order and to establish
   their role in the international context.},

   establishment of the communist system free from class struggle and
   alienation, D.Davydov considers social-personalist revolution a more
   plausible scenario. Such revolution, in his opinion, could lead to
   meritocracy as well as to the development of the social-personalist
   society per se, in which priority of assets accumulation is trumped by
   the priority of personal self-realization, and the inevitable class
   inequality coexists with the leading role of a creative individual.},

Title = {Federalism, gubernatorial power and the incorporation of subnational
   authoritarianism in Russia: A theory-testing empirical inquiry},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {51},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-79},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article investigates the complex relationship between federalism
   and electoral authoritarianism by making an empirical inquiry into the
   structure of incentives that shaped the reform of Russia's regional
   election laws in 2004-2009. The idea behind the reform was to make the
   incumbent governors more manageable and more dependent on the federal
   authorities. However, the process of its practical implementation
   largely coincided with Russia's transition to electoral
   authoritarianism, as a result of which this original intention was
   reversed by endowing regional authorities with an unrestricted effective
   power to determine the course of the reform. The main hypothesis of this
   study is that bounded only by the reform framework, the governors
   exerted their influence to maximize one of their main assets, the
   loyalty of the regional assembles. In order to substantiate this
   hypothesis empirically, a model formalizing the governors' optimization
   problem is constructed, its possible implications are discussed and
   their statistical support is examined. The results obtained support the
   theory according to which electoral authoritarianism, rather than simply
   suppressing the autonomy of most powerful subnational actors,
   incorporates them by expanding their effective control over the regional
   political arenas. The previously existing federal arrangements are
   instrumental in pursuing this goal.},

   This article considers recent changes in the UK and Europe that appear
   to challenge this idea. Exploring Colin Crouch's notion of
   `post-democratic' party politics and considering his diagnosis of shifts
   in parties' agenda setting, organisation and communication, the article
   considers evidence of post-democratic politics and the possibility for
   future renewal.},

Abstract = {The problem of political and economic regulation of contemporary global
   transformations, taken in the context of the New World Order discourse,
   attracts attention in Russia and abroad alike. Considering this problem,
   British analysts Ken Booth and Nickolas Wheeler underline three major
   approaches to security dilemma, namely, fatalist, mitigator, and
   transcender logics. Followers of the fatalist approach (neo-realists,
   globalists) believe that world order is a zero-sum game, where
   interstate interactions are mostly confrontational, and their pattern
   depends on the current balance of power. Mitigators (neo-liberals,
   functionalists, constructivists, etc.) insist that the emerging world
   order is a win-win game, where nations opt for investing some of their
   sovereignty into newly created international institutions (regimes and
   organizations), hoping that conventional rules adopted by them would
   help to decrease international uncertainty, which otherwise might lead
   to confrontation. Transcenders (neo-Marxists, feminists, anarchists,
   federalists, etc.) consider the existing world order an archaic one,
   calling for a new, fair and humane pattern of international relations.
   According to their logic, the new world order is the end of the game
   among sovereign states, because it derives from the idea of humankind
   not divided by national boundaries but united into a global
   transnational society.},

Abstract = {The article wants to bridge the gap between Comparative Politics and
   International Relations by recourse to the nearly forgotten
   Latin-American dependency theories. To do this, first of all the
   deficits of Western democratization research with respect to external
   factors of autocratization and democratization processes will be
   highlighted. Then, linking the structural analysis of dependency theory
   with the neorealist approach in International Relations, the article
   develops an interference model that will be used to analyse the
   political developments in postcolonial areas since the Second World War.
   As a result, the article presents an explanation of the wave-like
   character of autocratization and democratization as an alternative to
   Western research into political transformation.},

Abstract = {This article discusses, from the local professional perspective, access
   to justice for person-specific interventions to prevent or counter
   (violent) extremism in Europe. Using a Dutch case study it focusses on
   legal protection for hand-tailored interferences that are part of a
   wider-ranging counter-terrorism policy. While the so-called
   person-specific interventions, carried out by professionals, target
   designated high-risk individuals and groups, it is primarily the
   municipal authority that coordinates these criminal -, administrative -
   or social based measures. Furthermore, although researchers and human
   rights advocates have repeatedly sounded the alarm over access to
   justice for those affected, little research has been done into how those
   responsible for implementation perceive the necessity of legal
   protection. Also, the potential side-effects such as executive
   arbitrariness are modestly reflected in the literature. Henceforth, by
   reviewing policy documents and conducting semi-structured interviews,
   this exploratory study concludes that as far as legal protection for
   hand-tailored interferences are concerned, local professionals have
   faith in the checks and balances of the criminal justice system. Yet
   from their perspective this was less self-evident in cases of
   administrative - or social measures. Therefore, one may wonder if legal
   protections for person-specific interventions that deal with (potential)
   extremists are - sufficient in practice.},

Abstract = {Despite widespread acknowledgment of the importance of interdisciplinary
   pedagogy, disciplinary teaching remains the norm on most campuses,
   primarily due to cost and institutional constraints. Bridging the gap
   between literature on interdisciplinary teaching and active-learning
   techniques, this article describes an innovative and less costly
   approach through the linkage of case-study active-learning techniques
   with interdisciplinary principles at a small liberal arts college. We
   apply this student-centered approach to teaching international
   development, a field that critically needs integration across several
   social sciences. A practical way for political scientists to encourage
   under-graduate-level interdisciplinary thinking is to develop a case
   study that asks students to utilize practical problem-solving skills and
   policy analysis. We analyze the implementation and assessment of such a
   case study, discuss its successes and shortcomings and provide
   suggestions for expanded implementation. We also discuss the broad
   applicability of this approach to topics that require integration across
   disciplines in a variety of institutional settings.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2016},
Number = {3},
Pages = {25-39},
Abstract = {The article analyzes social, cultural and psychological bases of Soviet
   image, value and symbolic actualization in modern Russia. The data from
   political values and images of the Soviet past in the study of mass
   consciousness of Russian citizens, on the one hand, and image and
   symbolic space of the political communication of public institutions,
   political parties and public organizations of the Russian Federation, on
   the other, is analyzed. The analysis is based on the political and
   psychological concept of national identity which involves the study of
   the three components of this phenomenon: the political images, the
   political values and symbols. The analysis defined the main stages of
   transformation of the Soviet past representation in the citizens' mind
   and in public policy of the post-Soviet period: the stage of destruction
   of the Soviet image of the world (1990-ies.), the stage of fragmentary
   interest (2000s.) and the stage of system-functional actualization
   (2010-ies.). The authors show that actualization of Soviet imagery and
   symbols, which are generally deprived of the ideological component, is
   currently in process. Perceptions of earlier historical epochs are not
   symbolically significant for the citizens and are fragmentary
   represented by the mass media in connection with some events or
   anniversaries, while the image of the Soviet past is firmly stored in
   the people's historical memory and is transmitted to the next
   generations. The study concludes, that the appeal to images and values
   of the Soviet past (deprived, as a rule, of their ideological component)
   was a response to the ongoing process of finding value, image and
   symbolic bases for Russian national identity.},

Abstract = {In the field of international relations, Rousseau is generally
   considered an antiutopian and an exponent of the realist tradition. This
   view is based on his distrust of alliances and peace plans but also on
   the fact that he never offered any solution to how to lastingly ban war
   from the international scene. In this article, I argue instead that
   Rousseau's failure to propose any solutions in international politics
   lies rather in the utopian nature of his political philosophy. Rousseau
   intended to find remedies to the question of international law; if he
   never articulated them, it is, I submit, because the mere discussion of
   international relations would have undermined the lack of relationality
   which characterizes his model Republic. By envisioning the ideal state
   as self-sufficient and isolated (i.e. in the image of the unsociable man
   in the state of nature), Rousseau renders impractical the aspiration he
   had of resolving the question of sociability between states.},

Title = {PARTICIPATING UNEQUALLY? Assessing the Macro-Micro Relationship Between

Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {A great deal of attention has been paid to the consequences of economic
   inequality on political participation, yet only few empirical studies
   address the macro-micro relationship between income inequality and
   individual engagement. Furthermore, empirical indications diverge and
   give rise to competing theoretical arguments to be tested. This article
   seeks to fill this gap and to do so by using the latest round of the
   European Social Survey (ESS). The contribution is twofold: on the one
   hand, it establishes a direct link between measures of economic and
   political inequality - albeit of a particular type. On the other, it
   provides an up-to-date picture on participatory trends in Europe. In
   more details, income inequality is found to depress overall political
   participation and, most importantly, to increase the participatory gap
   between rich and poor for all unconventional forms of engagement.},

Title = {Marxism in the Anthropocene: Dialectical Rifts on the Left},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {393-421},
Abstract = {Natural scientists have pointed to the Anthropocene as a new geological
   epoch, with the precise dating not yet decided, but often traced to the
   Great Acceleration of the human impact on the environment since 1945.
   Thus understood, the Anthropocene largely coincides with the rise of the
   modern environmental movement and corresponds to the age of planetary
   crisis. This paper looks at the evolution of Marxian and left
   contributions to environmental thought during this period. Although
   Marx's ecological materialism is now widely recognized, with the
   rediscovery of his theory of metabolic rift, the debate has recently
   shifted to ecological dialectics, including dualism, monism, totality,
   and mediation, generating a conflict between ecological Marxism and
   radical ecological monism. It is argued here that only an ecological
   Marxism, rooted in a materialist dialectic of nature and society, is
   able to engage effectively with the Great Climacteric that increasingly
   governs our times.},

Abstract = {Social movements scholarship has increasingly turned to the study of
   direct social actions (DSAs) in times of economic hardship. This paper
   broadens this perspective to extreme right organisations. Combining a
   Political Claims Analysis of newspaper articles and online press
   releases, with a qualitative discussion of online propaganda material,
   we explore the engagement in direct social activism by three neo-fascist
   organisations in Italy: Forza Nuova, Fiamma Tricolore and CasaPound
   Italia (1996 - 2015). Our findings suggest that their propensity to
   direct social activism, rather than being exclusively related to
   economic distress, responds to a broad set of ideological,
   organisational and strategic incentives. Ideologically, DSAs are linked
   to the interpretation of the relationship between ideas and action of
   historical Fascism and of parts of the Italian neo-fascist tradition.
   Organisationally, DSAs serve as a tool to build support and solidarity,
   especially at the local level. Strategically, they are used to frame
   activism as a direct intervention in defence of interests of native
   peoples, and against political elites accused of being unresponsive to
   the needs of citizens. Our results offer a first empirical observation
   of the use of DSAs by extreme right actors, paving the way for
   comparative work at the cross-national level and on different arenas of
   engagement.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this essay is to reconstruct the relationship between
   subalterns, religion, and philosophy in Antonio Gramsci's Prison
   Notebooks. With the birth of mass society-that is, with the entry onto
   the political scene of the popular masses, and above all of the
   peasantry-politics entered directly into relation with irrational
   passions bound up with the religious mentality, and hegemony was
   constructed not thanks to the institution of a ``filter{''} for the
   passions (as was the parliament of ``notables{''}) but through the
   mastering of those ``passions{''} using forms of Caesarist and
   charismatic democracy. In Gramsci's view, the political action of the
   subaltern classes had to confront this new form of hegemony by
   recognizing the value of the profound content of religious ideas (which
   always indicate the need for a unification of theory and practice) and
   by working on a ``translation{''} of those ideas into the forms of
   self-organization and self-emancipation.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {419-432},
Abstract = {The 2016 Austrian presidential election was remarkably different than
   the previous ones in the history of the country characterized by its
   stable political system. Not only did it open the role of president in
   Austria to debate, but it also sidelined the two political parties that
   had dominated Austrian politics since World War II. Alexander Van der
   Bellen won the election with one of the closest margins in recent
   history. This article argues that the election divided the country in
   more than one way. Besides the near 50-50 divide between the candidates,
   the results show that it generated important dynamics in territorial
   politics as well, notably in the states and cities of Austria. These
   results point towards a party system transformation in Austrian
   politics.},

Volume = {9},

Pages = {161-187},
Abstract = {African Union member states are formally responsible for deciding on
   peace operation mandates, yet evidence from the African Union Peace and
   Security Council indicates that states informally delegate some
   decision-making autonomy to the commission. Given the commission's
   formal responsibilities in implementation, why have member states
   delegated any decision-making in international security? This article
   argues that, faced with resource limitations, African Union states
   surrender some decision-making autonomy to access relevant information,
   make informed decisions, and strengthen mandates. The argument
   challenges assertions that delegation does not occur in security
   decision-making. Findings draw on interviews with African Union
   ambassadors, commission staff, and other regional organization elites.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes Adam Smith's endorsement of economic growth and
   asks what it might mean for a scenario of low or zero growth in the
   Western economies. It distinguishes two models of economic growth in
   Smith's writing. The first, a ``trickle down{''} scenario, plays a
   marginal role; Smith's main focus is on a model in which the growth of
   productive capital and of jobs reinforce one another. There are three
   desiderata that this second model of growth achieves: a distribution
   that benefits the worst-off and leads to more equality in the long run,
   the harmonization of individual interests and societal interests, and
   the strengthening of the independence of citizens from employers, and of
   the political sphere from economic influences. To achieve these
   desiderata in a low or zero growth scenario, institutional reforms are
   needed, but such a scenario need not be as bleak as Smith imagined, as
   arguments by John Stuart Mill show.},

Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2016},
Number = {51},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates that the semantic contradiction between
   Western and Non Western democracies is based upon particular tensions
   and antinomies which constitute the conceptual history of democracy and
   can therefore be reconstructed genealogically. In search of crucial
   characteristics the traditional Western idea of liberal democracy and
   Non-Western innovations have in common, this contribution argues against
   the assumption that there is a definite transcultural interpretation or
   also a minimal consensus concerning the `core idea' of democracy.
   Instead, it focusses on the overlapping elements the global discourse
   about democracy shows at its boundaries. Accordingly, democratic
   antinomies offer a conceptual framework that illustrates both the common
   grounds and differences between the established ideas of democracy in
   Europe, America, Africa or Asia as well as the legitimacy and
   authenticity Western and Non-Western approaches may each claim.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {65-78},
Abstract = {Many Keynesian economists envisioned a new dawn of Keynesianism in the
   2007-8 financial meltdown in the United States. Nearly seven years
   later, it is clear that the much-hoped-for Keynesian prescriptions are
   completely ignored. Why? Keynesian economists' answer: ``neoliberal
   ideology,{''} which they trace back to President Reagan. This study
   argues, by contrast, that the rise of neoliberalism has much deeper
   roots than pure ideology, that the transition from Keynesian to
   neoliberal economics started long before Reagan was elected president,
   and that the Keynesian reliance on the ability of the government to
   regulate and revive the economy through policies of demand management
   rests on a wishful/optimistic perception that the state can control
   capitalism. The study further argues that the Marxian theory of
   unemployment, based on his theory of the reserve army of labor, provides
   a much more robust explanation of the protracted high levels of
   unemployment than the Keynesian view, which attributes the plague of
   unemployment to the ``misguided policies of neoliberalism.{''} Likewise,
   the Marxian theory of subsistence or near-poverty wages provides a more
   cogent account of how or why such poverty levels of wages, as well as a
   generalized predominance of misery, can go hand-in-hand with high levels
   of profits and concentrated wealth than the Keynesian perceptions, which
   view high levels of employment and wages as necessary conditions for an
   expansionary economic cycle.},

Title = {Eurocentrism and the History of Democracy},
Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2016},
Number = {51},
Pages = {56+},
Abstract = {This paper sets out an ambitious critique of contemporary political
   scientists, political historians and others concerned with the history
   of democracy. It argues that overwhelmingly the history of democracy
   relies on an overtly Eurocentric narrative that emphasizes the keystone
   moments of Western civilization. According to this narrative, democracy
   has a clear trajectory that can be traced from ancient experiments with
   participatory government in Greece and to a lesser extent in Rome,
   through the development of the British parliament, the American
   Declaration of Independence and the French Revolution, and then finally
   onto the triumphant march of the liberal model of democracy across the
   globe over the last 200 years, particularly under Western tutelage.
   Histories of democracy that focus exclusively on these events not only
   privilege Europe and its successful colonies, but also miss the broader
   human story of the struggle for and achievement of democracy. This
   presents us with a distinct challenge. For those whose heritage does not
   include a direct link to Greek assemblies, the American Congress or the
   French Revolution, the `standard history of democracy' provides a
   distant and exclusive narrative, which limits one's ability to embrace
   democracy. This paper concludes by noting that, as democracy spreads out
   across the world today, political scientists not only need to break down
   the intellectual orthodoxy that democracy has exclusively Western roots,
   but also to embrace a more global view of democracy as a political
   practise that has been present at various times and in sometimes
   unfamiliar ways in the complex histories and rich cultural traditions of
   most of the people of the earth.},

Abstract = {How do voter preferences come into focus over the electoral cycle in
   different countries? Do they evolve in patterned ways? Does the
   evolution vary across countries? This article addresses these issues. We
   consider differences in political institutions and how they might impact
   voter preferences over the course of the election cycle. We then outline
   an empirical analysis relating support for parties or candidates in
   pre-election polls to their final vote. The analysis relies on over
   26,000 vote intention polls in 45 countries since 1942, covering 312
   discrete electoral cycles. Our results indicate that early polls contain
   substantial information about the final result but that they become
   increasingly informative over the election cycle. Although the degree to
   which this is true varies across countries in important and
   understandable ways given differences in political institutions, the
   pattern is strikingly general.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Pages = {142-151},
Abstract = {The Paris Climate Agreement of December 2015 marks a decisive break from
   the unsuccessful Kyoto regime. Instead of targets and timetables, it
   established a Pledge and Review system, under which states will offer
   Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to reducing emissions that
   cause climate change. But this successful negotiation outcome was
   achieved at the price of vagueness of obligations and substantial
   discretion for governments. Many governments will be tempted to use the
   vagueness of the Paris Agreement, and the discretion that it permits, to
   limit the scope or intensity of their proposed actions. Whether Pledge
   and Review under the Paris Agreement will lead to effective action
   against climate change will therefore depend on the inclination both of
   OECD countries and newly industrializing countries to take costly
   actions, which for the OECD countries will include financial transfers
   to their poorer partners. Domestic politics will be crucial in
   determining the attitudes of both sets of countries to pay such costs.
   The actual impact of the Paris Agreement will depend on whether it can
   be used by domestic groups favoring climate action as a point of
   leverage in domestic politics-that is, in a ``two-levelgame{''}
   simultaneously involving both international and domestic politics.},

Abstract = {The Cheka, the Emergency Commission for Combating Counter -Revolution
   and Sabotage, was founded in 1917. It is the nucleus which engendered
   the Soviet secret service, a pillar of Stalinism and communist party
   rule. Writers were monitored particularly closely. In 1930, Andrei
   Platonov became a target of the Chekists. They created a ``Platonov
   file{''}, and thanks to the work of their informants, they were aware of
   what he was thinking and writing, preventing his works from being
   published. Although he was denounced as an ``enemy of the people{''}, he
   managed to survive the Great Terror. However, the arrest of his
   15-year-old son in the spring of 1938 and his being sent to prison camp
   for betrayal of the homeland, terrorist and counter-revolutionary
   activity, destroyed not only Platonov's son, but also Platonov himself.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of the dynamics of China's
   foreign policy through the prism of understanding the changes in its
   national interests as understood by the Chinese leadership. It includes
   a brief description of the approaches to the analysis of the national
   interests by Western authors and its comparison with the Chinese
   tradition. Analysis of China's foreign policy changes during the
   transition from the fourth to the fifth generation of Chinese leaders is
   given through the tenets of the Chinese international relations scholar
   Yan Xuetong theory. The main conclusion of the article is that the
   recent assertiveness of the Chinese foreign policy is the result of
   country's successes in achieving economic goals, which made it possible
   to shift priorities from providing economic growth to conquering the
   leading position in the world},

   Century},
Journal = {REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2016},
Number = {171},
Pages = {137-166},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Based on a survey of international literature, this paper proposes the
   classification of citizens' preferences for redistribution in three
   categories that shape those preferences: imperatives of social justice,
   risk aversion and the institutional framework. With the data provided by
   the ``Spanish Institute for Fiscal Studies Fiscal Barometer{''} an
   empirical application for the Spanish case is carried out. We use a
   probit model when the endogenous variable is dichotomized, and a linear
   model estimated through ordinary least squares when the dependent
   variable is an index constructed by principal components. The results,
   consistent with the theory and internatio-nal experience, show that the
   preferences under study, homogeneously distributed throughout the
   country, are based on the three described determinants. In particular
   most of the variables are significantly associated with the description
   of the institutional framework.},

Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2016},
Number = {51},
Pages = {491+},
Abstract = {The insight that the Western liberal conception of democracy is not
   shared universally raises the question whether citizens ``beyond the
   West{''} actually support the principles behind this conception. Taking
   up the debate about the compatibility of Confucianism and liberal
   democracy, this contribution hence analyses the empirical relationship
   between traditional Confucian and liberal democratic value orientations
   for the East Asian context. Based on representative survey data for 13
   political systems in North and Southeast Asia (Asian Barometer Survey,
   2010-2012) it is shown that Confucian values, especially the primacy of
   hierarchy, and liberal democratic values, especially the principle of
   power sharing, appear largely incompatible in the eyes of citizens.},

   Intersections with Italian and European pragmatism},
Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2016},
Number = {18},
Abstract = {This essay reconstructs a number of the historical-philosophical
   sources, extraneous to the tradition of Marxist thought, that came
   together to form the biography of the young Gramsci. It is here
   hypothesized that the particular itinerary of Gramsci's Marxism, which
   came to be defined as anti-determinist, may have been influenced by
   certain philosophical currents (United States and European pragmatism,
   French post-positivist epistemology) outside the tradition of the Second
   and Third Internationals. In attempting to challenge a certain revision
   of Marxism belonging to late nineteenth-century positivism, the young
   Gramsci made use of theoretical equipment that belonged to epistemology,
   together with pragmatist psychology, which taken as a whole allowed him
   to retrace and relaunch the theoretical status of Marx's philosophy.},

Abstract = {Russia faces a fundamental economic crisis. However, this will not lead
   to rapid collapse. Foreign exchange reserves are large, the banking
   system so far rather stable. There is no threat of social unrest either.
   The political leadership is concentrating on maintaining its power and
   pursuing particularistic interests. This exacerbates the situation.
   Without a basic new start, Russia will remain trapped in the natural
   resources cycle and will continue to slide backwards. The only way out
   is to increase legal security. Only when there is no longer a daily risk
   of losing property will capital flight and the outflow of highly
   qualified people stop.},

Journal = {AUSTRIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {45},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {23-34},
Abstract = {Multilateral cooperation schemes involving sub-sets of EU member states
   have proliferated over recent years. Yet, their implications for
   Europeanization research are little understood. Focusing on Austria's
   participation in the Salzburg Forum and in Central European Defence
   Cooperation, this article explores the implications of regional
   cooperation for Europeanization dynamics in the domains of internal and
   external security policy. On the one hand, it argues that multilateral
   cooperation schemes can function as a platform for policy-uploading and
   identifies important conditions that facilitate or impede the success of
   projecting national preferences through multilateral initiatives
   (vertical Europeanization). On the other hand, the article argues that
   multilateral cooperation schemes have led to the emergence of a web of
   loosely linked collaborative network structures that can facilitate the
   horizontal exchange of experiences and lessons learned beyond the
   boundaries of individual multilateral schemes (horizontal
   Europeanization).},

Title = {The Uses of Literacy: A Classic Revisited. Hoggart, the
   Working Classes and Social Mobility},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {29},
Number = {114},
Pages = {21+},
Abstract = {Since it was published in France in 1970, La culture du pauvre
   (translation of The Uses of Literacy) has exerted a strong influence on
   several generations of social scientists and historians. Its analysis of
   working-class lifestyles and the experiences of scholarship students
   still has a significant impact on French studies dealing with social
   mobilities and class relations. Paradoxically, though, these analyses
   have rarely been debated or revisited. Based on recent research and
   various empirical evidence (including unpublished material), this paper
   aims at answering the following questions: How did this book become a
   classic in French social sciences? What new perspectives has it
   afforded, or neglected? Finally, and above all, is it still relevant
   when looking at contemporary French society? Through the history of this
   intellectual importation, a close reading of the texts and new leads for
   some updating, this paper is an invitation to more reflexive and
   informed uses of the Hoggartian analysis. While revisiting Hoggart, our
   goal is to contribute to an unroutinization of his work, mainly by
   focusing on the strengths and limits of two important aspects of his
   book that are still frequently used: the ``us{''} vs. ``them{''}
   structure, as well as his chapter on ``the uprooted and the anxious{''}.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},

Volume = {19},

Pages = {151-172},
Abstract = {Women's representationn in politics in Latin America has grown
   significantly in the last twenty years. There are more women in
   parliaments, more female presidents and presidentical candidates, and
   more female ministers as well. Since 2000 seven out of nineteen Latin
   American countries have achieved substantially high number of female
   ministers (40 50 per cent and more in presidential cabinets. Also the
   percentage of female ministers has increased about 16 \% without using
   gender quotas, during the last four presidential terms. The main goal of
   the article was to find out circumstances contributing to the increase,
   and factors influencing decisions of the presidents to appoint female
   ministers. The research included the percentage of women holding
   ministerial seats in each of last four presidential terms in nineteen
   countries of Latin America (up to 2016). In the study was used ordinary
   least square regression to examine the influence of explanatory
   variables (the ideology of presidents, their effort to be reelected,
   percentage of women in parliaments and socioeconomic development of
   Latin American countries) on the number of female ministers. In
   conclusion, the analysis confirmed higher tendency to appoint women in
   the cases of leftist presidents, striving for reelection in the
   countries with higher percentage of women in parliament. The results
   also indicated connections between appointment of women and populism and
   indirect influence of legislative gender quotas on women's
   representation in government, which are possible ways for future
   research.},

Abstract = {There are many myths about referendums. The most common one is that
   voters are inherently sceptical and tend to vote no when given the
   opportunity. This article analyses some of the commonly held `truths'
   about referendums on EU matters. Based on a statistical analysis of all
   forty-three EU-related referendums since 1972, it shows that governments
   tend to lose referendums if they have been in office for a long time,
   that emotive words on the ballot paper are correlated with a high yes
   vote and that a high turnout is correlated with a vote against European
   integration, but campaign spending is inconsequential. Based solely on
   statistical evidence from the previous forty-three referendums, the
   opponents of EU membership will win the Brexit referendum.},

Abstract = {This chapter intends to analyze the doctrine of classical liberalism,
   assuming that, when well managed, these ideals can still represent us,
   not only as belonging to a tradition of struggle for human dignity, but
   also as the political version of what the theory of knowledge has
   established about man and his abilities. In this sense, each of the
   factors perceived as pathologies caused by the liberal thought
   (political apathy, commercial instrumentalism, reduced conception of the
   individual) is elaborated to find their meaning and theoretical
   implications. Therefore, it is found that individual freedom and, as a
   condition of this, equality, stem from a basic rationality, associated
   with the divine duty and secular self-preservation impulse. These two
   values are essential aspects of the political subject, not of man as
   man, but as contracting party, because Locke, being consistent with a
   rejection of dogmatic assertions that exceed reason, does not rely on a
   broad positive concept of human being in his political Treaty. The
   Lockean idea of self-realization includes the rejection of others'
   arbitrariness and thus he bases his defense on state boundaries and
   personal independence.},

Volume = {38},

Pages = {299-314},
Abstract = {Digital disobedience can be defined as politically motivated online
   lawbreaking. It includes Distributed Denial of Service actions,
   hacktivism, digitally based leaking (for example, Anonymous, Wikileaks),
   and whistleblowing (along the lines pursued by Chelsea Manning and
   Edward Snowden). Given its growing political importance, the phenomenon
   requires careful theoretical attention. Against the widespread tendency
   to criminalize digital disobedience by appealing to conventional notions
   of the `rule of law', this article argues that some of its proponents
   are in fact engaging in digital lawbreaking as expressions of their
   fundamental respect for the rule of law. Although this diagnosis
   highlights the partial overlap with conventional models of civil
   disobedience (which oftentimes similarly conceive of politically
   motivated lawbreaking as necessarily resting on a more fundamental
   respect for the law), we should hesitate before viewing digital
   disobedience simply as modernized or digitalized civil disobedience.
   Digital disobedience includes some political novelties, and traditional
   views of civil disobedience only get us so far in making sense of those
   novelties.},

Abstract = {This essay is devoted to Gramsci's reflection in his Prison Notebooks on
   language discourse and on languages; its aim is to show how this
   reflection constituted one of Gramsci's main contributions to Marxism,
   which up to that time had not had an autonomous theory of language
   discourse. In this, particular importance is assumed by the notion of
   translatability, developed in an original direction in the Notebooks.
   The essay therefore deals with the two most immediate premises of
   Gramsci's reflections. The first of them is constituted by the debate on
   language and nationalities in the revolutionary Russia of the 1920s, in
   relation to the new federal set-up of the soviet State and to the start
   of anti-illiteracy campaigns. The second premise is constituted by the
   thought of Antonio Labriola who, while not having been able to provide
   any personal contribution to linguistic thought, had shown great
   interest in this subject, which he knew above all through the writings
   of Wilhelm von Humboldt and Heymann Steinthal.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF E-POLITICS},

Abstract = {This article explores Swedish Parliamentarians' Twitter practices during
   the 2014 general elections. For individual candidates, the political
   party is important for positions within the party and on the ballot,
   especially in a party-centered democracy. A previous qualitative (n)
   ethnographic research project during the previous elections in 2010, in
   which one campaigning politician was studied indepth, found that her
   social media practices to a large extent were inward-facing, focusing on
   the own party network. But does this result resonate among all Swedish
   Parliamentarians? Specifically, the authors ask: is Twitter primarily
   used interactively, for intra-party communication, to interact with
   strategic voter groups or voters in general? By analyzing all
   Parliamentarians tweets two weeks up to the elections the authors
   conclude that retweeting was done within a party political network while
   @ messaging was directed towards political opponents. Mass media
   journalists and editorial writers were important in Parliamentarians'
   Twitter practices, while so-called ordinary voters were more absent.},

Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {242-260},
Abstract = {Conservatives are generally held to be biased towards the present state
   of affairs, but some conservatives see the present state of affairs as
   so great a threat, they advocate its overthrow. They are insurgent
   conservatives. Scholars portray a Republican Party in the 1950s and
   1960s dominated by a north-east liberal establishment confronting an
   emerging opposition based on anti-communism, economic liberalism and
   limited government. Barry Goldwater, deploying ideas developed as a
   long-standing opponent of the New Deal, from his experiences as a
   businessman, and his philosophic commitment to individualism, engaged
   extensively with conservatives from the mid-to late 1950s, becoming the
   spokesman for the developing conservative movement. Goldwater
   articulated an alternative, radical interpretation of conservatism.
   Using constitutive rhetoric, an under-used tool in the study of
   conservatism, this paper explores the content and message of Goldwater's
   insurgent conservatism. Rather than focussing on persuasion,
   constitutive rhetoric focuses on the relationship between the speaker
   and the audience in the forging of an identity. Goldwater's audience was
   already persuaded; what was needed was a common conservative identity to
   inspire a political movement. Goldwater did not `call conservatism into
   being,' but his rhetoric fuelled an insurgency and constituted
   conservatism in a new configuration.},

   the members of the Russian economic elite. The empirical part of the
   research is based on the biographies of those who exercise strategic
   control of the largest companies in Russia ( according to the ranking of
   the magazine ``Expert{''}) and/or those among the richest businessmen in
   the country (according to the ranking of the magazine ``Forbes{''}).
   Having considered in details the degree of entrenchment of the present
   economic elite in the political administrative nomenclature of the
   Soviet era as well as the post-Soviet work experience of the leading
   businessmen in the administrative structures and representative bodies,
   D.Tev reveals the peculiarities of political administrative activity of
   different categories of the economic elite.},

Abstract = {The article examines through the works of the Finnish artist Seppo
   Salminen how the nation takes a hold on the male body. It is
   demonstrated that art can offer a critical relationship to the
   constitutive elements of the nation. Art is read as a form of postmemory
   that deals with the nation and its trauma of war. The article forms a
   critique of the essentialist understandings of nationhood that seek to
   define and naturalize nations by means of the supposedly homogenous,
   holistic and historically continuous understandings of tradition,

Abstract = {The key objective of this article is to identify the main factors that
   explain the growing interest of Mexican local governments in external
   affairs. The main argument is that recent changes in the international
   system, domestic democratic developments, the transformation of the
   economic development model in the 1980s, and new perceptions and
   personal preferences of governmental authorities are factors that
   explain the growing interest of subnational actors to participate in
   global activities. The article is divided into four parts. The first one
   defines the concept of paradiplomacy and foreign policy. The second part
   analyzes the pillars that explain the new international dynamism of
   local Mexican governments. The next section describes the legal
   framework that regulates the international activity of local
   governments. Finally, the last part examines the case of Baja
   California, a border Mexican state that recently has been very active in
   foreign affairs.},

Title = {Too Limited, Too Late: Evaluating the Czech Republic's Performance as a
   Small-State Lobbyist in EU External Policy},
Journal = {NEW PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-78},
Abstract = {The article proposes a classification of interest promotion methods used
   by small EU member states which draws on lobbying literature in order
   for us to better understand how small states pursue their preferences in
   Council negotiations. It explores a single case study of the Czech
   Republic's efforts to influence the 2012 revision of the European
   Union's Generalised System of Preferences scheme through the lenses of
   this classification. The empirical part of the paper is based on
   original research interviews with European and Czech stakeholders who
   participated in the studied negotiations. While the dossier was
   considered important, the Czech Republic failed to employ more elaborate
   methods of interest promotion and thus came away with a sub-optimal
   outcome. Rather than explaining this by pointing to a lack of
   socialization of Czech representatives (and thus a lack of effective
   competence), this deficiency can be better explained by the low salience
   of the general policy area for the Czech Republic, which prevented the
   country from developing a favourable position from which to react
   promptly to the related developments and deploy the lobbying tools at
   its disposal. The article suggests that the lobbyist-like character of a
   small member state's performance in the Council may have wider
   consequences for the flexibility of the country's EU policy and the
   ability of its governments to pursue specific European policies.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to present some of the key events that
   occurred in the Colombian political, economic, and social spheres, as
   well as political processes that took place within and among the three
   branches of power during 2015. During the year, the executive, the
   legislative, and the judicial branches did efforts to create conditions
   directed to overcome the armed conflict through peace negotiations.
   Regional elections that took place in October were permeated by the idea
   of considering each regions' particular conditions to allow the
   construction of a territorial peace. In the sections that follow we
   summarize some facts that occurred in the country over the year. We also
   present a list and a short analysis of constitutional reforms and new
   laws that were sanctioned during the year. In the third section, we show
   subnational electoral results. Then, we describe the composition of the
   executive and the legislative branches, and we analyze inter-branches
   relations. Finally, we say something about the relations between
   different levels of government, and about the general functioning of the
   Colombian democracy.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},

Abstract = {The stipulation of marriage, that is commitment and obligation, meaning
   that each party to the contract are entitled to ask from the other
   party, a specific description, act or omission, or the result of another
   contract, or to get committed for the benefit of the other party. About
   the stipulation of marriage, it can be said that it is not true that
   people are entitled to sign a stipulation without any criterion, and
   then call it ``be enforceable{''}, rather the stipulation must be signed
   under the terms established by law and sacred religious of Islam. The
   stipulations of marriage must not be against the scripture and
   tradition. The majority of jurists of Imamiyeh religious, according to
   the Hadith ``Believers should fulfill their conditions, unless these
   conditions turn a lawful issue into an unlawful one or an unlawful issue
   into a lawful one ``believe that the principle is the fulfillment of any
   stipulation, unless it is a condition which turns a lawful issue into an
   unlawful one or an unlawful issue into a lawful one. The
   contra-scripture and tradition conditions are of those unlawful
   stipulations, as to not damage the marriage the main pillars; they do
   not cause the nullity of marriage. But if they damage the main pillars
   of marriage, not only the stipulation has been nullified, but the
   marriage itself is nullified as well. This paper scrutinizes the
   situation of contra-scripture and tradition, and the touchstone to
   distinguish such conditions, as well as to investigate the extent they
   influence marriage.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the hinge party both as a concept and a
   strategy. It seeks to `liberate'the hinge party from the clutches of
   such close conceptual relatives as the `pivot party', the `genuine pivot
   party', the `pivotal centre party', the `pivotal middle party'and the
   `pivotal median party'. This is a taxonomical jungle and while some use
   the terms ` hinge party'and `pivot party'interchangeably, this study
   urges a `velvet divorce'. The main theoretical question is in two parts:
   (1) What are the distinguishing features of the hinge party and how does
   it differ from the pivot party?; and (2) What set of legislative party
   system circumstances would seem most likely to favour a hinge party
   strategy of keeping options open to both left and right? Self-styled
   centrist parties would seem most likely to favour a hinge party strategy
   and the empirical question is: To what extent have the Nordic
   Centre-label {[}former agrarian] parties sought and been able to do so?},

Abstract = {Over the past decade there has been a growing interest in and concern
   about the actions of Canadian mining companies in Latin America. In this
   article we contribute to these debates by combining economic, social,
   and political analyses to examine the development of the Canadian
   government and the role of Canadian-headquartered companies in Bolivia's
   mining industry. First, we review the influence of the Canadian
   government's development assistance on Bolivian mining policy. Second,
   we analyze the characteristics of Canadian FDI and its effects on the
   Bolivian mining sector. We argue that the economic effects of Canadian
   mining companies in Bolivia have been less than significant. We consider
   it a failed attempt, since our data suggests that the Canadian
   government attempted to ``make Bolivia work{''} for mining companies.
   Finally, we illustrate the specific trajectories of Canadian mining
   companies with four brief case studies, two mines in operation, and two
   ``failed attempts.{''} In the first two case studies we examine the
   development and accumulation of capital. In the second two cases, we
   focus on the social conflicts, which arose around the exploration
   activities of two junior mining companies. We argue that junior
   companies are important to consider when surveying the Canadian
   government's role in the country.},

Abstract = {The United States marriage rights movement just culminated in July 2015
   with the Supreme Court declaring same-sex marriage constitutional. The
   mainstream - the mainstream media and the mainstream LGBT rights
   movement - all applaud this trajectory, with no attention to those who
   get left behind in marriage politics. In this paper, I will argue that
   same-sex marriage is in need of a materialist feminist analysis. I will
   critique my discipline - Sociology - for failing to adequately theorize
   same-sex marriage as a key component of the 21st Century landscape of
   the capitalist mode of production. I will also critique the mainstream
   LGBT rights movement and the media attention given same-sex marriage for
   their lack of attention to the classed relations embedded in marriage
   rights. A materialist feminist analysis will allow us to see that
   there's still a need for a larger, more emancipatory sexual politics.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {44},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Although numerous get-out-the-vote field experiments have identified the
   effects of particular mobilization tactics (e.g., canvassing, phone
   calls, direct mails) on voter turnout, we do not yet have a full
   understanding of the causal effect of overall mobilization. We study
   this by leveraging a natural experiment in Japan, in which the timing of
   a municipal election is as-if randomly assigned. The results show that
   almost concurrently held municipal elections boost these municipalities'
   voter turnout in prefectural elections by one to two percentage points.
   We argue that some unique settings in Japan allow us not only to
   mitigate omitted variable bias but also to attribute the estimated
   effect only to mobilization, rather than the effects of cost sharing and
   psychological stimulus. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Since the breakdown ofthe reconciliation process between the Turkish

   resumption of violence in the southeast has escalated to an alarming
   degree, threatening to exacerbate both regional instability as well as
   political polarization within Turkey Currently, the PKK feels emboldened
   by its affiliate PYD's perceived strategic importance to the US' owing
   in large part to its role in the fight against ISIL in Syria. This
   dynamic has negative spillover effects on the prospects for talks
   between the PKK and the Turkish state. In this article, the authors
   underline the need fir a ceasefire, resumption of peace talks, and on a
   separate track, `Or the longstanding rights related demands of Turkeys'

Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {399-430},

Abstract = {We are at an historical crossroads. The latest IPCC report gives dire
   predictions about potential losses from climate change, ranging from
   high sea levels to deterioration of agricultural production. Although
   emissions are still concentrated in the North, the most-rapid growth of
   emissions is occurring in the South, suggesting the need for major
   changes in the trajectory of its economic development. Massive aid flows
   for climate-change mitigation and adaptation lack any clear framework.
   We begin the task by examining the evolution of Central American
   electricity systems, seeking to explain the exceptional ability of
   several countries wracked by conflict, weak institutions, and struggling
   economies to move toward renewable fuels. We use first-person
   interviews, government documents and websites, and consultant and expert
   reports to examine the largely unrecognized achievements. The necessity
   of finding alternative energy is not in question, but how these
   countries overcame the financial, technical, and policy challenges
   should be of great interest and could potentially provide valuable
   lessons for other countries.},

Abstract = {Ayatollah Khoei expressed various views by other scholars besides
   expressing his views on general reliabilities. Concerning People of
   Consensus, he believes that transmission of hadith does not mean all the
   hadiths narrated by each of people of consensus by Imams, but the mursal
   hadith or the hadith narrated by the poor narrator is acceptable,
   expressing the majesty and position of hadith. Concerning An Al-Saghat,
   he believes that Ja'far ibn Bashir has narrated from the poor narrators
   such as Saleh bin al-Hakam and Abdullah bin Mohammed Jaefi, however how
   it can say that he has been being narrated from reliability. Ahmad ibn
   Muhammad ibn Abi Nasr as narrated by Shaykh Tusi is among three jurists
   who have been being narrated from reliability. Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei has
   mentioned name of 115 Sheikhs among which 53 members are reliable and
   others are unknown, nonsense or poor. He said that there is no
   accompaniment between accompany and reliability, as we do not know the
   prophet's accompanions just due to their accompaniment with him. Seeking
   for mercy and forgiveness are the assignments recommended in religion,
   mentioned that it can seek forgiveness for the unfaithful believers.
   Therefore, if the people like Sheikh Mofid or Sheikh Sadough seek
   forgiveness for a person, this does not mean their reliability.},

Abstract = {In a curious and hitherto largely overlooked episode, the revisionist
   ``neo-Ottomanist{''} ambitions of King Hussein of Jordan and Turgut Ozal
   of Turkey converged during the 1990s with the interests of an
   influential group of ``neoconservatives{''} centered in Washington to
   press for a radical redrawing of the Near Eastern political and
   territorial map. Due to a combination of material and normative
   limitations, neither Hussein's nor Ozal's ambitions materialized, but
   the common central elements of their visions - a rejection of the
   nation-state system imposed on the region after the Ottoman Empire's
   collapse; the evocation instead of past imperial greatness, updated to
   reflect contemporary democratic norms; and a style of rule characterized
   by a cosmopolitan and accommodating realpolitik-constitute an
   alternative to rival (authoritarian secular-nationalist, liberal,
   militant Islamist) prescriptions for the region's future at a time when
   the erosion of the post-Ottoman status quo continues to accelerate.},

Abstract = {Of late, the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency
   syndrome (HIV/AIDS) has become a cause of concern for both the state and
   the non-state actors. The activism led by civil society on HIV/AIDS and
   health movements espouses the health needs and rights of HIV positive
   people. While playing politically active role, at times civil society
   organizations (CSOs) support health movements, and their activities
   overlap. Although these groups are different in nature, structure and
   strategies, there are some commonalities among them. This article
   discusses the opportunities for coalition between CSOs and health
   movement, and also analyzes problems that lead to exclusion.
   The joint efforts of movements and CSOs have influenced the policy
   formulation and implementation towards ensuring rights of HIV positive
   people. There are several conducive factors towards building a strong
   network between CSOs and health movement. However, due to limitations
   associated with their activities, a strong coalition has not been
   possible resulting in a lack of a strong social movement.},

Abstract = {The 2015-2016 presidential election campaign had major effects on
   American debates regarding US policy toward Asia. Going into the
   campaign, the debates focused heavily on perceived US weaknesses in the
   face of growing challenges from China. As the campaign progressed, this
   broad concern with China remained active but secondary. It was
   overshadowed by strong debate on two sets of issues: international trade
   and the proposed Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) accord, and candidate
   Donald Trump's controversial proposals on allied burden sharing, nuclear
   weapons proliferation, and North Korea. Criticism of the TPP received
   broad bi-partisan support and posed increasingly serious obstacles to US
   government approval of the pact. Trump's controversial proposals were
   unpopular and seemed unlikely to be easily implemented even if he were
   elected; they were opposed by senior Republicans in Congress along with
   many others. Nevertheless, the proposals upset Japan, South Korea, and
   other Asian partners; they created major complications in US government
   efforts to reassure them in defining clear objectives toward regional
   partners and adversaries.},

Abstract = {As conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs spread in African countries,
   there is a need for well-designed programs that reflect their economic,
   institutional, political, and sociocultural circumstances. Using both
   qualitative and quantitative data analysis, this article examines the
   perspectives of beneficiaries, program managers, and community leaders
   regarding Ghana's CCT program. It addresses sociocultural attitudes
   toward poverty, perceptions of CCT as a poverty reduction strategy, and
   experiences with CCT implementation. Findings indicate favorable views
   of CCT but little support for giving money to the poor as a long-term
   poverty-alleviation strategy. Ghana's CCT program is seen as fair and
   popular, but current payment levels are viewed as inadequate,
   impractical, and unreliable.},

Abstract = {This article identifies a concept I call `boundness' in James Baldwin's
   work and asks how it offers an alternative and embodied way to theorize
   racial identity, racialized violence and interracial solidarity. In the
   1960s, in contrast to black nationalist and integrationist responses to
   racial domination, Baldwin repeatedly asserts that white and black
   people are literally bound (by blood) and therefore morally bound
   together. He posits a kinship narrative that foregrounds
   racialized/sexual violence, addressing the histories of Southern
   plantations and Jim Crow communities where lines of racial difference
   were drawn between siblings or between an enslaved child and his/her
   biological father. With particular attention to Baldwin's rhetorical
   techniques (use of racial signifiers, pronouns, familial language), this
   article examines boundness in four main texts White Man's Guilt, The
   Fire Next Time, a 1963 Public Broadcasting Service interview and a 1968
   speech in London and demonstrates how the concept functions as a
   political strategy to provoke shifts in identification.},

Abstract = {This article presents results of the research in contemporary trends of
   international economic inequality. The author argues that international
   economic inequality is a bidirectional and complex concept. The
   bidirectionality and complexity of the concept is reflected in the fact
   that there are countries that concurrently converge to or diverge from
   the most developed countries in terms of their economic development. The
   key finding presented here is the rise of economic inequality between
   countries, especially between the poorest and the richest countries. The
   exceptions are some countries that have made significant progress in the
   period from 2000 to 2014 in reducing the economic inequality in
   comparison to the richest countries. The most important factors that
   have contributed to their progress are distinctive economic institutions
   and development policies of those countries, as well as the effects of
   the financial crisis since 2007-2008, which caused a decade-long
   stagnation in the most developed parts of the world.},

Abstract = {This article explores the political foundations of ethnic security fears
   and examines the relationship between the structure of party competition
   at the constituency level and security fears at the individual level in
   Uttar Pradesh, India's largest state. The analysis shows that security
   fears are higher in constituencies characterised by multiparty
   competition. The central implication of this finding is that rather than
   leading to ethnic moderation, multiparty competition in ethnic party
   systems tends to be more ethnically divisive than in two party systems,
   increasing collective fears of the future.},

Abstract = {Estimation of ideological positions among voters, legislators, and other
   actors is central to many subfields of political science. Recent
   applications include large data sets of various types including roll
   calls, surveys, and textual and social media data. To overcome the
   resulting computational challenges, we propose fast estimation methods
   for ideal points with massive data. We derive the
   expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms to estimate the standard ideal
   point model with binary, ordinal, and continuous outcome variables. We
   then extend this methodology to dynamic and hierarchical ideal point
   models by developing variational EM algorithms for approximate
   inference. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and scalability
   of our methodology through a variety of real and simulated data. In
   cases where a standard Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm would require
   several days to compute ideal points, the proposed algorithm can produce
   essentially identical estimates within minutes. Open-source software is
   available for implementing the proposed methods.},

Abstract = {The goal of this paper is to stress the importance of changing the
   present growth strategy of Central and Eastern European (CEE) economies.
   The economic model of resource and debt intensive growth they have
   enjoyed in the past two decades have proved to be ineffective and
   unsustainable. Given that the CEE growth model cannot be identified
   separately from the EU as a whole, we try to propose possible policy
   measures that would stimulate growth in the CEE in context of the
   policies at the EU level.},

Abstract = {Voice-overs are used extensively to increase the effectiveness of the TV
   ads especially in the last decade. The main purpose is to provide the
   brand message via a clear feature that will inevitably grab the
   attention of the viewers. The current study contains the neuro tests of
   12 TV ads in banking and finance sectors on 168 participants in 8
   groups. Optic brain imaging (fNIRS) and in-depth interviews were the
   methodologies utilized during the test of these TV ads. The obtained
   results indicate that the use of voice-over during the TV ads possibly
   causes the decrease in attention and emotional engagement levels of the
   participants.},

Abstract = {On 11 June 2013, the Commission issued the Recommendation on common
   principles for injunctive and compensatory collective redress mechanisms
   in the Member States concerning the violations of rights granted under
   Union law. The main areas where private enforcement of rights granted
   under Union law in the form of collective redress is of value are
   consumer protection, competition, environment protection, protection of
   personal data, financial services legislation and protection of
   investments. Point 13 of the Recommendation concurrently emphasises that
   the principles it puts forward relate both to judicial and out-of-court
   collective redress. The Member States should ensure that judicial
   collective redress mechanisms are accompanied by appropriate means of
   collective alternative dispute resolution available to the parties
   before and throughout the litigation. Point 25 et seq. of the
   Recommendation then contains special regulations concerning collective
   alternative dispute resolution and settlements. The purpose of this
   article is to evaluate if the current legislation on alternative dispute
   resolution in the Czech Republic meets the principles encompassed in the
   Recommendation or if radical legal changes need to be adopted.},

Abstract = {This paper develops a systematic critique of the individualistic shift
   in the contemporary political theory of equality. Uncritically indebted
   to a model of homo oeconomicus centred on the ``merit{''} and
   ``responsibility{''} of each citizen, this individualised model is
   inadequate in accounting for contemporary inequalities based on class,
   gender and ethnicity. The paper argues in favour of re-setting
   egalitarian theory from a structural and political rather than ethical
   perspective, with the aim of building new social and political
   relationships of self and mutual respect and non-domination. This is
   especially compelling in the current context of ecological crisis,
   increasing class inequality, strong gender disadvantage, and systematic
   expansion of income inequality, fuelled by privatization, speculation,
   profiting without producing, and structural power asymmetries. This
   structural reorientation of the political theory of egalitarianism
   implies not only changes in the realm of the theoretical focus on
   justice and equality, but also suggest major changes in the current
   agenda of public re-distribution and pre-distribution policies.},

Abstract = {While the state continues to play a prominent role in the literature on
   developing countries, its absence in the work on advanced,
   industrialized societies is equally conspicuous. This article examines
   what happens to developmental states as they mature by analyzing the
   evolution of two, similar, statist societies, France and Finland. In
   contrast to recent literature on state-led or state-enhanced capitalism,
   we identify two responses to contemporary challenges. The French
   ``marketizing state{''} used a combination of coercion and compensation
   to increase market competition, whereas the Finnish ``investment
   state{''} targeted productivity-enhancing collective goods. We attribute
   these divergent responses to the structure of the postwar developmental
   state.},

Abstract = {In the present work we seek to rescue the debate on overexploitation,
   both in its theoretical origins and subsequent discussions in the Latin
   American social thought. This, under the assumption that such
   intellectual productions still represent useful heuristic tools that
   allow to apprehend the recent mutations of neoliberal capitalism and the
   problems that the world of work is currently facing in the region.
   Through a review of the theoretical elaboration on the concept of
   overexploitation developed by the Brazilian Ruy Mauro Marini, as well as
   the main discussions and further developments around it, we point out
   the central aspects of the concept, its main problematical knots, and
   some interpretation keys for the study of work in Latin America today.},

Abstract = {Undoubtedly, no country as America is the host and influenced of
   pressure groups, and because of the existence of the interests and
   valuation system in America, this issue has made decision making in
   foreign policy of this country difficult. Among pressure groups in
   America, Zionist lobbies seem to have the most influence in America's
   foreign policy. Based on this, it can be approximately said that America
   and Israel have had special ties after the World War II and AIPAC Group
   has always guaranteed the continuation of this relationship. A set of
   factors play role in forming foreign policy of each country internally,
   nationally and internationally that the outcome of these factors' action
   and reactions will is presented as the outcome and ``foreign policy{''}.
   The United Sates of America's foreign policy is also the same process,
   based on this according to the international relationships ideas which
   of the important levels in analyzing foreign policy of the United States
   of America is internal level whose one of its components is
   investigating the role of pressure groups in forming the foreign policy
   of this country, practically the activity of any groups isn't as
   prominent and highlighted as Zionist lobby in this subject.
   Therefore the author of this research is sought to investigate the
   effect of different shapes of Zionist lobby and the position and
   performance of this regime in America's foreign policy towards Iran,
   hence the arrow of lobbying activities in the area of Iran is also
   evaluated; consequently in the process of the research, stating that
   influential element in the system of decision making in The United
   States of America about the role of stakeholder groups with a focus on
   Zionist lobby and the unwavering support of the United States from this
   lobby is undeniable.},

   thick, qualitative study of a twenty-first century presidential ground
   campaign. Our goals in the study were to describe phenomena that are not
   commonly examined in most studies of field campaigns, namely (a) the
   purportedly transformative impact of the campaign on both individuals
   and collective contexts, (b) the holistic interaction of different
   strategic elements of the campaign, and (c) the processes the campaign
   used to develop citizen leadership to scale the campaign. We also
   consider the limitations of our approach, the reception of a book
   intended for both academic and practitioner audiences, and
   underexploited research agendas in the study of campaigns.},

Abstract = {Arbitration is one of the most important solutions to end enmity and
   replace judicial inquest. As international trading is extended,
   referring to judgment to solve the conflicts caused by commercial
   contracts has been rapidly rising which is a result of judgment benefits
   over justice authorities. Fastness and efficiency, law inquest cost,
   compromise nature of selecting the referees, and professional selection
   are among the most evident specifications of arbitration. Furthermore,
   Iran's involvement in the most significant judgment case of the last
   century i.e. the lawsuits filed between the Islamic Republic of Iran the
   United States of America after the victory of the revolution would
   double the essentiality of knowing this organization. Judgment may be
   either individual or organic (permanent) and also the number of referees
   needs to be one or three. The most important issue in the judge's
   inquest is to follow two factors including independence and impartiality
   from the beginning until the end of the inquest process. Violating these
   characteristics or the lack of one of both or other descriptions
   predicted in the arbitration contract would result in its violation by
   one side of the conflict or both of them. In the present paper, a
   comparison is conducted between the commonalty and distinction of Iran's
   international commercial arbitration in 1376 and international law.},

Abstract = {90 percent of the 2.7 million Syrian refugees in Turkey are living in
   urban areas throughout the country, and are grappling with the
   challenges of building meaningful lives for themselves, even as their
   future remains uncertain. While the refugee crisis has overwhelmed
   policymaking at the national level, through grassroots initiatives,
   people who have been displaced by the war in Syria have begun to find
   the support and resources that they need. In this article, the author
   draws upon her personal experience working for one such initiative - a
   community and education center called Small Project Istanbul (SPI) in
   Fatih - to comment on the reception of Syrian refugees in Istanbul, the
   particular challenges women and children face, and the necessity for
   Turkish society to get more involved in civil society activities.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},

Volume = {49},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1341-1371},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article argues that variation in public good provision is
   determined by the salience of demographic and economic regionalism,
   conceptualized as the presence of multiple large population centers and
   distinct economic units within a single country's borders. Two
   mechanismsdivergent public good preferences and regional
   self-sufficiencyunderpin this relationship. Evidence of these mechanisms
   as central to low public good provision is found in case studies of
   Ecuador and Colombia, two countries that score high on standard measures
   of ethnic diversity and that saw little public good provision during the
   first century after independence. A region-wide examination of
   post-independence South America and an investigation of change over time
   in Venezuela provide further support for the claim that regionalism
   affects public good provision. A plausible case for this aspect of
   geography as a cause of low public good provision poses a challenge to
   the scholarship attributing it to ethnic diversity.},

Abstract = {In this analysis of how electoral rules and outcomes shape the internal
   organization of political parties, we make an analogy to primary
   elections to argue that parties use preference-vote tallies to identify
   popular politicians and promote them to positions of power. We document
   this behavior among parties in Sweden's semi-open-list system and in
   Brazil's open-list system. To identify a causal impact of preference
   votes, we exploit a regression discontinuity design around the threshold
   of winning the most preference votes on a party list. In our main case,
   Sweden, these narrow ``primary winners{''} are at least 50\% more likely
   to become local party leaders than their runners-up. Across individual
   politicians, the primary effect is present only for politicians who hold
   the first few positions on the list and when the preference-vote winner
   and runner-up have similar competence levels. Across party groups, the
   primary effect is the strongest in unthreatened governing parties.},

Abstract = {Government formation in multi-party democracies is notoriously ridden
   with information uncertainty. Uncertainty is aggravated when new parties
   enter parliament, which generally suggests a `newcomer handicap' in
   government formation. However, relegating newcomers to the opposition
   comes with uncertainty in its own right, which suggests immediate
   cabinet participation as new leaders seize the opportunity and
   established parties pursue containment. We explore elite responses to
   this strategic problem in the postcommunist democracies of Central and
   Eastern Europe (CEE) where new parties often gain parliamentary
   representation. Even in CEE, a newcomer handicap in government formation
   is apparent, controlling for other detrimental party attributes.
   However, this applies to small newcomers only. For larger parties the
   handicap turns into a bonus, an effect only qualified once the newcomer
   outnumbers its competitors. Either way, newness-induced uncertainty thus
   intensifies the strategic rationale of government formation. As party
   systems become more volatile, these findings are relevant beyond CEE.},

Abstract = {Many studies highlight the critical roles of political parties in
   enhancing autocratic durability, mainly emphasizing mechanisms related
   to elite cohesion. The role of a mass party organization in stabilizing
   autocracies, though well recognized, has received relatively less
   emphasis. This article argues that the import of mass organization on
   autocratic durability is likely to vary with autocratic regime type and
   be greatest in competitive authoritarian regimes. I then exploit unusual
   survey data and an original data set containing information on 18,037
   regime-affiliated Communal Councils to examine the effects of a
   regime-affiliated mass organization on the incumbent vote in Venezuela.
   The formation of Communal Councils exerted a large effect on incumbent
   support but the strength of this effect varied depending on whether
   Councils were located in communities receiving high levels of material
   resources. These findings suggest that mass organization can greatly
   enhance competitive authoritarian durability but must be backed by
   patronage to be effective.},

Abstract = {Inspired by autonomy of migration and acts of citizenship literatures as
   frameworks for understanding migration, the paper analyzes the case of
   Haitian migrants in Brazil. It focuses, on the one hand, on the
   relational processes of constructing Haitian migrants as humanitarian
   immigrants' and, on the other, on the (im)perceptible tactics of
   survival and mobility enacted by them upon arrival. We argue that the
   humanitarian immigrant' label negotiates stasis by instantiating an
   ambivalent and depoliticized subjectivity, modulated in-between the
   refugee and the immigrant worker. Migrants challenge this framing and
   the precarity of controls created by it through imperceptible tactical
   interventions that allow them to provisionally escape the inhospitable
   conditions of reception at Brazilian borders. In their attempts to
   resist and redefine the terms of their presence, Haitian migrants have
   actualized a web of solidarity networks that have fostered alternative
   understandings of migration management and its relation with citizenship
   as a site of political struggles.},

   Charter},

Abstract = {In today's societies, in which the variety of social communications are
   increasingly expanded, citizenship rights in relation to all citizens
   equally and without discrimination depends on a comprehensive charter.
   This charter should specifically predict citizenship rights. The
   citizenship Bill of Rights will only be successful in achieving its
   goals in case it is principally based on the human dignity. The Iranian
   legal system in 1392 experienced the development of the ``Citizens
   Rights Charter{''}. This charter, with its fundamental drawbacks, will
   not have a desirable impact on the Iranian legal system.
   Apparently, human dignity enjoys a proper position in the introduction
   and the general rules of the Iranian Citizens Rights Charter. However,
   the charter's understanding of the concept of citizen and government has
   compromised this condition. On the one hand, considering the citizen as
   anonymous with the national, and granting citizenship right to the state
   on the other hand have compromised the the position of human dignity in
   the charter.
   With respect to the instances of civil rights, human dignity does not
   enjoy an appropriate position too. The lack of distinction between
   instances of human rights and mere citizenship rights,
   non-implementation of instances in a comprehensive framework and the
   over-emphasis on counting the instances by the law, has undermined human
   dignity in the citizen rights context.},

Abstract = {This article sets out to place political support for Henrietta
   Marshall's Our Island Story in the context of debates about Englishness,
   the European Union and the Anglosphere. It argues that support for this
   book was not just a debate about the teaching of history, but was part
   of a wider contest over the memory of Empire and England's
   constitutional past. This traditional narrative was deployed to help
   imagine and suggest a global future for Britain at a moment when a
   politics of disengagement with the European Union played out
   domestically. This contest was not formed in isolation, but was part of
   a re-engagement with traditional allies' within the Anglosphere' helping
   to answer a dilemma about Britain's future framed in terms of an English
   Conservative reading of the past. Arguments in favour of Our Island
   Story served to emphasise a significant tradition in Anglo-British
   thought that situated England as the dominant partner in a historic
   political-economic and cultural enterprise with a global legacy
   ill-suited to the political project of European integration. Thus, Our
   Island Story was not merely an innocuous children's tale, but was part
   of a politics of disengagement from the European Union that blurred the
   boundaries of political Englishness.},

Abstract = {Increased responsiveness and transparency are among the most important
   promises of digital democracy. A number of Parliamentary Monitoring
   Organizations (PMO) have emerged in the last decade, showing innovative
   ways of political communication between citizens and politicians and
   nourishing the hope put into revitalizing representative democracy. PMOs
   provide the infrastructure for parliamentary transparency and
   responsiveness by aggregating data about individual parliamentarian's
   performance and offer the possibility to (re-) establish the link
   between citizens and their representants. Using the example of the
   annual MP ranking drawn up by the German PMO Abgeordnetenwatch.de, this
   article deals with the responsiveness of MPs of the German Bundestag to
   citizen's online requests. The study shows that parliamentary and
   governmental position roles, as well as MP's presence or absence from
   the parliament are factors explaining their responsiveness. But the
   ranking itself also seems to have a direct impact on MP's responsiveness
   as particularly the lower performing MPs are keen to improve their
   position in the next year. The article closes with a discussion of the
   benefits and drawbacks of such rankings for working parliaments such as
   the German Bundestag.},

Abstract = {Many have problem reconciling China's corruption-infested system with
   meritocracy. The survey study reported here indicates that Chinese
   cadres are eager to impress their superior, but what impresses the
   superior is increasingly along the line of competence and achievement.
   Even corrupt officials have to deliver and be competent, the bottom line
   that sets limits to patronage. The system may not always favour the most
   competent but it is geared towards performance.},

Abstract = {The divorce means dissolution of marriage permanent that has been done
   after performing divorce and since then is interrupted conjugal
   relationship between husband and wife, however, according to the type of

   to marriage in Khula and Mubarat divorce. In some cases challenges
   returning to philosophy of divorce and a kind of defeating the purpose
   will be done that the opportunity does not give the men. And thus the
   nature of divorce is irrevocable and complete separation between men and
   women is created. Given the importance of returning issue, this research
   examines the effects of works and judgments of return on Khula and
   Mubarat divorce. After reviewing, finally, it was concluded that there
   is not difference between return and its effect in Khula and Mubarat
   divorce and the only difference is in the nature of these two divorces.
   So it is necessary that this issue comprehensively reflected in the law

Abstract = {This special issue revisits traditional group-based approaches to
   political representation by examining how multiple advantages and
   disadvantages interact and multiply in specific settings. The
   contributions examine how intersections of age, religion, gender,
   sexuality, ability, nationality, generation and ethnicity influence
   entrance to elected office and the power elected officials eventually
   wield. We propose a new intersectional framework for studying the
   mechanisms that lead to inclusion (advantage) and exclusion
   (disadvantage) in political representation, and find that (1) similar
   mechanisms produce different outcomes for different (sub)groups in
   society, and (2) the effect of identity mixes is contextual and differs
   across dimensions of representation.},

Abstract = {This paper evaluates long-term political consequences of severe economic
   shocks by combining a nationally-representative survey of Russians'
   political behaviors with long-term subnational economic data tracing
   Russia's post-Soviet economic transition. We show that the shock of
   transition has durably activated a limited but important sub-population
   of Russians while deactivating others. Surprisingly, much of the
   variation in contemporary political participation across Russia's
   population can be explained by local economic conditions experienced by
   Russians in the early 1990s: Durable patterns of participation seem to
   have been ``locked in{''} by economic trauma early in the transition
   period and are not influenced by the subsequent post-Soviet economic

Abstract = {This article analyzes how the political participation of men and women
   varies across the life course in Italy. Various studies on the topic
   have looked at the effects of the life cycle on political participation
   by using age as a proxy. Participation, however, may not be simply
   dependent on age. Instead, it may be related to the roles individuals
   assume during the life course. For this reason, the article looks at how
   participation changes during specific life transitions, such as leaving
   the parental home, forming a union and becoming a parent. Furthermore,
   the article puts special emphasis on how `private inequalities' in the
   household may become `political inequalities'. In fact, family roles and
   responsibilities can be constraints to participation, especially for
   women. The article finds that while leaving the parental home is
   positively associated with participation for both men and women, forming
   a union and being a parent is detrimental to the participation of women,
   but not to that of men.},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom pervades presidential politics, and there is no
   doubt that this will again be true in 2016. First among ``old
   politicians' tales{''} is that a political party's placement of a
   national convention in a specific state can affect presidential voting
   there, swinging or flipping it to its presidential candidate. Second,
   the selection of a vice-presidential candidate as a favorite son (or
   daughter) will deliver a state's electoral votes to a presidential
   ticket. Is either of these pearls of wisdom true? This article tests the
   truth of both the convention location and favorite-son claims and finds
   little evidence of their efficacy.},

   identify the causes of this privatization. MvQCA allows us to identify
   conjunctions of causes. Unlike suggested by the literature, neither
   problem pressure in hospital order treatment itself, nor partisan
   politics had an effect. Instead, we identified the institutional setting
   (the Land is the operator of hospital order treatment) as a necessary
   condition of the privatization of HOT. Furthermore, HOT was largely
   privatized in those Lander where the budget consolidation policy was
   above average.},

Abstract = {Opposition and electoral competition are intrinsic features of electoral
   authoritarian regimes, but also constitute threats or potential threats
   which must be contained. A major focus of the literature has been to
   delineate the ways in which authoritarian polities control and
   manipulate competition, so that it serves the regime rather than
   challenging it. Far less attention has been paid to the ways in which
   authoritarian regimes benefit from encouraging greater competition and
   opposition. Several reforms were introduced in Russia, following the
   2011 Duma election, which open the party system to more electoral
   opposition and competition. This article analyzes the impact of these
   reforms on the party system in Russia, with a particular concern for the
   ways in which increased competition can strengthen electoral
   authoritarianism.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Pages = {657-677},

Abstract = {Recent research reveals that nearly one-third of ethnic civil wars since
   1945 have been ``sons of the soil{''} (SoS) conflicts that pit
   indigenous populations against internal migrants. Despite important
   differences across SoS conflicts, many share a common trait as they
   often escalate during elections. While scholars have examined the causal
   mechanisms behind electoral violence, the relationship between elections
   and SoS conflicts has been overlooked. By examining a wide range of
   cases, the article breaks with previous research that privileges
   in-depth case studies of SoS conflicts with high levels of violence.
   Using insights from recent fieldwork in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, and
   Indonesia, the article sheds light on the causal dynamics that link
   elections and diverging levels of SoS conflict. In so doing, it
   illustrates how the severing of patronage networks and the shifting
   balance of power towards migrants create fertile contexts for political
   elites to instrumentalize local grievances. Elections are thus more
   likely to produce violent SoS conflicts when elites (at both the
   national and local levels) are able to mobilize supporters by playing
   upon these grievances, often through the politicization of citizenship
   and/or the ethnicization of the local sphere.},

Abstract = {We perform an empirical analysis to investigate how neighborhood
   heterogeneity affects electoral turnout. To this end, we rely on a
   unique dataset on local elections in an Italian municipality, which
   merges information on socio-economic characteristics of about 370.000
   individuals with turnout data for 434 electoral precincts in 2004 and
   2009. Exploiting both across and within precincts variation, we are able
   to disentangle the contextual effects on precinct-level electoral
   turnout of two different dimensions of neighborhood heterogeneity:
   income inequality and ethnic composition. Our results support the idea
   that contextual heterogeneity negatively affects political
   participation. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Our study investigates how and why racial prejudice can fuel white
   opposition to gun restrictions. Drawing on research across disciplines,
   we suggest that the language of individual freedom used by the gun
   rights movement utilizes the same racially meaningful tropes as the
   rhetoric of the white resistance to black civil rights that developed
   after WWII and into the 1970s. This indicates that the gun rights
   narrative is color-coded and evocative of racial resentment. To
   determine whether racial prejudice depresses white support for gun
   control, we designed a priming experiment which exposed respondents to
   pictures of blacks and whites drawn from the IAT. Results show that
   exposure to the prime suppressed support for gun control compared to the
   control, conditional upon a respondent's level of racial resentment.
   Analyses of ANES data (2004-2013) reaffirm these findings. Racial
   resentment is a statistically significant and substantively important
   predictor of white opposition to gun control.},

Abstract = {This article explores the precarious conditions deported Guatemalans
   encounter in their country of birth, alongside a consideration of how
   Guatemalan deportees' agency is structured by precarity yet mediated by
   individual factors such as foreign-earned capital and negative
   credentials. Previous research has found that deportees are often
   criminalized, stigmatized, and blamed for social problems. Researchers
   have also found that deportees can be well-suited for work in the
   transnational call center sector when they have adequate English skills.
   This raises the question of how deportees' individual characteristics
   and the local context of reception influence their (re)incorporation.
   This study, based on interviews with 34 Guatemalan deportees, reveals
   that deportees have varied trajectories, yet that the availability of
   call center jobs combined with deportees' capacity and agency creates a
   bifurcation in labor market outcomes between deportees who secure jobs
   in call centers and those who do not.},

Abstract = {In the wake of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision, many American
   private-sector employers now have the legal right to recruit their
   workers into politics and to fire or discipline employees who refuse to
   participate. How many firms and workers are engaged in this kind of
   political recruitment and why? And how have the opportunities for the
   political recruitment of workers by their employers changed over time?
   Drawing on national surveys of top corporate managers and workers, as
   well as a review of the legal literature, I provide initial answers to
   these questions and illustrate the implications of employer political
   recruitment for a range of substantive and normative issues in American
   politics. My findings invite further research and discussion about this
   feature of the American workplace and its effects on politics and
   policy.},

   parties and the Election Commission of India to highlight the dynamics
   of political praxis and institutional restraint, and while doing so
   endorses the view that institutional regulation is a vital part of a
   free and fair democratic exercise. It also argues that the institutional
   `logic of appropriateness' is being transformed at a time of greater
   participation in political competition in India: the number of
   candidates contesting the polls has grown phenomenally, as has the
   number of people coming out to vote. In this context, regulation and
   restraint have assumed an importance essential for responsible political
   practice and the institutionalization of the multiparty system itself.},

Title = {Co-authorship Networks in Swiss Political Research},
Journal = {SWISS POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {264-287},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Co-authorship is an important indicator of scientific collaboration.
   Co-authorship networks are composed of sub-communities, and researchers
   can gain visibility by connecting these insulated subgroups. This
   article presents a comprehensive co-authorship network analysis of Swiss
   political science. Three levels are addressed: disciplinary cohesion and
   structure at large, communities, and the integrative capacity of
   individual researchers. The results suggest that collaboration exists
   across geographical and language borders even though different regions
   focus on complementary publication strategies. The subfield of public
   policy and administration has the highest integrative capacity.
   Co-authorship is a function of several factors, most importantly being

Abstract = {Many intellectuals, various social movements, as well as all manner of
   individuals from around the globe who are critical of the ills of
   global, expansionist capitalism have written, spoken out about, and
   called for everything from minor changes to radical changes to the
   existing social, political and economic order. Moreover, many of these
   groups and individuals have used the tools of Marx's critique of
   capitalism in order to advance their positions and calls for change.
   While most critics of the existing social, political and economic order
   advance their critical examination of capitalist-spawned injustices with
   the hope of providing a foundation for us to explore ways to resist,
   disrupt and replace them, with few exceptions, usually this exploration
   is confined to (or at least focused on) human communities. However, in
   this essay, using some key concepts in Marx's oeuvre, I examine how the
   global expansion of capitalism, together with its requisite increase in
   structures of power and domination, are responsible for the
   intensification of similar injustices for non-human animals, which,
   according to Marx's own theoretical commitments, I argue, should also be
   resisted and, indeed, eradicated. On the flip side, in addition to
   arguing that a proper understanding of some of Marx's most fundamental
   commitments requires us to fight not only for human but for non-human
   animal liberation, I also argue that genuine animal liberation requires
   the radical disruption of capitalism and that the more common, less
   radical animal liberation movements are insufficient for bringing about
   this end.},

Title = {Term Limits and Collaboration Across the Aisle: An Analysis of
   Bipartisan Cosponsorship in Term Limited and Non-Term Limited State
   Legislatures},
Journal = {STATE POLITICS \& POLICY QUARTERLY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {198-226},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {As members of democratic institutions, state legislators must frequently
   collaborate with each other to achieve their varied goals. Given the
   increased attention to questions of polarization and gridlock, scholars
   should be particularly interested in understanding legislator decisions
   to collaborate across party lines. This article is primarily concerned
   with how institutional arrangements-specifically term limits-structure
   legislators' decisions to cosponsor bills with partisan opponents. Using
   data on bill cosponsorship from 41 states (82 chambers), we demonstrate
   that term limits reduce bipartisan cosponsorship even when controlling
   for average legislative tenure. We argue that term limits accomplish
   this by altering the incentives that legislators face. In addition, we
   demonstrate that the effect of term limits depends on the level of
   legislative professionalization. When professionalization is high, the
   negative effect of term limits on bipartisan cosponsorship is
   particularly pronounced.},

Abstract = {Issue ownership, which has a competence and an associative dimension,
   refers to the link between issues and parties in voters' minds. Although
   used frequently in voting research, there remain worries about the
   validity of its current measures. The measures may be confounded with
   respondents' (dis)agreement with parties' position and general party
   evaluations. Through a question wording experiment we compare measures
   of both issue ownership types and test which are most affected by the
   two confounding factors. We find that competence issue ownership
   measures are heavily affected by confounding factors while associative
   issue ownership wordings are less. Challenging existing research, we
   find that especially the classic `best at handling'-wording tapping
   competence issue ownership is most conflated with positions and party
   preference. (c) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {This paper is concerned with the transnational political activities of
   Congolese nationals in Pretoria. The relationship between the migrants
   is marked by ethno-regional and political rivalry between two groups
   living in Pretoria, namely the `combattants' and `anti-combattants'. The
   paper argues that there is a dialectical interaction between Congolese
   transmigrant political activities, both in the Democratic Republic of
   Congo and in South Africa.
   These transnational political activities have an impact on both the
   Congolese and the South African political scenes. Most importantly, the
   intra-Congolese rivalry is not only intermittent, but some of its
   dynamics are influenced by local politics back in the Democratic
   Republic of Congo. Following ethnographic research conducted among
   Congolese migrants between 2011 and 2013, this study revealed that
   grassroots political activists performed a key role in the Congolese
   transnational ethno-regional and political rivalry in Pretoria.},

Abstract = {Since the Soviet disintegration, Russians have engaged in discussions of
   what constitutes their system of distinct values. Today the language of
   a ``distinct civilization{''} is widely employed by top officials. This
   paper seeks to understand this discourse of distinctiveness as shaped by
   both history and politics. It studies the ideological shift by employing
   analysis of speeches by major officials and meaningful historical
   parallels. Like earlier historically significant concepts of value
   distinctiveness, Vladimir Putin's civilizational discourse has resulted
   from a combination of external pressures and domestic vulnerability
   stimulating the rise of a distinct political coalition.},

Abstract = {How can Islam play multiple and contradictory roles as a source of
   violence and peace, and a marker of identity differences and national
   unity? This study argues that religion, as a system of beliefs,
   manifests itself through discourses, which not only render
   intelligibility to religious practices and beliefs but also serve as the
   instruments of social control and regulation. An infinite variety of
   organizational and ideological differences within Islam presents the
   possibility for instrumentalisation of religion by stakeholders
   interested in accomplishing distinctive political aims connected to
   political legitimation. The study offers an empirical analysis of
   instrumentalisation of Islam by governments of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan
   and uses this evidence for developing a framework linking various
   discursive representations of religion to their political uses.},

Abstract = {Protest can be seen as a highly democratic expression of popular
   opinion. However, protest is also a non-representative,
   extra-institutional process for political change. In hybrid regimes,
   such as Ukraine, the legitimacy of effecting change through mass protest
   is a subject of debate. Because of the influence of mass protests in
   Ukrainian politics, individual views on the democratic legitimacy of
   protest are potentially important in perceptions of government
   legitimacy. Using original survey data from December 2013, this article
   finds that, whereas satisfaction with the functioning of democracy,
   partisanship, and the oft-cited regional divide are important
   determinants of approval for the Euromaidan protests, they do not
   influence how Ukrainians perceive the role of protest in a democracy.
   However, among those less committed to democracy, protest is more likely
   to be seen as illegitimate.},

Abstract = {This article describes and analyzes the evolution of African American
   political participation in the states of the former Confederacy since

   Expanded voting and electoral success for African Americans in the south
   have dramatically transformed the politics of the region and
   portenddeeper and longer-lasting change in the future, unless the
   Republican Party can begin to appeal to more minority voters. Current
   trends point toward possibly a major shifting in the politics of the
   region given demographic patterns and the difficulties of the Republican
   Party grappling with issues that drive African American voting.},

   This theory suggests that elites control, manage and organize the party

Abstract = {In this paper we analyze the collective bargaining agreements signed by
   the Metal Workers Union, the union representing the workers of this
   economic field in Argentina, between 1948 and 1994. We focus on the
   changes of the main clauses, such as the categories, patterns of
   productivity or licenses. We believe that this analysis allows us to
   evaluate the evolution of rights acquired or lost by the workers and the
   demands imposed by the Employers at every stage.},

Title = {Education and Voting Conservative: Evidence from a Major Schooling
   Reform in Great Britain},

Volume = {78},

Abstract = {High school education is central to adolescent socialization and has
   important downstream consequences for adult life. However, scholars
   examining schooling's political effects have struggled to reconcile
   education's correlation with both more liberal social attitudes and
   greater income. To disentangle this relationship, I exploit a major
   school leaving age reform in Great Britain that caused almost half the
   population to remain at high school for at least an additional year.
   Using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, I find that each
   additional year of late high school increases the probability of voting
   Conservative in later life by 12 percentage points. A similar
   relationship holds when pooling all cohorts, suggesting that high school
   education is a key determinant of voting behavior and that the reform
   could have significantly altered electoral outcomes. I provide evidence
   suggesting that, by increasing an individual's income, education
   increases support for right-wing economic policies and, ultimately, the
   Conservative Party.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the failure of Northern Ireland's first
   power-sharing executive, and subsequent attempts to restore
   power-sharing during the 1970s, was the result of conflicting attitudes
   towards devolution among Northern Ireland's politicians. Traditional
   ideological divisions between nationalists and unionists were not the
   primary bather to creating and sustaining cross-community institutions,
   as stressed in accounts of this period premised on consociational
   theory. Drawing extensively from archival sources, it argues that the
   split between the pragmatists from both communities, who were prepared
   to compromise their core principles and accept power-sharing devolution
   within a UK framework, and the dogmatists (both nationalists and
   unionists) who refused to contemplate any compromise to their core
   position, prevented a consensual political settlement emerging during
   the 1970s.},

Abstract = {Agendas shape the strategies states adopt in international bargaining
   and, therefore, the substantive nature of the resulting outcomes. They
   are also a dynamic feature of the process, as states add and subtract
   issues in order to shift the bargaining outcome in their favor. This
   article analyzes when and why states will use these different
   `issue-linkage' strategies. Focusing on the effects of a successful
   agreement and the costs of failure, it highlights conditions under which
   states are likely to add or subtract issues from the bargaining agenda.
   It tests these arguments using an original dataset of the bargaining
   strategies states have adopted in climate-change negotiations. It
   concludes by highlighting the implications the argument has for
   understanding the outcomes of international negotiations.},

Abstract = {One way to characterise the difference between analytic and Continental
   political philosophy concerns the different roles played by normative
   and descriptive analysis in each case. This article argues that, even
   though Michel Foucault's genealogy of liberal and neoliberal
   governmentality and John Rawls's political liberalism involve different
   articulations of normative and descriptive concerns, they are
   complementary rather than antithetical to one another. The argument is
   developed in three stages: first, by suggesting that Foucault offers a
   way to conceive of public reason as a historical phenomenon. Second, it
   is suggested that both Rawls and Foucault allow us to consider rights as
   historical and particular rather than a-historical and universal. Third,
   it is argued that Foucault's genealogy of modern liberal government
   illuminates some of the tensions and some of the alternatives within the
   liberal tradition in relation to the concept of political legitimacy.},

Abstract = {Indonesia has been prolific in creating local governments since 1999.
   This article reexamines provincial division in Indonesia and proposes a
   Veto players (VP) Theory of territorial reform, a function of the
   interplay of a number of VPs, their cohesion, and congruence of VP
   preferences. Using comparative analysis and process tracing of
   successful and failed cases through key informant interviews and
   secondary materials, Indonesia is found to have large but decisive VPs,
   where the direction of reform is contingent on the preferences of local
   players through territorial leveraging or opportunism. They are
   political elites who are supported by social movements whose preferences
   run parallel with the former. Despite a large absolute number of VPs,
   territorial reform was achieved due to smaller effective number of VPs
   (via established executive-legislative relations), due to mirroring and
   manipulation of preferences through side payments and other strategic
   behaviors (lobbying and social mobilization), and through reciprocity
   norms of patronage and personal linkages.},

Abstract = {This article revisits the constitutional dimensions of the debate on
   inferior courts in the First Congress. The basic question in the debate
   revealed the contested character of the new constitutional order and
   probed the extent to which it constituted a displacement of the old
   confederation order. Advocates of extending the federal courts, led by
   James Madison and Fisher Ames, employed the text of Article III to
   insist on the constitutional necessity of inferior courts, while the
   opposition relied on textual support for legislative discretion in the
   matter of judicial structure. I contend that by preserving and thus
   biasing certain arguments and by allowing those arguments to be made in
   terms of an appeal to higher law, the text lent weight to the Federalist
   position and thus demonstrated its capacity to shape the direction of
   institutional development in important ways.},

Abstract = {Article 13 of the Fiscal Treaty (2012) prompted the creation of an inter
   parliamentary conference to discuss and oversee the EU's post-crisis
   regime of economic governance. However, the first meeting of the
   `Article 13 Conference', in October 2013, was beset by conflict.
   Surprisingly, the main cleavage was not a left right debate over
   economic policy (for example, pro-versus anti-austerity), but a debate
   about the nature and purpose of the conference itself. This pitted the
   European Parliament (EP), preferring a weak conference with a narrow
   mandate, against a number of national parliaments that preferred a
   strong conference with a broad mandate. This cleavage was apparent in a
   series of constitutional, institutional and procedural disagreements
   that arose over the course of the setting-up of the Article 13
   Conference, many of which remained unresolved even after its second and
   third meetings, in January and September 2014, At the root of this
   struggle lay competing visions for the parliamentary oversight of the
   EU: Should scrutiny be centralized in the EP, or should there be a new
   system of joint scrutiny involving the EP and national parliaments
   together?},

Abstract = {Can a natural disaster shift long-standing party support for the
   long-term? Studies of political behavior indicate that, as elections
   approach, voters punish or credit governments based on their responses
   to severe weather phenomena. It may still be considered an open
   question, however, if poor crisis response could trigger more durable
   shifts in long-standing party support. I provide empirical evidence
   suggesting that it could. I exploit a crucial case for the study of
   change in party support, Storm Gudrun (Erwin), to examine long lasting
   punishment effects over crisis response. The estimated effect is of a
   magnitude that equals the largest block-transfer of voters in Swedish
   history and can be seen over three parliamentary elections (2006, 2010
   and 2014). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Recent research has cast doubt on the potential for various electoral
   reforms to increase voter turnout. In this article, we examine the
   effectiveness of preregistration laws, which allow young citizens to
   register before being eligible to vote. We use two empirical approaches
   to evaluate the impact of preregistration on youth turnout. First, we
   implement difference-in-difference and lag models to bracket the causal
   effect of preregistration implementation using the 2000-2012 Current
   Population Survey. Second, focusing on the state of Florida, we leverage
   a discontinuity based on date of birth to estimate the effect of
   increased preregistration exposure on the turnout of young registrants.
   In both approaches, we find preregistration increases voter turnout,
   with equal effectiveness for various subgroups in the electorate. More
   broadly, observed patterns suggest that campaign context and supporting
   institutions may help to determine when and if electoral reforms are
   effective.},

Abstract = {Scholars of political violence and genocide often lament that idealist
   issues such as humanitarian tragedies typically take a back seat to
   realist issues such as great power rivalry. They also should consider
   another set of calculations made by decision makersthose related to
   economic issues. A look at international political economy explains how
   governments frame their economic challenges of today and tomorrow. This
   essay provides a brief look at the main theories of international
   political economy: economic liberalism, economic nationalism, and
   economic structuralism (dependency and Marxism). It also examines two
   hybrid ideasthe East Asian strategy and state capitalismand the
   phenomenon of globalization. Genocide and humanitarian tragedies have
   economic dimensions to them. Governments making choices about
   intervention also have competing economic responsibilities. A look at
   these theories helps reveal the different assumptions about
   international political economy that color scholarly judgment on key
   political and economic trends, and how governments or movements frame
   their choices when economic perspectives are placed into the mix.},

Abstract = {This study examines the overlap ofinternational responsibility of
   individual and state for genocide. To describe this overlap, the
   material and psychological elements of genocide are discussed.
   International criminal law with the distinction between ``ordinary state
   responsibility{''} and ``aggravated state responsibility `` drawing the
   latter offences beyond the State's international responsibility that is
   mainly focused on the principle of compensation and in which punitive
   sanctions are not relevant. The result of this change is the
   establishment of individual criminal responsibility, and aggravated
   state responsibility.
   The goal ofthe research is to Explain The Overlap of international
   responsibility of individual and state for genocide to argue that the
   two items are not two separate categories and rather, they complete each
   other. so that responsibility of individual and state for the same
   action following primarily, individual criminal responsibility and

Abstract = {Arend Lijphart's Patterns of Democracy, similar to most of his work,
   elicited fierce scientific debate. This article replicates some of the
   analyses proposed in its second edition (published in 2012) in the light
   of the critiques received by the first edition (published in 2009). It
   primarily examines the relationship between institutional setup and
   interest group representation, disentangling the effect of consensualism
   from that of corporatism on issues such as macroeconomic performance and
   governance capabilities. The article further deepens our understanding
   of the complex causal mechanisms connecting these variables, proposing a
   more sophisticated empirical investigation that emphasises selection
   effects and conjunctural causation.},

   convergence, the context in which it should take place, and the reasons
   why it should. We close by showing how our contributors to this special
   issue open this debate for us in promising ways.},

Abstract = {This article examines the acts of detainee abuse that took place at the
   Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq from the standpoint of organization theory.
   Instead of seeing Abu Ghraib as a failure of bureaucracy, I show that
   the prison is emblematic of a different organizational model adhocracy
   that places greater emphasis on the delegation of improvisation and
   practical judgment to low-level operators. I argue that that there is an
   intimate connection between adhocracies and the kind of security
   apparatus put in place by Coalition forces in Iraq, that the space of
   their encounter is potentially dangerous, and that adhocracies demand a
   distinctive approach to questions of individual responsibility.},

Title = {Choreographed Segregation: Irish Republican Commemoration of the 1916
   Easter Rising in `Post-Conflict' Belfast},
Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1, SI},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {This article considers the commemorative events for the 1916 Rising
   taking place over the course of the Easter weekend in Belfast an
   exercise in choreographed segregation. The paper highlights that,
   beginning on Easter Sunday morning and concluding late on Monday
   afternoon, six separate faction-specific commemorations take place in
   the west of the city. Rather than serving the purpose of uniting an ever
   expanding network of rival groups under a banner of this shared Irish
   republican commemoration, the manner by which the events are organised
   serves to harden the lines of intra-factional difference. Analysis of
   the use of commemorative space, with a specific focus on how it is both
   shared and divided over the course of the Easter weekend, reveals the
   designation of separate time slots for groups to gather and internal
   segregation within the same commemorative space in the city, Milltown
   cemetery. In addition the article highlights the competition over use
   and ownership of important and iconic republican symbolism. It is argued
   that the expansion of separate republican commemorations for the Easter
   Rising is linked to the improving political climate in `post-conflict'
   Belfast. Segregation at the events is based on a need to ensure an
   absence of violent intra-factional conflict should two or more
   commemorative rituals collide. However, of equal importance is the
   crucial role the 1916 Easter commemorations play in maintaining
   marginalised republican factional identities, particularly those whose
   very existence is challenged as a result of the dominant position of the
   powerful republican group in the north, Sinn Fein. Findings presented in
   the article are supplemented with reference to data gathered through
   interviews conducted with members across the republican movement in the
   north. The overall outcome is a commemorative event that appears
   solidarity limiting, fragmented and deeply contested despite taking
   place in a relatively peaceful and consensual `post-conflict'
   environment.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {38},

Pages = {485-500},
Abstract = {In August 2013, US president Barack Obama announced a plan to link
   federal financial aid to college performance. This plan, it is argued,
   will allow students, parents, and federal lenders to avoid paying
   tuition for an ultimately meaningless credential. It identifies relevant
   educational outcomes as rates of graduation, the earnings of graduates,
   and the attainment of advanced degrees after graduation. The president's
   plan is part of a much larger trend toward ``accountability{''} and
   ``transparency{''} in education, an important feature of which is the
   proliferation of the language and programs related to assessment of
   student learning outcomes. In this essay, I show that outcomes
   assessment is a form of ``one-dimensional thought{''} as this concept is
   developed in One-Dimensional Man and that it suffers from the defects
   identified by Marcuse there. Outcomes assessment, therefore, codifies
   ways of thinking about education that undermine its role in the
   development of liberated forms of consciousness and emancipatory praxis.},

Abstract = {What explains varying levels of emigrant transnational engagement in
   home-country politics? The well-known difficulties in obtaining migrant
   profile data and restriction to a few destination countries have
   resulted in a lack of systematic empirical investigation of this
   question. We expand nascent efforts to fill this gap by offering a new
   theoretical framework and novel research design that stress the
   potential importance of destination characteristics. We argue that the
   experience and environment in emigration are critical factors for
   emigrants' engagement with two major types of homeland-related political
   activities: electoral and community. Using Ukraine as a case of an
   average migrant-producer developing country and using count models on
   original survey data on Ukrainian extraterritorial voters in a diverse
   set of 15 countries, we show that assimilation, emigrant networks, and
   destination characteristics are consistently strong predictors of
   transnational political engagement among the emigrants who show at least
   a minimal concern for homeland politics.},
