Abstract = {When he gave his first political work the title The Elements of Law
   Natural and Politic, Hobbes signalled an agenda to revise and
   incorporate continental Roman and Natural Law traditions for use in
   Great Britain, and from first to last he remained faithful to this
   agenda, which it took his entire corpus to complete. The success of his
   project is registered in the impact Hobbes had upon the continental
   legal system in turn, specific aspects of his theory, as for instance
   the right to punish, entering the European civil code through Pufendorf,
   and remaining to this day. This is a topic of considerable importance at
   a time at which the UK is considering scrapping the European Union, with
   all the attendant legal ramifications that entails. But strangely,
   despite some acknowledgement of Hobbes's contribution to European civil
   law, and specifically the German civil code, the larger legal context
   for his thought has not thus far been systematically addressed.},

   v. Board of Education},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {44-60},
Abstract = {The colorblind individualism that pervades American politics and society
   keeps schools segregated although Americans support integrated public
   education. While the 1954 US Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of
   Education has never been overruled, later cases and policies have
   encouraged its retrenchment. We argue in this multi-disciplinary review
   of published literature that there are two different versions of
   Brown-the iconic, pro-integration symbol supported by most Americans,
   and a formal, juridical requirement that permits continued school
   segregation. The formal, juridical Brown is supported by the
   implementation of multiple educational policies, particularly
   neighborhood schools, magnet schools, and charter schools, all built on
   the firm belief that there is no violation of Brown. Rather than
   promoting a vision of Brown that champions a strong integration goal,
   these policies bolster the second interpretation of Brown: one that
   allows segregation to occur, so long as it is not outwardly deliberate.},

Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},

Abstract = {The European football is in need of proper governance. This fact has
   been acknowledged in a number of EU documents, as well as by some of its
   member-states, Britain and France in particular. Weak governance
   undermines the financial stability of football clubs and the ability of
   sport to fullfil its key social functions. Besides other things, it open
   channels of external interference in the functioning of FIFA and UEFA as
   self-regulating bodies of football governance. The present article is
   devoted to the exploration of governance modes transformation in
   European and international football, influences by the European
   integration process. Global governance is employed here as an analytical
   approach. It allows to specify the role of the EU in development and
   maintenance of rules and norms, which limit the freedom of state and
   nonstate actors, involved in the sphere of football.
   The 2007 Lisbon Treaty endowed the EU with direct competence in the
   field of sport. But today it will still be a mistake to conclude that
   the European institutions are directly responsible for the formation of
   new structures of football governance. Nevertheless, their activity does
   have an impact on the lives of those who are involved in it. Unsatisfied
   stakeholders (football clubs, players and fans) turn to the EU for
   support when seeking alternative ways for settlement of disputes, when
   they do not find resolution in the internal structures of football
   governance. Vertical pathways, established in the traditional pyramid of
   the European football governance are subsequently undermined. Thus, the
   EU influence makes it easier to turn to structures of network
   governance.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE INVESTIGACIONES POLITICAS Y SOCIOLOGICAS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {131-148},
Abstract = {Through the comparative analysis of the published legal diplomas and
   static information available by the social security Institute IP, we aim
   to evaluate the impact of the financial and economic crisis of 2007/
   2008 in the main measures of social protection valid in Portugal, namely
   the solidarity complement for aged persons, unemployed and illness
   subsidy, family allowance for children and young, pension of invalidity
   and old age pension, and at last the social insertion income. In the
   generality, every available, social contributions have been passed by
   onerous legislative alterations, expressed in the reduction of the
   amounts attributed in the suppression of benefits, in the period of the
   concession of the same and of course in the decrease of benefits, in the
   period of concession of the same and obviously in the decrease of
   beneficiaries, being an exception to the last indicator (diminution of
   the number of beneficiaries) the unemployment subsidy and the old age
   pension, supported circumstances in the consequences of the crisis, and
   the adverse evolution of demography, respectively.
   Towards the found evidences, we can easily conclude that the tendency
   for the implementation of neoliberal politics of austerity, affected the
   pillars of the welfare State, still in construction, with direct
   consequences in the life of many citizens, above all, the more
   vulnerable.},

Title = {Indigenous institutions as an alternative conflict resolution mechanism
   in eastern Ethiopia: The case of the Ittu Oromo and Issa Somali clans},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {85-109},
Abstract = {The study was conducted in eastern Ethiopia where the Somali and Oromo
   ethnic groups live. The main purpose was to examine the roles and
   challenges of the indigenous conflict resolution mechanisms practised as
   an alternative to modern methods among the Ittu Oromo and Issa Somali
   clans. The study employed a qualitative research approach under which
   key informant interviews, focus group discussions, observations and
   informal discussions were conducted. Key informants and focus group
   discussants were selected purposively. It was found that territorial
   expansion, resource competition and cattle raiding were considered as
   the main causes of violent conflict in the area. Boundary disputes
   between the two regions have been associated not only with the
   accessibility of resources, but also with issues of identity. According
   to the participants, the indigenous institutions can play a major role
   in preventing and resolving intra-ethnic conflicts. There are cases of
   government support for indigenous institution leaders, especially where
   there is proximity between such leaders and the current political
   system. Government intervention in the indigenous systems can also
   result, however, in the weakening of customary institutions in the area.
   The absence of a single common binding indigenous institution that
   governs inter-ethnic conflict in the area is another challenge for
   indigenous systems of conflict resolution. Indigenous institutions can
   deal effectively with many conflicts caused by the above mentioned
   factors, but since they also have certain limitations, serious thought
   should be given to the option of appropriately integrating modern and
   indigenous institutions.},

Volume = {21},

Pages = {181-199},
Abstract = {This article engages with the thought of Augusto Del Noce (1910-1989),
   the most important Italian Catholic philosopher and political thinker of
   the 20th century. The focus is on how Del Noce came to elaborate a
   Catholic `modernity,' bridging a positive encounter between Catholicism,
   democracy and freedom. This philosophical project had a considerable
   impact on modern Italian culture and politics. At the theoretical level,
   the argument is embedded within the larger aim of recognizing attempts
   within Catholic philosophy to articulate an Italian political trajectory
   that does not simply accept the tale of a singular path to modernity
   based on the Enlightenment model but instead tries to articulate an
   alternative vision of the modern, grounded within a transcendental
   perspective.},

   rebel group implies the need to problematize citizen participation in
   key thought of Hannah Arendt about a politic of life and death related
   to the action and the plurality of all players in the field of human
   affairs. It is a qualitative research hermeneutics approach that
   considers citizen participation in key politic Arendtian thought of life
   and death that tends to political action, democracy and peace dialogue.
   Therefore, the plurality of men has always been the key to strengthening
   democratic states. The incidence of citizen political action in a peace
   process identifies the legitimacy of a collective whole to provide a
   significant public to run a post-conflict with all social possibilities

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {449-465},
Abstract = {South Africa's soft power capacity is often constrained by the tensions
   emerging between regional normative commitments on the one hand and more
   cosmopolitan, liberal democratic norms on the other. The country's
   African leadership aspirations, which require sanctifying state
   sovereignty and non-intervention over human rights and democracy, is one
   such example. This article illustrates how these tensions illuminate the
   extent to which South Africa's more independent, cosmopolitan,
   bridge-building posture under Mandela has increasingly given way to an
   orientation emphasizing its Africanist credentials as more of a
   liberationist than liberal democracy and soft balancing against the OECD
   world. Whether this move has resulted in unequivocal African
   followership as a form of soft power remains uncertain.},

Abstract = {This article aims at understanding the transformations of the
   enlargement policy during the 2000's. It focuses on the relation between
   EU's institutions, analyzes their official statements from 2004 to 2006,
   and puts emphasis on their interactions and unexpected results. In a
   context favoring the politicization of the EU enlargement but without
   allowing the possibility of any official reform, policy tools have been
   mainly impacted by incremental changes. The process of rethinking the
   tools led in turn to a comprehensive renewal of the enlargement
   methodology, bringing fundamental changes. Indeed, the new methodology
   calls into question one of the key policy components (the pre-accession
   strategy) and challenges the policy paradigm of conditionality.},

   the power debate},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {65-82},
Abstract = {This article introduces Margaret Archer's research on reflexivity to the
   power debate, alongside Pierre Bourdieu's already influential concept of
   habitus. Both offer significant insights on social conditioning in late
   modernity. However, their tendency to the extreme of social determinism
   and voluntarism must be avoided. To do so, this article adopts
   Haugaard's family resemblance concept of power, describing habitus and
   reflexivity as an important new binary of power instead of a conceptual
   zero-sum game. This strengthens the explanatory role of agency, central
   to the three dimensions of power, without losing sight of constitutive,
   structural power. It also helps overcome the habitus-reflexivity
   dichotomy in social theory and provides a starting point to evaluate
   Archer's work from a power perspective.},

Abstract = {During the Revolution of 1905/1907, a terrorist ``epidemic{''} broke out
   in the Russian Empire. Russian Poland was one of the main centres. A
   disproportionate number of attacks and assassinations took place in
   Warsaw, Lodz, and other cities within the once autonomous kingdom. This
   massive wave of terrorist violence did not have socioeconomic causes,
   but rather fed on resurgent Polish nationalism. That the imperial centre
   perceived the Polish periphery as essentially unreliable and,
   accordingly, pursued a repressive policy, contributed to the escalation.
   Broad swathes of the Polish population perceived themselves as
   humiliated.},

Abstract = {The signing of the Ulster Covenant on 28 September 1912 by almost
   450,000 men and women was a powerful act of defiance on the part of
   Unionists in the context of what they perceived as the threat to their
   way of life represented by the Liberal Government's policy of Irish Home
   Rule. This article attempts to look beyond the well-studied leadership
   figures of Carson and Craig in order to fashion insights into the way
   Ulster Protestant society was mobilised around the Covenant and
   opposition to Home Rule. It draws attention to hitherto over-shadowed
   personalities who can be said to have exerted crucial local influence.
   It also contends that although pan-Protestant denominational unity
   provided the basis for the success of the Covenant, the Presbyterian
   community was particularly cohesive and purposeful in the campaign. The
   article further argues that the risk-taking defiance that came more
   easily to the Presbyterians, on account of a troubled history, largely
   evaporated in the new political circumstances of Northern Ireland when
   it became a separate devolved political entity within the UK from 1921.},

Abstract = {In Poland, two irreconcilable camps stand opposite one another: the
   ``right-wing conservatives{''} and ``liberal Poland{''}. In the
   self-perception of the party Law and Justice (PiS), this stand-off is a
   Manichaean struggle between good and evil for the ``recovery{''} of a
   system that is seriously ill. The demonization of Jarostaw Kaczynski and
   his party on the part of the liberal camp follows the same Manichean
   logic. As a result of this confrontation, urgently needed reforms, such
   as those in healthcare, are at risk of being dragged out. And the way
   PiS has acted since taking over power calls to mind Edmund Burke's
   insight: change based on indignation can lead to disaster.},

Title = {Conceptualizing Usage in Voting Behavior for Political Marketing: An
   Application of Consumer Behavior},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {259-284},
Abstract = {Political marketing has borrowed and adapted many terms from mainstream
   marketing, such as image management (segmentation, targeting, and
   positioning) and consumer (voter). In marketing, the terms ``user'' and
   ``usage'' have been established, yet their application to political
   marketing is less clear. This paper analyzes the feasibility and
   usefulness of usage in the political context. Drawing from the
   literature on usage, a model is developed and applied to four voting
   environments: Britain, Australia, Russia, and Belarus. One critical
   factor that emerges is the concept of choice, whereby the voter may
   chose to indicate their preference for one party yet be forced to use a
   different party as chosen by collective choice. Another issue is the
   potential for habitual voting behavior to limit decision making. It is
   concluded that usage needs to be contextualized specifically for
   political marketing.},

Abstract = {Scholars have not reconciled Ralph Waldo Emerson's anti-political
   individualism with his newly rediscovered abolitionism. This article
   attempts to unite the apolitical and political Emerson by showing that
   they are only temporally separated. Solitude prefaces politics. I first
   explain Emerson's solitary contemplation as imagination that reveals
   interpersonal obligations. Second, I show how these obligations draw the
   thinker back to politics, and in Emerson's case, to abolitionism, where
   he advocated small conversations to incite others to contemplation and
   then action. Conversation did not convert hostile slaveholders. But,
   third, I note that Emerson admired the abolitionists who attempted moral
   suasion in the South at great personal risk. Their political activism
   exemplified self-reliance within society.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {38},
Number = {4},
Pages = {547-560},
Abstract = {Careful reading of Herbert Marcuse's texts, including Counterrevolution
   and Revolt, One-Dimensional Man, An Essay on Liberation, and Eros and
   Civilization, reveals his subtle attention to the human-animal dialectic
   and its role in human liberation. More specifically, animals mark the
   irrationality of advanced industrialized society for Marcuse, and his
   subtle but keen treatment of the animal question in politics provides an
   opening to radically rethink politics for animals and humans. Working
   from Marcuse's critical theory, I explore the contemporary
   one-dimensional animal, which I argue imbricates both animals and humans
   in the violence and destruction that characterizes advanced industrial
   society. Using Marcuse's concept of one-dimensional society and his
   discussion of animals as my theoretical framework, I specifically
   consider vegetarianism in its capacity to militate against the
   contemporary political economy of meat. I conclude that Marcuse's
   insights point to a radical vegetarianism aligned with anti-capitalist
   politics that offers the development of sensuous, pleasurable,
   life-affirming sensibilities that support true liberation for both
   animals and humans.},

Abstract = {In the discipline of international relations, the balance which was
   expected to be established in the 21st century between the hegemony of
   the state and social forces has failed to materialize, and the hegemonic
   structure of the state continues to maintain its supremacy. In
   nation-states unable to reconcile the conceptual principles of hegemony
   and the rule of law, the effects of this issue continue to increase and
   this is the most important reason political and social issues are
   unsolvable. In this article, the author highlights the relationship
   between state sovereignty and violence, the oppression of material
   forces and social forces, and the importance of being transformed from a
   nation-state to a democratic state.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {44},

Abstract = {The literature on elections and election monitoring is divided between
   those who take a skeptical view, suggesting that monitors are often
   political rather than objective in their judgments, and those who see
   monitors as a real force for cleaner, more honest elections. Studies
   that use field experiments to look for the effect of monitors generally
   support the optimists, indicating that the mere presence of election
   observers can have powerful effects. This is surprising given the extent
   of the resources available to incumbents who wish to conduct electoral
   fraud. We present the results of an experiment in which 768 observers
   were randomly assigned to polling stations in 21 cities in Russia in the
   2011 parliamentary elections. Unlike most previous studies of election
   observers, our results suggest that observer effects on turnout and vote
   for the ruling party are small. The results suggest the need to study
   more carefully the circumstances that shape the impact of observation
   missions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {46},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom holds that Republicans have hawkish foreign policy
   preferences compared to Democrats but quantitative research on the use
   of force finds no relationship between the party of the president and
   his propensity to use force. This article offers two reasons for this
   puzzling nonfinding. First, although Republicans have favored military
   spending and intervention more than Democrats have since the mid-1960s,
   the two parties' positions on these issues were reversed before that
   time. Analyses that cover the entire postwar era conflate periods when
   party had opposite effects. Second, previous research has generally
   focused on actual uses of force. Strategic conflict avoidance by
   potential targets is more likely to obscure a party effect when
   examining these relatively high-level conflict events. Examining events
   data, which include many lower-level conflict events, we find evidence
   that Democrats were more hawkish than Republicans during the 1949-65
   period and that Republicans were more hawkish during the 1966-92 period.},

Abstract = {Using the case study of South Africa, this article examines how
   influential outsider states perceive the legitimacy of the UN Security
   Council and whether they can perform a critical role in affecting the
   legitimacy of the institution. The article demonstrates that South
   Africa's reform diplomacy challenges the authority of the existing
   membership of the Council but not the legitimacy of the original mandate
   of the Council as the guarantor of international peace and stability.
   Such a reform agenda allows for promoting South Africa's own candidacy
   as a new permanent member of the Council. Despite its activism in
   promoting such reform, South Africa's diplomacy is undermined by its
   incapacity to influence the positions of the permanent five members, the
   lack of support by other African states, and its own ambivalent foreign
   policy that oscillates between support for human rights and allegiance
   to the global South.},

Abstract = {The present work examines the development of the Popular Action Front
   (FRAP), emphasizing the concept of democracy and its relation with the
   concept of revolution in the political project of the Chilean Left.
   Although we acknowledge the importance that the concept of revolution
   had for the two most important left-wing parties at the time, the
   Communist Party and the Socialist Party, we aim to show how the FRAP's
   discourse, in its origins, is based mainly on a democratic and
   progressive discourse, although not openly revolutionary, having the
   latter a later appearance in the leftist coalition's project.},

Abstract = {The Joint Stock Company has its role in motivating the economical
   development of the state. In order to fulfill such role, balancing shall
   be achieved between Majority and Minority rights or at least restricting
   the majority arbitrariness in terms of decision making. Such
   arbitrariness means bringing the investors away from investments in such
   types of companies which shall, indeed, have its negative influence on
   the national economy.
   The laws and Jordanian companies' law in particular, paid specific
   attention in terms of minority rights protection, and in the same time
   recognize its existence, its right to participate in decision making and
   also to practice control over the majority who manage and run the
   company's affairs.
   Indeed, we cannot ignore the fact that Jordanian legislator tried much
   to correspond between majority and minority rights or at lease protect
   the minority rights. In spite of such efforts, we still witness more
   problems that hinder such issue.
   From this point this study came to clarify much of such rights,
   presenting and analyzing thereof in a way that enable the investor to
   practice in a way to achieve desired interests.},

Abstract = {Max Weber has had a huge influence upon the enquiry into civilisations
   and their differences. Books and articles keep coming out on Western
   rationality and the Occidental form of capitalism, what he called modern
   capitalism. But things have changed since 1904, when he started
   publishing on world religions and their social consequences, especially
   for the prevailing economic ethics of personal conduct. His favourite,
   Protestantism, is barely surviving in Europe, although still flourishing
   in the US and Brazil. And modern capitalism has moved to East and South
   East Asia, the religion of Buddhism in various combinations with local
   religions. Are there then no other civilizational divide than Weber's
   candidates: religion and capitalism? Yes, there is a more powerful
   separation among the world's civilisations that is being experienced
   daily by global inhabitants, namely the rule of law (RL).},

   the earthquake of 2010, with the intention of re-establishing the order
   and the life lost under the rubbles. Near six years after the tragedy
   the city that is emerging, in effect, looks like it was before because
   unsafe constructions, unhealthy neighborhoods, poor access to basic

Abstract = {It is widely lamented that lame-duck presidents are do-nothing
   presidents. But systematic studies of these periods focus almost
   exclusively on domestic policy, ignoring the implications for foreign
   affairs. In this article, I argue that presidents are no less ambitious
   at the end of their time in office and the desire to cement their
   historical legacies can even make them more so. However, this ambition
   is checked by a substantial increase in the constraints imposed by other
   political actorsmost notably Congress. This mismatch between incentives
   and opportunity pushes presidents toward foreign policy, where
   meaningful achievements are still possible due to greater presidential
   autonomy. The result is an increase in diplomacy, and international
   agreements, and use of force.},

Abstract = {Inter-election volatility is essential for the functioning of democracy.
   In accounting for the underlying processes prior research focused on
   campaign volatility, while neglecting between-campaign volatility. This
   neglect is not warranted however. Between-campaign periods may include
   multiple events that set the stage for electoral competition and shape
   citizens' political cognitions, attitudes and party preference until the
   next election. Depending on the flow of political communication,
   between-campaign periods may considerably contribute to inter-election
   volatility. Drawing on a data set from an intra- and inter election
   panel survey conducted in the 2009 and 2013 German federal elections,
   the evidence suggests that between-campaign changes in party preferences
   and political attitudes were at least as important as within-campaign
   changes in contributing to inter-election switching. Moreover, political
   involvement is less powerful in conditioning electoral volatility than
   suggested by conventional wisdom. The analysis thus provides a first
   step toward a general account of inter-election volatility. (C) 2016

Abstract = {This article examines when partisan media effects occur during
   presidential campaigns. I argue that partisan media are most likely to
   influence candidate impressions early in the election cycle, when voters
   have less crystallized impressions of the candidates and are less
   motivated to defend their party's nominee. Using multiple methods and
   two large-scale surveys spanning 2008, I show that Fox News affected
   favorability toward Barack Obama during the first five months of the
   election year, but those effects largely disappeared over the last five
   months. The results varied by political knowledge, however, as Fox News
   affected low-knowledge viewers throughout the entire year, but only
   affected high-knowledge viewers early in the election cycle. These
   results provide important new evidence on how partisan media affect
   viewers and when those effects occur during a presidential election.},

Abstract = {Japan combines demographic challenges of decreasing childbirths and an
   ageing population, yet political unwillingness to use immigration to
   ease labour market and caregiving shortages. Paying attention to gender,
   diversity, and inclusion would seem to be a `rational' political choice.
   Although Prime Minister Abe (Abe II) understands the need to appear to
   be responding to Japanese women qua equal citizens, women remain more an
   `object' of LDP policy than a substantive beneficiary. To improve his
   image, Abe has incorporated `Womenomics' into his strategy of economic
   revitalisation; the result has been a rather incoherent blend of `equal
   participation' and `women's utilisation'. In 2016, the dearth of
   diversity and anti-feminist sentiment within Japanese politics continues
   to be mirrored in both passive and active ways within the discursive and
   institutional political climate, including within academia. It is
   largely premature to assume a shared normative or scientific commitment
   to inclusion and diversity in Japan. Japanese Political Science (JPS) is
   no exception, and this has obvious implications for what constitutes a
   `serious' political issue worthy of study, what gets funded, who gets
   hired, and the extent to which critical debates within feminist
   political science (FSP) on gender, race, and diversity are taken
   seriously. In this article, I offer a preliminary evaluation of JPS in
   light of three indicators: the under-representation of women in Japanese
   academia generally and political science specifically; the access of FPS
   to large-scale government funding grants (2003-2013) and its impact on
   the discipline; and recent efforts by feminist political scientists in
   Tokyo to create a home' for debates on gender, diversity, and political
   representation. I conclude with a hopeful expectation that increasing
   numbers of political scientists in Japan will begin to genuinely
   problematise the dearth of diversity in Japanese politics and to
   approach this fundamental puzzle of Japanese democratisation with the
   intellectual curiosity that it deserves.},

Abstract = {The impending demise of passenger motor vehicle manufacturing in
   Australia provides a good opportunity to view the trajectory of industry
   policy since the Whitlam government commenced the process of tariff cuts
   in 1973. It is argued that industry policy over this period demonstrates
   the effects of path dependence and a lack of policy learning. In the
   industry policy context, the path dependence perspective suggests three
   key factors in explaining policy effects: the importance of initial
   conditions; the role of cumulative causation in the interaction between
   policy settings, actors and firms; and the shaping role of networks.
   While political or electoral factors could, on occasion, generate
   support for threatened industries, overall, neo-liberal policy ideas
   guided decision-making. An examination of Australian defence industry,
   and a comparison of the Australian and New Zealand dairy and milk
   processing industries reinforces the importance of institutionally
   shaped path dependency.},

Abstract = {Since the 1980s, developing countries have been implementing radical
   reforms to increase their competitiveness in the global economy. While
   the increased export orientation has had positive effects on economic
   growth in many countries, it has also left them susceptible to external
   attempts to influence domestic regulatory standards. In this article, we
   explore a specific case that illustrates how domestic actors cope with
   such external pressures for regulatory reforms. We examine how domestic
   policymakers received the European Union's import ban on natural honey
   produced in Brazil and the actions they took in an attempt to have the
   ban lifted. The import ban triggered the creation of a new institution,
   the Honey Chamber, which helped to coordinate the interests of different
   sectoral actors, thereby helping to overcome institutional
   fragmentation. Once established, the new institution facilitated the
   revision of the existing regulatory standards and paved the way for the
   more-rigorous monitoring of residues in honey.},

Abstract = {The dramatic increases in crime rates and the perception of insecurity
   in Mexico has fueled the interest in decoding the relationship between
   fear and the urban environment. This paper examines different
   epistemological perspectives to understand more deeply the phenomenon of
   fear of crime. With a special emphasis on those perspectives that go
   beyond the rationalist models, we explored issues of representation,
   speeches, scales and contexts, aiming to explore local narratives,
   cultural representations and different levels of symbolic meaning that
   contribute to the spatial construction of fear.},

Abstract = {Extensive and comprehensive political, economics, technological
   differences and related crisis have caused organizations to encounter
   many challenges in directing activities and maintaining their position
   in a competitive environment. Strategic management is known as an
   efficient solution for institutes in dynamic environments.
   Strategic marketing management determines and plans marketing strategies
   and implements them with a clear understanding of the organization's
   mission, the assessment of environmental factors, checking the
   organization's situation, and exploring opportunities in the market.
   Strategic management process is a guidance to execute organization
   activities besides organization type or size. This process can be used
   by organizations in terms of marketing. The basic steps of strategic
   marketing management are similar for all types of organizations like
   organizations related to manufacturing industries, while importance of
   each step is different to others depending on effective environmental
   factors on the institute. In the present paper, these steps and some
   examples of their application are explained.},

Abstract = {Lipsky's Street-Level Bureaucracy (1980) led to a major paradigm shift
   in the study of public administration and bureaucracy. It identified
   discretion by frontline workers as a critical issue in the study of
   street-level bureaucracy. Chinese scholars have since 2000 joined
   research on street-level bureaucracy. Some reviews of the English
   literature on street-level bureaucracy have been published in China.
   This paper discusses some major issues in research on street-level
   discretion in the West, drawing on Hupe and Buffat (Public Manag Rev
   16(4):548-569, 2014); Maynard-Moody and Portillo (The Oxford handbook of
   American bureaucracy. Oxford University Press, Oxford, pp 255-277,
   2010); Portillo and Rudes (Annu Rev Law Soc Sci 10:321-334, 2014).
   Compared with the Chinese reviews noted above, this paper is a more
   substantial and updated summary and assessment of the literature on
   street-level discretion. It also raises some issues for future research
   on frontline discretion in China.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to contribute to the understanding of public policy
   towards `the Erased' implementation problems in the Republic of
   Slovenia, where the former Yugoslav population was removed from the
   Register of Permanent Residence by national authorities. We will focus
   on the implementation of two constitutional rulings during the period
   from 1999 to 2012 in the context of multi-level policymaking and policy
   networks. With the analytical framework applied in a two-level analysis
   we will analyse how these mezzo (the relations between policy actors)
   and macro level (the structural strength of the state and social
   political groups in parliament) variables influence policy outcomes and
   in particular ineffective implementation. The results reveal a gap
   between two different decision-making processes: what political actors
   wanted to do, and what they were obliged to do according to
   constitutional demands. Additionally, the change at the macro level will
   be shown to contribute to the change in the policy network at the mezzo
   level and thus to the final implementation of public policy towards `the
   Erased.'},

Abstract = {This article investigates the determinants of parliamentary support for
   international fiscal aid. Departing from the literature on presidential
   systems, it analyses an exemplary case of a parliamentary system,
   Germany. Two theoretical accounts are distinguished. The first perceives
   MPs as policy-seekers and focuses on the positioning of government and
   opposition parties and individual MPs on an economic leftright and a
   pro- versus anti-EU dimension. The second regards MPs as vote-seekers
   and presumes an electoral district connection. The statistical analysis
   of a new data-set containing information on 17 Bundestag roll-call votes
   from 2009 to 2015 finds support for the first account: voting in favour
   of fiscal aid measures is mainly driven by government membership and EU
   support. By contrast, neither economic ideologies, nor district or
   mandate characteristics influence support for fiscal aid. The article
   contributes to a growing literature on the domestic politics of
   international political economy.},

Abstract = {This article summarises the rapidly increasing number of studies dealing
   with parties' positional changes. After a short introduction and a brief
   discussion of a number of elementary definitions and delimitations, the
   second section evaluates eight factors commonly associated with party
   policy change. Here, the proposition that parties tend to respond
   systematically to changes in public opinion seems to be the most studied
   and, similarly, the most supported explanation. The third and final
   section identifies a number of research gaps and recommends topics for
   future research.},

Abstract = {In this paper we test the limits of one of the more influential critical
   inquiries linking media to Marx's notion of alienation: Guy Debord's
   Society of the Spectacle as applied to web 2.0 media landscapes. While
   in need of qualification and historicization to interpret web 2.0 media,
   we argue that the idea of the Spectacle provides a useful holistic
   perspective capable of reconciling the ambivalent phenomena of
   alienation that can be found in this new context. Thereafter, by
   exploring how web 2.0 media practices are consistently tied to labour
   and value creation, we argue in favour of a materialist approach to
   media, which treats means of communication as a means of production.
   Furthermore, we contend that in the new media landscape, Debord's
   Spectacle becomes a useful heuristic for understanding ( new) mediation
   as alienation, what we term, `Spectacle 2.0.'},

Title = {Analyzing the Wide Pankurdism from the Copenhagen School and
   Constructivism Perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},

Abstract = {In the (post-Cold War era), one can see violence, ethnic and religious
   changes in the Middle East more than any other regions in the world. In
   the recent years, changes and rises have made this region the central
   place for ethnic and religious crisis around the world. The present
   study aims to answer this basic question framed through two theoretical
   approaches of constructivism and Copenhagen school. That is, what are
   the most influential reasons for spreading pankurdism in the
   Kurdish-resident regions in the Middle East? In order to answer this
   question, the research hypothesis is based on some influential elements
   including self-governance experience in Iraqi Kurdistan as the heart and
   the locus for forming the dream of great Kurdistan, appearance and
   activation of new generation of leaders, Kurdish party and civil actors.
   It also includes intensification of awareness and ethnic
   identity-orientation among young Kurdish people, the fragility of the
   government in Iraq, collapse of authority in Syria and appearance and
   proceeding of Islamic state of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) forces. In this
   paper, the research method is analytical-causal explanation. The most
   important findings of the study is that the combination of reasons cause
   to make spread of pankurdism in the Kurdish-resident region and their
   convergence effective. These reasons are the identification among the
   Kurds as the result of dissatisfactions, humiliation, and suppression
   during several decades, the successful experience of autonomy in the
   Kurdish-resident regions, and collapse and fragility of authority in
   Syria and Iraq. In the near future, such increasing opportunities and
   convergences of the historical and main identity can prepare the Kurds
   to put pressure on the governments for autonomy or even their
   independency.},

Abstract = {Initiatives carried by companies, institutes and governments to flourish
   and embellish the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) among
   the public have led to its penetration into every walk of life. ICT
   enhances the efficiency of various systems, such as the organisation and
   transfer of data. However, with the digital and remote access features
   of ICT comes the motivation towards financial, political and military
   gains by rivals. Security threats and vulnerabilities in existing ICT
   systems have resulted in cyber-attacks that are usually followed by
   substantial financial losses. This study discusses the security in ICT
   from a business, economic and government perspective. The study makes an
   attempt to understand the seriousness of the security issues and
   highlights the consequences of security breech from an economic
   perspective. Based on the performed analysis, the factors behind these
   attacks are provided along with recommendations for better preparations
   against them.},

Abstract = {We specify the level of polarization in a two-party legislature as an
   explicit function of three factors: (1) the ideological heterogeneity of
   district median voters, (2) the distance between candidates of different
   parties in the same or ideologically comparable districts, and (3)
   partisan bias in choosing between candidates equidistant from the median
   voter. Our key empirical finding, reinforced by two alternative methods
   of calculation, is that, while changes in each factor have contributed
   to the present day extremely high level polarization in the US House of
   Representatives, at least 80\% of the growth in that polarization from
   1956 through 2008 can be attributed to a dramatic increase in the second
   of these factors: party differentiation at the district level.},

Abstract = {Poole and Rosenthal's NOMINATE scores have been a boon to the study of
   Congress, but they are not without limitations. We focus on two
   limitations that are especially important in historical applications.
   First, the dimensions uncovered by NOMINATE do not necessarily have a
   consistent ideological meaning over time. Our case study of the 1920s
   highlights the challenge of interpreting NOMINATE scores in periods when
   party lines do not map well onto the main contours of ideological debate
   in political life. Second, the commonly used DW-NOMINATE variant of
   these scores makes assumptions that are not well suited to dealing with
   rapid or non-monotonic ideological change. A case study of Southern
   Democrats in the New Deal era suggests that a more flexible dynamic
   item-response model provides a better fit for this important period.
   These applications illustrate the feasibility and value of tailoring
   one's model and data to one's research goals rather than relying on
   off-the-shelf NOMINATE scores.},

Abstract = {A substantial body of research examines whether increasing the
   proportionality of an electoral system increases turnout, mostly based
   on cross-national comparisons. In this study, we offer two main
   contributions to the previous literature. First, we show that moving
   from a single-member district system to proportional representation in
   multimember districts should, according to recent theories of elite
   mobilization, produce a contraction in the distribution of
   mobilizational effort across districts and, hence, a contraction in the
   distribution of turnout rates. Second, we exploit a within-country panel
   data set based on stable subnational geographic units before and after
   Norway's historic 1919 electoral reform in order to test various
   implications stemming from the contraction hypothesis. We find
   significant support for the predictions of the elite mobilization
   models.},

Abstract = {One of the most controversial debates about the nature of Franco's State
   relates to its totalitarian or authoritarian character. The political
   repression of the press in its early days reveals itself as the
   political key to understanding the regime. This paper analyzes an
   unpublished episode of censorship that affected Arriba, the official
   newspaper of the ``single party{''}. Its director was ousted from his
   job for a short period of time and then covertly prosecuted, in a
   judicial process at which the remaining newspaper directors were obliged
   to testify. The case was counted as a victory for the Foreign Affairs
   Minister, who regained control over the press.},

Abstract = {This paper explores four potential motivations for the party
   politicization of the senior civil service: ideological agreement,
   coalition governance, party family issue priorities, and consociational
   representation. Using data on the party affiliation of 134
   secretaries-general (SGs) serving in the Dutch ministerial bureaucracy
   between 1945 and 2013, it examines the partisan logic of appointment
   patterns among senior civil servants in the Netherlands. Overall levels
   of politicization are very high (almost 70 percent of all SGs have a
   discernible party affiliation), with a strong increase between 1970 and
   1990 and a slight drop-off during the past decades. The appointment
   patterns suggest that the main drivers behind the party politicization
   of the Dutch elite bureaucracy are the demand for ideological agreement
   and a consociational quest for the representation of the `pillar
   parties' in the senior civil service.},

Abstract = {What drives candidates to go negative and against which opponents? Using
   a unique dataset consisting of all inter-candidate tweets by the 17
   Republican presidential candidates in the 2016 primaries, we assess
   predictors of negative affect online. Twitter is a free platform, and
   candidates therefore face no resource limitations when using it; this
   makes Twitter a wellspring of information about campaign messaging,
   given a level playing-field. Moreover, Twitter's 140-character limit
   acts as a liberating constraint, leading candidates to issue sound bites
   ready for potential distribution not only online, but also through
   conventional media, as tweets become news. We find tweet negativity and
   overall rate of tweeting increases as the campaign season progresses.
   Unsurprisingly, the front-runner and eventual nominee, Donald Trump,
   sends and receives the most negative tweets and is more likely than his
   opponents to strike out against even those opponents who are polling
   poorly. However, candidates overwhelmingly punch upwards against those
   ahead of them in the polls, and this pattern goes beyond attacks against
   those near the top. Sixty of 136 dyads are characterized by lopsided
   negativity in one direction and only one of these 60 involves a clearly
   higher status candidate on the offensive.},

Abstract = {Previous research has established the critical relevance of better
   understanding the conditions that either facilitate or obstruct
   rebel-to-party transformations for the sake of strengthening the
   prospects for both peace and democracy in post-war societies. In this
   study, we contribute to this growing research agenda in two ways. We
   first present and analyse data collected by the Uppsala Conflict Data
   Program (UCDP) on all peace agreements that contain specific
   rebel-to-party provisions during the time period 1975-2011. Second, we
   introduce new data on rebel-to-party outcomes during the same time
   period. The descriptive findings confirm several of our theoretical
   expectations. Rebel-to-party provisions are exclusive to the post-Cold
   War era, and are commonly included in peace agreements with third-party
   presence. Somewhat surprisingly, we have seen almost twice as many
   agreements with such provisions in Africa compared to other regions, and
   only in peace agreements in governmental conflicts. However, we find
   several cases of rebel-to-party outcomes in territorial conflicts. Our
   data also confirm that rebel-to-party provisions are neither necessary
   nor sufficient for rebel-to-party outcomes, and highlight the potential
   relevance of other political provisions also supporting the group's
   political integration.},

Abstract = {While there is a clear relationship between better health and better
   economic outcomes, the effects of increasing health insurance on the
   economy remain understudied. We employ two datasets, one on health
   insurance coverage in the contiguous 48 U.S. states and one for
   countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,
   to model the effect of expanding health insurance on state and country
   economic and employment growth over the last two decades. We find that
   increased health insurance coverage of the working age population,
   especially through government programs like Medicaid, is associated with
   faster gross domestic product and employment growth. However, we also
   find that these results may be contingent on controlling the
   per-enrollee cost of these programs. These findings are informative for
   future health insurance reforms both federally and in the U.S. states.},

Abstract = {As a twenty-first century post-war, emigrant-sending country, Liberia
   reflects global citizenship norms while simultaneously departing from
   them, and this unique positioning offers new opportunities to theorise
   citizenship across spatial and temporal landscapes. In this article, I
   examine Liberian citizenship' construction through a historical prism,
   arguing that as Liberia transformed from a country of immigration to one
   of emigration, so too did conceptualisations of citizenship - moving
   from passive, identity-based citizenship emphasising rights and
   entitlements to more active, practice-based citizenship privileging
   duties and responsibilities. Given the dynamic trends in citizenship
   configuration across the globe and particularly in Africa, this article
   fills gaps in the growing body of literature on citizenship and
   participation in emigrant-sending countries by contributing to wider
   debates about how identities, practices and relations between people
   transform in the aftermath of violent conflict. Empirical evidence
   presented is based on multi-sited fieldwork conducted in 2012 and 2013
   with 202 Liberians in urban centres in West Africa, North America and
   Europe.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to examine the applicability of John Womack Jr's
   framework on workers' strength. To do so, the paper examines the
   1916-1923 strikes led by dock workers in one of the most sensitive and
   strategic sectors of the Chilean economy at that time: the saltpeter
   docks. Based on the thorough study of over twenty strikes, this paper
   aims to show that working in the most vulnerable place of the export
   circuit did not necessarily imply that these workers had the strength
   suggested by Womack Jr's framework. The data show that these workers
   were dispensable, so in most cases they were displaced from the
   ``strategic position{''} where they were theoretically located.},

Abstract = {Contracts usually comes from agreement to those who are in harmony with
   the will and desires and in this economic interaction each party seeks
   to obtain his profits and interests and another forced or convinced to
   go with it. This way finally results in justice between the parties and
   hence the agreement as the best and most equitable means of exchange of
   goods and the distribution of wealth are established between two sides.
   However sometimes parties will not form in the open environment but a
   deception in the atmosphere caused by the use of deception and
   fraudulent practices methods to impose their will and the other party
   forced to the contract know that the fact is not refused to accept, or
   at least accept it with such situations. To condemn such behavior it is
   not enough that can only be committed morally to blame because the use
   of deception means to hide the faulty product which may cheated person
   bear the material or spiritual losses. Since jurisprudence knowledge is
   responsible for the expression of practical laws and ordinances
   principles and to deal with problems arising from fraudulent contract.
   Dealings in public life offer religious and legal solutions and this is
   not possible except with great scientific efforts in the field of
   jurisprudence. Deceiver responsibility is examples of un-arbitrary civil
   liability. Scholars have analyzed the deceiver's liability and
   responsibility in detail to rule deceiver (Deceit) has been invoked. So
   that wherever deceit and pride to be true in taking responsibility for
   the spiritual and material elements no deceiver can be cited and
   compensation that pride has suffered through fraud and deceit pride
   demanded. Once a deceiver can be no liability for (Deceit) and the
   following conditions must be present:
   1) beguiling act 2) prejudicing 3) sedative's knowledge and seduced
   unknowing 4) element of deception 5) deceived dissatisfaction},

Abstract = {This essay explores five figures of sympathy at work in Walt Whitman's
   writings, with a focus on Leaves of Grass. Of particular note is the way
   Whitman presents sympathy as not only a moral sentiment but also a
   more-than-human natural force that draws bodies together. Sympathy was a
   key term in the lexicon of nineteenth-century American political
   debates, and we find in Whitman and others elements of a non-modern
   sense of sympathy as a vital or physical force operating below, through,
   and beyond human bodies.},

   multilevel analysis},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {43},
Pages = {158-168},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Proponents of compulsory voting argue that this institution leads to
   higher levels of political engagement. Opponents of mandatory voting
   instead argue that forcing people to vote can increase feelings of
   political alienation and generate lower levels of political engagement.
   The empirical record on this issue is scarce and inconclusive. This
   paper revisits this question with a series of multilevel models that
   evaluate the impact of compulsory voting on different forms of political
   engagement, using data from all the waves of the Americas Barometer
   Survey (2004-2014). The results suggest that compulsory voting has a
   negligible effect on political engagement. However, the results also
   reveal an interesting interaction. Citizens with low levels of education
   are more likely to be cognitively engaged with the political process
   when voting is mandatory. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The inclusion of 11 new member states from the former Eastern bloc
   constitutes a significant challenge to the European Union in various
   respects. Many worry that whatever tenuous European identity' existed
   prior to the eastern enlargement, it has now become so diluted that no
   meaningful European political community can form. We provide an
   empirical account of the state of European identity after the eastern
   enlargement through a comparative analysis of affective and cognitive
   European identity in the old and the new Central and Eastern European
   member states. Our empirical analyses indicate that while the overall
   levels of cognitive European identification in the East are indeed lower
   than in the West, citizens from new member states are just as attached
   to Europe as citizens from old member states. Most importantly, not only
   is there no discernable difference in cognitive identification among
   young Europeans in East and West, but the youngest in the East seem to
   be even more strongly attached to Europe than their peers in the West.},

Abstract = {This article provides an empirical assessment of the causal structure
   underlying the core dependent variable of electoral research (the vote)
   and two of its most notable predictors (partisanship and leader
   evaluations). A critical review of traditional models of voting
   highlights the need to account for the reciprocal relationship between
   the main predictors as well as for the potential feedback stemming from
   the dependent variable. In the light of these considerations, a new
   `iron triangle' of electoral research would seem to take shape, with
   partisanship, leader evaluations and the vote tight to each other by a
   strong link of reciprocal causation. Making use of pre-/post-election
   surveys from Britain and Italy, the empirical analysis provides evidence
   for a strong effect of past behavior on political attitudes. However,
   past behavior seems to exert its effect mainly on partisan attitudes,
   whereas party leader evaluations appear only slightly affected. The
   results point to the considerably weakened role of partisanship as
   attitudinal anchor of vote choice. Leader evaluations, on},

Abstract = {Using data from the 2013 Australian Election Study, this article
   investigates voting patterns among Australian voters from
   non-English-speaking backgrounds (NESB). It reveals that a valence
   politics model - comparing images of the two major parties and their
   leaders, partisan attachments, and judgements about party performance on
   economic issues - outperforms rival models. That is, it provides a
   powerful explanation of the decisions NESB voters made. In deciding
   between competing parties in the 2013 election, NESB voters resembled
   Australian voters who emigrated from English-speaking backgrounds and
   Australian-born voters. The findings of this article offer new insights
   into electoral research in Australia, indicating that previous studies
   have underestimated the important role of the valence politics model in
   explaining voting patterns among Australian voters. The article also
   provides plausible explanations for the convergence between various
   cohorts of voters in the 2013 election.},

Abstract = {It is easier for voters to make informed electoral choices when parties
   talk about the same issues. Yet, parties may decide against such ``issue
   engagement.{''} We hypothesize that issue engagement between parties is
   more likely (a) when the similarity of their policy positions means that
   both parties have clear electoral incentives to talk about the same
   topics and (b) when parties face few organizational constraints in terms
   of campaign resources. Our empirical analysis of 2453 press releases by
   Austrian parties shows that ideological proximity and party resources
   affect the level of issue engagement. These findings suggest that issue
   engagement is less likely precisely where it is needed most, which has
   important implications for understanding the democratic quality of
   election campaigns.},

Abstract = {This paper examines under what conditions it is justifiable that the
   government takes into account the demands of protesters and whether the
   terms of procedural-equality in protest participation were met in the
   `Pots and Pans' protests in Iceland in 2008-09. The protests were
   triggered by a financial melt-down in Iceland and did not come to an end
   until almost all the main demands of the protesters had been met. The
   main conclusion is that due to the seriousness of the issues which
   triggered the protests and that those issues were of national concern,
   together with the large numbers of protesters and wide support for their
   demands as well as extensive public discussion about the issues of the
   protests, they were a prime example of a situation when the authorities
   should consider taking the demands of protesters into account.
   Furthermore, in this paper it is established that giving in to the
   demands of the protesters was within the terms of procedural-equality
   between the protesters and those who did not participate - adding to the
   justification that, in this case, it was justifiable to defer to the
   protesters' demands.},

Abstract = {Previous research in political methodology argues that researchers do
   not need to include a product term in a logistic regression model to
   test for interaction if they suspect interaction due to compression
   alone. I disagree with this claim and offer analytical arguments and
   simulation evidence that when researchers incorrectly theorize
   interaction due to compression, models without a product term bias the
   researcher, sometimes heavily, toward finding interaction. However,
   simulation studies also show that models with a product term fit a broad
   range of non-interactive relationships surprisingly well, enabling
   analysts to remove most of the bias toward finding interaction by simply
   including a product term.},

Abstract = {Among the flurry of legislative reforms achieved by Lyndon Johnson, few
   have proven more transformative than the Immigration and Nationality Act
   of 1965 (INA). Hailed at its recent fiftieth anniversary as one of the
   Great Society's egalitarian triumphs, few observers realize how
   reluctant LBJ was to champion the measure in the first place or how
   close it came to defeat in Congress. Saved by difficult compromises, the
   INA ultimately supplanted racist national origins quotas with a
   competing set of immigration opportunities and restrictions. The result
   was a contradictory law that recast the U.S. demographic landscape in
   spite of itself.},

Abstract = {Can human rights institutions influence individual behavior? This
   article tests the ground level effectiveness of two strategies that aim
   to eliminate discrimination: a powerful, top-down combination of
   incentives and norm promotion and a bottom-up NGO-based effort. The
   study uses a hard case, that of discrimination against the Roma
   (commonly known by the disfavored term ``Gypsies{''}), spans three
   towns, Murska Sobota and Novo mesto in Slovenia and Cakovec in Croatia,
   and includes altogether 606 subjects. Levels of discrimination are
   estimated via trust games played with money, which are particularly
   appropriate because the Roma are widely stereotyped as cheaters and
   thieves. The findings suggest that the EU accession process, widely
   regarded as a strong incentive-based and norm promoting rights change
   mechanism, may not substantially reduce discrimination on the ground.
   Instead, they suggest that ground level organizing aimed at improving
   relations between Roma and non-Roma helps reduce discrimination.},

Abstract = {The recent expansion of social protection in the Global South has
   focused on practice (the how) and not on principles (the why). The
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) endorse social protection as a
   means of addressing both poverty and inequality. In this article, which
   contributes to the Special Issue on The principles and practice of
   social protection', we focus on the principles that (often implicitly)
   underlie four types of social protection responses to poverty and
   inequality. The analysis of moral, economic, political and social
   arguments shows a convergence on the need to alleviate poverty, but the
   principled agreement to tackle inequality is weaker as it requires a
   broader mandate and more extensive state intervention. Regardless of
   strong moral/social arguments, dominant economic/political arguments are
   less inclined to accept the type of social protection required to
   address inequalities.},

Abstract = {Following the approach of the innovation system, the article aims to
   contribute to characterize the innovation process in the health area. It
   was analyzed interactions among actors of the health system in Rio
   Grande do Sul, Brazil. The study was based on a set of secondary and
   primary data and is characterized as an exploratory empirical study.
   Primary data were collected through questionnaires and face-to-face
   interviews. Secondary data were obtained from the Directory of Research
   Groups of the National Council for Scientific and Technological
   Development, Brazil, and were used to build interactions networks. The
   analysis has shown that although the recognized presence in the local
   health system of a number of organizations, interactions among the
   various subsystems -services, teaching and research, and industrial- are
   rare. Among the actors who stood out as central players in the network
   are: a university hospital, traditional research universities and a
   various types and sizes of productive sector organizations.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Although the question of whether constitutional rights matter is of
   great theoretical and practical importance, little is known about
   whether constitutional rights impact government behavior. In this
   article, we test the effectiveness of six political rights. We
   hypothesize that a difference exists between organizational rights-most
   notably, the rights to unionize and form political parties-and
   individual rights. Specifically, we suggest that organizational rights
   increase de facto rights protection because they create organizations
   with the incentives and means to protect the underlying right, which
   renders these rights self-enforcing. Such organizations are not
   necessarily present to protect individual rights, which could make
   individual rights less effective. We test our theory using a variety of
   statistical methods on a data set of constitutional rights for 186
   countries. The results support our theory: Organizational rights are
   associated with increased de facto rights protection, while individual
   rights are not.},

Abstract = {Due to the politicization of much policymaking in the European Union
   (EU) and the growing competences of the European Parliament (EP), party
   groups in the EP have become key targets for organized interests. This
   article investigates which party groups in the EP are prioritized by EU
   lobbyists and why. The focus is on two presumed key components of this
   prioritization process, namely power and position. It is expected that
   lobbyists take into account both the extent to which parties align with
   their views and their legislative power. The empirical analysis draws on
   interviews with 143 interest group officials and their lobbying
   expenditures on 78 legislative proposals initiated by the European
   Commission between 2008 and 2010. The analysis suggests that the media
   prominence of party groups in relation to specific issues as well as the
   extent to which interest organizations and party groups adopt opposing
   policy positions considerably shape how party groups in the EP are
   targeted by lobbyists.},

Abstract = {The institutionalization of party politics is supposed to contribute to
   the consolidation of democracies. Analysis of Hungary's democratic
   backsliding shows, however, that this is not necessarily the case. This
   article demonstrates that the combination of populist party strategies,
   polarized party relations, and the inertia of the party system
   constitutes a significant challenge (here labeled populist polarization)
   to the consolidation of liberal democracy. After considering the
   applicability of structuralist and transitologist frameworks to the
   political dynamics in Hungary, the article differentiates the notion of
   populist polarization from similar concepts and argues that populist
   polarization in the region poses a more acute danger to high-quality
   democracy than the much-feared under-institutionalized and fragmented
   configurations of party politics.},

Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Research on mass political behavior relies extensively on ideology
   scales. The majority of political science surveys use a unique, and
   potentially problematic, word to anchor the endpoints of these scales
   ({''}extremely{''}). However, political science has surprisingly little
   evidence on the effects of using this anchor over others. We utilize an
   older, but ignored, survey experiment on the 1989 American National
   Election Study (ANES) Pilot Study to analyze the consequences of the
   choice between using ``very{''} or ``extremely{''} endpoint labels.
   Theoretically, our results illustrate how a seemingly negative question
   anchor helps optimally measure a key concept (ideology) that is
   fundamental to understanding phenomena such as mass polarization.},

Title = {Ensuring consistency across levels? The delegation model of multi-level
   party politics and Spanish framework manifestos},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {452-464},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In multi-level systems, state-wide parties are faced with particular
   challenges. Competing in elections on multiple levels of the polity,
   such parties juggle the desire for national recognizability and the need
   to be responsive to regional particularities. In this paper, I reflect
   on the delegation model of multi-level party politics, which is a
   theoretical perspective of great importance in the literature, arguing
   that the accuracy of the model depends on two critical assumptions.
   Based on these theoretical considerations, I develop the model further
   and apply it to the case of the two main Spanish state-wide parties, the
   Partido Socialista Obrero Espanol (PSOE) and the Partido Popular (PP).
   More specifically, the programmatic positions of their regional branches
   are analyzed, and it is shown that the framework manifestos issued by
   the national party organizations shape these to a large extent. While
   this case is used to illustrate the illuminating potential of the
   extended delegation model, the paper is similarly attentive to the
   limitations of the model and also hints at the implications for our
   conception of democracy in multi-level systems.},

Abstract = {Democratic House members exhibit wide variation in their support for
   free trade, while Republicans are relatively stable in their support.
   What explains these trends? There are two important factors that explain
   trade votes in the House of Representatives. First, we argue that
   ideology is an important influence on members' preferences over a wide
   range of issues, including free trade. Second, free trade directly
   affects labor through its effects on income, employment, and workers'
   rights. We argue that liberals are uniquely susceptible to labor
   concerns, and that their votes are determined in large part by these
   considerations for both electoral and ideological reasons. We analyze
   the 11 most recent trade agreement ratification votes in the House. The
   results show that ideological differences explain the gap in support
   between the parties. Moreover, liberal members are much more sensitive
   to concerns for labor, measured as district unemployment, campaign
   contributions from labor organizations, and trade partners' records of
   worker rights protections, which explains the variation in Democratic
   support across agreements. Taken together, the findings have
   implications for the upcoming vote on the Trans-Pacific Partnership,
   which has already generated debates regarding its effects on workers.},

Abstract = {Discretionary is Chastisement and Punishment that its type and amount
   has not been determined in the law and Fiqh (Islamic law), and is at the
   discretion of ruler, or in more correct word, is at the discretion of
   the judge; Since, according to Article 4 of the Iranian constitution,
   the laws should be originated from Fiqh, arranged discretionary in
   Islamic Penal Code and Fiqh is same in many cases. This article tries to
   investigate discretionary characteristics in the Penal Code and Fiqh;
   and answer to this problem that, prescribed discretionary in law and
   Fiqh, to what extent are aligned and have similar dimensions to
   aforementioned characteristics.},

Abstract = {Research on youth participation in opposition parties under hybrid
   regimes is limited. This article explores and compares the contextual
   factors influencing young people to join opposition parties in the
   hybrid regimes of Hong Kong and Singapore. Based on life history
   interviews with 19 young opposition party members between the ages of 18
   and 29 in both polities, this study identified seven significant
   factors. They are the characteristics of the opposition parties
   themselves, significant political events, politics-related university
   experiences, media influence, voluntary organizations, family influence,
   and politics-related secondary school experiences. This suggests that
   some favorable factors still exist for opposition parties in hybrid
   regimes to recruit young talents. This study also found that although
   most factors are shared by participants of both Hong Kong and Singapore,
   their relative importance and contents can be different, which may
   reflect the different types of hybrid regimes that these two societies
   respectively have.},

   Germany have tried to have his place as actor in the new international
   and global order until the fall of the Wall. First from their
   participation in the different international conflicts and through the
   problems that this meant in the German intern policy and then it was
   important to check their actuals actions and defies on the basis of
   important debates -civil power versus political realism-not only in
   Germany but too on the outside. Although from the economic point of view
   is the strongest country in Europe and his political realism increases,
   is not like the others European powers precisely for his role in the two
   world wars, the nacionalsocialist dictatorship and the holocaust, and
   till today Germany must be considered, a special great power in the
   world scenery.},

Abstract = {Voters are reluctant to sanction representatives for individual
   misconduct if they have to balance candidate-level and party-level
   factors in their choice, but this trade-off is affected by the electoral
   system. Our general theoretical model explains why individual
   accountability can empirically occur in single-member district (SMD)
   systems but is expected under less restrictive conditions using
   open-list proportional representation (OLPR). The latter not only
   decouples party and candidate choice but also makes seat allocation more
   vote elastic. For a thorough empirical test of our argument, we draw on
   real-world evidence from state-level elections in Bavaria, Germany,
   which are held under an unusual mixed-member system. Exploiting a recent
   public scandal involving one-third of representatives, we examine how
   electoral punishment of the same candidates by the same voters differs
   across electoral rules. Drawing on difference-in-differences as well as
   matching/regression estimators, we show that electoral punishment is
   substantially larger under OLPR than under SMD systems.},

Abstract = {Frente para la Victoria, the political force that governs Argentina
   since 2003 to today, arose as a political force in 1998 in the Santa
   Cruz province, from the creation of the motto ``Frente para la Victoria
   Santacrucena{''}. The tenure of Nestor Kirchner in the Rio Gallegos
   (capital of the province) intendancy is usually pointed as the main
   precedent in the making of said motto. This article goes further back to
   showcase the political experience of the main political leaders from the
   organization in question in Ateneo Juan Domingo Peron between 1981 and
   1987, before entering the municipal state structure. In contrast with
   previous studies which estate that parties are shape in the locus of
   state structures, this article demonstrates how the core political
   conceptions of kichnerism about how it must operate and build it self
   into an organization, the features of its political identity -its
   militant character-and its pragmatic political ideology have an origin
   before its experience of state management. The sources for this writing
   were semi-structured interviews, magazines and local newspapers, diaries
   of parliamentary sessions, among others.},

Abstract = {Why do so many security policies fail in Latin America? This article
   shows that it is difficult to uproot criminality because it is an
   inherent part of the development of both states and democratic regimes.
   More specifically, it is part of the three main networks of security
   providers: the executive branch; the criminal justice system; and the
   sector of armed non-state entities. Relations within and between these
   three networks reflect their own interests and powers rather than public
   security, undermining policy from the beginning. This article will apply
   this analytical framework to two principal dimensions of public security
   in Latin America. One is of illegally trafficked goods, such as
   narcotics; the specific case study here is of the trafficking of
   firearms. The second dimension is the set of security policies in a
   country, which range from iron fist crackdowns to community policing.
   The case study is Honduras, which has endured nearly every security
   problem that afflicts the region, responding with policies that failed
   for 15 years until they began to shift attention toward the networks of
   criminality that were obstructing them.},

Abstract = {The collapse of USSR and the independence of the remaining republics
   from it lead to special geo-politic and geo-strategic changes across the
   northern borders of Iran. The presence of the influence of regional and
   trans-regional players in Caucasus that first try to omit Iran or limit
   the role and presence of Iran in the region and second, have created new
   sources of threat for Iran in this region has affected the foreign
   policy of Iran to a significant extent. Given the fact that Caucasus can
   be the origin of various crises and events such as the separatism,
   nationalism, and ethnic tension that given the presence of powers such
   as America and Israel in this region and because of ethnic nexuses can
   endanger the national security of Iran and Iran needs to have control
   over the regional entrance gateways to preserve and provide national
   security and interaction with future challenges. One of the practical
   approaches in this respect is the fulfillment of the presence and
   influence of Iran in security issues located among these countries which
   can reduce the possibility of leaving negative influences of such crises
   on the national security of our country.},

   means?},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Pages = {678-698},
Month = {JUN 6},
Abstract = {Is Belarus an enviable constant in international relations: a maverick,
   isolated from the West and inseparable from the East? On the surface,
   there seems to be business as usual: Lukashenko's regime remains
   unchallenged; Belarus' relations with the European Union - spasmodic at
   best; while its absorption into Russia's Eurasian project continues
   apace. Yet, some critical disjunctures - manifested in government tacit
   resistance to Russia's influence, and more instructively, in people's
   growing affinity with Europe - may indicate a sea-change transformation
   in the very fabric of society. This article, utilizing extensive and
   subject-focused research, conducted in the country between 2009 and
   2013, examines the nature and causalities of the occurring change. It
   argues that democracy promotion, in Belarus' case, may work better when
   depoliticized and inculcated, through norms, regulations, and practices
   of international order, into the daily lives of individuals. Through its
   continued technocratic, inclusive, and sector-level engagement, European
   Union governance, even under the conditions of limited bilateral
   dialogue, have succeeded in fostering much-needed space for reciprocal
   learning and critical reasoning, which may have far greater
   transformative potential than manufacturing a single collective will for
   democracy building.},

Abstract = {The Eastern Mediterranean has been blessed with a number of major gas
   discoveries over the last few years, and it is attracting considerable
   interest from international oil and gas companies. These gas discoveries
   have raised expectations significantly and will have a major impact on
   the region, albeit often overstated. Globally, however, low gas prices
   are hindering their development. Regional markets may be more conducive,
   but these present challenges as well. In the Eastern Mediterranean,
   Egypt is a hotbed of activity in terms of hydrocarbons. Rapid
   developments in Egypt's natural gas projects, and its progress towards
   selfsufficiency, are impacting prospects for Cyprus and Israel to export
   their gas to Egypt and Europe. Not only is this commercially
   challenging, but the markets for it may no longer be available. However,
   rapid developments in the region are also opening up other opportunities
   for Israel and Cyprus, which are addressed in this article.},

Volume = {44},

Abstract = {Measuring the effect strategic choices have on electoral outcomes is
   problematic, because this requires an assessment of the outcome under a
   counterfactual that is not observed. To overcome this problem, we extend
   the synthetic control approach for causal inference to circumstances
   with multiple treated cases and use it to estimate the effect of
   vice-presidential candidates on their home states' vote. Existing
   research has concluded that vice-presidential candidates have little
   effect on the outcome of elections in their home states. However, our
   results from elections spanning 1884-2012 suggest that vice-presidential
   candidates increase their tickets' performance in their home states by
   2.67 percentage points on averageconsiderably higher than previous
   studies have found. In addition, our results suggest that the
   vice-presidential home state advantage (HSA) could have swung four
   presidential elections since 1960, if presidential candidates had chosen
   running mates from strategically optimal states.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the virtues of gold open access (OA) from the
   perspective of its impact on social science scholarly associations and
   their members. OA has clear and obvious virtues, including
   redistribution downward and outward of research findings. But it also
   has the potential for upward redistribution or narrowing of the realm of
   publication, which this author finds troubling. A central question is
   who will cover article processing charges. The article identifies five
   potential sources of the necessary funds or ways to reduce the funds
   that are necessary, and discusses problems with each in terms of likely
   gainers and losers. It also identifies two potential substantive
   concerns about the kinds of social science scholarship most amenable to
   OA. It concludes by observing that, as is often the case, an apparently
   narrow technological innovation opens large issues - organizationally,
   substantively, and even morally.},

Journal = {PRESIDENTIAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Pages = {335-364},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The state of the national economy is known to be of fundamental
   consequence for presidential fortunes, which implies that citizens (1)
   believe presidents exert substantial control over the national economy
   and, consequently, (2) hold presidents accountable for economic
   conditions. Yet the ability of presidents to control the national
   economy is highly constrained. Thus, we know relatively little about how
   citizens come to perceive the presidency as being so responsible for
   economic outcomes. Using a survey experiment, this study examines
   whether presidential campaigns, and candidates' claims specifically, are
   capable of shaping citizens' perceptions of presidential responsibility
   for the economy. Paradoxically, the results reveal that the public is
   inclined to hold presidents accountable for the economy to a
   significantly greater extent than it perceives presidents to actually
   control the economy. Moreover, the results suggest that, by deliberately
   omitting information about the constraints on presidential power over
   the economy, candidates' claims may play an important role in
   perpetuating unrealistic expectations of the president among the general
   public.},

Abstract = {Dreams of Latin American integration are as old as decolonization
   itself, with Simon Bolivar's vision of a league of American republics
   the first of myriad attempts at multilateral engagement. Indeed, the
   Americas region has challenged Europe at least nominally in its attempts
   at regionalism and integration. This article investigates the case of
   the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States ( CELAC), the most
   recent and arguably ambitious attempt at Latin American cooperation. The
   article adopts a ``two-step{''} approach to evaluate the extent to which
   CELAC is able to achieve its goals. Drawing first on neoliberal
   institutionalist research in global governance, it argues that CELAC's
   structural weaknesses and the conflicting interests of its core members
   raise doubts about its ability to accomplish its wide-ranging material
   ambitions, including economic integration and promotion of development.
   It then counters that to focus solely on CELAC's inabilities to
   facilitate material cooperation would be to overlook the other purposes
   and functions of the institution, which are continuing to construct,
   consolidate, and frame a regional identity. Following recent
   constructivist research, CELAC is framed as a vehicle for the
   articulation of a shared Latin American identity; it arises out of a
   continuing and mutually constituting process of region construction and
   recognition.},

Abstract = {Two experiments demonstrate the powerful influence of others' views on
   individual attitudes and attitude expression. Those around us can
   influence our views through persuasion and information exchange, but the
   current research hypothesizes that exposure to alternate views even
   without discussion or exchange of persuasive arguments can also alter
   what attitudes are expressed, and even generate long term shifts in
   attitudes. In an initial study, naive participants were asked their
   attitudes on a range of standard survey items privately, publicly in a
   group with trained confederates, and again privately following the group
   setting. Findings indicate significant attitudinal conformity, which was
   most pronounced when participants were faced with a unanimous (versus
   non-unanimous) group. The group experience continued to influence
   participants' views when they were again asked their views in private. A
   second experiment varied whether participants heard views from live
   confederates or via computer, demonstrating that these effects could not
   be attributed only to issue-relevant information provided by or inferred
   from group members, and that attitude change persisted long after
   participants had left the laboratory. In summary, when people are asked
   their attitudes publicly, they adjust their responses to conform to
   those around them, and this attitude change persists privately, even
   weeks later. Accordingly, such purely social processes of attitude
   change may be every bit as important as more traditional cognitive
   informational processes in understanding where people's political
   attitudes come from, and how they may be changed.},

Abstract = {This article reinterprets the role of Protestantism in the American
   Revolution by examining the unpublished sermon manuscripts of Boston
   Congregationalist minister Samuel Cooper. Even as late as 1775,
   Protestant ministers like Cooper identified Protestantism with liberty
   and Roman Catholicism with tyranny. But these same ministers eagerly
   allied with Catholic France against Protestant Britain in the
   Revolution. Cooper even redeployed colonial war sermons against his new
   British foes in the Revolution. The shifting loyalty of ministers like
   Cooper cannot be explained by mere expediency or secularization of the
   political elite. Rather, the explanation lies in the evolving nature of
   transatlantic Protestant constitutionalismthe ongoing association of
   Protestantism with liberty and the rule of lawover 2 centuries.},

Abstract = {Studies on centralization and its effect on political empowerment among
   racial minorities suggest that decentralized arrangements are optimal
   for increasing empowerment. However, this article argues that the
   ``decentralization-asoptimal{''} perspective ignores the complicated
   history that racial minorities have had with government. To assess the
   effects of centralized government on political empowerment among racial
   minorities, this article examines how state takeovers of local school
   districts have affected black and Latino descriptive representation on
   local school boards. Using an original dataset of state takeovers of
   local school districts from 1989 to 2013, as well as case study analysis
   of Newark, New Jersey, this article shows that centralization affects
   communities differently according to the level of political empowerment
   they have at the time of centralization.},

Abstract = {The efficiency of the control policy of a State has the dual task, to
   provide appropriate incentives in the public and private agents, which
   deter unlawful acts, without neglecting an optimal level of control
   (Polinsky and Shavell 2007), that minimizes the social cost of criminal
   activity. The economic theory of criminal behavior proposes its
   approach, based on criteria of rational choice concerning stable agent
   preferences and incentives to unlawful conduct, disregarding moral
   aspects. The theoretical model of criminal deterrence (Becker 1968)
   lists the possible incentives for agents, regarding the deterrence
   capability of these control systems and the perceived efficiency of its
   operation, thus providing information for predictive analysis on the
   strategic behavior of individuals and establishes parameters for the
   analysis of control policies, from an economic perspective. This paper
   proposes an application of the theoretical model of criminal deterrence
   (Becker 1968) for corruption control, based on the case of the
   Anti-Corruption Commission of Ecuador, in the period 1998-2008.},

Abstract = {Japan-NATO co-operation has come a long way from the initial political

   counter-piracy operation in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean which
   has been critical to the development of a more robust form of military
   interaction and has set the foundations for an enhanced partnership. He
   explains why maritime security can continue to play a central role in
   driving co-operation forward, notwithstanding the need for both actors

Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {214-230},

Abstract = {Seven Latin American countries - Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras,
   Mexico, Nicaragua, and Panama - have recently shifted from quota laws to
   parity regimes. This paper offers the first scholarly examination of the
   discourses underlying this parity shift, exploring how proponents frame
   and justify the measure in these seven cases. I find that Latin
   America's parity advocates appeal to women's presence in the population
   and to the equality of outcomes. In doing so, they argue that gender
   balance constitutes a prerequisite of the democratic state. This framing
   is further legitimated by court decisions validating the
   constitutionality of affirmative action. In becoming widely shared,
   these discourses should continue to influence parity innovations across
   Latin America.},

Abstract = {This article describes how partisan actors during the Obama years have
   escalated polarization by transforming policy disputes into
   constitutional contests over the ground rules of the federal
   system-contests, moreover, in which one bloc of politically like-minded
   states opposes another. The article examines in particular how
   Republicans have supported strong claims of state sovereignty, and in
   some cases resurrected the antebellum doctrine of nullification, to deny
   to either Congress or the executive branch the authority to reform state
   health care markets or to limit states' emissions of greenhouse gases.
   Democrats have reinforced the partisan divide by declining to debate the
   constitutionality of their policies, instead invoking supposedly settled
   judicial precedent; and by enabling President Obama to create new
   federal policy through direct negotiation with like-minded states, thus
   circumventing congressional obstruction. Ironically, both parties appear
   willing to shrink the power and authority of an already diminished
   Congress, a development with unsettling implications for the future.},

Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {As part of recent efforts to advance participatory policymaking, there
   is increased collaboration between government and women's groups
   creating, in principle, deliberative mini-publics'. While there is
   substantial literature debating the merits of mini-publics, their
   longer-term influence on macro-political' environments is still
   unfolding. This article examines the particular case of a successful
   collaboration between the New Zealand government and the sexual abuse
   sector (represented by Te Ohaakii a Hine - National Network Ending
   Sexual Violence Together or TOAH-NNEST) in the specially commissioned
   Taskforce for Action on Sexual Violence, which ran from 2007 to 2009 to
   evaluate the processes and politics of engagement. Drawing on interviews
   and documentary evidence, the article maps the oscillating nature of
   engagement for TOAH-NNEST, and the gains and losses in partnering with
   successive governments since its inception in 2006. The analysis in this
   article identifies the factors that led to the success of the
   mini-public'/Taskforce, and those that disabled the impacts of the
   successful collaboration at the macro-political level. The article
   concludes with a discussion about the challenges of engagement for
   community groups in dynamic political and policy contexts.},

Abstract = {Duverger's Law suggests that two parties will dominate under
   first-past-the-post (FPTP) within an electoral district, but the law
   does not necessarily establish two-party competition at the national
   level. United States is unique among FPTP countries in having the only
   durable and nearly pure, two-party system. Following this observation,
   we answer two questions. First, what contributes to the same two parties
   competing in districts all across the country and at different levels of
   office? Second, why is the US two-party system so durable over time,
   dominated by the same two parties? That is, Why two parties? As an
   answer, we propose the APP: ambition, the presidency, and policy. The
   presidency with its national electorate and electoral rules that favor
   two-party competition establishes two national major parties, which
   frames the opportunity structure that influences party affiliation
   decisions of ambitious politicians running for lower offices. Control
   over the policy agenda helps reinforce the continuation of a particular
   two-party system in equilibrium by blocking third parties through
   divergence on the main issue dimension and the suppression of latent
   issue dimensions that could benefit new parties. The confluence of the
   three factors explains why the United States is so uniquely a durable
   two-party system.},

Abstract = {While significant attention has been paid to the levels of
   representation of women in both the Westminster Parliament and the
   Scottish Parliament, much less consideration has been given to the
   position within local government. This article addresses that deficit
   for Scotland. It shows that for twenty-five years following the
   reorganisation of local government in Scotland in 1974 there was a slow
   but relatively steady increase in the numbers of female candidates and
   councillors, although more recently this appears to have plateaued
   somewhat, together with a similar increase in the number of women
   councillors taking up more senior roles in Scotland's councils. The
   article analyses the representation of women in Scottish local
   government over the period from 1974 to 2012 against the backdrop of
   significant change in Scotland, including a further restructuring of
   local government and the introduction of the Single Transferable Vote
   for council elections, the creation of the Scottish Parliament, the rise
   of the SNP and the decline of the Conservative Party.},

Abstract = {The Second Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Summit held in December
   2015 marked the significance and extent to which China's relationship
   with Africa is changing. China's tripling of its financing commitment to
   US\$60 billion signalled its confidence in the economic transformation
   prospects of the African continent. The changing Sino-Africa
   relationship is underpinned by a shift towards a more balanced
   partnership that recognises Africa's socio-economic and political
   priorities, beyond the demand for its natural resources.
   This paper seeks to help unpack the different dimensions of the links
   between Africa and China including the ``untold story{''} of the
   relationship. A story about the significant number of Africans who live
   in or frequently visit China; and the increasing flow of African
   investiments and tourists into China. Sino-Africa relations have evolved
   to the extent that African countries are taking a more assertive role
   when it comes to investment and signing trade deals, ensuring that their
   interests are protected.},

Abstract = {Does grassroots party activity win parties votes? The effect of party
   organization on performance is one of the most enduring debates about
   political parties. The conventional wisdom regarding the growing
   irrelevance of grassroots activity in the age of television has been
   increasingly challenged by studies of constituency parties' efforts to
   mobilize likely supporters on election day. Few studies, however, have
   looked at the electoral impact of grassroots activity outside plurality
   systems. In particular, we present a most intriguing case study - one
   where voting is compulsory and parties' efforts at mobilization likely
   superfluous. Using new and detailed data on grassroots party activity in
   Flanders, we demonstrate that grassroots activity has a positive and
   significant effect on parties' vote share in the 2012 local elections,
   even after controlling for national tides and performance in the
   previous election. Alternative modelling strategies and
   operationalizations are testament to the robustness of these findings.},

Abstract = {This article engages with the perennial matter of the relationship
   between ideas and interests in British party politics, in particular
   that relationship within Conservative and Unionist politics. After a
   preliminary consideration of the contemporary understanding of ideology
   as complex and fluid rather than fixed and settled, the article examines
   a way of capturing paradoxical aspects of ideological thinking-that it
   is self-chosen or the result of a changing perspective and yet also
   apparently natural or in Conservative terms, `common sense'. It does so
   by exploring the intellectual lineage of `elective affinity' and
   assesses its value for understanding how political identities not only
   endure but also how those identities change. An attempt is made to give
   some substance to that understanding by viewing through that lens of
   elective affinity the association between Conservatives and Ulster
   Unionists in its historical, ideological and institutional contexts.},

Abstract = {When, how, and under what conditions can individual legislators affect
   presidential appointments? Since the early 1900s, the senatorial norm of
   the blue slip has played a key role in the confirmation process of
   federal district and appeals court judges, and it is an important aspect
   of the individual prerogative that characterizes senatorial behavior
   more broadly. We analyze newly available blue slips, covering the
   historical period 1933-1960. We show that the blue slip functioned in
   this era most often to support and expedite nominations, indicating that
   senators used this device to shape the nominations agenda in this
   period. Additionally, we analyze the factors that contributed to an
   individual senator's decision to support or oppose a nominee, or return
   a blue slip at all, finding that senators were more likely to return
   positive blue slips when the Judiciary Committee chair was not a
   coalition ally. We argue that while blue slips did at times provide an
   early warning for poor nominees, they more often offered a means by
   which senators ensured that their desired nominees were confirmed
   swiftly. The positive role of the blue slip demonstrates that this
   device protected the individual prerogatives of senators, allowing them
   a degree of agenda-setting authority with regard to nominees in the weak
   parties era.},

Abstract = {National pride predicts a wide range of politico-economic outcomes, yet
   what makes individuals proud of their nation is not completely
   understood. We propose and test a theory that an important but thus far
   unexplored determinant of contemporary national pride is the longevity
   of national identity. To measure the longevity of national identity, we
   construct an index based on responses from an original expert survey
   designed to trace the emergence of national identity across the polities
   of Europe and the former Soviet Union. We find that our National
   Identity Longevity Index is statistically significantly positively
   associated with the extent of national pride. The implied effect is
   robust and noteworthy in magnitude. Our results suggest that
   contemporary national pride inter alia reflects deep, historically
   rooted societal conventions which take time to emerge.},

Abstract = {Evaluations of teaching effectiveness rely heavily on student
   evaluations of teaching. However, an accumulating body of evidence shows
   that these evaluations are subject to gender bias. Theories of
   leadership and role incongruity suggest that this bias should be
   especially prominent in large courses. This article examines publicly
   available data from two large political science departments and finds
   that female instructors receive substantively and significantly lower
   ratings than male instructors in large courses. The author discusses the
   implications of apparent gender bias in teaching evaluations for the
   professional success of female faculty. Findings of gender bias in
   evaluations in other fields also hold in political science and are
   particularly problematic in the evaluation of large courses.},

Abstract = {In current world, regarding the daily event occur in human
   communications domain, the process of international problems causes
   blurring the role of governments and this new situation leads to
   evolution in common traditional diplomacy of past centuries. Parallel
   with the communities' evolution, it is evident, new scenarios engender
   in diplomacy and international relations arena which seek the modern
   preferences along methods adoption and modern means like using
   non-governmental players capacity especially NGOs. Regarding the youth
   role-playing in various countries specially developed ones as a
   thinking, work and providing ideas forces in institutions, scientific
   and administrative centers and the YNGOs development process in the
   global system along various programs including welfare and philanthropic
   measures beyond the countries' boundary; and creating active youth
   global network and developing this network in most youth communities
   along influence in philanthropic and universal programs in international
   arena which causes the influence on the minds of different masses of
   people and even governments and international organizations; new
   discourse with the title of youth diplomacy as modern diplomacy is
   created. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate what is the
   role of youth diplomacy in developing philanthropic discourse and
   promoting welfare measures in international system by using NGOs. It
   seems, meanwhile, moving in the way of developing mutual understanding
   among youth in other countries, who has motivation and concerns to
   encounter the spread of war, ethnic conflicts, migration, the spread of
   AIDS, environmental degradation and other similar cases; will be the
   reason of the creation of the effective youth global network in
   countries along governments and YNGOs-orientated by unofficial means
   have the approach of achieving a better future in order to achieve the
   peace and pressure on the governments have the role in promoting
   violence and extremism.},

Title = {The Element of `Access to Information' in Arhus Convention and Act
   Regarding Dissemination and Free Access to Information},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {The free access of all people to information is deemed as the requisite
   and precondition for efficient participation in process of
   decision-making by public authorities where it has been reflected in
   many national and international rules and regulations.
   `The right of access to information that has been formally recognized in
   many countries by virtue of criteria in constitution or articles of
   freedom of information law as a right includes most of the information
   stored by public authorities and consists of environmental information.
   The regulations regarding recognition of right of litigation for
   citizens may also include some regulations that give citizens the right
   of acquisition of essential information.
   Before entry in domain of environmental terminology, the concepts of
   access to information and public participations are assumed as a
   category in political law that has been reflected in democratic
   political regimes under title of `Rights of nation' in constitutions of
   those countries.'
   Access to information etc has been formally recognized in Article 10 of
   Rio Declaration on Environment and Development (1992) at international
   level and it briefly holds: `... Anyone shall totally access to the
   information at disposal of public institutions about environment and.
   the governments shall facilitate public participation by giving
   information to the people. and compensation for loss shall be
   guaranteed.'
   Although access to information and other aforesaid issues are not deemed
   as new elements in Article 10 of Rio Declaration (1992) and they have
   been typically incorporated in some other international documents
   several years before 1992, Aarhus Convention (1998) has explored in
   details of totally triple concepts in Article 10 at regional level and
   it presents specific mechanism for enforcement of regulations in this
   convention.
   UN Economic Commission for Europe. was inaugurated in Aarhus (Denmark)
   on 25th June 1998 and Aarhus Convention. was approved. Iran Islamic
   Parliament also ratified Act regarding Dissemination and Free Access to
   Information on January 25 2009 and it was recognized in compliance with
   expediency of system.
   This article examines and compares Aarhus Convention because of it
   remarkable importance as a model for access to information and its
   executive mechanism for element of access to information in that
   convention and Act regarding Dissemination and Free Access to
   Information so that by means of comparative study on these two documents
   concerning to element of access to information it can give answer to
   this proposed question that if Act regarding Dissemination and Free
   Access to Information may be responsive to public information
   requirements about the environmental subjects in such a way that to
   prepare the ground and possibility for public participation in process
   of environmental decision-making by the public authorities as it
   reflected in Aarhus Convention.
   After review and comparison of information in terms of great constraint
   and banning in presentation of information titled as `confidential' that
   has been reflected and executed, the size and subject of accessible
   information may not meet the requirements of community at the age of
   explosion of information and in the world that has been converted into a
   small village. On the other hand, only Iranian nationals have right to
   access this information and discrimination in nationality is another
   main barrier against public access to information. To remove this
   inadequacy and defect, the upgraded laws should be enacted through
   exploitation from regulations and mechanisms of Aarhus Convention as the
   world pattern. Among them, the confidential (classified) information
   size may be noticeably reduced and the persons will have right of access
   to useful information without discrimination in nationality.},

Abstract = {National parliaments have the potential to serve as transmission belts
   between the European Union (EU) and their citizens. By publicly
   communicating EU issues, they can enhance the visibility, public
   accountability and ultimately the legitimacy of supranational
   governance. Not least since the Eurozone crisis, this task has become
   increasingly important in the ever more politicised context of EU
   integration characterised by public and partisan contestation. Against
   this background, the aim of the article is to investigate the
   communication efforts of national parliaments in EU affairs and, in
   particular, to analyse the impact of the levels of contestation of EU
   issues both within the public and the parliamentary arena on their
   communication activities. In a nutshell, in how far has political
   contestation acted as a catalyst for parliamentary communication of EU
   affairs? Our data on plenary activities in seven EU parliaments from
   2010 to 2013 reveals that political contestation in public opinion has a
   positive impact, while contestation within parliament may hamper
   communication of EU affairs.},

Abstract = {Many Americans think campaign money has a corrupting influence on
   Congress. Yet how they think about money in politics is a relatively
   unexplored topic. This article investigates how the public reasons about
   campaign money and corruption. Our survey experiments demonstrate that
   attitudes about campaign money are structured by partisan interest and
   are also driven by information about sources of campaign money and the
   amount spent (particularly for large independent expenditures made
   possible by Citizens United), the method of delivery, and about what the
   money is spent on. Mass perceptions about corruption of Congress,
   furthermore, may reflect aversion to negative campaigns as well as
   attitudes about campaign financiers having undue influence over
   representatives. These findings not only provide a more nuanced picture
   of attitudes about campaign money but also have consequences for how we
   assess reform proposals relating to money and politics.},

Abstract = {We examine the impact of the current economic crisis on the accuracy of
   responsibility attribution between levels of government within states.
   Using individual-level data from Spain, we show that learning about
   responsibility attribution depends on the saliency of the issue (in our
   study, unemployment) and economic self-interest. The (unintended)
   positive consequence of economic crisis is that citizens are now more
   able to accurately attribute the responsibility for political decisions
   than some years ago. Learning is particularly significant among those
   individuals more affected by the economic crisis.
   Resume Nous analysons l'impact de la crise economique actuelle sur
   l'attribution de la responsabilite aux differents niveaux de
   gouvernements dans des Etats. Selon des donnees individuelles d'enquetes
   espagnoles, nous demontrons que l'attribution correcte des
   responsabilites depend de la preponderance du sujet en question (dans
   notre etude, le chomage) et de l'interet economique de chacun. La
   consequence (non intentionelle) de la crise economique est
   qu'aujourd'hui les citoyens sont capables d'attribuer de maniere plus
   precise la responsabilite des decisions politiques qu'il y a quelques
   ans. L'apprentissage est encore plus grand entre les individus les plus
   touches par la crise economique.},

Abstract = {In the beginning of 2007, the Committee on Public Sector
   Responsibilities (CPSR) presented its final report on the future
   organization of the intermediate level of government in Sweden. The
   CPSR, which consisted of representatives from all parties in parliament,
   recommended replacing the existing structure of 20 county councils with
   six to nine regional municipalities. The committee's proposal is
   paradoxical in light of the resistance to regions that exists within the
   country's two largest parties: the Social Democrats and the Moderates.
   The purpose of this article is to describe and explain the CPSR's
   unanimous proposal to establish regional municipalities despite this
   resistance. How was it possible to achieve a unanimous proposal? In
   order to explain this paradox, I use the multi-level party' theoretical
   approach. The empirical study, consisting of a qualitative case study of
   the actions of the Moderates and the Social Democrats on territorial
   policy, supports this theoretical construct. It is evident from the
   empirical record that groups within the parties had different views
   about territorial policy. Within the CPSR, the advocates for regions
   took control, which made a unanimous proposal possible. The research
   findings improve our understanding of party organization in a polity
   characterized by multilevel governance. When the central level delegates
   more power and responsibility to subnational levels, the balance of
   power within parties changes. New regional and local elites arise, which
   makes it possible for a single party to communicate different messages
   on territorial policy depending on which group is in charge within a
   particular arena.},

Abstract = {Following the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the Bush administration relied
   heavily on the state secrets privilege to defend executive actions. When
   Barack Obama entered office, he announced that the privilege had been
   over-used by the Bush administration and offered this as a first
   principle: We must not protect information merely because it reveals the
   violation of a law or embarrassments to the government. Yet the Obama
   administration continued to rely on the privilege to protect litigants
   from challenging abusive, illegal, and unconstitutional actions by the
   Bush administration and applied the privilege to entirely new assertions
   of executive power.},

Abstract = {Long considered a literary master, Nathaniel Hawthorne was also a shrewd
   political thinker, often embedding his insights in seemingly
   nonpolitical works. In The Old Manse, Hawthorne uses an imaginative tour
   of his Concord residence to prompt reflection on the core nature and
   functions of well-built human institutions. After considering the value
   of narrative fiction in gaining a deeper understanding of political
   institutions, I draw out the implications of Hawthorne's essay for
   institution building. Hawthorne's observations are well worth
   considering amid the political turbulence of recent years, for they
   serve as a guide for constructing institutions that can reconcile the
   claims of security and liberty, while also building multiple layers of
   community.},

Abstract = {By employing the theoretical framework of framing, the present paper
   attempts to examine the Icelandic media's coverage of the 2013
   parliamentary election by paying particular attention to coverage of
   public opinion polls and the policies of the political parties, i.e. the
   ``horse-race{''} frame and the issue frame, and to examine media's
   reliance on experts for interpretation of election news. Seven online
   news media, two newspapers, two radio stations and two television
   channels were monitored for 25 days prior to Election Day, i.e. from
   April 2 to April 26, 2013, - resulting in 1377 election news stories.
   The findings show, for example, that 29.8\% of all the election news
   stories had public opinion polls as their primary angle while 12\% of
   the stories were primarily issue-oriented. In addition, the media rely
   on experts for interpretation of the polls; five of the 10 most
   interviewed or quoted sources on public opinion surveys were political
   science experts who were affiliated with universities. Finally, news
   coverage of polls was generally amplified as media outlets had a
   tendency to report on public opinion polls that were commissioned by
   other media.},

Abstract = {Over the past few years, Palestinian children in Occupied East Jerusalem
   (OEJ) have faced high rates of arrest. The article examines violence
   against children during arrest by juxtaposing state official documents
   recording debates and analyses of children's rights with published
   reports by human rights and civil society organizations. The article
   suggests that arrested children in OEJ suffer from three intersecting
   discriminatory regimes: structural discrimination that targets them as
   criminals based on their ethnicity; a lack of assistance as they fall
   under the responsibility of neither the Palestinian nor the Israeli
   socio-legal systems; and limited access to welfare, justice, and
   educational opportunities. The article concludes by suggesting that
   Palestinian children face severe structural violence that amounts to
   state-hate criminality.},

Abstract = {When do terrorist campaigns end? Why do terrorist groups decline? What
   are the causes of terrorist disbandment? What are the explanatory
   factors that account for individual and collective disengagement? This
   paper analyzes the case of Terra Lliure, a Catalan terrorist group
   active between 1979 and 1995, in order to identify the independent
   variables that determine the success or failure of terrorist groups. In
   accordance to the literature on political violence, the paper develops a
   multi-level argument that distinguishes three explanatory variables: (1)
   counter-terrorism; (2) organizational dynamics; and (3) individual
   factors. The article concludes that a counter-terrorist policy (macro
   level) based on increasing the cost of participation in an insurgent
   group is most successful when it coincides with organizational
   fragmentation (meso level) and individual burnout (micro level).},

Abstract = {Why is the difference in redistribution preferences between the rich and
   the poor high in some countries and low in others? In this article, we
   argue that it has a lot to do with the rich and very little to do with
   the poor. We contend that while there is a general relative income
   effect on redistribution preferences, the preferences of the rich are
   highly dependent on the macrolevel of inequality. The reason for this
   effect is not related to immediate tax and transfer considerations but
   to a negative externality of inequality: crime. We will show that the
   rich in more unequal regions in Western Europe are more supportive of
   redistribution than the rich in more equal regions because of their
   concern with crime. In making these distinctions between the poor and
   the rich, the arguments in this article challenge some influential
   approaches to the politics of inequality.},

Abstract = {While electoral research usually distinguishes voters from abstainers,
   in the Swiss direct democratic context one needs to take into account a
   third category of citizens, the selective voters, who decide anew at
   each vote whether they will participate or not. This article offers an
   investigation of this common but under-researched form of participation.
   To that end, we take advantage of a unique data-set linking official
   turnout data with survey data. Our results show that selective voters
   constitute the bulk of the electorate. While they form a heterogeneous
   group in terms of socio-demographic characteristics, selective voters
   lean more towards abstainers than towards permanent voters with respect
   to political variables. We argue that this is not necessarily bad news
   in terms of democratic theory.},

Volume = {16},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {44-77},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Studies of the diffusion of policies tend to focus on innovations that
   successfully spread across governments. Implicit in such diffusion is
   the abandonment of the previous policy. Yet little is known about
   whether governments abandon policies that have failed elsewhere, as
   would be consistent with states acting as policy laboratories not only
   for policy successes but also for failures. This article focuses on the
   possible abandonment of failing welfare-to-work policies in the
   formative years (1997-2002) of the Temporary Assistance for Needy
   Families (TANF) program across the 50 U.S. states. Using a dyad-based
   event history analysis, I find that, if both states in a pairing have a
   policy and one state's policy fails (in employing welfare recipients,
   reducing welfare rolls, or reducing overall poverty rates), then the
   other state is much more likely to abandon that failing policy.
   Moreover, such learning from the other state's experience is more common
   when the states are ideologically similar to one another and when the
   legislature in the potentially learning state is more professional.},

Abstract = {This article explores the concept of vocation in the political theory of
   John Dewey. Primarily relying on his political thought from the years
   prior to World War I, it analyzes in particular his early books and
   periodical essays, along with his lectures to teachers' organizations,
   talks before groups of political activists, and seminars at the
   University of Chicago from this time. Using these early and formative
   sources, it argues that Dewey's theory of democracy can rightly be
   understood as being centered on vocation's role in society. In making
   this case, the article focuses on this concept, examining its relation
   to work, its role in democratic education, and its meaning for the
   professions, including experts in business and government. The essay
   concludes by discussing how Dewey's understanding of vocation can help
   us reconsider the continuing political challenges and possibilities
   posed by the contemporary American experience of work.},

Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Scholars debate the relative strength of economic and
   `socio-psychological' sources of anti-immigrant sentiment. However, the
   literature often fails to distinguish legal from illegal immigration and
   therefore overlooks a major instance in which this debate is moot. To
   address this issue, we develop a theory that recognizes two different
   modes of evaluating immigrants: ``attribute-based'' judgment, in which
   respondents weigh immigrants' desirability based on individual
   characteristics-human capital, race, language ability, and so on-and
   ``categorical'' judgment, which disregards these altogether. Categorical
   judgments arise when a policy issue triggers blanket considerations of
   justice or principle that obviate considerations about putative
   beneficiaries' individual merits, instead evoking overriding beliefs
   about the desirability of the policy as a whole or casting the entire
   category as uniformly deserving or undeserving. We use experimental
   evidence from two national surveys to show that the principal
   distinction between attitudes toward legal and illegal immigration is
   not in the relative weight of immigrants' attributes but the much
   greater prevalence of categorical assessments of illegal immigration
   policy, much of it rooted in rigid moralistic convictions about the
   importance of strict adherence to rules and laws.},

Volume = {9},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Positioning minority concerns within a power-sharing mechanism is a key
   issue that has been influential in Sri Lanka's modern state-building
   process experimented from the later part of the colonial period.
   Throughout the post-independent era, most state-building projects were
   critically debated with regard to sharing political autonomy between the
   majority Sinhalese and the minorities. This study attempts to locate the
   claims and concerns of minorities seeking political autonomy in Sri
   Lanka's state-building and power-sharing discourse. The study found that
   the state-building process in Sri Lanka has always been a struggle
   between establishing a majoritarian-ethno-nationalist hegemonic state
   system and preserving the right of minority ethnic groups to political
   power-sharing. The study further found that (a) insufficient emphasis
   given towards understanding power-sharing and federalism as a means to
   accommodate diverse interests and rights, including the political
   autonomy rights of minorities, (b) the opportunistic politics of
   opposition parties, and (c) the ethno-nationalist agenda of the majority
   Sinhalese were the major factors that have induced to undermine the
   minorities' claims for political autonomy. The ultimate result of this
   is the continuous struggles by minorities to situate their political
   autonomy demands within Sri Lanka's state-building and power-sharing
   discourse.},

Abstract = {Since the 1990s Sally Haslanger has argued that part of the work of
   philosophers is not to describe a concept like women but to change it in
   order to help bring about a fairer society. Since, she argues, the
   definitions of such concepts should be formulated in accordance with an
   epistemological framework that foregrounds their normative role, the
   work of feminists is crucial in identifying the legitimate values that
   such concepts ought to serve and thus what their meanings should be.
   This article evaluates Haslanger's proposal that our values are best
   served by reducing the concept woman to a person subordinated on the
   grounds of her sex' by contrasting it with an alternative that draws on
   Richard Rorty's early work on the mind-body problem. According to this,
   the concept women should be subject not to reduction but to elimination,
   the consequence being that there never were any women.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {10-25},

Abstract = {Human rights are currently either seen in a morally exaggerated way as
   ``trump cards{''} in political negotiations or they are pruned back to a
   purely juridical level, absorbed into legal instances. In contrast to
   this, the author defends a political conception of human rights that
   overcomes the problems besetting both conceptions, but without having to
   sacrifice their critical, normative content or a realistic role for
   human rights in international politics. The author argues, first, that a
   political conception of human rights assumes that human rights grow out
   of concrete experiences of injustice and are the product of political
   struggles. Human rights are, second, placeholders for the public
   thematization of oppression, humiliation, marginalization, and
   despotism. At the same time, human rights as placeholders not only
   provide the foil against which criticism of existing conditions is
   exercised but are also themselves objects of criticism. And, finally,
   the obligations imposed by human rights are not duties of assistance but
   institutional duties to realize the conditions for exercising human
   rights.},

Abstract = {In Northern Ireland there is a constant struggle between competing
   interpretations of historical events, the determination of which serves
   to validate and legitimate views of the present and to meet contemporary

   and transmitted across generations by commemoration and memorialization.
   This article examines how Ulster Loyalist collective memory is

Title = {`Alliance with the Enemy': Why the CDU and the Greens Formed Their First
   Coalition in a Large German Federal State},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {This article seeks to explain the 2013 coalition between the CDU and the
   Greens in the German federal state of Hesse. It applies traditional
   office-seeking and policy-seeking coalition formation theories to the
   case alongside a new explanation underscoring the influence of past
   behaviour on coalition partnership; namely, the negative impact of a
   pre-electoral commitment breach on future coalition formation. The
   results show that pure office-seeking cannot explain the coalition
   outcome. Instead, as the analysis of textual data extracted from
   political parties' manifestos shows, there has been a constant process
   of policy approximation between the CDU and the Greens in Hesse.
   Additionally, we find evidence suggesting that the SPD's breach on their
   promise not to rely on support by the Left Party in 2008 shaped the
   CDU's refusal to coalesce with the SPD in 2013. The findings add to our
   understanding of the interplay between office-seeking and policy-seeking
   motivations as well as the personal enmities of key actors in shaping
   the coalition formation. The study further offers insights into the new
   German coalition option between the Greens and the CDU, which can serve
   as a blueprint at the national level.},

Abstract = {The article is an analysis of previous unconstitutional appeal,
   reintroduced as the Spanish Constitutional Court attribution decades
   after it was repealed, although now restricted exclusively to draft
   Statutes of autonomy or amendments thereto. The main reason for its
   restoration (the referendum of the Statutes approved by way of art.
   151); indistinction of the Statutes of autonomy as an object thereof;
   maintain consistency of its optional character and not turn it into an
   imperative procedure; non-extendible deadline for sentencing; and
   relative skepticism that the previous unconstitutional appeal serves to
   achieve what is assumed that the legislature pursues the same time, it
   is the essential aspects addressed in the work.},

Abstract = {Mark Pennington argues political systems should be decentralized in
   order to facilitate experimental learning about distributive justice.
   Pointing out the problems with Pennington's Hayekian formulation, I
   reframe his argument as an extension of the Millian idea of
   ``experiments in living.{''} However, the experimental case for
   decentralization is limited in several ways. Even if decentralization
   improves our knowledge about justice, it impedes the actual
   implementation of all conceptions of justice other than libertarianism.
   I conclude by arguing for the compatibility of egalitarian
   redistribution with the epistemic virtues of markets pointed out by
   Hayek.},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Recently started the new millennium, the West is witness a conflict
   between two ideologies that converge to use Islam as a weapon of choice
   with which declared opponents. To Islamophobia, that joins large sectors
   of the Western population and whose strategy involves systematically
   revile the Islamic civilization, with the purpose of ratting as Muslim
   enemies to men and women who reside in Western societies, opposes the
   Western phobia which is monopolized by native radical ideologies of the
   Islamic world. Identified these two philosophies, the aim of this
   research pursues the separately analysis from both to come to conclude
   as necessary the alteration of the foundations that are supporting, to
   avoid being affected as sensitive areas as the personal and social
   safety.
   The methodology, consisting in the exposition of causes that may be
   indicative of the mutual resentment that his followers profess
   themselves, comes to demostrate the impact that those speeches have the
   time to build an enemy; fed, on the one hand, of imaginary fears, the
   rejection of all meaning of multicultural theory of modern societies,
   and therefore, negative cultural concessions to people who do not
   promote them in their societies of origin. The Western phobia, sponsored
   by the Islamist ideology, comes to introduce Islam in the early stages
   as the resource with which to face the Western supremacy, and from there
   to promote violence against those who have usurped their land, and are
   reproaching their lano interest in addressing proposals for modern
   political, social or family. Only proposals of intercultural harmony and
   rejection of the discourses that make Islam a political and military
   ideology may prevent that these ideologies continue gaining accessions.},

Abstract = {The social sciences have long been facing the challenge of establishing
   their own status. One solution to this challenge has been the use of the
   natural sciences as a `model of modernization'. This has led to various
   critical reactions within social sciences. Two have been particularly
   relevant recently. The rhetorical angle that Skinner, McCloskey, and
   Klamer, among others, suggest in their respective disciplines, and the
   rescue of phronesis by Flyvbjerg, who tries to account for absent
   realities in the mathematical models as for example power. My hypothesis
   is that both (the rhetoric angle and the phronetic science) assume and
   complement each other in a propaedeutic way and can be interpreted as a
   narratological tendency that corresponds to a Nietzschean moment.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this chapter is to show that deliberative democracy, in
   historical terms, is a reaction to the crisis of liberal democracy
   legitimacy and, in academia, represents a theoretical solution to
   economic and elitist proposals that homogenized ideas and
   interpretations of democracy during the 20th century. The study is
   conducted through the discussion of a theoretical framework on three
   levels: the theoretical-conceptual construction of democracy in the
   West, the historical genesis of democracy in its representative and
   deliberative versions and, finally, the debate around citizen
   participation in the realization of democracy as a process. This
   document makes a significant contribution to the demystification of
   liberal democracy, introduces a powerful critique of the representative
   model, and defends a position that redefines the concept of political
   participation. In conclusion, the chapter allows to understand that the
   participation of citizens in decision-making is an indicator of the
   maturity of democratic systems, since participatory-deliberative
   democracy is the paradigm of achievement of popular government in
   contemporary regimes.},

Volume = {78},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Based on public opinion data, anti-Americanism of one form or another is
   endemic in the Middle East. This paper examines the extent to which
   hostility generalizes beyond opposition to American foreign policy but
   is unique to the United States. It conducts a field experiment in
   Lebanon that manipulates the putative sponsor of a survey and draws on a
   simple behavioral outcome: do people refuse to be interviewed based on
   who they think is asking the questions? Results show that academic
   sponsors do not affect participation rates but that refusals spike under
   government sponsorship of multiple nationalities-behavioral patterns
   which replicate in communities that vary widely in their a priori levels
   of hostility to the United States. Ironically, systematic opt-outs by
   political opponents make people in the government conditions appear more
   rather than less supportive of US-favored policies compared to their
   peers in the other treatment groups.},

Abstract = {As well as telecommunications, the French system of Higher Education and
   Research (HIR) is deeply restructured from the Pact of Bologna (1999).
   In the name of a perpetual modernization of public services and a policy
   of economic austerity, the HIR was dismantled and rebuilt in a record
   time. The reforms initiated in 2005 with a policy of drastic decrease in
   teaching positions and senior researchers have a number of effects on
   the working conditions and employment, and then on the homo academicus.
   Reorganizations induced by these reforms were, and still are, synonym
   for all academic staff of increasing of their homework and constant
   intensification of their workload, that phenomenon is also shown by
   Spanish or Chilean research. However, with the continuing decline of
   human and economic resources and the proliferation of conflicting
   mandates, academics workers face a chronic inability to do well their
   job. The degradation of their environment as well as the erosion of
   their work ethic, coupled with disappointment and exhaustion, are
   psychosocial risk factors. But the multiplication of forms of suffering
   and warning signs in universities are often invisible in the French
   academic landscape, which, like the rest of the country, is gradually
   ``latinoamericanized{''}.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {121-139},
Abstract = {Building on past and current experiences of populism in Latin America,
   this article makes four arguments. First, whereas populist movements
   seeking power promise to democratize society by challenging the
   legitimacy of exclusionary institutions, populist governments often
   include the excluded at the cost of disfiguring democracy. Second,
   during populist events the meanings of the ambiguous term `the people'
   are disputed. When social movements are weak, and when the institutions
   of liberal democracy are discredited, a populist leader could attempt to
   become the embodiment of the will of the people. Third, even though the
   concept of the people is central to populism, it could be constructed
   differently. It could be imagined as heterogeneous and plural, or as the
   people-as-one, as an entity that shares one identity and interest that
   could be embodied in a leader. Fourth, populism shares with fascism an
   imaginary construction of the people-as-one. Yet differently from
   fascism, which staged extraordinary politics as war against internal and
   external enemies, populists staged their extraordinariness as winning
   popular elections and did not establish dictatorships.},

Abstract = {The 2014 European Parliament (EP) elections were held after a period
   where public opinion about the EU changed significantly. In this paper
   we investigate evaluations of the performance of the European Union, as
   this dimension of EU attitudes is particularly relevant ahead of
   elections. We look at public opinion developments since 2009 and then
   zoom in on the role played by the news media in shaping public opinion
   about EU performance by linking citizens' evaluations across time to the
   news media content they were exposed to. The article relies on original
   multiple wave survey panel data and a systematic media content analysis
   in the Netherlands. It shows how public opinion has changed, how it
   changes around EP elections, and how exposure to media coverage can help
   improve citizens' evaluations of EU performance.},

Abstract = {This article adopts a post-colonial approach to analyse representations
   of ``militants{''} and ``terrorists{''} in the United States' Militant
   Imagery Project (MIP) and the Counterterrorism Calendar. It argues that
   sites such as the MIP and the Calendar produce meanings of
   ``militant{''} and ``terrorist,{''} wherein Muslims/ Arabs are linked
   with violence. At the same time, similar violence committed by
   right-wing extremists, gun owners, and so on are ignored. There is also
   a related assumption about an uncritical, homogeneous audience gazing at
   these images. All of these serve to continually securitise Muslims and
   Arabs in the United States. This article aims to dismantle this
   racialised meaning by illustrating processes through which sites such as
   the MIP and the Calendar link ``militant{''} and ``terrorist{''}
   violence with Muslims and Islam. In doing so, they erase Western-led and
   state-sanctioned violence from representations of ``terrorism.{''} By
   outlining these erasures and silences, this article questions the
   meanings of ``militants{''} and ``terrorists{''} produced and
   communicated by the MIP and the Counterterrorism Calendar. It also
   directs attention to the socio-political and ethical implications of
   selectively labelling only some violence and violent actors as
   ``terrorist.{''}},

Abstract = {The research of the conflict prevention has become intensive after the
   end of the Cold War. In that period, prevention of conflicts becomes
   defined goal of a high number of global and regional organisations
   including the EU. The article focused on the role of the EU in the
   formation of a more general attitude to conflict prevention and its
   redefinition. The effect of the EU as an international actor was given
   not only by its specific form of external activities, but dominantly
   also by its normative effect. The aim of this study was to analyse the
   specific position of the EU as a normative actor vis-a-vis conflict
   prevention paradigm and to find out whether it has any potential to
   co-establish this paradigm. The presented study attempted to identify
   the EU as a power sui generis, where conflict prevention could be
   considered as one of the important characteristic features of
   identification of the EU as a normative power. The theoretical framework
   was also based on the constructivist concept assuming the ability of the
   actor to influence and socially establish the security paradigm. The
   study explored if the EU acts as a normative power in external relations
   and, as a result, if it is able to exercise influence not only in its
   real behaviour but also in relation to redefining the paradigm of the
   approach to conflict prevention as such. Strategic pro-active concept
   based on conflict prevention could be one of the ways in which the EU
   can address the need for greater clarity about its goals and methods as
   a global security actor.},

   Soldiers},
Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},

Pages = {211-236},
Abstract = {This article examines the forcible recruitment of child soldiers by
   rebel organizations through a comparative case study analysis of the
   National Resistance Army and the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda.
   Responses by the international community to the use of children as
   soldiers have continued to be ineffective, and understanding the factors
   that not only motivate a group to forcibly recruit but also the factors
   that dictate their level of forcible recruitment is crucial to
   curtailing the practice. This article investigates the role that
   endowments of a rebel group have on their decision to forcibly recruit
   children as soldiers. Adapting Jeremy Weinstein's theory of the role of
   initial endowments on rebel group's use of force, I explain why rebel
   organizations forcibly recruit children. I suggest that the type of
   endowments matter, specifically the type of endowments accessible to an
   organization during both its formation and throughout its lifespan.
   Endowments thus come in two forms-economic and social and each impacts
   how the group structures control and recruitment practices. The findings
   demonstrate that groups lacking social endowments will be more likely to
   disregard the well-being of local populations and engage in violent
   recruitment tactics. In addition, fluctuations of a group's economic
   endowments will impact the level of forcible recruitment of children
   perpetrated by the group.},

Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {29},
Number = {115},
Pages = {57+},
Abstract = {Patrolling and securing one's neighbourhood is an old practice in South
   Africa, reflecting a widespread insecurity linked to the high prevalence
   of violence in urban areas since the colonial period. This long history
   of citizens' initiatives in the field of policing is reflected in the
   now abundant literature dedicated to vigilantism in South Africa. Too
   often, however, vigilante groups appear as unified and homogeneous. On
   the basis of two life stories and an ethnographic and historical
   investigation on the outskirts of Cape Town, we have adopted a different
   perspective, which emphasizes two points that until now have received
   scant attention in the literature on vigilantism: its feminization and
   its biographical dimensions. The moral careers of women for long
   involved in these groups reveal a series of individual vulnerabilities,
   be it in their personal, family or professional lives. At the same time,
   these individual trajectories emphasize the role of the state in shaping
   citizen initiatives in the field of policing, especially in a context of
   impoverishment and mass unemployment.},

Abstract = {Recent work challenges traditional understandings of the link between
   race and voter turnout, suggesting that there is limited evidence of
   increased minority voting due to co-ethnic representation and
   majority-minority districts. Here I examine 65.3 million registration
   records from 10 states to trace individual-level participation before
   and after the 2012 round of redistricting, testing whether a shift in
   congressional representation, candidacy, and/or district ethnic
   composition affected an individual's decision to participate. Separating
   results for non-Hispanic white, black, Latino, and Asian American
   registrants, I find that individuals change their behavior in response
   to ethnoracial context, with African Americans more likely to vote when
   assigned to majority-black districts with black candidates or
   incumbents. White and Asian registrants also turn out in higher numbers
   when a co-ethnic candidate is on the ballot, but Latinos may be less
   likely to vote in the short term when assigned to majority-Latino
   districts.},

Abstract = {The artice analyzes the literary work, Cancer Ward, by Alexandr
   Solschenizyn, as a parable of the decline of Stalinism. The association
   between literature and criticism needs also an introspection pain of the
   victims. The parable and analogies of a work sometimes hurt the
   political and historical text value.
   Our article attempts to recover the demolishing perception that the
   Russian author has about Stalinism through characters who threaten the
   stability of a system which is a dictatorship. The parable is not only a
   metaphor, but also the realization of a problem and, in the case of
   Stalinism, the evidence of a systematic strategy of neglect and
   exclusion towards the dissident intellectual.},

Abstract = {It presents an essay about the extreme barbarism practiced by
   ethnocentric and fanatical cultural systems. For this purpose is
   referred to as the representative Islamic State or Nazism. It works with
   the hypothesis that the general educational ineffectiveness against this
   kind of barbarism is related to their poor understanding. Your goal is
   to try to define some basics that may be useful for an eventual Pedagogy
   and education against barbarism based on the complexity and
   consciousness for, from them, advance along the path of understanding
   and educational action. As befits trial methodology, the author's
   arguments supported by reasons and precedents sources will be presented.
   Since it is not a review article and by the scarcity of scientific
   papers on education and barbarism from Pedagogy, selection of sources is
   enough to try to meet the study objective. The main contributions of the
   paper are a conceptual contribution of barbarism from a pedagogical
   point of view and a proposal for an education foundation against extreme
   barbarity made from the ``Radical and inclusive approach of the
   training{''} (Herran, 2014a). The study's findings point to an
   educational commitment of all with this huge and permanent challenge,
   since each self, conceptualized as part of the complex phenomenon of
   barbarism observed. The work will be divided into the following parts:
   introduction, reflections on the extreme cultural barbarism and its
   relativity, ordinary ways to combat this barbarism, education as one of
   those ways, some foundations for an education against extreme barbarity
   and some conclusions. This is an epistemological contribution to a
   possible Pedagogy of barbarism, not a pedagogical proposal applied to be
   held in a later work.},

Abstract = {Experiential learning is a growing practice in higher education today.
   Master of Public Administration (MPA) programs use experiential learning
   to expose students to application and reinforcement of academic theories
   and concepts. This most often is accomplished through a required
   internship. This article argues for the addition of service learning
   requirements to MPA curricula. A complementary relationship between
   internship and service learning requirements yields four primary
   benefits: (1) further involvement of pre-service and in-service students
   in experiential-learning activities; (2) additional exposure to
   real-life application of course concepts; (3) better and more targeted
   classroom reinforcement mechanisms; and (4) additional community
   benefit. Complementarity between internship and service learning
   requirements allows the best of each experiential-learning approach to
   augment the other. We contend that this produces better-prepared MPA
   graduates by exposing them to a more diverse set of immersive learning
   opportunities and application scenarios.},

Abstract = {As a critique of neoliberalism, this article considers Marcuse's
   formulations on ``paralysis of criticism{''} presented in his seminal
   text One-Dimensional Man. This is not a pessimistic perspective. Rather,
   the author promotes a social diagnosis on political struggles,
   considering the new challenges of advanced industrial societies to
   radical subjective experiences of emancipation. The article centers
   upon, it is important to note, a frequent question in Marcuse's
   inquiries: How do we think critically in counterrevolutionary times?
   This is a question that mobilizes dialectics to revolutionary trends as
   it expresses an effort to re-think traditional categories of Critical
   Theory in their ``obsolescence.{''} In a world of ``no alternatives,{''}
   obsolescent categories are symptom of its diseases. Such obsolescence
   contrasts immediate relations of status quo with ``radical{''}
   mediations of social forces. It mobilizes criticism in ``catalytic{''}
   processes to emancipate ``centrifugal social forces{''} from below, a
   qualitative leap to social changes able to face counterrevolutionary
   times.},

   theorizes a shared space between these concepts, opening up new ground
   for politics. It provides an illustration of the dynamic of hegemony
   within a community economy through empirical work carried out with
   food-sovereignty collectives in the Asturias region of northern Spain.
   These collectives demonstrate economic practices that foreground our
   communality and interdependence while negotiating the exclusion that
   accompanies all politics. These food sovereignty economies demonstrate
   that when the concept of hegemony is applied at the site of everyday
   politics, new territory is created for enacting a community economy.},

Abstract = {While the political debate on the integration of immigrants has
   traditionally been tied to cultural aspects, ``meritocratic{''}
   arguments have increasingly gained relevance. With the introduction of a
   ``State Secretariat for Integration{''} (2011-2013), Austrian politics
   on immigrant integration have turned into a prototype of this
   reorientation. This article studies the meritocratic approach to
   integration by the Austrian government in a two-stage analysis. Firstly
   it analyses the government's new policy narrative and its relation to
   previous rhetoric on immigrant integration. Secondly it demonstrates, if
   and how this discourse has been translated into policies. It
   demonstrates that the meritocratic approach largely relies on criteria
   derived from other policy areas, most importantly labor market and
   education, whereas its extension to other forms of action remains
   limited and inconclusive. The findings underline the intrinsic
   ambivalences of the meritocratic logic if applied to immigration
   integration policy, yet they also allow for a critical assessment of its
   inclusive and exclusive potential.},

   of Applied Behavioural Therapies},
Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {38-58},
Abstract = {Applied behavioural therapies are widely adopted interventions that have
   become the standard of healthcare and expert knowledge for autistic
   people in Canada. These therapies are methods of individualized
   behavioural modification whereby skills are taught, and socially
   ``undesirable{''} or ``inappropriate{''} behaviour is regulated
   according to expert claims that focus on correction, imitation,
   repetition, reinforcements, and environmental modification. Despite
   their prevalence, these therapies are highly controversial methods
   within autism communities, with mostly non-autistic parents and
   clinicians as their main proponents, and autistic self-activists as
   their critics. The ethnographic research presented will examine the
   culture, training, and knowledge practices of behavioural therapy
   providers in Ontario, to study disciplinary techniques that are used to
   create expert subjects. In order to operate as a technology for
   producing optimal results in the autistic subject, working as a
   behavioural therapist involves multiple techniques such as completing
   intensive exercises consisting of audible and textual surveillance,
   recorded sessions, and intratherapeutic replicability. These techniques
   and exercises often work to discipline expressions of care in accordance
   with a ``psychocentric{''} framework for understanding autism and
   supporting autistic people.},

Abstract = {I propose a lens model for understanding how core identities (ethnic,
   sectarian, racial or national) are affected by past interactions and
   narratives increasing the chances of the outbreak of violent conflict.
   The model can be used to show how core identities are polarized during
   conflict escalation and how they might de-polarize during periods of
   de-escalation and conflict resolution, leading to potential
   transformation of core identities in post-conflict situations. Northern
   Ireland will be used to illustrate the Integrated Relational Identity
   Structure model, showing how conflicting identities have changed, or
   not, as a result of history, the conflict and the peace process.},

Abstract = {Our study contributes to the ongoing debate about women in combat by
   exploring women combatants' experiences of war through interviews with
   women soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces who served as combatants or
   in combat-support roles in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. We proffer
   that the bodily experiences of women combatants disturb conventional
   international relations and hegemonic masculine war metanarratives that
   either abstract or glorify combat. These otherwise silenced narratives
   reveal juxtapositions of feelings of competence and vulnerability and
   shed light on the women's struggle for gender integration in the
   military. We conclude the article with a reflection on the challenges
   facing researchers investigating war and terrorism.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {53},
Number = {3},
Pages = {757-772},
Abstract = {Aristotle, in his Politics, characterized the human being as a social
   animal (zoon politikon) which had the unique ability not only to express
   feelings but also values, through language (ejon logon). These
   principles of sociability have been one of the most important points of
   reference for all subsequent discussions on the social link. This paper
   tries to assess the validity of the philosopher's postulates today, in
   the context of an economically globalized society, but also
   interconnected by social networks. It also aims to outline a
   readjustment of the human figure for which is proposed the denomination
   of zoon elektronikon.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Internal debates continue in China and abroad about the meaning and
   significance of Chinese President Xi Jinping's position on a new Asian
   regional security order. Some observers insist that a strongly worded
   May 2014 speech Xi delivered in Shanghai reflects China's intensified
   determination to exercise an increasingly assertive posture toward the
   United States. Others suspect that such rhetoric is largely designed for
   internal consumption to appeal to nationalist sentiments about the need
   for China to stand up to the United States and take a leadership role in
   the region. Such differences in interpretation are extended to
   discussions about China's attitudes toward the United States' continued
   strategic presence in Asia and about Washington's maintenance of its
   long-standing alliance network there. The truth is that a combination of
   Chinese aspirations for shaping a new regional security architecture
   tempered by the realities and constraints of what China can actually do
   at this point in time must be acknowledged by both Chinese policymakers
   and their foreign counterparts.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},

Pages = {184-205},
Abstract = {This paper provides an argument in favour of federal institutional
   design on the basis that it is more congenial to the preservation and
   promotion of normatively desirable societal diversity than its unitary
   alternative. Seeking inspiration in the work of three of the most
   influential liberal thinkers of the nineteenth century: John Stuart
   Mill; Alexis de Tocqueville; and Lord Acton, I construct a novel case
   for federalism that focuses on the inherent benefits of a
   dual/multi-layered governmental structure. Section one argues for the
   value of diversity, stating that it can both improve the authenticity of
   individually exercised autonomy, and improve the quality of individually
   espoused moral views. Section two considers the potential dangers posed
   by the unitary state to the flourishing of diversity through the
   centralisation of key institutions. Section three shows how the federal
   model sidesteps these pitfalls, and offers a more auspicious environment
   for the cultivation and enjoyment of diversity.},

Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2016},
Number = {51},
Pages = {86+},
Abstract = {This article recommends the term `despoties' for those Eurasian regimes
   combining democratic rhetoric with undemocratic rule. Despotism and
   totalitarian dictatorship differ in the fact the first one does
   guarantee high output without mobilizing the people. Other phenomena,
   however, are more classic, e.g., systems of clientelism and patronage
   wrongly considered as only pre-modern features by theories of
   modernization. The differentiation with democracies is more difficult,
   since despotism is a ``polysemic rule of a new kind{''}. Within
   despoties undemocratic features are combined with democratic ones (like
   formal execution of elections) and highly efficient governance. It is
   argued that a new type of regime is emerging beyond known notions, such
   as `defect' `delegative', or `illiberal' democracy.},

Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2016},
Number = {51},
Pages = {225+},
Abstract = {The article discusses the potential for democratic rule in non-Western
   societies, starting from the oft-claimed inevitable connection between
   liberal constitutionalism and democracy. By unpacking this normative
   connection the article shows that behind this relationship there is a
   culturally specific conception of political order that is limited to the
   West. However, to evaluate the idea of a non-Western democracy we cannot
   presuppose this conception of political order. Instead, through an
   analysis of the political order in Russia and China, the article
   demonstrates that in non-Western societies the political order and the
   system of norms exclusively focus on the individual. This kind of a
   summative order of the political offers different preconditions for
   democracy; in a third step these will be examined as to the practical
   possibilities for non-Western democracy.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to considering soft power as a new form of power
   within the modern political system. The emerging importance of the
   corresponding mechanisms which regulate social development would lead,
   on the one hand, to the growing competition between countries for an
   opportunity to promote their own agendas, and on the other hand, it
   would undermine state monopoly on internal communication and produce new
   risks for sovereignty. Non-state actors who are more flexible and
   responsive to diversified demands of civil society pretend to e capable
   to build an alternative for the contemporary state and world order. One
   of consequences is likeliness of a state to ``mimicry{''} into civil
   society institutions to react early to emerging threats.},

Abstract = {The article applies the model of the clan-state / captured state on the
   case of Azerbaijan. It discusses the types and forms of informal
   political institutions in Azerbaijan and explains restructuring of the
   informal networks that has occurred after Ilham Aliev's arrival to the
   presidential office. The core of the article are several mini case
   studies based mostly on an analysis of local media resources and a
   primary data collected during field researches conducted in 2006-2014.
   The article shows that Azerbaijan's informal political structures based
   on clientelism and endemic corruption have de facto taken over the
   country's formal political scene and using manipulated public tenders
   transfer a large proportion of oil rents to bank accounts of the ruling
   elite.},

Abstract = {The regime of financial market governance in the European Union evolved
   from generic comitology 15 years ago into one of the most specialized
   sectoral regimes today. The initial Lamfalussy reform focused on
   producing better hard law through open and transparent consultations and
   supporting its consistent implementation by delegating soft law powers
   to supervisory committees with independent expert capacity. Under the de
   Larosiere reform, committees were transformed into European Supervisory
   Authorities and their soft law guidelines `hardened' into binding
   technical standards, which later formed the Single Rulebook pillar of
   the banking union. The successive reforms improved the procedural
   effectiveness of rule-making, but it is too early to evaluate their
   effects on implementation because of constant changes. Reforms also made
   the regime of governance more open and transparent and thus potentially
   more inclusive. However, the technical nature of financial regulations
   and the fact that many decisions are made on the global level conspire
   against improvements in the democratic legitimacy. The reforms thus
   shifted power toward expert industry insiders.},

Journal = {POLITIX},

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {This idea of a State drawing upon different social groups and requiring
   predispositions incorporated through primary and secondary socialization
   could seem today an old-fashioned hypothesis as it ignores the levels of
   intermediation between administrative practice and earlier socialization
   of agents. It could make us forget the role played by the
   institutionalization of administrative roles, limited plasticity of
   administrative rules that have to be applied, and the role played by
   Grandes Ecoles in the selection and recruitment of high-ranking civil
   servants. Yet this article deals with this classic question of Sociology
   of State. It argues that we should not consider on one hand social
   groups carrying values and on the other hand a State hiring from among
   groups of agents carrying homogeneous values. This article supports the
   assumption - common in the sociology of work but not applied when one
   comes to analyze the work of civil servants - that the entry into the
   profession (of bureaucrat) is associated with a continuous process of
   socialization that promotes or disqualifies certain previously acquired
   dispositions.},

   Chinese geo-political and geo-economic interests in region. It is based
   on economic balancing concept that explains the linkage between military
   and political interests with economic relations to create great power.
   Because of this, the author support the idea that China is trying to
   occupy the American role over the region in late 20th Century. With this
   new presence China has created a new structure in Latin America with
   regional balancers and also this change in the region has helped China
   to improve its performance in the multipolar system. The theoretical

Abstract = {With the accomplishment of this research, the testimonies and the
   educational experiences during the Francoism in Zujar, placed in the
   northwestern part of the region, in the province of Granada, have been
   known. We analyzed four interviews in depth, using a qualitative
   methodology developing a biographical-narrative study. We obtained
   photos and images of objects of interest on the part of the interviewed
   that complete and complement the construction of the history of life and
   provide us a more complete vision of the object of study. The main
   results show us the difficulties in the education, big situations of
   illiteracy, epochs of shortage, and the precariousness of the
   educational system in Zujar. The intergenerational relations, the
   accomplishment of the interviews, as well as its literary transcription
   they have allowed us to know little by little the forms of life and the
   needs proceeding from an epoch marked by the Dictatorship. We detected
   the big differences, in the education and in the daily life between the
   current and the Francoist Spain. We conclude with the differences in the
   school and in the everyday life between the present time and the
   Francoism Spain. We must say that the construction of gender in that
   epoch was made showing the relationship between women and family,
   highlighting its role as an educator of children, to be the perfect
   woman and educated inside your home... foreground the existence of a
   curriculum aimed at girls, in which school subjects for women on
   household chores were held with the aim of teaching them to embroider,
   sewing... In the same way, the importance of the religion in schools,
   with the need to pray at the entry and exit of the school.},

Abstract = {For decades, Africa lay at the periphery of US security policy.
   Attention to the continent intensified after the 9/11 terrorist attacks
   amid claims that East Africa and the Sahel had become hubs of terrorist
   activity. Despite this shift, US analysts and policymakers continue to
   frame security threats in Africa using a traditional, Cold
   War-influenced paradigm. Commonly used indicators are based on
   mainstream security studies, which provides a narrow view of security.
   Using Critical Security Studies, this article provides a broader and
   more inclusive assessment of security threats in Africa.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},

Volume = {12},

Pages = {266-281},
Abstract = {This article analyses the process by which lay citizens acquire new
   knowledge through participation and, reciprocally, how elected
   officials, civil servants, and associative leaders may learn from lay
   citizens. The aim is to develop a better understanding of the
   relationships and dynamics between these different stakeholders since
   the turn towards participatory democracy. Participatory devices generate
   new dynamics among social movements' actors and the creation of
   knowledge stemming from interactions between participants, who all learn
   from each other. Nevertheless, these mutual forms of learning do not
   necessarily imply the disappearance of power relations and knowledge
   imposition attempts by dominant stakeholders during the debates.},

   dictatorship the PRC's official political discourses operate with
   various special conceptions of ``democracy{''}. However, it would be
   more than misleading to evaluate and judge these debates according to
   the standard definition found in pluralist, liberal democracies. The
   article examines the state philosophy underlying the democracy concept
   used by the fifth generation of Chinese leaders and tries to identify
   divergences/convergences between the fifth and the fourth generation's
   ideas about democracy. The strengthening of deliberative democracy
   accompanied by a recentralization of political power under Xi Jinping
   allows insights into the current reconfiguration of China's governance

Abstract = {Nikolay Oleynikov and Oxana Timofeeva are members of the Saint
   Petersburg-based collective Chto Delat, a group of nondogmatic Marxist
   artists, philosophers, and activists. Members of the group are in
   continuous interdisciplinary dialog. This artwork is an example of the
   circulation of ideas, images, and practices that flow from the members
   of the collective, influencing the singular studies of each artist, and
   back from the singular exercises of each artist, enriching the practices
   of the collective. Combining the images of Oleynikov and a text by
   Timofeeva, the artwork analyzes a collective dimension of spirituality
   that through artistic political practices uncovers a series of
   transformations of animal bodies, addressing the nonhuman aspects of the
   phenomenon of comradeship. In this uncovering, questions of solidarity,
   pain, and utopian community are raised and actualized in the encounter
   between text and image.},

Abstract = {This chapter lays out the outline of the book, an analysis of the
   Republican presidential primary electorate, and reviews the literature
   on presidential nomination campaigns. Using primary exit poll data, the
   authors will profile four factions of the Republican Party: moderates
   and liberals; somewhat conservative voters; very conservative
   evangelicals; and very conservative secular voters. Scholars typically
   focus on momentum and elite influence as key factors in determining the
   nomination. The authors argue that it is also important to understand
   the factions of a political party and their interactions. Candidates
   first aim to become champions of one or more factions, and then attempt
   to build coalitions with other factions in the later stages of the
   nomination process.},

Title = {Contemporary Transformations of the Relations between Politics, Culture

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {53},
Number = {1},
Pages = {29+},
Abstract = {According to Tilly, two laws shaped the process of transformation
   undergone by Western European societies since the Peace of Westphalia
   until the end of the 20th century: their increasing inner homogenisation
   and their growing heterogeneity between them. Cultural inner
   homogenisation affected, first, those ethnic groups living within the
   territories of the said states. The second phase of homogenisation
   impinged on those groups that immigrated after World War II. This
   process followed different models according to the country considered,
   but the 1973 oil crisis revealed their general lack of success. During
   the last quarter of the 20th century and onwards, these European
   societies have been altered by two progressive and contradictory global
   logics: a process of cultural homogenisation at the world level (rather
   than society level) and a process of cultural re-creation led by those
   groups with an immigrant background, who have reacted against their
   integration shortcomings by searching for new sources of social and
   personal esteem in their respective cultural and religious traditions.
   This paper seeks to clarify these processes from a social
   differentiation and political representation theory perspective. The
   latter becomes indispensable, as the said processes have happened in a
   context in which the structure of relations (i.e. communication) between
   civil society and the democratic political sphere have experienced a
   radical crisis. In this way, the complex relations that exist between
   civil society, culture, religion and politics in these Western European
   societies are depicted.},

Abstract = {In times of genetically modified food, globalized production and
   distribution chains, food safety is a major issue in public policy.
   Although industrial actors have traditionally had remarkable influence
   on political decision-making in this area, challenger organizations from
   civil society have gained influence by mobilizing support and shaping
   public discourse on the Internet. The authors' study analyzes online
   issue networks concerning food safety in order to assess the actor
   constellations and coalitions that may serve as an opportunity structure
   for the mobilization of the issue. By comparing the US, the UK, Germany,
   and Switzerland, the authors investigate the differences in policy
   settings between pluralist and corporatist democracies. They find that
   the mobilization structures related to food safety issues are actively
   promoted by the challengers themselves. In countries where challengers
   do not find support within national politics, the challengers' online
   communication refers to mass media as witnesses to legitimize their
   concern in public debates.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between participatory budgeting,
   that is, the allocation of a budget directly by residents rather than
   elected officials, and the rise of neoliberal logics in municipal
   governance. It does so through a case study of the longest participatory
   budgeting project in Canada, the Neighbourhood Support Coalition (NSC)
   in Guelph, Ontario. While participatory budgeting is often posited as a
   deepening of democracy through increased citizen authority,
   neoliberalism is typically interpreted as antithetical to democracy,
   resulting in more centralized control and the marketization of municipal
   governance. I argue that participatory budgeting in Guelph is best
   understood as an adaptation of community groups to neoliberal changes in
   municipal governance, rather than a direct challenge to neoliberal
   policies. In the case of Guelph, when the participatory budgeting
   process began to be perceived as in contravention of the automatization
   and marketization of neighbourhood groups, the participatory budgeting
   process was eliminated in favour of a process that fit better with these
   logics. This work builds on previous research on participatory budgeting
   by both putting participatory budgeting in explicit dialogue with
   neoliberalism, and also temporally extending the narrative of Guelph's
   experience beyond 2009, to capture the decline and eventual
   discontinuation of the participatory budgeting process.},

   AMERICA AFTER 1990},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {167-190},
Abstract = {The mutual relationship between electoral systems and party systems
   belongs to the fundamental issues for political science for recent
   decades. The causality between electoral and party systems anticipated
   in Maurice Duverger's ``laws{''}, published in 1950's, has been
   verified, revised or falsified by many scholars for many times up to the
   present. These fundamentally different and sometimes even contradicting
   results of the scholars testing the impact of electoral engineering on
   party systems (and vice versa) have put a question about direction of
   upcoming inquiries of this matter. Hence, the present study summarizes
   the results, contrast them with each other and critically reflect
   fundamental findings and explanations of the scholars focusing (not
   just) on the linkages between setting of electoral systems and formats
   of party systems (or number of effective political parties
   respectively). In doing so, we focus on Latin America's context which is
   very interesting and useful example from many reasons described bellow.
   On the basis of critical reflection, the study tries to draw possibly
   necessary changes in an approach to this issue, especially in terms of
   (in)dependent variables' change or reformulation, reversing direction of
   the causality, and so on. This study could therefore facilitate further
   and more accurate research of mutual relationship between electoral and
   party systems.},

Abstract = {Austrian political actors have improved the protection of outsiders by
   expanding the coverage of labour rights, social security, and active
   labour market policy spending in the past two decades. The article
   attributes these `solidaristic' traits of Austrian labour market policy
   change to the persistent reliance of weak governments on trade union
   support in the mobilisation of a durable consensus. When governments are
   internally divided and prone to reform deadlocks, they face a powerful
   incentive to share policy-making authority with the social partners.
   Despite a significant decline in power resources, the Austrian trade
   union confederation has therefore remained influential enough to
   compensate outsiders for growing economic uncertainty on a volatile
   labour market. To substantiate this claim empirically, the article draws
   on primary and secondary sources as well as interview evidence with
   policy-making elites.},

Abstract = {The article compares the history of political science (PS) in Chile and
   Uruguay in the 1970s and 1980s. Drawing on research that includes 58
   interviews with Chilean and Uruguayan scholars and a systematic analysis
   of the main academic journals of these countries, it shows that
   important aspects of the Chilean case have not been fully taken into
   account by the literature. While in Uruguay PS was indeed undermined by
   the authoritarian government, in Chile key components of the current
   institutional infrastructure of the discipline were created during, and
   sometimes by, the dictatorship. The contrast between these two PS
   trajectories problematizes the linear narrative `democracy. PS' and
   provides a more nuanced understanding of the discipline's
   development(s)as well as of its political nature(s). In the background
   of this piece there is a theoretical meditation on the relationship
   between knowledge and power.},

Abstract = {This project examines the utility of a particular course enhancement,
   Cengage's Aplia, and more generally interactive tools designed to
   facilitate reading in the introductory American government course. Using
   two control and two treatment sections of the course (one section each
   for two instructors) during the Fall 2013 term, we measured student
   performance, engagement, and interest in the subject matter. While there
   was no statistically significant benefit regarding interest level, use
   of Aplia resulted in improved performance and engagement in the course.
   We conclude that, subject to further study, the Aplia diagnostic quizzes
   offer tangible benefits in teaching the introductory American government
   course and offer further insights regarding these benefits.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {78},
Number = {1},
Pages = {137-151},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article explores mass attitudes toward unilateral presidential
   power. We argue that mass attitudes toward presidential power reflect
   evaluations of the current president as well as more fundamental
   conceptions about the nature of the office, which are rooted in beliefs
   about the rule of law. In four nationally representative surveys, we
   find low levels of support for unilateral powers, that these attitudes
   are stable over time, and that they are structured both by presidential
   approval and beliefs in the rule of law. In a fifth survey, we show that
   political context conditions support for unilateral power, and in a
   sixth we show that these attitudes are consequential for policy
   evaluation. Even during the Obama presidency, when presidential power is
   highly politicized, voters distinguish the president from the
   presidency. Our results have important implications for public opinion's
   role in constraining the use of presidential power.},

Abstract = {This article analyses political events thak took place in El Salvador
   between 2014 and 2015, when two electoral contests have been held and
   the FMLN won its second's presidential contest after the nomination of
   one of its historical leader, Salvador Sanchez Ceren. At the legislative
   level, despite the victory of ARENA, the bloc formed by GANA and FMLN
   managed to control enough seats to dominate the Chamber. In the context
   of consolidation of the FMLN as a governmental party and the
   fractionalization of the right wing opposition, the Supreme Court has
   thus become the principal opponent of the government.},

Abstract = {The article presents the results of a large-scale audit conducted in the
   wake of the quantitative apartment-based survey on tablets in the Samara
   and Voronezh regions. It is shown that under the existing circumstances
   route sampling becomes very problematic. In a situation of scarcity of
   different resources (money, time, personnel) the perfectly implemented
   samples are indicative of fabrications and distortion of the prescribed
   procedures rather than professional and high-quality work. In fact,
   pollsters implement quota-controlled samples that are incompatible with
   the systematic route selection, which doubts the adequacy of the
   employed methods of statistical analysis.},

Abstract = {Political corruption is one of the most important issues for the Xi
   Jinping's government and Chinese society in general. This article
   analyses the harmful effects of corruption on certain social, economic
   and institutional variables. First, it presents the current state of
   political corruption in China and it explores some social movements that
   have emerged in response to this phenomenon. The corruption perceptions
   index (prepared by Transparency International) and the control of
   corruption index (one of the six governance indicators developed by the
   World Bank) have been used as indicators of corruption. The study was
   then extended to Japan as a country with a different political and
   economic context than China. Based on the data obtained, a comparative
   analysis of the state of corruption between the two countries was
   carried out. We have studied the correlations of the previous indicators
   with the degree of freedom (published by Freedom House) and with the
   Gross Domestic Product per capita (published by the World Bank) in
   recent years.},

Abstract = {The Wayuu indigenous peoples inhabit the Guajira Peninsula on the
   Colombian-Venezuelan border. In the last two decades, they have suffered
   severe situations of violence and the advancement of mining in their
   traditional territory by transnational companies. In recent years, the
   Wayuu also live a severe humanitarian crisis due to lack of access to
   drinking water and food. In this paper I affirm that the notions of
   state of emergency and exceptionality are relevant to analyze power
   apparatus in the borderlands and the conditions under which individual
   and collective life are (or not) possible. Second, I analyze the links
   between otherness and power apparatus showing the links between
   neoliberalism and multiculturalism. Finally, I argument why a spatial
   perspective enables a positioning that can outline some responses to
   states of emergency in which life itself is uncertain.},

Abstract = {Scholars of deliberation conceive of respect as a key component of
   reasoned democratic exchange. However, disrespect abounds in public
   debates, especially in contemporary online discussions. This article
   investigates the factors that foster disrespect in online debates. It
   also considers whether the existence of some disrespectful utterances
   may actually contribute to deliberation. After all, in certain
   situations, some types of disrespect may be useful to public debate to
   the extent that they may induce reciprocity and engender discursive
   mobilization. To that end, the article analyzes 1,281 comments about
   same-sex marriage in Brazil, which were posted on YouTube and other news
   websites. The analysis points to: (1) a relationship between disrespect
   and one specific type of reciprocity; (2) an association between
   disrespect and anonymity; and (3) a correlation between disrespect and
   the use of religious frames. These results suggest: (1) the importance
   of disaggregating variables usually associated with ``good
   deliberation{''}; (2) the relationship between reciprocity and respect;
   (3) the protection offered by digital anonymity with respect to angry
   expression; and (4) the tension, first noted by Papacharissi (2004),
   between politeness and incivility.},

Abstract = {Deploying a broadly interpretive approach, the article explores the
   extent to which, and the ways in which, equality is enacted in
   non-elective as well as elective representation. It argues that the
   fleeting and fragmentary equalities evident in non-elective
   representation are democratically significant, and that examining them
   can enhance understanding of the democratic promise and limits of
   different modes of representation.},

Abstract = {Paramilitary actions and the resort to technology to monitor the border
   by two groups of citizens in Arizona question the use of the concept of
   vigilantism. Their practices aim to monitor and criticize, as experts,
   the surveillance tactics by federal authorities rather than to illegally
   resort to violence against those crossing the border without
   authorization. These two groups constitute and publicize knowledge on
   situations of migration and smuggling. They portray themselves as
   ``security experts{''}. Nevertheless, such a development raises a number
   of issues regarding the audience and the credibility of such proclaimed
   expertise, as well as the toning down of ideological motives in these
   practices of surveillance. Finally, the constitution of this expertise
   seems to provide new ground for a critique of the federal state and its
   monopoly on law and order. All in all, playing the expert card seems to
   provide neo-vigilantism with an opportunity to reinvent itself, in the
   context of an increasingly militarized borderland.},

Abstract = {There has been a lot of research done on ``Western'' politicians and
   political systems with regard to political marketing. But what about
   other countries, especially those that possess a different political
   standard? This article seeks to address one particular Russian
   politician: Vladimir Putin. He rose from obscurity to become Russia's
   second president (after Boris Yeltsin). Two presidential elections form
   the focus of attention, 2000 and 2012. The aim is to discover the
   consistencies and breaks in the manufacturing of Putin's political image
   and reputation. A number of breaks and continuities were discovered in
   terms of how Putin is marketed. This seems to be a reflection of the
   changes taking places in Russia's political environment, which then
   needs to be taken into consideration when political marketing is
   conducted.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},

Pages = {339-356},
Abstract = {In recent years, democrats both inside and outside the academy have
   begun to reconsider the merits of the age-old practice of sortition, the
   random selection of political officials. Despite this fact, however, the
   comparative assessment of the merits of voting and sortition remains in
   its infancy. This paper will advance this project by treating the
   problem of assigning public responsibilities as a problem of allocative
   justice. To treat the problem in this manner is to treat public office
   as a type of good to which citizens might have various claims. Random
   selection is the appropriate method for distributing public office when
   all citizens have equal claims to that office and there is not enough to
   go around. Universal distribution is more appropriate when all claimants
   have equal claims to the office and there is enough to go around (as
   with universal suffrage, for example). Election (or possibly other
   procedures, such as appointment) makes sense when citizens do not enjoy
   equal claims to the office and that office is in scarce supply. This
   approach captures a crucial component of democratic equality. Different
   understandings of democratic equality lay behind sortition and election.
   Each might be appropriate under different circumstances, but both place
   rights-based constraints on the design of a democratic political system.},

Abstract = {What causes individuals to express patriotism? We argue that Americans'
   symbolic patriotism stems in part from social influence, with norms in
   relevant identity groups influencing individuals' patriotism levels.
   Given that Americans identify with multiple groups-national, racial, and
   religious, among others many groups are potentially influential in this
   regard. We focus in this article on Muslim Americans, an especially
   diverse group, conducting an experiment with approximately 450 Muslim
   Americans from across the USA. We randomly assigned participants to
   stimuli that portrayed either Muslim Americans or Americans in general
   as either highly patriotic or unpatriotic. Perceived patriotic norms
   among Americans and Muslim Americans strongly-and equally-influenced
   participants' expressions of patriotism, although unpatriotic norms did
   not influence participants' patriotism. In addition, patriotic and
   unpatriotic norms among fellow national and subgroup members influenced
   participants' evaluations of government. As predicted, these norms did
   not influence intended participation, suggesting that the normative
   import of symbolic patriotism may be limited. Finally, African-American
   Muslims, a minority subgroup of this population, were less responsive to
   Muslim American patriotic norms than were non-African-American Muslims.
   The results support the conceptualization of patriotism as a social norm
   and demonstrate the political relevance of Americans' multiple
   identities.},

Abstract = {The difficulties of defining the essence of populism and of
   circumscribing the range of application of this concept have determined
   a long-lasting controversy in the academic field. Among the main
   subjects under discussion, one question has arisen most frequently: can
   populism be considered as an ideology (a `thin' ideology, in Freeden's
   sense) or must it be reduced to a political style which can be attached
   to any ideological background? Referring to the notion elaborated by
   Juan Linz in order to distinguish authoritarianism from totalitarianism,
   and on the basis of the empirical evidence, we suggest that populism
   must be seen neither as an ideology nor only as a style, but as a
   mentality, connected to a vision of the social order that is based on a
   belief in the innate virtues of the people, whose primacy is claimed as
   the source of legitimacy for the government.},

Abstract = {The Russian studies of party systems usually focus on their genesis and
   actor structure, competition and institutionalization. Meanwhile, such
   crucial characteristic of a party system as its nationalization has been
   largely overlooked by the Russian scholars. The situation with
   regionalization of party systems is not much better: it is mainly
   studied in the framework of the electoral geography, if studied at all.
   As a first step to remedy the situation, R.Turovsky refers to the
   existing international political science approaches to the study of
   nationalization and regionalization of party systems. He considers the
   origin of the relevant notions, research trends and indicators used and
   tests some of them on the Russian elections.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},

Volume = {53},
Number = {3},
Pages = {915-935},
Abstract = {In Chile, political activity is half-hearted when aimed at indigenous
   peoples in regards with their specificity, and it scarcely recognizes
   their specific political and cultural features. This creates tension
   between the demands for the recognition of diversity, in contrast with
   the protection of the common good, blind to the difference. Today, a
   third of the Mapuche population lives in Santiago, making the origin and
   aim of the demands for political recognition more complex, posing
   questions regarding the reconfiguration of identities in a dynamic and
   heterogeneous context which is cut off from the territories that have
   been historically reclaimed. Data was obtained through qualitative and
   inductive methodology. The results show an urban setting where there is
   a shift from the historical demands disseminated by the Mapuche
   movements towards discourses that demonstrate the distinctive features
   of life in the capital of Chile. These political demands seek
   self-determined, autonomous or representative space to guarantee the
   survival of their culture, and they hold expectations that posit the
   need for the State and local governments to modify the conditions that
   today make their distinctive features invisible and hinder their impact
   in the political sphere at a national and local level.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2-3, SI},

Abstract = {In this article, we aim to draw attention to the hopes, frustrations and
   disillusions that so-called `transitional justice' projects produce in
   drastically poor, war-torn, historically marginalized but politicized
   Indigenous communities. Drawing on extensive ethnographic research we
   conducted separately between 1982 and 2010 in Guatemala and Mexico, we
   describe the ways in which the world came to know about Finca San
   Francisco's massacre, committed by the Guatemalan army on 17 July 1982,
   as part of its scorched earth policy. We then look at the various forms
   of reparations its survivors have been the subject of. In so doing, we
   focus more specifically on how the Center for Human Rights Legal Action
   (CALDH), the non-governmental human rights organization that was behind
   the Rios Montt genocide case, mobilized Finca San Francisco's massacre
   survivors to become participants in the trial. After examining how the
   survivors of Finca San Francisco responded to CALDH's mobilization
   efforts, we reflect on the kind of `gift' these survivors expected in
   return for their stories of annihilation and destruction. Our goal is to
   bring to light the `economy of testimony' that human rights activists,
   journalists or social scientists become entangled in once they ask
   genocide survivors to testify about the brutal deaths of their loved
   ones.},

Abstract = {More than 20-years electoral system reform's discussions were focused on
   solving problems that create the national governments in the Czech
   Republic. But currently it appears that electoral reform deals primarily
   with dissatisfaction of citizens with the state of democracy (as a part
   of democratic culture). Citizens and politicians believe that
   strengthening elements of personalization in electoral mechanism
   settings will lead to a greater focus on individual candidates and
   therefore politics, they represent establish a stronger relationship
   between the candidates (MPs) and voters and increasing personal
   accountability of those who are selected, a positive contribution to
   (re)building of the Czech democracy. The question of this study is how
   to evaluate electoral systems and the ratio of its personalization? Are
   discussed electoral reform proposals more personalized than the current
   voting system in the Czech Republic? In that context the paper
   highlights the deficiency of most cited and most widely used
   classification of electoral systems personalization based on the article
   The Incentives to Cultivate Personal Vote by Carey and Shugart (1995).
   The results show that the classification suffers from still unclear
   possibilities of coding the variables and impracticability of coding
   special features of existing systems. Nevertheless we can state that all
   the analyzed proposals are more personalized than the current electoral
   system accept of the Greek variant.},

Abstract = {This article explains the dissolution of Czechoslovak federation. It
   shows that the breakdown in bargaining between Slovakia and the federal
   center in Prague resulted from the federal institutional framework,
   differences in fiscal policy preferences and elite patronage incentives
   to monopolize the spoils of state property sell-offs. Relatively less
   developed minority regions often seek greater autonomy in order to
   redress their economic backwardness through interventionist economic and
   social policies. Due to its veto powers, Slovakia was able to block
   central legislation, setting the stage for the divorce. At the same
   time, the federal government in the center was committed to a
   laissez-faire strategy of governance, which precluded any significant
   accommodation of the periphery. (Mostly) Czech politicians understood
   that yielding to Slovak claims would threaten to undercut their
   pro-market strategy and diminish Prague's exclusive access to the spoils
   of market reforms. In terms of the bargaining model, the center was not
   dependent on the periphery, which possessed a credible exit option. In
   fact, the periphery was perceived as a hindrance to the center's ability
   to pursue its fiscal goals and a fast economic transition, and as
   limiting Prague's exclusive access to a nascent revolving door between
   the upper echelons in politics and business.},

Abstract = {Political parties have long been identified as critical players in
   Canadian democracy. In this address I focus on the activities of parties
   at the constituency level arguing that this is crucial to fully
   understanding many important questions in Canadian political science. By
   way of example, using data relating to the 2015 federal election, I
   argue that examining the relative vitality of local party associations
   in the period between election campaigns assists in a fuller
   understanding of election outcomes and that examining local party
   nomination dynamics is key to understanding the underrepresentation of
   women in the candidate pool and ultimately in the House of Commons.},

   coalition voting},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {44},
Pages = {293-306},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Rental voting is a coalition voting strategy, by which supporters of a
   senior coalition partner cast their vote for the prospective junior
   coalition partner to secure its representation in parliament and, hence,
   the formation of this coalition. We make transparent that previous
   research has only studied rental voting in contexts, in which coalition
   signals were consistent with the rental-vote logic. Employing a
   qualitative identification strategy, we find evidence for rental voting
   only in the context with consistent coalition signals. Moreover,
   respondents exposed to consistent coalition signals behave similarly to
   voters who most likely did not receive the inconsistent coalition
   signals they had been exposed to. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The collapse of the Turkish-Kurdish peace process and renewed fighting
   has not pushed the situation back to square one because the Kurdish
   issue has been institutionalized within Turkish domestic politics as
   well as regionalized and internationalized by the earlier official
   governmental talks with Ocalan, other PKK members, and the HDP. Factors
   that influence the possibility of renewing the peace process include the
   Syrian civil war, ISIL, Rojava, the United States, Syrian refugees, and
   the current violence within Turkey. In this article, the author reviews
   the experiences and lessons learned to date, which will serve as
   important background for the renewal of the peace process.},

Title = {The Determinants of State Legislator Support for Restrictive Voter ID
   Laws},
Journal = {STATE POLITICS \& POLICY QUARTERLY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {411-431},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We examine state legislator behavior on restrictive voter identification
   (ID) bills from 2005 to 2013. Partisan polarization of state lawmakers
   on voter ID laws is well known, but we know very little with respect to
   other determinants driving this political division. A major shortcoming
   of extant research evaluating the passage of voter ID bills stems from
   using the state legislature as the unit of analysis. We depart from
   existing scholarship by using the state legislator as our unit of
   analysis, and we cover the entirety of the period when restrictive voter
   ID laws became a frequent agenda item in state legislatures. Beyond the
   obviously significant effect of party affiliation, we find a notable
   relationship between the racial composition of a member's district,
   region, and electoral competition and the likelihood that a state
   lawmaker supports a voter ID bill. Democratic lawmakers representing
   substantial black district populations are more opposed to restrictive
   voter ID laws, whereas Republican legislators with substantial black
   district populations are more supportive. We also find Southern
   lawmakers (particularly Democrats) are more opposed to restrictive voter
   ID legislation. In particular, we find black legislators in the South
   are the least supportive of restrictive voter ID bills, which is likely
   tied to the historical context associated with state laws restricting
   electoral participation. Finally, in those state legislatures where
   electoral competition is not intense, polarization over voter ID laws is
   less stark, which likely reflects the expectation that the reform will
   have little bearing on the outcome of state legislative contests.},

Abstract = {After decades of neoliberal rule in which market forces held
   pre-eminence in shaping development, there has in recent years been a
   resurgence of an activist developmental state in promoting economic
   development and tackling poverty and inequality. This article explores
   the resurgence of developmental state thinking in South Africa.
   Specifically, the article critically appraises the functioning of the
   post-apartheid state as it relates to land reform and rural development
   and argues that a weak bureaucracy and a policy fixation on the
   neoliberal willing buyer, willing seller policy framework militates
   against the promotion of a thorough-going land reform and rural
   development programme to promote rural livelihoods. We argue that South
   Africa needs a developmental state that will construct a skilled and
   competent bureaucracy, a centralised planning agency with the power to
   coordinate and ensure that government departments work together, and
   that will actively intervene in the economy to meet developmental
   objectives.},

Abstract = {The 2016 presidential election has been widely regarded as one of the
   most portentous in our history. This is not because it was (at least
   ostensibly) a podium for great divisive issues, but because of what has
   been happening to the process by which the President is chosen.
   As that process unfolded, there were recurring signs of an unstable
   political culture. Designated Democratic heiress-nominee Hillary Clinton
   found herself significantly challenged by a highly improbable contender:
   74-year-old Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, an old-time Jewish socialist
   from Brooklyn. No less unexpected was the implosion of designated
   Republican heir-nominee Jeb Bush. Most improbable of all was the
   nomination triumph of politically virginal and behaviorally outrageous
   Donald Trump. The ultimate assault on conventional political wisdom was
   Trump's election victory, which defied prevailing assumptions of an
   increasingly Democratic population, and the role of money and
   organization in presidential choice.},

Abstract = {Drawing on empirical evidence from online citizen feedback on the 2012
   Egyptian Constitution, we demonstrate that despite normative skepticism
   about implications of participatory constitution making, citizen
   participation matters. Using data of more than 650,000 online votes and
   comments on the constitution, we find that draft provisions with higher
   public approval are less likely to change and those with lower approval
   are more likely to change. We also find that Articles related to rights
   and freedoms are more likely to change based on online public input.
   Finally, following the boycott of the Constituent Assembly by
   non-Islamists, changes in draft Articles based on public feedback drop
   sharply. These findings highlight the conditions under which
   participatory constitution making becomes more effective. First,
   consensus among citizens over the most salient issues increases the
   probability that those issues would be successfully incorporated in the
   constitution. Second, without ex ante elite agreement over the design of
   the constitution, it becomes difficult to account for citizen proposals
   amid political clash between elites.},

Abstract = {The Egyptian Revolution of 2011, in fact was the result of crises in the
   Egyptian society; such as increasing social inequality and corruption
   and Mubarak's efforts to inherit the presidency. These crises by the
   help of the media -from the press to the social networks-provided the
   grounds for shaping anti-Mubarak social movements and eventually led to
   fall him. In this regard, one of the most considerable point, was the
   salient role of the press and the print media in the process of the
   revolution. Traditionally, there have been three types of journalism
   system in Egypt: the state-owned, independent and partisan (party-run)
   press. In this context, the researcher has tried to answer this
   question: how was the role and position of each type of these press
   systems in Egypt in the process of the revolution -especially since
   January 25th until February 11, the day that Mubarak resigned-, and how
   effective were these roles and positions on the Egyptian Revolution of
   2011? In this regard, in addition to detailed introduction of the
   newspapers of each press, the emphasis is to observe their views and
   positions accurately and portray the main discrepancies between the
   state-owned press with the independent and partisan papers. As the
   findings of the research show, it seems in the Egyptian Revolution of
   2011, the relative freedom of these traditional media in expressing
   their own views with the growth of the middle class, enabled Egypt to
   pass the Mubarak's thirty-year dictatorship by mobilizing their demands
   and forming powerful social movements.},

Abstract = {Reflections about city, women and security draw reflexive axes for
   academia, and for the design and implementation of public politics. To
   prevent and address the manifestations of violence, as varied as the
   power relations that they embody, has proven to be a difficult and
   challenging task. This article analyzes how the subjective aspects of
   sexual harassment pose challenges for the integrity of public politics
   to eradicate it. It is based on the experiences of harassment during
   their transit through the public space of three women, in Quito, one of
   the five cities chosen for the pilot initiative of UN Women ``Safe
   Cities and Safe Public Spaces{''}. Also, it examines the role of such
   subjective aspects in the interaction of the Protocol for action in
   cases of sexual violence in the integrated passenger system of Quito and
   the Integral Penal Code, which raises debates about the role of gender
   representations in the design and implementation of public politics, the
   intersection between national and local responsibilities, the role of
   the State facing gender violence and the symbolic value of crimes and
   contraventions, for the recognition of its manifestations.},

Abstract = {After a Coalition electoral victory in 2013, the Australian Office for
   Women was returned from the periphery to the centre of government. This
   was contrary to the expectation that women's policy will be given
   greater salience under governments of the left rather than of the right.
   To unpack this puzzle, we examine institutional arrangements and policy
   directions under successive Labor and Coalition governments in
   Australia, including the abolition of intergovernmental bodies concerned
   with gender equality. We find that the influence of neoliberalism has
   resulted in a blurring of patterns of partisan difference over gender
   equality policy. There are some continuing partisan differences but also
   a common pattern of increased emphasis on international and regional
   rather than domestic policy. The notable exception to this pattern is in
   the area of gender-based violence.},

Abstract = {By framing contemporary policy debates as a superficial choice between
   two polarised approaches to global ivory trade legality, Harvey {[}2016.
   ``Risks and Fallacies Associated with Promoting a Legalized Trade in
   Ivory.{''} Politikon 43 (2): 215-229] oversimplifies and
   mischaracterises the nature of the African elephant conservation and
   trade regulation problem. Consequently, there is a failure to engage
   appropriately with the analytical work undertaken by economists and
   other social scientists since the 1989 ivory ban. Much of this work
   elucidates deeper institutional complexities relating to elephant
   management across different scales and geographies and acknowledges it
   as an issue of political economy as much as one of conservation.
   Over-simplifying the trade legalisation debate provides a distraction
   from more fundamental challenges facing the survival of Africa's
   elephants. To understand and address these challenges more
   appropriately, analysts and decision-makers should carefully consider
   the implications of conflicting values, institutional interplay and
   economic limits. Most importantly, they should work closer together to
   identify and resolve outstanding questions of mutual interest.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to deliver experimental evidence on the dispute between
   two behavioral models of electoral turnout. Both models share the idea
   that the subjects' voting propensities are updated from their past
   propensities, aspirations, and realized payoffs. However, they differ in
   the exact specification of the feedback mechanism. The first model has a
   strong feedback mechanism toward 50 percent, while the other has only
   moderate feedback. This difference leads to two distinct distributions
   of voter types: the first model generates more casual voters who vote
   and abstain from time to time. The latter generates more habitual voting
   behavior. Thus far, the latter model seemed to be better supported
   empirically because survey data reveal more habitual voters and
   abstainers than casual voters. Given that the two models differ in their
   propensity updating mechanism in dynamic processes, a more direct test
   of their assumptions as well as implications with survey data is still
   pending. We designed a laboratory experiment in which subjects
   repeatedly make turnout and voting decisions. The result from
   experimental data is mixed, but more supportive of the second model with
   habitual voters and abstainers.},

Abstract = {German MPs spend a substantial amount of time in their home districts.
   Based on observation and interview data, this article aims to understand
   both the motivation and the effects of district work in Germany. The
   institutional setting of the German political system provides various
   incentives for MPs to conduct district work. What results from them is
   investigated by analyzing the activities in the district, MPs different
   communication styles, their casework, their party events and the
   influence of mandate types on MP behavior. Discussing how the activities
   in the district and those in parliament are related shows how crucial
   this link is for understanding modern representative democracies. Thus,
   in studying parliaments, a broad focus is in order.},

Abstract = {What are the factors that facilitate or hinder Islamic political
   parties' performance in elections in the Middle East and North Africa?
   Why did Algerian Islamists as an electoral force declined steadily over
   the past two decades? Why didn't Algerian electoral Islamists present
   the same mobilization capacity as their counterparts in neighboring
   countries did in early 2010s following the Arab Spring? In analyzing the
   evolution of three related variables: incumbents' power structure and
   political openness; electoral Islamists' inclusiveness and unity; and
   the framing process of Islamic political parties to build a legitimacy,
   the article tries to address the questions and contribute to the
   theoretical framework of the political process model by applying it to a
   case that is typical in MENA.},

Abstract = {While the definition of extended conceptions of democracy has been
   widely discussed, the measurement of these constructs has not attracted
   similar attention. In this article we present new measures of polyarchy,
   liberal democracy, deliberative democracy, egalitarian democracy, and
   participatory democracy that cover most polities in the period 1900 to
   2013. These indices are based on data from a large number of indicators
   collected through the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) project. We present
   and discuss the theoretical considerations and the concrete formula
   underlying the aggregation of indicators and components into high level
   measures of democracy. In addition, we show how these measures reflect
   variations in quality of democracy, given the respective ideals, in
   2012. In the conclusion scholars are encouraged to make use of the rich
   dataset made available by V-Dem.},

Abstract = {In modern democracies, politicians' accountability is often linked to
   the disciplining mechanism of electoral control. For politicians in
   their final term, this mechanism is impaired. Using a novel data set
   covering 910 members of the UK House of Commons active within the period
   1997-2010, we investigate how reduced electoral control affects
   last-term MPs' trade-off between work effort inside parliament, leisure,
   and outside interests. Our main contributions lie in providing the first
   explicit consideration of (1) MPs' final-term intra-/extraparliamentary
   work balance and (2) MPs' reasons for leaving parliament (i.e.,
   retirement, career change, electoral defeat). These extensions provide
   important fresh insights concerning the boundaries of elections'
   disciplining power.},

Abstract = {This essay is an attempt to assess the important evolution undergone by
   the pan-African ideology. It argues that from its inception the ideal
   was marked by moral values and political ambitions that were grounded on
   the desire to reverse the dominant views of African inferiority. This
   has not resolved the identity and racial connotations that have provoked
   the proliferation of views about what pan-Africanism really means. Yet
   pan-Africanism has become the most powerful magnet for generations, and
   remains the most solid reference for the construction of an integrated
   Africa. The last 10 years have witnessed large-scale affirmation of a
   particular brand of the pan-African ideology. Thabo Mbeki is one of the
   most significant architects of this development.},

Abstract = {Within foreign policy and academic circles in the United States and
   other western countries, retrenchment has become an increasingly
   controversial topic. In spite of the increased attention, there have
   been few empirical studies that rigorously examine the outcomes of great
   power retrenchment. In this paper, we seek to fill this gap by
   performing a quantitative analysis of great power retrenchment outcomes
   from 1870-2007. Counter to the retrenchment pessimists' expectations, we
   find that retrenchment leads to relatively positive outcomes for
   declining states. States that choose to retrench experience shorter
   periods of economic decline and are less likely to be the target of
   predatory conflict initiation.},

Abstract = {This article presents two interlocking arguments for epistemic political
   egalitarianism. I argue, first, that coping with multidimensional social
   complexity requires the integration of expertise. This is the task of
   political parties as collective epistemic agents who transform abstract
   value judgments into sufficiently coherent and specific conceptions of
   justice for their society. Because parties thus severely lower the
   relevant threshold of comparison of political competence, citizens have
   reason to regard each other as epistemic equals. Drawing on the virulent
   peer disagreement debate, I then analyze the epistemic significance of
   political disagreement. I contend that citizens ought to pursue
   epistemic conciliation, an idea I contrast to the ideals of compromise
   and of consensus. Subsequently, I introduce insights from public choice
   theory and empirical findings which show that and why multi-party
   electoral competition coupled with equal rights to participation tends
   to produce conciliatory outcomes. We thus have reason to endorse
   political egalitarianism on epistemic grounds.},

Abstract = {Steady political polarization since the late 1970s ranks among the most
   consequential transformations of American politicsone with far-reaching
   consequences for governance, congressional performance, the legitimacy
   of the Supreme Court, and citizen perceptions of the stakes of party
   conflict and elections. Our understanding of this polarization
   critically depends on measuring it. Its measurement in turn began with
   the invention of the NOMINATE algorithm and the widespread adoption of
   its estimates of the ideal points of members of Congress. Although the
   NOMINATE project has not been immune from technical and conceptual
   critique, its impact on how we think about contemporary politics and its
   discontents has been extraordinary and has helped to stimulate the
   creation of several similar scores. In order to deepen appreciation of
   this broadly important intellectual phenomenon, we offer an intuitively
   accessible treatment of the mathematics and conceptual assumptions of
   NOMINATE. We also stress that NOMINATE scores are a major resource for
   understanding other eras in American political development (APD) besides
   the current great polarization. To illustrate this point, we introduce
   readers to Voteview, which provides two-dimensional snapshots of
   congressional roll calls, among other data that it generates. We
   conclude by sketching how APD scholarship might contribute to the
   contemporary polarization discussion. Placing polarization and
   depolarization in historical perspective may powerfully illuminate
   whether, how, and why our current polarization might recede.},

Abstract = {Political discontent remains a pressing issue for UK parliamentary
   democracy that needs to be better understood. We offer a range of
   theoretical perspectives on dimensions of political disaffection and
   seek to measure them with substantially new survey measures that assess
   how citizens perceive the performance and motivation of politicians. Our
   results indicate that the public's critique of politics and politicians
   takes a number of different forms, which varies in predictable ways
   across social groups and according to other politicaland attitudinal
   measures. Mainstream parties are ensnared by political discontent, but
   other parties can be beneficiaries of it. We show that discontent is at
   least as important a driver of UKIP's support as social, cultural,
   demographic or economic factors.},

Abstract = {My purpose in this essay is to show that the enduring value of Alexis de
   Tocqueville's work is rooted in his philosophical anthropology, or view
   of human nature. In Democracy in America, Tocqueville reveals his view
   of human nature as he treats the relationship between religion and
   politics in the democratic social state. His political science remains
   valuable because he understands human beings as creatures distinguished
   by their desire for the infinite and immortal. In sum, for Tocqueville,
   religion is an essential support of liberty in the democratic social
   state because it answers the soul's desire for the infinite and
   immortal, and provides the foundations for personal and political
   justice.},

Abstract = {There is a rich body of theorizing on the diffusion of democracy across
   space and time. There is also an emerging scholarship on authoritarian
   diffusion. The dynamics of the interaction between external democratic
   and autocratic diffusion processes and their effects on national and
   sub-national political regime outcomes have received scant attention in
   the literature. Do democratic diffusion processes help counter external
   authoritarian influences? And, in contexts where external diffusion of
   democratic influences is weak, do we observe greater susceptibility to
   diffusion from regional autocracies that might in turn reinforce
   authoritarian practices and institutions in recipient states? To address
   these questions, we perform analysis of data from two original
   under-utilized data setsa data set on the European Union (EU) aid to
   Russia's regions and a data set with statistics on trade among
   post-Soviet states. We find that EU aid has the effect of countering
   external authoritarian influences that work through Soviet-era
   inter-regional economic ties.},

Abstract = {Does cabinet size have an impact on economic policy in Africa? The
   average number of ministers has increased steadily for four decades, yet
   we know little about the economic effects of new portfolios, despite
   popular complaints about costly cabinets. Comparative studies generate
   conflicting expectations, either blaming coalition governments for
   patronage or crediting them with economic restraint. Using data on 45
   Sub-Saharan African countries between 1971 and 2006, our empirical
   analysis links parties and portfolios to budgetary policy performance.
   We show that cabinets with more ministries are associated with budget
   surpluses, but they are also slightly more likely to engage in patronage
   spending. Next, we find that cabinets governing through multiparty
   coalitions have no consistent impact on budget surpluses. However, they
   are strongly associated with less extractive government and lower rates
   of patronage spending compared with single-party cabinets. These results
   hold after controlling for the type of colonial legacy, economic
   conditions, population size, constraints on executives, level of
   democracy, oil income, type of party system and ethnic and religious
   fractionalization. We conclude that parties and portfolios are both
   important but they have different effects: adding portfolios to the
   cabinet may improve economic outcomes by enhancing specialization, but
   governance through multiparty cabinets generates incentives to both
   limit extraction and restrain patronage spending.},

Abstract = {Recent approaches to class analysis in advanced capitalism have been
   largely disconnected from the capitalist labour process. This paper has
   three basic goals. First, we suggest a composite Marxist model of
   current class structure grounded in ownership, managerial authority,
   specialized knowledge and value relations in the capitalist labour
   process. Secondly, this model is used for an empirical assessment of
   continuity and change in class structure, based on a series of national
   surveys in Canada in the period 1982-2010. Thirdly, using the same
   series of surveys, we use this model of class structure to evaluate the
   extent to which employment class positions are relevant for
   understanding shifting expressions of class consciousness. Within the
   employed labour force in this particular advanced capitalist country, we
   find a generally declining conventional working class and expanding
   proportions of managerial and professional employees. Connections
   between employment class positions and class consciousness can involve
   complex mediations. Evidence for the persistence of strong hegemonic
   consciousness among corporate capitalists is provided by an additional
   unique series of surveys. This persistence contrasts with declining
   working class identity and increasingly mixed class consciousness among
   most other employment class positions. However, pro-labour oppositional
   consciousness is found to dominate among unionized industrial workers
   and professional employees in the private goods-producing sector, who
   may be among the most directly exploited workers in value terms in an
   emergent `knowledge economy'. The findings suggest the continuing
   relevance of pursuing class analyses based on production relations in
   advanced capitalist economies.},

   signalling device, motivator or to distract or dismay the enemy. Phillip
   S Meilinger explores how this use of sound in battle began millennia ago
   as shouts, war cries and drum rolls, and continues today with the use of

   Redistribution in Bafut History},
Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2016},
Number = {17},
Pages = {32-56},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Conflict is a broad term and scholars have advanced different
   definitions forspecific types of conflict. In the Bafut kingdom of North
   West Cameroon, conflicts have been caused by wanton grabbing and
   irrational redistribution of land. Within the kingdom's traditional
   political system, there is a complex network of relations between the
   leaders and with members of the community. This paper establishes that
   problems of land and redistribution have bred conflicts in Bafut and
   deterred cordial relations and coexistence within communities. It has
   also resulted in collusions, political crisis and strenuous relations
   between different segments of the society. Through colonial and post
   independence administrative documents, assessment reports, local
   government reports, petitions, government decrees and laws and other
   published works we conclude that the controversies over land
   distribution that led to conflicts in Bafut history were a result of
   interplay of power politics.},

Title = {Electoral Backlash against Climate Policy: A Natural Experiment on
   Retrospective Voting and Local Resistance to Public Policy},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {60},
Number = {4},
Pages = {958-974},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Retrospective voting studies typically examine policies where the public
   has common interests. By contrast, climate policy has broad public
   support but concentrated opposition in communities where costs are
   imposed. This spatial distribution of weak supporters and strong local
   opponents mirrors opposition to other policies with diffuse public
   benefits and concentrated local costs. I use a natural experiment to
   investigate whether citizens living in proximity to wind energy projects
   retrospectively punished an incumbent government because of its climate
   policy. Using both fixed effects and instrumental variable estimators, I
   identify electoral losses for the incumbent party ranging from 4 to
   10\%, with the effect persisting 3 km from wind turbines. There is also
   evidence that voters are informed, only punishing the government
   responsible for the policy. I conclude that the spatial distribution of
   citizens' policy preferences can affect democratic accountability
   through `spatially distorted signalling', which can exacerbate political
   barriers to addressing climate change.},

Abstract = {This article examines selected aspects of Althingi's operations over the
   last 24 years in light of theories on parliamentary affairs, the effect
   of the Internet on society and changes in Althingi's internal and
   external environment. It shows that political struggles are stuck in a
   definite rut which undermines time management and the government's
   agenda power. All main characteristics and measurable quantities of its
   work altered little. There are also indications that the quality of
   legislation is deficient. The opposition's tactics have been to carve a
   negotiating position for cases with filibuster utilizing the
   parliament's low level of organisation of case processing. This seems a
   cheap and irrelevant solution for an otherwise important matter. Modern
   demands have become outspoken, calling for careful methods, efficiency
   and discussion that is objective, concise and comprehensible.},

Abstract = {Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, and the country's prominent role in
   instigating and supporting an anti-Kiev rebellion in Donbas, surprised
   the world. This study seeks to explain Russian behaviour in these two
   cases. Because of the recent nature of events, there is so far not an
   abundance of reliable sources. Thus, some of the findings in this study
   should be seen as suggestive rather than conclusive. It is argued that
   dominating Russian axioms about Russians and Ukrainian being one people;
   the West using popular uprisings as a means of war against unwanted
   regimes; and Western exploitation of Russian weakness for 20 years; all
   constitute necessary preconditions for the Russian behaviour. However,
   the explanation is not complete without considerations on the dominant
   position of people with background from the Federalnaia Sluzhba
   Bezopasnosti in the inner decision-making circle, and on Putin's
   risk-taking, improvisation and emotions.},

Abstract = {In May 2001, the Italian Lega Nord (LN) was included in the coalition
   government led by Silvio Berlusconi after the general election. A year
   later, the French Front National (FN) provoked a political earthquake
   after the passage of Jean-Marie Le Pen to the second round of the 2002
   presidential ballot, alongside the incumbent President Jacques Chirac.
   Drawing from a qualitative methodology, this article compares the LN's
   and the FN's impact on the development of Italian and French immigration
   policies during Berlusconi's second term and President Chirac's last
   term. Acknowledging the complexity of immigration policy, the article
   concludes that the LN had a moderate impact in Italy while the FN
   enjoyed significant impact on policy developments in France. This
   research highlights the presence of important endogenous and exogenous
   constraints on the development of this political process in the two
   cases, which have been neglected in the ERP literature.},

Abstract = {In many parts of the world, people live in dual polities: they are
   governed by the state and organize collective decision making within
   their ethnic community according to traditional rules. We examine the
   substantial body of works on the traditional-state dualism, focusing on
   the internal organization of traditional polities, their interaction
   with the state, and the political consequences of the dualism. We find
   the descriptions of the internal organization of traditional polities
   scattered and lacking comparative perspective. The literature on the
   interaction provides a good starting point for theorizing the strategic
   role of traditional leaders as intermediaries, but large potentials for
   inference remain underexploited. Studies on the consequences of dual
   polities for democracy, conflict, and development are promising in their
   explanatory endeavor, but they do not yet allow for robust conclusions.
   We therefore propose an institutionalist research agenda addressing the
   need for theory and for systematic data collection and explanatory
   approaches.},

Abstract = {While most of the literature on information shortcuts in open-list PR
   systems focuses on the importance of ballot position effects, the
   influence of a candidate's localness has widely been ignored by existing
   studies. In this paper, I address this research gap and argue that
   voting patterns in open-list PR systems are more versatile than existing
   research would suggest. By analyzing a special characteristic of the
   open list PR system employed in the parliamentary elections of Hamburg,
   it is shown that a large portion of voters chooses to vote for local
   candidates irrespective of the ballot position of the candidate. The
   paper further controls for factors conditioning the effect and finds
   that it remains strong even after taking them into consideration. The
   results have important implications for the representativeness of
   open-list PR systems, ballot paper design, as well as for our
   understanding of voters' decision making process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Vote choice in regional elections is commonly explained as dependent on
   national politics and occasionally as an autonomous decision driven by
   region-specific factors. However, few arguments and little evidence have
   been provided regarding the determinants that drive voters' choices to
   one end or the other of this dependency-autonomy continuum. In this
   article, we claim that contextual and individual factors help to raise
   (or lower) the voters' awareness of their regional government, affecting
   the scale of considerations (national or regional) they use to cast
   their votes at regional elections. Using survey data from regional
   elections in Spain, we find that voters' decisions are more autonomous
   from national politics among the more politically sophisticated voters,

Abstract = {The article focuses on the avant-garde artistic group of Valparaiso
   called Rosa Nautica, which between 1922 and 1923 tried to portray the
   daily life of the population of the hills of the port. Also, this group
   was characterized by spreading the manifestos that appealed to a social
   revolution led by the dispossessed sectors, not the intellectuals, whose
   appeal largely stemmed from the relationship established with one exiled
   Hungarian Socialist Bela Kun regime. Previous research about this
   avant-garde group has not highlighted his social gaze, subsuming
   discussions about the writing style more than his background. Therefore
   we consider it important to reevaluate his vision of the dispossessed
   sectors of Valparaiso, along with the political project that the group
   brandished, largely to build a broader view of the development of
   Chilean social literature of the 1920s.},

Abstract = {Comparative politics has always been schzofrenic. It is a powerful
   method of analysis and a useful source of information. Both have a
   promising future, but to realize it both will have to change. This essay
   explores the dilemmas facing the sub-discipline and suggests some
   solutions regarding assumptions, concepts and units of analysis and
   description. One reason for optimism is its globalization and shift from
   a perspective rooted exclusively in the North and West to an increasing

Abstract = {While the International Relations literature has long debated whether or
   not economic sanctions are an effective foreign policy tool, it neglects
   to empirically examine the damage sanctions impose on target economies.
   This study presents two theoretical explanations about the impact of
   sanctions on target countries' economies, and collects extensive
   empirical data to test such theoretical connections in three areas:
   international trade; foreign direct investment; and foreign portfolio
   investment. A cross-national, time-series data analysis of 133 countries
   during the period from 1970 to 2005 reveals that regardless of the
   number of senders, the type of sanctions or the level of anticipated
   costs to the target and the sender, economic coercion damages none of
   the economic conditions of the target. This finding suggests that if the
   objective is to maximize economic pain in the sanctioned country, a
   sanctioning country should think twice before choosing economic coercion
   as its primary non-military strategy.},

Abstract = {The Great Recession of late 2007 through 2009 had profound negative
   economic impacts on the U.S. states, with 49 states experiencing revenue
   decreases in their 2009 budgets representing more than \$67.2 billion
   USD. Also during this period, states enacted a record number of laws
   related to immigrants residing in their states. We make use of data from
   the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) to examine punitive
   immigration policy enactment from 2005 to 2012 and conduct a state
   comparative study using cross-sectional time-series analysis to examine
   the potential ways in which the economic recession and changing
   demographics in the states have impacted punitive state immigration
   policy making. We hypothesize that although anti-immigrant anxieties are
   driven in part by economic insecurity, they are also impacted by the
   presence of a large or growing proportion of racialized immigrants. We
   find that increases in state Hispanic populations and state economic
   stressors associated with the recession have both led to a greater
   number of enacted punitive state immigration policies. In addition, we
   find that changes in the non-Hispanic white populations in the states
   are also impacting the expression of anti-immigrant attitudes in state
   policy during this period.},

Abstract = {Although scholars have examined committee rosters extensively, no study
   has considered the relationship between the ideological composition of
   panels and their participation in bill drafting. I thus ask: Which
   committees are frequently excluded from legislative deliberations? Does
   the composition of committees affect the degree to which they contribute
   to bill development? Using DW-NOMINATE data, I calculate ideological
   scores for congressional panels between 1989 and 2010 to see whether
   certain committees are routinely bypassed. I find that moderate panels,
   polarized panels, and panels with moderate chairs are often excluded,
   while extreme committees in the majority direction tend to retain
   bill-writing duties.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to explain the use of inside and outside lobbying by
   organised interests at global diplomatic conferences. At first sight,
   the lobbying at these venues is puzzling as it does not seem to be a
   very fruitful way to acquire influence. The use of outside strategies
   especially is perplexing because most aspects of international
   negotiations fall outside of the purview of national constituencies. It
   is argued in this article, however, that the presence of outside
   lobbying is not so puzzling if lobbying is seen both as a way to attain
   influence and as a way to pursue organisational maintenance goals.
   Empirically, the article draws on interview data with 232 interest group
   representatives that participated at either the 2012 session of the
   World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference in Geneva, or the
   2011 (Durban) and 2012 (Doha) United Nations Climate Conferences. The
   analysis demonstrates that organisational needs, and especially the
   competition actors face in obtaining resources, significantly affects
   the relative focus of organised interests on inside and outside
   lobbying.},

Abstract = {The effect of mistakes on contract depends on certain conditions of
   which the most salient one is the fundamentality of mistakes.
   Magistrates must refer to contract parties' intentionsto identify the
   domain of the fundamental mistakes and their effects on the contract. Is
   the domain of the effective mistakes limited to the subject and
   important characteristics of the contract parties? Or can we find a
   unity of measurements among the characteristics of mistakes causing
   nullification, which incorporate all or at least most of the proofs of
   mistakes causing nullification? Why do in some cases, mistakes result in
   nullification and in others the cancel right and in some other ones no
   effects in contracts? The civil law, in articles 200 and 201, limits the
   domain of mistakes to ``the contract itself{''} and ``the important
   feature of contract parties{''}. If we consider the base of the mistake
   effectsitsfundamentality, the mistake domain includes any mistakes in
   all basic elements of contracts which are the main reasons for making
   the contracts and mutual consent. Its condition is that the description
   of fundamentality is clearly or implicitly mentionedin the contract.
   Also the extent of effect of mistakes in contracts, depends on the
   importance of mistaken element in the opinions of contract parties. Some
   of the elements of the contract are related to mutual consent and
   mistakes in them result in problems in intention and nullifying the
   contract. Some other elements are not related to mutual consent and they
   are not in the domain of intention of the contract. If mistakes in them
   comes to the domain of mutual consent, naturally it leads to the
   authority of cancelling the contract.},

Title = {Attitudes towards gender equality and perception of democracy in the

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {23},
Number = {5},
Pages = {862-891},

Abstract = {This article analyses the relationship between support of democracy and
   attitudes to human rights, in particular, support for gender equality,
   in the countries covered by the first wave of the Arab Barometer
   project. We use cluster analysis and negative binomial regression
   modelling to show that, unlike in most countries of the world,
   correlation between support of democracy and gender equality is very low
   in the Arab countries. There is a group of people in the region who
   support both democracy and gender equality, but they are a small group
   (about 17\% of the population) of elderly and middle-aged people
   characterized by higher education and social status. A substantial
   number of poorly educated males express support for democracy but not
   for gender equality. Many people, especially young males aged 25-35 in
   2007, are against both gender equality and democracy. Younger people
   tend to be both better educated and more conservative, those belonging
   to the 25-34 age group being the most patriarchal in their gender
   attitudes. Yet, controlling for age, education does have a positive
   effect on gender equality attitudes. Nevertheless, this phenomenon may
   reflect two simultaneous processes going on in the Middle East. On the
   one hand, people are getting more educated, urbanized, etc., which means
   the continuation of modernization. On the other hand, the fact that
   older people are the most liberal age group may point to a certain
   retrogression of social values in the younger generations.},

Abstract = {In this article, I claim that Mary Wollstonecraft and Edmund Burke both
   conceive of the rights of man as a medium for individuals to care for
   and cultivate the self. Beginning with Michel Foucault's doubts that a
   concern with the care of the self can be found in modern political
   thought, I turn to Wollstonecraft and Burke in order to show that their
   debate turns precisely on the question of whether the rights of man
   enables or disables a care of the self. For Wollstonecraft, on the one
   hand, the rights of man provide women with a means to overcome a
   destructive set of virtuessuch as beauty, chastity, and modestythat
   leave them spiritually destitute and deeply unhappy. For Burke, on the
   other hand, such rights devastate the system of manners that had
   previously nurtured the self's relation to itself. Regardless of this
   disagreement, my key claim is that both thinkers conceive of the rights
   of man not just as a juridical construction but also as a comprehensive
   way of life. In this way, I extend Foucault's notion of the care of the
   selfalong with his conception of ethics, conversion, and personal
   cultivationto a foundational debate in the human rights tradition.},

Abstract = {This article introduces centrality in covoting networks as a measure of
   influence. Based on a simple cueing dynamic, it conceptualizes those
   lawmakers as most centraland thus as having the greatest signaling
   influencewho impact the greatest number of colleagues' voting decisions.
   A formal proof and an agent-based simulation show that cue-providers are
   always more central than followers; hence, we can use real-world voting
   data to identify the most influential legislators. To confirm the
   measure's construct validity, we predict covoting centrality in the
   European Parliament and find those factors that are expected to impact
   legislators' influence to predict their centrality.},

Abstract = {The 800th anniversary of Magna Carta came at a time of growing
   uncertainty about what it means to be British. Contemporary politicians
   have responded by articulating visions of Britishness, through which
   they seek to unite citizens behind a common identity. Taking as its
   focus the myth of Magna Carta, this article examines the rhetoric of
   Britishness of Gordon Brown and David Cameron. It shows that although
   both link Magna Carta to the myth of British exceptionalism, Cameron
   alone defines Britishness against an external `Other'. The article also
   demonstrates that Magna Carta acts as a `founding myth', and that its
   emergence as such is indicative of a change in Britain's `rhetorical
   culture'.},

Abstract = {This work is going to rebuild the action of the communist union between
   the 1930 and 1940 decades in the City of Cordoba (Argentina) and it's
   going to demonstrate the political and union resistances that the
   1943-46 government and the Peronism caused on its leaders. Unlike what
   historiography holds about this topic, our hypothesis points that the
   Peronism didn't found an organizational empty between the workers, but
   many unions of trajectory that were organized by communists and
   socialists. On the other hand, it is stressed the autonomy that the
   communist union leaders from Cordoba defended when the national party
   authorities wanted to reconcile with the Peronist union, after the XI
   National Communist Party Congress.},

   absolved. In this case, what Called the attention was the opening to the
   debate that has been a constant in a identitary formation of the United
   States: the implicit and explicit dynamics which show the racism in the
   contemporaneous world. And, despite the struggle done by Martin Luther
   King and Abraham Lincoln, it questions until what point this practice
   have finished and contrary how big sectors of the society legitimize the
   exclusion of differences. For this reason, from theories of Charles
   Darwin and Harbert Spencer (Social Darwinism and racial determinism)
   with the postmodern approach of the International Relations, we make an
   analysis of the subtlest forms of social and racial exclusion. Taking
   into account the challenges presented by those topics in the present.},

   involves the issue of Prescription or Statutory Limitations. Since the
   Statutory Limitation often is the main obstacle facing the culture of
   non-punishment, the main question is that whether Iraqi's war crimes is
   supposed to prescription?
   It should be noted that prominent values of humanity entail the
   condemning of severe international crimes and non-applicability of
   principle of prescription. Therefore, International Criminal Law through
   codification of regional and international documents including the
   Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal has predicted a period of 35 years for
   investigation of Iraqi high-ranking officials' crimes: Accordingly, it
   seems that the theory of non-applicability of prescription over Iraqi's
   war crimes during war against Iran has been substantiated.},

Abstract = {Ernesto Laclau develops a research program that aims at explaining
   political phenomena as articulatory practices that structure collective
   identities. Discourse Theory, as social ontology and research
   methodology for Politics, highlights the antagonistic nature of
   historical-cultural processes during the production of meanings and
   senses that shape social field. By reviewing the sources that inspire
   the Argentinean philosopher to develop his proposal, it is concluded
   that discourses are established through a hegemonic dynamic that
   recognizes the contingent and antagonistic nature of every discourse. In
   the end, Discourse Theory is applied to the Colombian context, more
   precisely to the signifier ``peace{''} during the 2014 Presidential
   Elections. It is argued that ``peace{''} made possible the unification
   of different parties due to its semantic indeterminacy as empty
   signifier.},

Abstract = {The Governments, military forces and other organisations responsible for
   cybersecurity deal with vast amounts of data that has to be understood
   in order to lead to intelligent decision making. Due to the vast amounts
   of information pertinent to cybersecurity, automation is required for
   processing and decision making, specifically to present advance warning
   of possible threats. The ability to detect patterns in vast data sets,
   and being able to understanding the significance of detected patterns
   are essential in the cyber defence domain. Big data technologies
   supported by semantic technologies can improve cybersecurity, and thus
   cyber defence by providing support for the processing and understanding
   of the huge amounts of information in the cyber environment. The term
   big data analytics refers to advanced analytic techniques such as
   machine learning, predictive analysis, and other intelligent processing
   techniques applied to large data sets that contain different data types.
   The purpose is to detect patterns, correlations, trends and other useful
   information. Semantic technologies is a knowledge representation
   paradigm where the meaning of data is encoded separately from the data
   itself. The use of semantic technologies such as logic-based systems to
   support decision making is becoming increasingly popular. However, most
   automated systems are currently based on syntactic rules. These rules
   are generally not sophisticated enough to deal with the complexity of
   decisions required to be made. The incorporation of semantic information
   allows for increased understanding and sophistication in cyber defence
   systems. This paper argues that both big data analytics and semantic
   technologies are necessary to provide counter measures against cyber
   threats. An overview of the use of semantic technologies and big data
   technologies in cyber defence is provided, and important areas for
   future research in the combined domains are discussed.},

Abstract = {The rival of many-Europes' is a super-power Europe that reprises but
   redefines core concepts - peuple, frontier, sovereignty and national
   power - that many-Europes contests. At the heart of this rivalry is the
   problem of power. Efforts to define a specifically European style of
   power, as civilian, tranquil, or normative, would seem to cater to the
   post-national Europe that many-Europes advocates. But the word `power'
   is haunted by the signifying trace of threatening performance and by the
   undecidability that this performance engenders. This trace of
   performative threat endows the word `power' with aesthetic effect and
   causes it to co-exist in conceptual tension with the adjectives
   (civilian, tranquil, normative and others) that are supposed to
   domesticate it. I suggest that many-Europes represent itself to the
   world as an anti-power, and explore the writings of Patocka and Levinas
   to give this concept definition.},

Abstract = {Interpersonal disagreement has been linked to a variety of democratic
   outcomes, and classic theories of social influence place it at the heart
   of opinion formation. We examine the relationship between exposure to
   disagreement and information seeking during elections, while developing
   and testing a theory of heterogeneous effects based on recent work on
   personality and discussion (e.g., Gerber et al. 2012). Using a simulated
   campaign experiment (Lau and Redlawsk 2006) and data from the 2008-9
   ANES panel study, we find consistent evidence that personality
   conditions responses to disagreement in expected waysit enhances effects
   for those with certain traits, while suppressing it for those with
   others. We close by reflecting on this pattern of results, discussing
   broader implications while moving toward a more general theory of social
   influence.},

Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {This paper reports results from laboratory experiments on how commitment
   problems affect bargaining choices. Subjects are randomly assigned the
   conditions that produce a commitment problem in order to estimate the
   effect the commitment problem condition has on bargaining behavior. The
   empirical results suggest subjects are consistently responsive to the
   commitment problem condition. When presented with a commitment problem,
   most subjects identify the condition and choose the present day lottery
   over future negotiation. Moreover, subjects not exposed to the
   commitment problem condition bargain as if they were playing the
   one-stage ultimatum game. Subjects in both games are responsive to their
   own costs rather than their opponents, playing as if this complete
   information game were in an incomplete information setting.},

Abstract = {By looking at the example of right-wing extremism, this article argues
   the proposition that there is no real correlation between democracy and
   the internet. As a technological medium, the internet can both promote
   and harm democracy. This will be demonstrated by first describing the
   internet's functions as a media element in far-right extremism, and then
   by investigating, through a diachronic comparison, the ways that
   communications and interactions in terms of right-wing extremism have
   evolved from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0. This is followed by a synchronic
   comparison that focuses on three specific playing fields for far-right
   extremism on Web 2.0 ( namely Facebook, eBay and YouTube) to investigate
   what has changed in terms of communications and interactions, and what
   Web 2.0 characteristics are significant in each case.},

Abstract = {In this essay, I read Mark Twain as a practitioner of what Deleuze and
   Guattari call an ``active micropolitics,{''} focusing especially on his
   depictions of race and racism. In his popular stories, essays, speeches,
   and autobiography, Twain gave voice not only to marginal and
   underprivileged characters, but also to minoritarian, changeable
   sentiments circulating among popular majorities. Moreover, he suggested
   these sentiments might comprise not only actual counter-majorities, but
   also potential counter-majorities, linking personal complexity to
   democratic potential. I argue that despite his appreciation for the
   inertia of popular prejudice, Twain's appeals to minoritarian
   sentiments, and the popularity thereof, testify against Tocqueville's
   fatalism concerning majority opinion in general, and white supremacism
   in particular.},

Abstract = {This article builds its arguments on a reading of the novel Estrella
   distante, by the Chilean writer Roberto Bolano. It deals with ideas that
   reflect upon the visual components of the narration, the temporal
   divergences with which the narrative is structured, and the links they
   tend with the political history evoked in the fiction (the main
   character wants to show the world the affinity between avant-garde art
   and the recently installed Pinochet's dictatorship). The various ways in
   which photography appears are understood as the core of a visual
   reflection that runs through Roberto Bolano's literature. Also, the
   article considers a controversy that confronted two Chilean
   intellectuals regarding the relationship between avant-garde art
   practices in Chile during the dictatorship and the 1973 coup. This is
   read in conjunction with the covert dialogue established between
   Bolano's novel and mentioned avant-garde practices.},

Abstract = {This article explores the processes involved in the emergence of rival
   social imaginaries, as they develop in a cultural ecosystem, relating it
   to Turkey's failed coup. To accomplish that, it unravels how people
   construct their own nature by studying the social construction of
   reality, which is comprehensively partial to `values.' What we see and
   how it is understood leads to the emergence of diverging ideological
   trajectories and, eventually, to social contestation as a result of
   competing claims. In Turkey, this ongoing contestation is reflected in
   the failed coup d'etat. In other words, the failed coup d'etat is
   explored as a clash of social imaginaries, in which the Gulenist social
   imaginary was vanquished by the AK Party's social imaginary.},

Abstract = {Although consent and commerce were dominant principles of revolutionary
   political culture, early American expansionists engaged in the continual
   appropriation of indigenous land. How were these principles of consent
   and commerce combined with processes of territorial conquest? Rather
   than a Lockean right of conquest where labor establishes the right to
   property, architects of early American expansion drew on a possessory
   right to property in which property is established by social convention
   rather than natural right. Political thinkers such as Thomas Jefferson
   and Henry Knox enlisted the possessory right to property in the
   justification of early US colonization, emphasizing the importance of
   purchasing Indian land. Yet when Indian nations refused to sell their
   land, these same figures cast indigenous resistance and coercive
   reactions to it as exceptions to the norm of commercial expansion,
   giving rise to a discourse of commercial conquest that aided in the
   justification of native dispossession.},

Abstract = {Despite the relevance of Spain inside the European Union and the growing
   intensity of Spain-China relations in the last decade, this bilateral
   relation has received very little academic attention outside of Spain.
   This paper aims to contribute to correct this deficit, not by a mere
   description of the ties between these two countries, but by an analysis
   that presents the advantages and the limits of a relationship based on a
   protectionist approach in the economic arena and on good political
   understanding in the context of China's relations with the EU member
   states. This paper concludes that both governments are satisfied enough
   with the development of their bilateral relationship not to envisage the
   need of a radical change in the way it is being conducted.},

Abstract = {Status transmission theory represents an important challenge to social
   learning theory, but its generalizability may be limited to countries
   where there is a strong intergenerational correlation in educational
   attainment. Based on a unique data set that matches register data from
   the 1999 Finnish parliamentary elections with individual-level data
   provided by Statistics Finland for a sample of eighteen-to
   thirty-year-olds and their parents, we assess these two explanations for
   unequal turnout. We first show that parental education does affect the
   turnout of young adults, as predicted by status transmission theory.
   However, parental voting rather than the transmission of education from
   parent to child appears to be the more important mediating factor. We
   then go on to demonstrate that there is a strong association between
   parental voting and the turnout of their adult children that is
   independent of the effects of parental education. More detailed tests of
   a number of implications derived from social learning theory reinforce
   our conclusion that the theory offers a superior explanation in
   countries where there is not a strong parent-child link in educational
   attainment.},

Abstract = {Several scholars agree that low political trust has fundamental negative
   implications for society at large. This study tests the power of
   institutional performance theory in explaining the differences between
   individuals in political trust (cross-sectional) and fluctuations of
   political trust over time (longitudinal). Indeed, the dominant scholarly
   debate has concerned whether political trust is stable and dependent of
   endogenous factors such as political socialization and social trust, or
   whether it is exogenous (i.e., in constant fluctuation due to later
   experiences with institutions and the outputs they produce). In terms of
   cross-sectional differences, the aim is to assess the relative impact
   institutional performance on political trust of a citizen. As regards
   the longitudinal approach, political trust varies over time and from an
   explanatory perspective it is important also to understand how well the
   institutional performance theory predicts over-time variation of
   political trust. The study employs repeated European Social Survey data
   for Finland between 2004 and 2013. The results show, first and foremost,
   the strong impact of evaluations of institutional performance on
   political trust: satisfaction with government and economy explains
   differences both between individuals and over time. Social trust and
   welfare state performance are also strong predictors, but they explain
   differences only at the individual level and do not predict over-time
   variations.},

Abstract = {The Chinese experience following the Cultural Revolution (circa.
   1966-1976) in adjusting from a period of great human suffering and civil
   chaos to one of relative normalcy deserves placement within the larger
   transitional justice literature. As an early example of conflict
   transformation and reconciliation that restored legitimacy to the
   Chinese Communist Party (CCP) through not only substantive reforms, but
   also history revision, controlled outlets for communal venting, and the
   scapegoating of outgoing officials, the Chinese case challenges
   scholarly assumptions that competent transition policies must be rooted
   exclusively in truth and justice. This article thus concludes with a new
   approach for evaluating reconciliation processes that accounts for the
   disparate array of national experiences including, amongst others,
   Germany, Rwanda, South Africa, Guatemala, China, Ecuador, and Spain.
   Such modeling is necessary to press the transitional justice literature
   toward a more theoretically driven evaluation of conflict transformation
   and reconciliation policies.},

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {This article examines Australia's National Action Plan (NAP) on Women,
   Peace and Security (WPS) within the context of global debates on the
   implementation of UNSCR 1325 and its associated resolutions. It
   demonstrates that Australia has made a strong rhetorical commitment to
   the United Nations WPS agenda that aligns itself with global feminist
   goals to enhance the protection and political participation of women in
   conflict-affected regions. Rhetorically, Australia also supports a broad
   conceptualisation of global security that challenges the gender
   relations that create women's insecurity. However, these words fail the
   test of practice. The 2012 Australian NAP lacks the architecture to
   ensure strong, consistent, and comprehensive action on the WPS agenda.
   This article explores the sites of these failures and argues that
   addressing these issues is the first necessary step towards reconnecting
   government rhetoric with WPS outcomes.},

Pages = {217-233},

Abstract = {This article reviews the recent debate on realism in political theory
   (including the articles in this symposium) and examines its implications
   for global political theory. It distinguishes two versions of realism -
   contrasted, respectively, with political utopianism and political
   moralism - and argues that the second of these realisms fails to be
   sufficiently realistic by the standards of the first. In particular, it
   exaggerates the extent of political disagreement within domestic
   societies and underestimates the unifying force of national identities.
   In international relations, by contrast, disagreement over values runs
   deeper, and the pursuit of national interest remains a serious obstacle
   to co-operation, as classical international realists insisted. Current
   proposals for global democracy and global distributive justice therefore
   run into serious difficulties over agency and legitimacy: who might have
   reason and capacity to create the institutions needed to deliver these
   goals, and how could these institutions be rendered legitimate in the
   eyes of global publics?},

Abstract = {In passing the Marriage Referendum 2015, Ireland became the first
   country in the world to enshrine marriage equality in its written
   constitution and the first to legalise same-sex marriage through
   national referendum. Turnout was high and the result decisive,
   illustrating the extent to which the Irish public embraced the proposal
   to adopt marriage equality on a constitutional basis. This is notable,
   given Ireland's record of having maintained a criminal ban on homosexual
   acts until as late as 1993; as such, the recent advancements made by
   this once socially conservative state in the field of LGBT rights
   demands the attention of scholars. This report provides an account of
   the historic Marriage Referendum beginning with an overview of the
   historical development of the gay and lesbian rights movement in
   Ireland, the role of the Irish Convention on the Constitution in
   bringing about the Referendum, and details of the proposal itself. It
   then progresses with a brief description of the Yes' and No' campaigns,
   an overview of opinion poll figures in the period leading up to the
   Referendum, and finally concludes with a discussion of turnout and
   voting on referendum day.},

Title = {Falling short of expectations: the 2012 children amendment, from
   drafting to referendum},
Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {252-281},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In November 2012, the Irish electorate approved a new provision in the
   Constitution dedicated to children's rights. The popular portrayal of
   the referendum campaign was that it was largely uncontroversial, albeit
   with a sting in the tail. However, this over-simplifies the reality of a
   political struggle that was vigorously contested for almost a decade
   before the actual referendum campaign. While the idea of a children's
   rights amendment was never far from the political agenda during this
   period, the political appetite for ambitious reform ebbed and flowed.
   The campaign itself was successful in passing the amendment, but the
   outcome was nonetheless seen as a disappointing one. This paper will
   explore two questions regarding the genesis and evolution of the
   children amendment, from initial public consultations through to the
   referendum campaign. First, what were the political forces that sought
   to influence the wording of the amendment, and which side had more
   reason to be pleased with the final product? Second, what were the
   factors that caused the referendum campaign to play out in such an
   unsatisfactory way for the Government?},

Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {1},
Number = {2},
Pages = {190-214},

Abstract = {This article tests hypotheses of the clientelist theory of political
   participation using both individual level cross sectional survey data
   and aggregate level data from all 76 provinces in Thailand for the 1996,
   2001 and the 2005 General Election timeframes. According to the
   clientelist theory of political participation, we would expect higher
   participation among those with fewer resources when there is an
   incentive for a patron to buy participation, and lower participation
   where there is no incentive. I use linear and logistical regression to
   test hypotheses derived from this theory and find there is support
   enough to suggest clientelism as a cause of political participation
   during the democratic period of Thailand. The results have important
   implications for understanding clientelism, regime legitimacy and the
   prospects for a return to democracy.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the testimonial literature of Latin American exile
   within the wider framework of studies of exile and post-exile. It claims
   that testimonies have an important role in providing access to the
   multiple and reflexive voices of exiles and expatriates, which are
   relevant to the reconstruction of the recent history of Latin America.
   Their relevance lies in enabling analysis to move beyond the heroic,
   Byronic vision of exile towards a less idealistic yet more intimate
   understanding of the gains and losses of territorial displacement, as
   well as the tensions, ambiguities, and conflicts developing within the
   communities of exiles, as they face new challenges. Exile testimonies
   also allow research to trace the development of a broader sense of
   identity extending beyond territorial borders and expressed in the
   awareness of being part of national Diasporas and, for many, also a
   Latin American transnational consciousness.},

Abstract = {Swedish decision-makers opted out of the European banking union (EBU)
   despite the large cross-border presence of Swedish banks in Estonia,
   Latvia, and Lithuania. The three Baltic states, on the other hand, have
   already joined the eurozone and are part of the EBU. This article
   identifies three important domestic considerations that have shaped
   Sweden's position. Firstly, Swedish decision-makers were concerned that
   member states outside the eurozone would not fully participate in EBU
   decision-making. Secondly, they were reluctant to pay for the
   recapitalisation or resolution of distressed non-Swedish banks in other
   EU countries. Thirdly, Sweden preferred to retain regulatory autonomy in
   crisis management. The article relates Sweden's position to the overall
   cautious approach of other non-eurozone members such as the UK and
   Denmark. Nevertheless, it highlights the enhanced role of the European
   Central Bank (ECB) in banking supervision not only for eurozone insiders
   such as Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania but also for member states
   outside the Eurozone such as Sweden.},

Abstract = {How do political parties arrive at their policy positions? We
   conceptualize position formation in federalist countries as an
   intra-party bargaining process in which subnational parties compete with
   each other in an attempt to get their own positions into their national
   party manifesto. Drawing on theories about inter-party bargaining over
   ministerial portfolios, we hypothesize that the bargaining success of
   subnational parties depends on their parliamentary strength. We evaluate
   our hypotheses based on a comprehensive dataset on policy positions of
   national and subnational parties in Germany from 1990 until 2009. Our
   results show that German subnational parties that are powerful in the
   second parliamentary chamber (Bundesrat) are particularly successful in
   shaping the manifesto of their national party. The findings have
   important implications for our understanding of intra-party politics and
   position formation within political parties in Germany more specifically
   and federalist countries more generally.},

Abstract = {Empirical social science often relies on data that are not observed in
   the field, but are transformed into quantitative variables by expert
   researchers who analyze and interpret qualitative raw sources. While
   generally considered the most valid way to produce data, this
   expert-driven process is inherently difficult to replicate or to assess
   on grounds of reliability. Using crowd-sourcing to distribute text for
   reading and interpretation by massive numbers of nonexperts, we generate
   results comparable to those using experts to read and interpret the same
   texts, but do so far more quickly and flexibly. Crucially, the data we
   collect can be reproduced and extended transparently, making
   crowd-sourced datasets intrinsically reproducible. This focuses
   researchers' attention on the fundamental scientific objective of
   specifying reliable and replicable methods for collecting the data
   needed, rather than on the content of any particular dataset. We also
   show that our approach works straightforwardly with different types of
   political text, written in different languages. While findings reported
   here concern text analysis, they have far-reaching implications for
   expert-generated data in the social sciences.},

Abstract = {On 14 and 17 November 2009 approximately 3 000 foreigners (mostly
   Zimbabweans) were chased from their homes in the town of De Doorns in
   the Western Cape, South Africa. Their homes were looted and burned. The
   importance of revisiting this xenophobic attack lies in the unfortunate
   reality of the persistence of xenophobia in South Africa. This article,
   guided by the theory of ethnic violence as presented by Donald L
   Horowitz and Jean Pierre Misago's explanation based on ``the
   micro-politics of violence{''}, seeks to understand the underlying
   conducive conditions and the triggers of the xenophobic attacks in De
   Doorns. Key informant interviews were conducted with a local farmers'
   organisa isation, the Hex River Valley Table Grape Association; a
   provincial farmers' organisation, Agri Western Cape; and a human rights
   organisation, People Against Suffering Oppression and Poverty. The value
   in conducting these interviews five years after the incident is that it
   provided for hindsight and an exploration of whether the conditions had
   changed. Conducive conditions were identified as: a casualised labour
   system, the perceived threat of the influx of foreigners, a context of
   impunity, unscrupulous behaviour of labour brokers and government
   inefficiencies. Two triggers were identified: a turf war between labour
   brokers, and the political opportunism of a local councillor. The events
   of De Doorns also provide for reflection on broader pathological
   conditions in the South African context: a culture of lawlessness, poor
   labour relations and an easy resort to violence.},

Abstract = {International commitments pay' could be the mantra of the current
   literature on international organisations: tying their hands at the
   international level is a means for governments to push through
   politically costly, but ultimately welfare-enhancing reforms. It is
   argued in this article that this logic has a limit, which can be
   empirically observed. Past a given point, further depth of integration
   increases odds of backsliding. This belief is tested in the context of
   accession to an institution whose rules have been heavily scrutinised:
   the World Trade Organization (WTO). Countries with low rule of law are
   imposed a risk premium in the form of demands for deeper concessions,
   making over-committing' possible. This relationship is used to assess
   the extent to which deeper commitments lead to backsliding.
   Industry-level analysis supports these beliefs: deep commitments lead to
   increased odds of backtracking through a range of legal and extra-legal
   mechanisms. Ambitious international commitments can backfire.},

Abstract = {We argue that individuals' personality dispositions influence the
   relative success of different rhetorical strategies of political
   persuasion on policy issues, and thus function to constrain the behavior
   of elite actors in their attempts to win support for favored policy
   outcomes. Drawing on the psychological concept of functional matching,
   we propose that policy persuasion can be understood in terms of the fit
   between the regulatory focus of the individual on prevention or
   promotion and the framing of policies in terms of losses or gains. Using
   an experimental research design, we find that the success of policy
   appeals is conditional on the interaction of the policy frame and
   citizens' personality. These effects are especially pronounced among the
   less politically sophisticated. Implications for the role of personality
   in politics, scholarly work on persuasion and framing, and constraints
   on elite behavior are discussed.},

Abstract = {How does living in a battleground state during a presidential election
   affect an individual's political engagement? We utilize a unique
   collection of 113 million Facebook status updates to compare users'
   political discussion during the 2008 election. Battleground state users
   are significantly more likely to discuss politics in the campaign season
   than are users in uncompetitive blackout states. Posting a political
   status updatea form of day-to-day engagement with politicsmediates
   approximate to 20 percent of the relationship between exposure to
   political competition and self-reported voter turnout. This paper is
   among the first to use a massive quantity of social media data to
   explain the microfoundations of how people think, feel, and act on a
   daily basis in response to their political environment.},

Abstract = {This article examines a neglected topic, the imposition of
   counterrevolution. Whereas revolution can sweep across whole regions
   like a tsunami, reaction tends to advance gradually, country by country.
   As these differences suggest, counterrevolution unfolds in a more
   deliberate and systematic fashion than revolution, which is fueled by
   the rash, ill-considered belief that the tsunami's triggerthe striking
   overthrow of a longstanding ruler by mass protestis widely replicable.
   While reactionaries share this facile inference during the revolutionary
   upsurge, they engage in learning thereafter, rely less on problematic
   inferences, and resume more rational decision-making. Longstanding
   experience and practices of open debate and collective deliberation
   enable them to process information more thoroughly and calibrate their
   counterrevolutionary plans to domestic opportunities. Consequently, they
   succeed in reestablishing autocratic control step by step. By
   demonstrating how reactionaries recuperated their grasp of political
   reality during the upheavals of 1848, the article elucidates the
   differential patterns of rationality in politics.},

Abstract = {In this article, I examine critically the themes raised by Lewis Minkin
   in his 2014 volume about Labour politics, The Blair Supremacy, within
   the context of his earlier work concerning the party's relationship with
   its affiliated trade unions. I outline his argument concerning the
   development of party management, especially that regarding a Blair
   coup'. I discuss the role of norms in political explanation, the
   importance of formal rules in understanding Labour politics, the
   significance of wider changes to the party's character, how best to
   conceptualise the nature of Tony Blair's leadership, and, finally, the
   historical development of the party's trajectory. I conclude with an
   overall assessment of Minkin's corpus and some pointers as to an
   alternative conceptualisation of Labour's relationship with its
   affiliated unions.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions does democratization erode religious political
   engagement? The dramatic democratic transitions in the Catholic world
   during the last quarter of the twentieth century have been accompanied
   by the widespread decline of Catholic political parties, but the
   interaction between democratizing reforms and the development of
   religious parties in the Catholic world remains poorly understood. This
   article analyses the crucial case of Mexico to explore if, how, and
   under what conditions electoral participation encourages the
   differentiation of religious and partisan activism. Relying on archival
   research and an original data set describing the religious linkages of
   302 historic and contemporary leading members of the PAN, Mexico's
   largest Catholic-inspired party, this article shows that democratization
   is only indirectly linked to the secularization of religious parties,
   and its effects are conditional on the resources and opportunities
   available to religious activists.},

Abstract = {Despite the burgeoning comparative literature on electoral authoritarian
   regimes, fewer studies have accounted for the emergence of hegemonic and
   competitive authoritarian regimes at the subnational level. This article
   examines the variation in subnational electoral authoritarianism with
   data from the Russian Federation. First, the article shows that by using
   a comparative regime classification most Russian subnational cases can
   be classified as electoral authoritarian between 1991 and 2005. Yet,
   there are considerable differences in competitiveness between the
   electoral authoritarian regimes. The article accounts for this variation
   by drawing on both comparative electoral authoritarianism literature as
   well as more context-specific explanations. Statistical analysis on 192
   subnational electoral authoritarian cases shows that the determinants of
   Russian subnational authoritarian stability are rather similar to those
   found in cross-national studies. Subnational (non)competitiveness in
   Russia appears to be related to the structure of the regional economy
   and natural resource rents, and to a lesser degree to the specific
   Russian federal context. Authoritarian ``know how{''} also plays a role
   in authoritarian regime building. The findings of the article contribute
   to the literature on electoral authoritarianism, subnational
   democratization and Russian subnational politics.},

Abstract = {Economic voting is a widely accepted regularity in the political science
   literature, yet most work on the subject either assumes that economic
   performance is a direct result of policy making or, more recently,
   argues that voters are able to identify when this is not the case. Our
   article challenges these claims by showing that, in a large subset of
   Latin American countries, both presidential popularity and prospects of
   reelection strongly depend on factors unambiguously exogenous to
   presidents' policy choices. These findings advance the literature on
   assignment of responsibility for economic performance and pose important
   implications for democratic accountability.},

Abstract = {This study investigates an old question that has re-emerged in social
   policymaking and in analyses of global social development: to what
   extent does targeting and size of social transfers matter for poverty?
   Using multilevel logistic regression and Cross-National Data Center in
   Luxembourg (LIS) income data for 40 middle-and high-income countries, we
   show that the size of transfer income has greater explanatory value for
   cross-country differences in poverty than the degree of targeting of
   transfer income. The results are remarkably robust in terms of estimated
   individual-level and country-level compositional and confounding
   factors.},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates the utility of comparative historical
   approaches and tools for temporal analysis in comparative regional
   integration. Over three decades Australian and New Zealand policymakers
   constructed a Trans-Tasman Single Economic Market that, like the Single
   European Market, creates supra-national authority and removes
   administrative barriers to free movement of goods, services capital and
   people. Like the Single European Market, the Trans-Tasman Single
   Economic Market regulates internal movements of people liberally. In
   Europe, some argue, liberal regulation of people movements has led to
   politicization of integration. In Australia and New Zealand integration
   has no mass political salience. This article compares European and
   trans-Tasman integration to explain these divergent outcomes. It shows
   how differing sequences of events can explain varying levels of mass
   mobilization around integration in the two cases. In Europe economic
   integration' preceded the liberalization of people movements.
   Trans-Tasman integration reversed this sequence.},

   Asking Basic Questions about Basic Institutions},
Journal = {POLITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Pages = {224-242},

Abstract = {This article evaluates the proposition that the relationship between the
   family and the state should be more central to the study of American
   political development. It compares parallel efforts in the 1980s by
   pioneering feminist political and legal theorists to put on the table
   such issues as the public/private distinction between the polity and the
   family, assumptions about the role of the family (and of women's wifely
   and maternal labor) in the political order, and injustice within the
   family. It illustrates how legal scholars, regularly examine not only
   the evolution over time of family definitions, forms, and gender roles,
   but also the evolution of how various forms of the state have regulated
   and supported the family. The article suggests that the study of
   American political development is a ``big tent{''} within which scholars
   from diverse disciplines may benefit from fruitful conversations about
   parallel inquiries. To indicate the importance of the contextual and
   temporal examination of the family and the state, the article analyzes
   the recent landmark Supreme Court opinion, Obergefell v. Hodges (2015),
   which held that same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to
   many in every state.},

Abstract = {In this article we intend to approach the study of the theories of
   imperialism and the specific characteristics of Marxism in early French
   Socialism, through the study of a particular author: Paul Louis
   (1872-1948), a militant of Blanquist origin that wrote a vast amount of
   work during his political life. Our first concerns are the specific
   features of his analysis of colonialism and imperialism: the economic
   foundations of the phenomenon, his characterization of the different
   imperialist countries and his political conclusions; tied to this, we
   analyze his position on some general debates of the socialism of that
   time: His standings on revisionism and socialists' ministerial
   participation, the general strike, the Russian Revolution of 1905, and
   the Republican form of government. This internal analysis of Paul Louis'
   work will be explained also in the framework of the debates over these
   topics that ran through French Socialism as a whole, as well as the
   political organizations in which he participated and the Second
   International, to be able to establish to which other positions they
   were close, and where were they placed in the fractional disputes on
   both national and international levels. Our hypothesis is that Paul
   Louis articulated an original vision of imperialism closely related to
   the political changes of his time, from some early analyses more related
   to a series of republican legacies, going through a rigorous analysis of
   imperialism as a phase of capitalism that influenced Lenin, until a
   final phase where he became a sort of party spokesman on the subject,
   returning to a more propagandistic stance. At the same time, from 1905
   onwards he formed his own vision of Marxism that questioned many aspects
   of Guesdist orthodoxy, the predominant Marxist current of French
   Socialism.},

Abstract = {When considering the problems of media freedom in Turkey, two types of
   pressures come to the fore: (1) the first-hand and tangible pressures
   exerted on the media by the civilian and military powers, and (2) the
   indirect and intangible pressures caused by the ideological circles
   encapsulating the civilian and military powers. Looking at the history
   of media in Turkey, it becomes apparent that it is not the political
   institution that is the main factor limiting media freedom, but rather
   the official ideology surrounding the political institution. In this
   context, it is necessary to consider the issue of freedom of media in
   Turkey through the perspective of the democratization of both the
   country and its media sector. This study will discuss freedom of media
   in Turkey and the relation between media and politics by focusing on the
   democratization of the sector, without excluding the perspective that
   the media should be distant from the pressures of the civil and military
   centers who hold the administration in their hands.},

Abstract = {This article compares how Portuguese voters and deputies evaluated the
   role of legislators and the representation process before and after the
   economic crisis (2008 and 2012, respectively). It makes use of a set of
   six issues characterising two views of representation: one
   institutional-independent and another participatory-mandatory. It also
   includes an analysis of two core policy issues. The research draws upon
   surveys of Portuguese voters and deputies carried out in 2008 and 2012.
   Findings reveal significant changes in the patterns of representation, a
   tendency for greater deputy-voter correspondence on the issues of
   representation, and lesser correspondence among government parties on
   core policy issues. Finally, voters' views of representation seem
   equally significant when explaining levels of congruence both before and
   after the crisis.},

Abstract = {In light of recent trends in the internationalisation of post-secondary
   education, the rising popularity of short-term study abroad programmes,
   and the persistent lack of diversity in study abroad, this article
   presents an option for a short-term, hybrid study abroad programme. The
   article highlights the Oregon University System Cuba programme and its
   use of a `double hybrid' model utilising both in-person and on-line
   coursework and on-campus and study abroad courses aimed to
   internationalise educational opportunities statewide and to diversify
   populations participating in international programmes. Though early in
   its evolution, the `double hybrid' model has much to offer educational

Abstract = {The extent to which popular support for the welfare state depends on
   income varies greatly across nations and policy domains. We argue and
   show formally that these variationslargely overlooked yet essential to
   understanding the politics of redistributionreflect in part the design
   of tax and transfer policies in terms of progressivity. When
   progressivity is high, politics is perceived by income groups as a zero
   sum game and conflicts over who gets what intensify. When progressivity
   is low, and tax contributors and benefit recipients overlap,
   redistributive struggles become politically less salient. We test these
   predictions both across nations and across policy domains within a
   sample of advanced industrial democracies. Our findings indicate that
   the progressivity of the tax and transfer system is a major determinant
   of the predictive power of income on preferences for redistribution.},

Abstract = {We assess the ability of logit, probit and numerous other parametric
   models to test a hypothesis that two variables interact in influencing
   the probability that some event will occur {[}Pr(Y)] in what we believe
   is a very common situation: when one's theory is insufficiently strong
   to dictate a specific functional form for the data generating process.
   Using Monte Carlo analysis, we find that many models yield overconfident
   inferences by generating 95\% confidence intervals for estimates of the
   strength of interaction that are far too narrow, but that some logit and
   probit models produce approximately accurate intervals. Yet all models
   we study generate point estimates for the strength of interaction with
   large enough average error to often distort substantive conclusions. We
   propose an approach to make the most effective use of logit and probit
   in the situation of specification uncertainty, but argue that
   nonparametric models may ultimately prove to be superior.},

   Egypt in late 2015 may prove a boon to Turkey's long-term goal of
   serving as an energy transit country. If the Egyptian market is

   gas from the Leviathan and Aphrodite fields there, leaving Turkey as the
   most economical transport option for exports to Europe. The prospect of
   a pipeline offers added impetus to settle long-standing conflicts
   between Turkey and its potential partners Cyprus and Israel, which
   coincides with a renewed push for normalization of relations in the

Abstract = {Why do some countries indulge in financial repression, harming economic
   development in the process, whereas others promote financial
   development? Three main explanations have been put forth. Market
   failures, due to information asymmetries, mean that credit is rationed
   even when lenders could potentially benefit from making loans readily
   available. Political failures, due to state capture, mean that credit
   will be rationed as a way of generating rents for politically powerful
   financial incumbents. The state might, however, have its own fiscal
   reasons for politicizing the supply and price of credit, since financial
   repression provides easy-to-collect revenues. I draw on the third
   approach to argue that the state's fiscal imperative is usually the
   primary reason behind financial repression, and even when private actors
   benefit, they are subordinate to this concern. A dynamic panel analysis
   that exploits instrumental variables and a case study of Mexico adduce
   strong empirical support for my fiscal transaction cost theory.

Abstract = {Though we have learned a great deal about lobbying in recent years, many
   questions remain unanswered. Among them are these questions: When
   lobbyists provide information to government decision-makers, what kind
   do they provide? Do different kinds of lobbyists use different kinds of
   information? And how do sources of opposition affect the kinds of
   informational arguments utilized by lobbyists? We address these
   questions using data from a survey of nearly 200 lobbyists in five
   American states. Among our most important findings are the following:
   (i)Much of the information that lobbyists provide to policymakers is
   policy analytical in nature; (ii) There are surprisingly few differences
   in information provision across lobbyist and group types; and (iii) The
   differences in information provision that do exist likely derive from
   the policy environment in which lobbyists operate, especially the level
   of conflict they face.},

Abstract = {We explain the Icelandic bubble economy and the financial crisis of 2008
   with lessons from classical political economy theories (Keynes, Minsky,
   Kindleberger, Reinhart and Rogoff). We ask why and how the Icelandic
   bubble came about? Why it went so far off track? Who were the main
   actors? And why they did it?
   At the base of these developments were changes in the policy environment
   and institutional changes in finance and economy, which produced both
   new opportunities and new risks, as well as paving the way for new
   powers to rise in the society, not least with the full privatization of
   the state banks in 2003. An overextended belief in the virtues of the
   free market of the private sector led to a laissez-faire attitude
   towards the new risks, while the new opportunities were pursued with
   great efforts.
   This produced a classical but unusually large financial bubble,
   culminating in 2003-2008, with massive and risky growth of banks. The
   main characteristic of the Icelandic bubble was extensive business
   speculation with borrowed money. The consequence was excessive
   accumulation of foreign debt, which tends to be the ultimate cause of
   financial crises. The main actors were the top ten percent of income
   earners, who gained tremendously during the decade leading up to the
   collapse. Their incomes grew way beyond all others, not least their
   financial earnings, which sprang mainly from the activities of the
   unsustainable bubble economy.},

Abstract = {Explanations for the sharp difference in the economic growth performance
   of Russia and China under economic reform vary widely. There is a debate
   over which institutional characteristics are conducive to good growth
   performance: decentralization and competition among local governments or
   centralization of control over performance targets. Yet there has been
   little systematic empirical effort to test the implications of these
   theories for the behavior of firms. This paper uses data from surveys of
   firms conducted by the World Bank in 2012 to analyze differences in
   business-government relations in Russia and China. The findings suggest
   that differences in levels of administrative decentralization help
   account for differences in business-government relations in the two
   countries.},

Abstract = {This article analyses how the interactions between a strong populist
   government in Ecuador and a weak, divided, and inefficient internal
   opposition in a context of weak liberal institutions could lead to what
   Guillermo O'Donnell termed the slow death of democracy. Rafael Correa
   was elected with a substantive project of democratization understood as
   economic redistribution and social justice. His administration got rid
   of neoliberal policies and decaying traditional political parties, while
   simultaneously co-opting social movements, regulating civil society, and
   colonizing the public sphere. Because the judiciary was subordinated to
   Correa, social movement activists, journalists, and media owners could
   not use the legal system to resist Correa's crack down of civil society
   and regulation of the privately owned media. They took their grievances
   to supranational organizations like the Organization of American States.
   When these organizations stepped in to challenge Correa, his government
   denounced imperialist intervention in his nation's internal affairs, and
   advocated for the creation of new supranational institutions without US
   presence.},

Abstract = {In many political systems legislators face a fundamental trade-off
   between allocating effort to constituency service and to national
   policy-making activities, respectively. How do voters want their elected
   representatives to solve this trade-off? This article provides new
   insights into this question by developing a conjoint analysis approach
   to estimating voters' preferences over their legislator's effort
   allocation. This approach is applied in Britain, where it is found that
   effort allocation has a significant effect on voter evaluations of
   legislators, even in a political system where other legislator
   attributes - in particular, party affiliation - might be expected to
   predominate. This effect is nonlinear, with voters generally preferring
   a moderate balance of constituency and national policy work. Preferences
   over legislator effort allocation are not well-explained by
   self-interest or more broadly by instrumental considerations. They are,
   however, associated with voters' local-cosmopolitan orientation,
   suggesting that heuristic reasoning based on underlying social
   dispositions may be more important in determining preferences over
   representative activities.},

Abstract = {The political functions of conflict-related commemoration have been
   examined in Northern Ireland, as in other deeply divided societies.
   However, a gap in research has persisted. In order to properly examine
   and evaluate local commemoration as a political activity, we should find
   out the size and spread of this activity, and ascertain who is
   responsible for its production. Accordingly, this paper presents the
   findings of a scoping survey of `Troubles'-related commemoration in
   Northern Ireland. We supply survey data in relation to types of
   commemoration; categories of actor; frequency; and location. Combining
   this with field observation of the forms and themes of commemoration, we
   examine how these data can frame our understandings of the environment
   of `Troubles' memory.},

Abstract = {Why do historical legacies continue to burden politics in East Asia?
   According to major schools of thought on collective memory, perceptions
   of historical injustice may be determined by the past (traditionalism),
   the present (presentism) or the interplay of both. This paper assesses
   the validity of these theories by examining the effect of transitional
   justice on perceptions of wrongdoers. Transitional justice offers a
   unique substrate for exploring competing theories of collective memory
   as it represents a contemporary process for dealing with the past. Were
   transitional justice to transform perceptions of wrongdoers, it would
   provide evidence supporting presentism. This hypothesis was tested using
   a survey of 640 adults from the Gallup Korea online panel. South Korea
   was selected as a research site because the legacy of Japan's occupation
   remains unresolved. A Tobit analysis supported presentist approaches
   although, as traditionalists claim, perceptions of wrongdoers were
   resistant to change. The organic nature of collective memory suggests
   that perceptions can only be transformed by comprehensive transitional
   justice.},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {182-204},
Abstract = {With the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the issue
   of radicalisation has loomed large in Western policy debates. Recent
   summits on countering violent extremism have sought to highlight the
   importance of undermining extremist narratives, mobilising moderate
   Muslims who oppose ISIS and working to address drivers of
   radicalisation. This article explores the ideological underpinnings of
   this approach. It focuses on what I call the ``Muslim paranoia
   narrative{''}, a recurring feature of Western radicalisation discourse
   that helpfully captures its ideological commitments and their
   contemporary significance. Analysing its manifestation in American
   political culture, I argue that the Muslim paranoia narrative indicates
   a powerful process of ideological reproduction that works against
   approaches to counter-radicalisation centred on engagement and
   collaboration with Muslim communities.},

Abstract = {The events of the year 2015, such as the approval of the law calling for
   a constitutional referendum on presidential re-election and the
   corruption scandals related to the Indigenous Fund, contributed to
   defining the main policies of Evo Morales' third term as Bolivia's
   president. The decline in hydrocarbon prices had a negative impact on
   the national economy and gave way to the emergence of a number of social
   conflicts. The subnational elections consolidated the MAS's electoral
   power, although it lost in the main cities, while the autonomy
   referendum resulted in an utter rejection of the departmental statutes,
   which revealed an interest in reconfiguring existing national-local
   relations. This article outlines the main political events that
   transpired in Bolivia in 2015.},

   Government and a regional limited management on the collection of the
   own and the assigned taxes; the excessive and unsustainable public
   expenditure of an overrated Public Administration with and old procedure
   and organizational structure has put on guard the Government. Thus,
   certain legislatives amendments concerning the public expenditure
   streamlining such as the structure and the administrative procedures
   simplification, public information access and transparence, good
   management and the Administration updating through an electronic
   Administration service were enacted by the central and regional
   government since 2009. This new legal framework has been tied up with
   those field measures and steps, bringing it to focus the Galician
   Community. It needs to be underlined that the Glician Plan de
   racionalizacion de la Administracion paralela (Rationalisation Measures
   of the running parallel Administration), has been the first
   restructuring process of the instrumental administration in Spain.},

Abstract = {in this research we determine as the rise in crime and insecurity,
   poverty, unemployment, inequality in income distribution and
   administrative corruption at the local level have a negative impact on
   the performance of public management of local governments in Latin
   America in recent years. This has also affected the appreciation of
   human development at the local level in both life expectancy, education
   (human capacity building) and quality of life of citizens, in addition
   to negatively affect democratic development in Latin America (the
   ability of political systems local effectively meet public demands of
   its citizens and their communities) which affects the political
   legitimacy of regional local government. We conclude by proposing an
   alternative to increase local governance and positively impact both
   human development and the quality of democracy in Latin America.},

Title = {Is Under-Consumption Responsible for Persistent Stagnation in the US

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},

Abstract = {The monopoly capital/under-consumption model of crisis posits that under
   conditions of oligopoly the system's inability to absorb a rising
   surplus generates reduced growth rates and, in the absence of
   counteracting mechanisms, stagnation. This paper argues that the
   theory's explanation for the crisis of manufacturing profitability that
   erupted in 1965 is not supported by the empirical data pertaining to
   profit rates, capacity utilization, and state expenditure. Specifically,
   the paper presents an econometric ARIMAX model which incorporates
   government expenditure as a control variable in order to test whether
   state spending serves as a counteracting mechanism to raise capacity and
   increase the manufacturing profit rate, as predicted by the monopoly
   capital school. It is argued that the model does not support the
   contention that system-wide stagnation is related to insufficient
   aggregate demand. Rather, the evidence suggests that the accumulation
   process continues to be governed by fierce competition. The implications
   of this conclusion for state policy and labor organizing are also
   discussed.},

Title = {RETRACTED: ``I'm Not Leaving, I'm Not Afraid{''}: (Re)Visiting the
   Dysfunctional Systems of Justice on Gender-based Violence (GBV) in
   Uganda (Retracted Article)},
Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},

Pages = {23-43},
Abstract = {The narratives on many of the gruesome African post-civil wars have
   always acknowledged the evil that the females were subjected to. In
   Uganda, women were both victims and weapons of war. Despite the fact
   that Uganda's justice system adopted the Truth and Reconciliation
   Commission (TRC) to prosecute gender-based violence (GBV) as a national
   crime, rape continues to be a weapon of war. As a result, there are
   traditional and contemporary barriers to access gender-based justice in
   many African states, including Uganda. Issues regarding GBV including
   sexual assault justice in post-civil war society has remained very
   sensitive. Beyond the fact that it may lead to stigmatization, the
   social deficit of this is yet to be deconstructed in Uganda. The
   dysfunctional systems of justice process cannot be seen as agency of
   reward. This system is usually expensive to service and maintain. This
   is coupled with the loss of faith syndrome in judicial systems by the
   GBV victims. As a combination of weak judicial systems and social and
   economic impediment limit the prospects of a GBV, this study assesses
   gender justice in the post-civil war Uganda. It focuses on Uganda for a
   variety of reasons, among which is that Uganda is the first African
   state to adopt TRC in 1974, and, from a gender perspective, the 1995
   Constitution of the Republic of Uganda is acclaimed as being one of the
   only two gender-sensitive constitutions in Africa. This study has
   broader implications, as it raises questions about the relevance of the
   regime of justice on the victims and the perpetrator and draw lessons
   from this experience.},

Abstract = {Postcolonial studies in India have a rich tradition. Since the late
   1980s, many theoretical innovations have been deployed in these
   analyses. The objective of this article is to uncover some of the
   limitations of the theoretical fields deployed to analyse postcolonial
   societies within the discourse of postcolonialism in India. I will
   narrate the transition from the discursive field constituted by hegemony
   and its related concepts to the field constituted by a version of
   governmentality and critique these deployments. This critique, like all
   critiques, is based on a particular query. I am primarily interested in
   the question: how far does this deployment allow or shut out the
   subversive potential of actors within the postcolonial structure?},

Title = {Governance through Economic Paradigms: Addressing Climate Change by
   Accounting for Health},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Pages = {87-96},
Abstract = {Climate change is a major challenge for sustainable development,
   impacting human health, wellbeing, security, and livelihoods. While the
   post-2015 development agenda sets out action on climate change as one of
   the Sustainable Development Goals, there is little provision on how this
   can be achieved in tandem with the desired economic progress and the
   required improvements in health and wellbeing. This paper examines
   synergies and tensions between the goals addressing climate change and
   economic progress. We identify reductionist approaches in economics,
   such as `externalities', reliance on the metric of the Gross Domestic
   Product, positive discount rates, and short-term profit targets as some
   of the key sources of tensions between these goals. Such reductionist
   approaches could be addressed by intersectoral governance mechanisms.
   Health in All Policies, health-sensitive macro-economic progress
   indicators, and accounting for long-term and nonmonetary values are some
   of the approaches that could be adapted and used in governance for the
   SDGs. Policy framing of climate change and similar issues should
   facilitate development of intersectoral governance approaches.},

Abstract = {Political campaigning is a global phenomenon in the sense that the
   methods for achieving political goals are becoming similar all over the
   globe where elections are being used as a tool for the legitimation of a
   political elite. This article addresses the question of the extent to
   which the political campaigning environment in Latvia is influenced by
   global trends. Globalization in this case is viewed from the perspective
   of Latvia's geopolitical location between the West and Russia and a
   comparison of political campaigning practices in Western democracies and
   authoritarian Russia. What methods of political campaigning are more
   appropriate in Latvia, those such as used in old democracies or the
   authoritarian regime? At the same time, there are also considerable
   local peculiarities in every country that affect the strategic planning
   and implementation of political campaigns. Therefore, the second
   research question relates to the main areas that determine the specific
   framework of the political campaigning environment in Latvia. The
   results of the research reveal that the influence of both Western and
   Russian styles of political campaigning are detectable in Latvia,
   although the international effect is rather limited, because Latvia as a
   political campaigning environment is dominated by its own unique
   characteristics. The main aspects that determine the local framework of
   the political campaigning environment in Latvia are the media system,
   political parties, and political culture.},

Journal = {DESAFIOS},

Volume = {28},

Pages = {121-163},
Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {This article engages into a comparative policy analysis through the
   mapping of the financial paradiplomacy experience in some emerging
   market countries. The article introduces the concept of financial
   paradiplomacy, outlines the financial model of paradiplomacy in
   countries with federal government structures, compares the experience
   with financial paradiplomacy in four emerging market countries
   (Argentina, India, Mexico and Russia), and provides an overview of those
   experiences compared with Brazil. The article concludes that financial
   paradiplomacy in emerging markets is limited since subnational
   governments are required to raise funds in the domestic credit markets

Title = {THE CAUSES OF THE ELECTORAL (IN)STABILITY OF INCUMBENTS IN HYBRID
   REGIMES IN LATIN AMERICA 1990-20141},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},

Abstract = {The research on hybrid regimes has advanced in the recent years but
   there is still a gap with respect to a question of their (in)stability.
   There are researchers asserting that hybrid regimes are only a
   transitional regime type while others insist on their stable
   (persisting) character. The aim of this article was to explore the
   causes of the incumbents' electoral (in)stability in hybrid regimes in
   Latin America. For that purpose, an instructive comparison of 18 cases
   of national presidential elections eleven of incumbent victory and seven
   that led to a victory of the opposition - was carried out in the years
   between 1990 and 2014. The text assessed the validity of the two main
   sets of hypotheses. The first highlighted the strategy on the part of
   the opposition forces and the second referred to the context in which
   the opposition political forces operate. The analysis concluded that
   while the unification of the opposition as the main strategy to win
   elections did not appear to be a prominent factor in the explanation of
   hybrid regime stability, the contextual variables strategy on the part
   of the incumbent and the previous performance of the candidates'
   platforms in local elections seemed to bear some explanatory power.
   Results obtained in this analysis are handicapped by a relative small
   sample of data but present a promising venue for future analysis. Future
   research can confirm our result on a bigger sample or compare our theory
   with other explanations about electoral (in)stability in hybrid regimes.},

Abstract = {Journalism as we know it is said to be under existential threat brought
   about by a combination of corporatisation and technological change. This
   has led some scholars to ask whether it can survive. The dominant
   account is one of under-resourced newsrooms that are at best incapable
   of adapting and at worst guilty of cynically abandoning professional
   standards. This article challenges these empirical claims, but at the
   same time affirms the normative concern underpinning them. In our case -
   a conspiracy of high politics - journalists do not just report political
   news but they conspire in its outcome. So, by changing the mode of
   inquiry we also change the question; not can journalism survive, but how
   do journalists cope.},

Abstract = {Politics in Northern Ireland suffers from a dearth of female
   representation, a problem that has traditionally been more acute within
   unionist parties than their nationalist counterparts (Galligan and
   Wilford, 1999, `Women and Politics'. In Mitchell, P. and Wilford, R.
   (eds) Politics in Northern Ireland, Oxford, Oxford University Press).
   This is despite the aim of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement to establish
   equality provisions for women. This article draws upon substantive and
   unique access to data gathered from an extensive membership study of
   Northern Ireland's largest party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)
   (Tonge, J., Braniff, M., Hennessey, T., McAuley, J., and Whiting, S.
   (2014) The Democratic Unionist Party: From Protest to Power, Oxford,
   Oxford University Press) to explore how attitudes towards female
   representation impact upon inequalities in gender representation in
   Northern Ireland. Exploring how women have fared in the `new' Northern
   Ireland since 1998, this article examines the position of women within
   party politics and utilises interview and survey material on the DUP.
   The article identifies a more progressive cohort within the party
   membership that wants to see more gender equality. Yet, the legacy of
   the peace process has meant positive discrimination remains anathema to
   the vast majority within Northern Ireland's largest political party.},

Abstract = {In Poland, the party Law and Justice (PiS) has amended the
   Constitutional Court Act. In doing so, it has reduced the Constitutional
   Court's authority and paralysed the pronouncement of judgements. As a
   result, a dispute has ensued over the relationship between legislature
   and judiciary and escalated into a veritable constitutional crisis. In
   essence, the president, the government, and the PiS majority faction in
   the Sejm have a different understanding of separation of powers, one
   based on a new definition of sovereignty, the source of which is not the
   political whole, the demos, but the ``nation{''}. This thinking feeds on
   a conservative utopia. In the PiS understanding of the law, traditions
   from the interwar era and the Polish People's Republic are detectable.},

Title = {RUSSIAN POLITICS THROUGH PRISM OF SOCIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2016},
Number = {5},
Pages = {183-191},
Abstract = {The starting point for the author of this essay was the book ``Russia
   surprises. 2015{''}, prepared by a partnership of leading think tanks -
   Social Design Center ``Platforma{''}, All-Russian Center of Public
   Opinion Research (VTsIOM), and the institute of Socio-Economic and
   Political Reseasrch (ISEPR Foundation). Studying the political
   consciousness of society is difficult, in particular because its being
   not monolithic, but extremely controversial and composite. In addition,
   political scientists and sociologists often appeal to not the same
   interpretive criteria. Now the problem of self-identification,
   positioning oneself in the turbulent new world occupies the crucial
   place in the national consciousness of Russians. The growing frustration
   of the mass consciousness, associated with the consequences of the
   reunification of the Crimea - e.g. a bloody conflict in the south-east
   of Ukraine, Western sanctions and a hostile atmosphere in relations with
   some Russia's neighbors - could not but trigger the growth of
   psychological tension in Russian society and its polarization. The
   analysis of data, given in the book ``Russia surprises{''}, shows that
   Russia surprises first and foremost by a certain inconsistency,
   ambiguity, and the passivity of public opinion. We are witnessing the
   formation of a sluggish but obvious anti-Western discourse on the
   background of an amorphous, nonlinear nonverbalized ideology. Now, as
   the book ``Russia surprises{''} demonstrates, we are also witnessing the
   formation of a relatively idiosyncratic consensus, based on a sense of
   patriotism and anti-Western rhetoric. The author also analyzes the new
   controversial role of the Internet and social media in shaping public
   opinion.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {82-100},
Abstract = {The expansion of transnational civil society challenges the regulatory
   reach of nation-states, both individually and collectively. One
   regulatory challenge is that transnational civil society organizations
   (TCSOs) can avail of opportunities to engage in, or facilitate,
   transnational rent-seeking in ways which benefit a small group of
   organizations or individuals but which impose significant social costs.
   This article suggests that certain roles played by TCSOs lend themselves
   to rent-seeking behaviour and it explores the hypothesis that TCSOs can
   engage in, or facilitate, transnational rent-seeking where they
   constitute transnational special interests and/or private transnational
   authorities. To this end, the article outlines a brief theoretical
   framework and applies it to case studies of two TCSOs, representing
   transnational trade associations and industry lobbies, and sports
   associations and regulators. While the conclusions here are tentative,
   the article argues for further research including refinement of the
   theoretical framework and empirical testing.},

Abstract = {The 2014 revolt in Ukraine's Donbass provinces had deep roots among the
   region's industrial workers. Key sources of the uprising included
   resistance to neoliberal austerity measures planned by the radical
   right-wing government that had come to power in Kiev, and a
   determination to block attacks by ultra-right militias allied with the
   new Kiev authorities. The inchoate nature of labour movement politics in
   the Donbass meant that leadership of the Donetsk and Lugansk republics
   fell primarily to politically ill-assorted individuals drawn from the
   region's socio-economic ``middle layers.{''} The Russian leadership met
   the Donbass uprising without enthusiasm, but under pressure from
   domestic opinion, provided sufficient aid to allow the revolt to
   survive. Meanwhile, the Kremlin used a variety of pressures to forestall
   any evolution of the uprising in a radical left direction. Despite the
   limitations of the rebellion, it defended important interests of the
   Donbass proletariat, and dealt a sharp, unexpected rebuff to the
   eastward advance of NATO military influence and of neoliberal economic
   policies. Important numbers of workers gained a much keener grasp of
   their class interests.},

Pages = {400-415},
Abstract = {This article examines the normative status of border controls from a
   neo-republican perspective, grounded in the value of freedom as
   non-domination. It makes use of Philip Pettit's account of this kind of
   freedom and discusses Pettit's own remarks on the status of border
   controls. Against Pettit, it argues that the domination generated by
   border controls is ineliminable given existing political institutions,
   because such controls cannot avoid subjecting non-citizens to coercion
   in ways that are not forced to track their interests. The article also
   argues for an alternative neo-republican account of border controls that
   does not deny their coerciveness but allows for certain border control
   policies in non-ideal circumstances.},

Abstract = {Real estate loans in Swiss francs were very popular in East Central
   Europe. Around 700,000 such loans were granted in Poland alone. The
   financial crisis in 2008-09 led to an appreciation of the franc. Many
   Polish borrowers with franc debt, the ``frankowicze{''}, soon found it
   difficult to make their payments. The Swiss National Bank's decision to
   abandon the franc's linkage to the euro set off panic among those
   affected. During election campaigning, the party Law and Justice (PiS)
   promised to solve the problem of franc loans. Since only a minority of
   frankowicze are PiS supporters and represent a relatively wealthy part
   of Polish society, the attempt to solve this problem is a politically
   delicate matter for PiS.},

Journal = {POLITICA \& SOCIETA},

Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {73-90},
Month = {JAN-APR},
Abstract = {The paper outlines the conceptual framework of Neoliberalism in its
   original form: the one that developed - between the 1930s and the 1960s
   - from the debate between the German Ordoliberals and the Austrian
   school of Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich von Hayek. The aim of the paper
   is to demonstrate that within this initial framework Neoliberalism not
   only defines a specific concept of government and economy, but, in fact,
   implies a new framework of civilization. This framework attempts to
   respond to the crisis of modern society which, during the same decades,
   has been discussed in dramatic terms by several protagonists of European
   culture. This profound dimension of the neoliberal project has been
   overlooked for a long time, however, it is an essential key to the
   understanding of the extensive success of neoliberalism after the 1980s
   as well as the reasons that are causing its failure today. Although the
   Ordo-liberals' explicit purpose was to fight the trends of
   refeudalization that they considered latent in market economy, with time
   neoliberal policies have instead promoted and amplified boosts towards
   refeudalization. This development stands in explicit contrast to the
   tendencies towards pluralism that are emerging within today's global
   society. The antithesis between refeudalization and pluralism not only
   signifies the failure of neoliberalism, but also imposes itself as the
   primary form of social conflict in the contemporary world.},

Abstract = {In his legal sociology, Max Weber - following the general orientation of
   all his work - seeks to define the basis for an understanding of the
   singularity of the process of rationalization of law in the modern
   western civilization, especially of the civil law system. Having started
   his academic career as a jurist-historian in the 19th-century German
   historical school of jurisprudence, in which he developed research in
   history of commercial and Roman law, Weber had deep knowledge of the
   legal-historiographical literature of the time and were familiar with
   the main sources of western legal history. His typological-comparative
   legal sociology and the several attendant theories about the relations
   between the various forms of law with the political, economic and
   religious formations have thus solid empirical foundations and can offer
   a valuable contribution for present research.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Pages = {323-337},
Abstract = {Albert Hirschman's rhetoric of reaction is a potentially powerful
   typology of the arguments made by both proponents and opponents of
   reform (1991. The rhetoric of reaction: Perversity, futility, jeopardy.
   Cambridge: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press). However, scholars
   have identified a number of gaps in the typology, in particular that it
   has struggled to explain the lines of rhetoric associated with disputed
   empirical evidence. This paper reviews Hirschman's typology before
   applying it to the contentious municipal amalgamation debates currently
   unfolding in New South Wales, Australia. We then examine the lines of
   attack open to progressives and reactionaries on the basis of empirical
   data. We conclude that the use of empirical data opens new lines of
   rhetoric for both `progressives' and `reactionaries' generally, but that
   both information costs and complexity significantly affect the timing
   and penetration of the arguments.},

Abstract = {This essay explores the work of French ultraleftist Gilles Dauve.
   Situating his contribution against a discussion of left communism as a
   unified intellectual-political current, it identifies and discusses
   three crucial moments in Dauve's work. A first moment, 1969-1979, sees
   Dauve attempting to critically draw together council communist,
   Bordigist, and situationist contentions into a unified and unique
   communist perspective. During a second moment, coincident with the
   crisis of Marxism, Dauve continued to solidify this position, in
   particular criticizing the confluence of liberal-democratic thought with
   antifascism. In a third moment, 1999-present, Dauve has engaged in
   important rethinking and clarification, further underscoring communism
   as communization. The essay's conclusion underscores the importance of
   Dauv's singular intellectual journey in terms of its novel synthetic
   quality, its resonance with contemporary discussions of the appearance
   of a new global Left, and its important contribution to the
   communization current.},

Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},

Abstract = {It has been 50 years since Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act ended
   legal employment discrimination on the basis of race and sex, and more
   than 40 years since Title IX prohibited sex-based discrimination in
   education. In the U.S., women earn more bachelors and advanced degrees
   than men and women are as likely as men to be employed. Yet, similar to
   business, law, and politics, highly visible women leaders in higher
   education remain the exception. This essay argues that overt bias, most
   easily addressed by policy and law, has been driven underground and
   replaced by a more subtle form of institutional discrimination expressed
   as normative institutional rules and practices. Drawing from research on
   gender equity and academic leadership, this paper argues that these
   obstacles to women's advancement will need to be exposed and redefined
   for everyone before women can enjoy benefits equally with men. In the
   interim, opportunities exist for women as individuals to be more
   proactive in acquiring leadership skills and experience. Similarly,
   institutions must be proactive in adopting strategies to accelerate the
   progress of women into top leadership positions while simultaneously
   advancing important structural and cultural changes.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {13-34},
Abstract = {Quebecers see their society as being more just than that of the French.
   This finding cannot be explained by the relations - which might have
   been different in each of these two societies - between the micro- and
   macro-justice, nor by a different effect of self-positioning or
   subjective mobility on the sentiment of justice in society. These
   relations are similar in both societies. However, the French position
   themselves much lower than the Quebecers, they have less confidence in
   their chances for upward mobility and are much more pessimistic.
   Unemployment, which is much higher in France, is without a doubt one
   element that influences these judgments.},

Abstract = {This essay, translated here in Italian and preceded by the Author's
   inedited preface, reconstructs the trajectory of second wave feminism
   since the 60s, exploring its ambivalences. Shifting from an analysis
   focused on economic redistribution to one founded on recognition of
   differences, feminism has sacrificed the critique of neoliberalism on
   the altar of women's emancipation. In order to break the tie with
   neoliberalism, Fraser proposes a new conception of social justice that
   links the principle of non -domination with those of social protection
   and solidarity.},

Abstract = {Effective as of January 1 2015, the latest reform of the Basic Law for
   the Federal Republic of Germany has re-drafted Paragraph 1 of Article
   91b of the Basic Law, which regulates the relationships between the
   Federation and the Lander regarding the promotion of scientific
   research. The new provision has sought to resolve the serious
   consequences created by the wording given to same by the great federal
   reform of 2006. The 2014 reform thus constitutes the response to the
   open debate in the last decade in Germany on the need to remove a
   regulation which prevented the Federation from participating financially
   alongside the Lander in research institutions of higher education
   establishments and of the Universities in particular. This Article
   analyses the scope of this new regulation, which has raised significant
   expectations for improved funding for these establishments, but also
   questions that will need to be specified in practice.},

Abstract = {This paper develops a theoretical framework for understanding the
   relationship between violent contexts of territorial control and vote
   choice by drawing on insights from literature on the contextual
   determinants of political behavior and civil wars. It tests the
   hypothesis that individuals living in a violent context tend to behave
   in line with the strategic objectives and ideological orientations
   proclaimed by the armed actor dominating the area. Using a national
   survey conducted in Colombia in 2005, and contextual level data, this
   paper employs hierarchical regression models to test this hypothesis.
   Results suggest that on moving from areas dominated by the Colombian
   state to regions controlled by right-wing paramilitary groups,
   individuals were more likely to support a presidential candidate on the
   right of the ideological spectrum. However, this relationship appears to
   be conditioned by partisanship, as minority party sympathizers' vote
   choices are the most affected by changes in violent contexts.},

Abstract = {This article brings feminist theories of social reproduction in
   conversation with decolonizing feminisms. It takes up Indigenous women's
   social reproductive labour as enactments of creative expansion. In
   approaching social reproduction as a site of struggle, it identifies
   three processes of expansion and resistance at this site: the expansion
   of care and intimacy into subsistence production; the expansion of the
   ``family{''} beyond the nuclear through community and kin networks; and
   the expansion of relations of care to include the land.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the politics of two rival loans to Ukraine, one from
   Russia and one from the IMF. While the Russian loan was made at the
   behest of the elected government of Ukraine as a gesture of solidarity
   between two closely intertwined post-Soviet economies experiencing
   similar difficulties, the IMF loan was not only a tool of vain US policy
   to retain purchase on fast-developing events in Ukraine, it was made in
   violation of the IMF's own rules. The loans form a critical chapter the
   contemporary transition from the geopolitical economy of US and Western

Abstract = {The developed society depends on many critical infrastructure processes,
   such as power generation, water treatment, many types of manufacturing,
   and smart buildings. These processes need control and the automation
   industry has embraced the Internet to connect all these controls.
   However, the controlling devices thus opened to the world do not always
   have adequate safeguards to withstand malicious users. Many automation
   systems have default passwords or known and unknown backdoors. Also,
   often those systems are not updated to close security weaknesses found
   after original installation. The authors argue that while the industry
   is familiar with the notion of safety of equipment and processes, it has
   not focused enough on IT security. Several years ago the Shodan search
   engine showed how easy it is to find these control devices on the
   Internet. The authors followed this research line further by targeting
   one nation's IP address space with Shodan and found thousands of control
   systems, many of which represent models and versions with known
   vulnerabilities. Their first contribution is presenting these findings
   and analyzing their significance. Their study started in 2012 and the
   most recent results are from the end of 2015. To gain further knowledge,
   they have built a prototype scanner capable of finding industrial
   control systems. This lets the authors evaluate the possibility of
   performing routine scans to gauge the vulnerability of a nation. Their
   second contribution is to present a template for a national Internet
   scanning program. The authors discuss the technology, performance, and
   legality of such a program. Based on their findings and analysis they
   argue that nations should continuously monitor their own Internet
   address space for vulnerabilities. The authors' findings indicate that
   the current level of vulnerabilities is significant and unacceptable.
   Scanning a nation's critical infrastructure can be done in minutes,
   allowing them to keep a tight control of vulnerabilities. Yet, in
   addition, the authors need to extend current legislation and the rights
   of government officials to bring more security in national critical
   infrastructures; this discussion is their third contribution. The
   cyber-space has become a playing field for criminals, terrorists and
   nation states, all of which may have a motive to disrupt the daily life
   of a nation, and currently causing such disruptions is too easy.},

   seeks to couch the putative revolution in Thorstein Veblen's theory of a
   ``machine process{''} in order to recast it less as a discrete
   phenomenon to be dealt with by the discipline, but instead as part of an
   evolutionary process of social change that instils habits of mind of
   those who are subject to it, and who in turn, influence the machine
   process itself in a co-determinant manner. This article offers the
   synthesis of Veblen and the Frankfurt School to theorize how the digital
   revolution might be critically assessed in its evolutionary framework,
   and speaks towards an evolutionary critical theory for analysing
   political society beyond discrete events.},

Abstract = {Undergraduate research (UGR) is a ``high-impact practice{''} that has
   been consistently shown to effectively promote desirable
   student-learning outcomes (SLOs) including critical thinking, logic,
   written and oral communication, problem solving, and interpretation of
   evidence, especially among minority and disadvantaged students.
   Mentoring quality UGR experiences in regular upper-level political
   science courses, however, is a difficult and time-consuming activity.
   This article describes an attempt to provide an intensive,
   semester-long, and group-based UGR experience in an upper-level American
   politics course. It discusses how this experience was designed to
   deliberately foster specific institutional UGR SLOs and summarizes
   student perceptions of the overall effectiveness of the experience.},

Abstract = {Food has long served as a form of cultural capital, and historically it
   was an elite few food critics who held the power to ascribe status to
   dining experiences. The rise of social and digital media arguably allows
   anybody to adopt the role of critic. Lowered barriers associated with
   digital technologies, coupled with the contemporary `foodatainment' boom
   have opened the floodgates for amateurs to weigh into the critical
   culinary discourse. The tendency for contemporary high-status dining
   experiences to include casual, rustic and simple foods suggests that the
   age of food snobbery is in the past. However, this notion of
   `omnivorousness' can be viewed as an alternative means of establishing
   rules surrounding high-status foods. Johnston and Baumann's US research
   reveals two frames used in food writing to valorise foods in an
   omnivorous age: authenticity and exoticism. In this project, Johnston
   and Baumann's methodology is developed and applied to Australian
   professional and amateur reviews. Results show that Australian
   professional reviews frequently employ frames of distinction whereas
   amateur reviews do not; it concludes that the contribution by amateurs
   to the critical culinary discourse is limited.},

Abstract = {The monetary union in Europe may be treated as a specific example of the
   international system, which is applicable in monetary relations. The
   creation of Eurozone was a political decision, taking shape over several
   years in a grand bargain. The purpose of this article was to analyse the
   relationship between the political and economic system during the crisis
   of the common currency. This applies above all to monetary system in
   Europe, where the interactions between politics and the economy are very
   visible. In this context, the consequences of the adoption by Slovakia
   of the single currency were presented. The paper was based on the theory
   of optimal currency areas and the theory of convergence. The
   strengthening of inter-governmentalism and hierarchy between Member
   States supports the improvement of controllability and management.
   However, the competition for leadership was a potentially destabilising
   factor. Analysis of selected Slovak economic indicators showed that
   despite the problems caused by the crisis in 2009, the adoption of a
   common currency did not result in a significant price increase or other
   negative economic phenomena in the longer term.},

   analyze civilizational codes of India and China, to define key
   peculiarities of cultural and political development of the both states,
   to speculate on their historical paths, political systems, religious and
   ideological factors in the context of civilizational codes. Moreover,
   the article discusses international environment and the level and trends
   of economic development. The authors draw a number of conclusion about
   similarities and differences in two ancient civilizations, as well as

Title = {Growth Critique in the 1970s Crisis and Today: Malthusianism, Social
   Mechanics, and Labor Discipline},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-43},
Abstract = {This article examines the perspective on labor in two critiques of
   ``growth{''} as elaborated in the context of two capitalist crises: the
   Keynesian model of industrial development in the 1970s, and the
   neoliberal finance capitalist growth model of today. A landmark event
   for the first critique was the publication of the ``Limits to Growth{''}
   report, and for the second the emergence of the ``degrowth{''}
   theoretical current. Both critiques have a Malthusian point of
   departure, and their view on overpopulation is accordingly discussed.
   Comparison between them shows that despite their ecological and
   supposedly socially and politically neutral point of departure, both
   bodies of critique examined here-that of the 1970s and the contemporary
   one-prescribe for labor the obligation of social discipline and
   acceptance of labor-market insecurity, along with the undermining of
   welfare rights. First, I argue that there is no such thing as an
   ahistorical critique of growth, but only critiques of different,
   case-specific models of growth in each particular instance. Second, I
   argue that the idea of a steady-state economy that predominates in
   growth critical programs is incompatible with the process of expansion
   and continual enlargement inherent to capitalism. Finally, I argue that,
   in the framework of two different crises, both critiques of growth
   promoted a vision of social pacification and, on the basis of ecological
   arguments, justified the preservation of capitalist power relations.},

Abstract = {Having carefully reviewed the processes occurring today in the politics
   of memory, A. Miller concludes that in the 21st century the European
   politics of memory as a whole undergone a radical transformation as a
   result of interaction between the Western and the Eastern European
   cultures of memory. According to the author's assessment, the Eastern
   European model that focuses on the sufferings of its nation and the
   motive of the existential threat, prevailed over the West-European, in
   which the theme of self-blame and responsibility played the main role.
   Explaining such turn by both the unwillingness of the elites of the
   leading Western countries to enter into a tough confrontation with the
   EU new members regarding their politics of memory, as well as by the
   ``old Europe's{''} loss of self-confidence and trust in the success of
   the EU as a project of integration, Miller shows that the Eastern
   European mechanisms of collective memory and identity construction
   prevailed when the Western Europe comprehended the growing tensions in
   the relationships between Russia and its neighbors.},

Abstract = {This article explores the Kirkuk conflict through the Turkmens'
   newspaper Alqal'a. Using agenda-setting and framing/priming for
   theoretical background and qualitative content analysis as a method, two
   macro-themes, related to the conflict, are found to be fundamental
   therein. These two main themes are: (1) exclusion and (2)
   self-confirmation. The two macro-themes overarch several micro-or
   sub-themes and are closely related to each other. They are set to inform
   the readers about what to think and how to think about the conflict.

Abstract = {This article explores the European Union's (EU) democratic and security
   objectives in the European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) toward three
   post-Soviet states: Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. By discussing the
   ENP's objectives, this study concludes the following: first, despite
   long-term ENP democracy promotion, there have been very limited
   democratic developments in the partner states between 2005 and 2014;
   second, security challenges remain in partner states in the breakaway
   regions in Transnistria in Moldova, Abkhazia and South Ossetia in
   Georgia, and Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk in Ukraine. Therefore, EU's
   Kantian view of security through democracy has failed, and its ambition
   to create a ring of Eastern friends has not led to improved relations in
   the Eastern neighborhood. On the contrary, the EU's push eastward has
   instead intensified insecurity in its partner states due to limited
   democratization.},

Abstract = {This study offers a short introduction to the development of cities in
   the period of democratization in Poland. It stresses the importance of
   multifarious factors that determine the importance of particular
   entities. It takes into consideration their origins, geographical
   location, administrative and political importance, city reforms,
   demographic and economic factors as well as their functions and finance
   to assess the role and salience of different city categories. It
   analyses the impact of the aforementioned factors, especially of
   administrative and self-government reforms on the position of the cities
   in Polish self-government system. It also finds that the self-government
   reforms, reflecting the international trend towards the unification of
   self-government system, have not led to the homogenization of cities in
   Poland, but that provisions introduced allow for individualisation of
   their internal structures and functions.},

   of such quality or value in poetry. So we use for this epistemic
   deductions according to the sources, considering the various tendencies
   of this artistic expression, its elements or means of composition.
   On the other hand, reflect from eidetic and subjective to set as main
   conclusion phenomenological aspects, this: the concept of aesthetics
   suffers from a unique perception of widespread significance because of
   the cognitive abilities of the reader and their taste for this kind of

Abstract = {This article focuses on the United States Northwest Ordinance of 1787's
   profession of `utmost good faith' towards Indians and its provision for
   `just and lawful wars' against them. As interpreted by US officials as
   they authorized and practised war against native communities in the
   Northwest Territory from 1787 to 1832, the `just and lawful wars' clause
   legalized wars of `extirpation' or `extermination', terms synonymous
   with genocide by most definitions, against native people who resisted US
   demands that they cede their lands. Although US military operations
   seldom achieved extirpation, this was due to their ineptness and the
   success of indigenous strategies rather than an absence of intention.
   When US military forces did succeed in achieving their objective, the
   result was massacre, as revealed in the Black Hawk War of 1832. US
   policy did not call for genocide in the first instance, preferring that
   Indians embrace the gift of civilization in exchange for their lands.
   Should Indians reject this display of `utmost good faith', however, US
   policy legalized genocidal war against them.},

Abstract = {In this paper I present Mao's historical view based on dialectical
   materialism, and I propose that this socialist historiography can help
   the current PRC regime to reflect on its relationship to its past and
   its future. As we know, the contradictions of capitalism and communism
   lie not only in the economic and political realms but also in the
   completely different senses of time they offer. In the case of Maoism,
   it is the unfixed future that agitates people to revolutionary action. I
   will explore what dialectics means to Maoism by exploring both the
   original texts of Mao and the exegesis of various Maoist scholars, and I
   will also study poems written by Mao to explore his romantic view of
   history.},

Title = {The Ambiguities of the BUMIDOM (1963-1982): A Specific Migration Policy
   for the French Overseas Departments},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {29},
Number = {116},
Pages = {81+},
Abstract = {The BUMIDOM is a French state agency created by the government in 1963
   in order to control and organize migrations from the overseas
   departments (Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Reunion) and thus
   neutralize the latent social crisis. The mere existence of such an
   agency as well as the policy it implemented reveal the continued
   existence of specific treatments of the overseas departments and their
   population, even after the colonial period. Such persistence constitutes
   a starting point to study and analyze a French colorline that may be
   less rigid and apprehendable than those that exist in states with
   institutionalized segregation. Although it does not rely on a biological
   type of racism, it is still based upon practices justified by the
   geographic and cultural backgrounds of the migrants. Migrants coming
   from overseas departments are viewed as citizens by the BUMIDOM. They
   are still subjected to a specific public and associational supervision.
   The study also shows that some of the practices by BUMIDOM agents and
   the general prejudice against people from the overseas departments
   contributed to forms of racialization that are more culturalist than
   colorist (but it's worth noting these two forms are not mutually
   exclusive). The organized migrations implemented by the BUMIDOM reveal
   deeply unequal relations between the mainland and the overseas
   departments. That is why despite the non -coercive nature of its action,
   the BUMIDOM is remembered as a weak institution and generally despised
   by the population. The agents of the BUMIDOM probably considered the
   migrants from the overseas territories as full citizens; however, not
   only were their actions constrained by the domination to which their
   ``clients{''} were subjected, but the policy they implemented
   contributed, to a certain extent, to the persistence of their
   domination.},

Abstract = {The implications of the Crimea becoming part of the Russian Federation
   are multifaceted; first of all, they can be seen in the political
   sphere. In order to legitimize the accession process, the powers of most
   political actors were mobilized, especially the ones of the
   institutional and partisan veto players, whose agreement is necessary
   for a change of the legislative status quo. Necessity to respond rapidly
   to the Crimean event was the cause of the emergence of political
   functions of the Council of the State Duma - the internal institutional
   structure, which used to be responsible only for organizational work of
   the lower house of the parliament. The subsequent formal confirmation of
   such functions is the reason to assume that Russia has a new
   veto-player. To understand the actual role of the Council of the State
   Duma in the legislative process, the author has analyzed its powers and
   considered qualitative and quantitative indicators which influence the
   agenda and legislative initiatives. The results show that the Council of
   the State Duma is a strong technical structure characterized by
   political composition and limited political opportunities.},

Abstract = {Since its birth in the last quarter of the twentieth century, the animal
   liberation movement has attempted to expose the transnational, global
   character of speciecism and institutionalised forms of exploitation.
   Within the American panorama, however, the ``war against terror{''}
   following 9/11 had such a profound effect on (radical) activism at a
   legal and legislative level that the movement found itself in the
   position of having to reassess their focus, leading to theoretical and
   aesthetic responses to anti-terrorist rhetoric. The aim of this article
   is (1) to examine the manner by which anti-terrorist rhetoric affected
   the movement and how the movement appropriated such rhetoric to reinvent
   their own discourse, and (2) analyse the audiovisual semiotics employed
   by Denis Hennelly in his 2010 film, Bold Native, so as to address how
   issues central to the movement's current struggle and assimilation of
   concepts such as ``terrorism{''} and ``patriotism{''} translate at an
   aesthetic level.},

Abstract = {For over ten years, Gramsci was a prolific journalist, almost always
   however in unsigned articles, making it recognition difficult. Progress
   made in studies on Gramsci's life and thought have shown up the
   weaknesses of previous collections of his journalistic and political
   writings in the two series of his Works (the first one coming out
   between 1954 and 1971 and the second - incomplete - one from 1980 to
   1987). The volume relating to the years 1910-1916, shortly forthcoming
   in the National Edition, and the just published volume on 1917, will
   contain important novelties, first of all as regards the text, now
   re-established on the basis of a precise examination of the journals in
   which they appeared. Textual examination, which has also included a
   definition of the profile of the journalists who wrote on the same
   pages, has allowed us to make a better-founded attribution of the
   anonymous authors, leading to the exclusion of some articles that are
   known and the inclusion of new ones. Among these is a series of articles
   devoted to operas, operettas and concerts, which show that Gramsci's
   relation to music is rather different from the one that criticism has
   hitherto construed.},

   peripheralization, that explains the spatial changes experienced by the
   violence of the armed conflict in Colombia between 2002 and 2014. These
   changes focus on the northeast and the southwest. That is, scenarios
   away from the decision-making centers in the country, which have lower
   levels of economic and social development, but with an important
   strategic value for the presence of illicit crops or greater guerrilla
   activism. Thus, Political Geography is claimed as a discipline that
   facilitates understanding of the dynamics of violence and the
   possibilities of peace building, especially given the current process of
   dialogue with the FARC and ELN.},

Abstract = {The ability of the news media to mobilize voters during an election
   campaign is not well understood. Most extant research has been conducted
   in single-country studies and has paid little or no attention to the
   contextual level and the conditions under which such effects are more or
   less likely to occur. This study tests the mobilizing effect of conflict
   news framing in the context of the 2009 European Parliamentary
   elections. The unique multi-method and comparative cross-national study
   design combines a media content analysis (N548,982) with data from a
   two-wave panel survey conducted in twenty-one countries (N532,411).
   Consistent with expectations, conflict framing in campaign news
   mobilized voters to vote. Since the effect of conflict news was
   moderated by evaluations of the EU polity in the general information
   environment, conflict framing more effectively mobilized voters in
   countries where the EU was evaluated more positively.},

Abstract = {This essay seeks to show that elections in Mexico still display
   important flaws. A typical electoral problem takes the following general
   form: a political agent diverts his or her resources unduly, using them
   to somehow manipulate voters before an election. I focus on three
   particular manifestations of this problem: a) some type of payment is
   offered to voters, b) voters are somehow threatened, c) the information
   provided to voters is distorted. The goal is to document the prevalence
   of these three phenomena and discuss their implications for Mexican
   democracy. I rely on a revision of the modern academic literature: a
   series of articles and books written by academics provide insights about
   the importance of these problems and their solutions. Their empirical
   results prove that Mexico has not been able to consolidate into a
   liberal democracy. Two types of solutions can be drawn from the lessons
   and thoughts of these academics: respecting formal institutions more at
   the macro level, and gaining more consciousness of democratic values at
   the micro level. This may help Mexico turn into a liberal democracy.},

Abstract = {A fundamental dilemma which troubles advocates of interinstitutional
   partnerships in regional development pertains to the extent to which
   partnerships enhance the effectiveness of governance processes and
   outcomes. This dilemma is particularly relevant in contexts that lack
   strong cohesive regional development alliances, such as the Portuguese
   case. This article aims to shed light on the debate regarding the role
   of partnerships in regional development, drawing on a unique
   collaborative interinstitutional partnership. It explores the responses
   to complexity across the different stakeholders, as well as its effects
   at the formulation and implementation stages of the strategic plans
   devised to apply for EU funding. Findings suggest that
   interinstitutional partnerships induce significantly different
   allocative choices at the agenda-setting. However, the established
   partnership was unable to cope with the several obstacles that emerged
   during the implementation, suggesting several vulnerabilities of
   partnerships, which are explored. Findings suggest the need to reinforce
   governance mechanisms during the implementation stage.},

Abstract = {Phenomenon of the soft power in international relations theory has been
   quite intensively investigated in recent years. However this research
   rather reflected the soft power in the Western perception. Specifics of
   the soft power (and its tools) in the perception of countries such as
   China Russia or Brazil have been developed only in a few specialized
   studies. Most of the researchers within the frame of international
   relations could not imagine effective soft power tools in Russian
   foreign policy. For this reason was drawn this study. The study deals
   with a potential of soft power in the Russian concept. Authors of the
   study analyze broad-spectrum concept known as the `Russian world'.
   Through this concept Russia implements its soft power abroad. The
   authors point out that the Russian concept of the soft power is
   different significantly compared to the American (the West) model of the
   soft power and present specific instruments promoting Russian soft power
   abroad. Success or failure of the concept of the `Russian world' is
   subsequently evaluated in the conclusion.},

Abstract = {Security relations between Singapore and the United States have evolved
   significantly since the former gained independence in 1965. From an
   unlikely partnership pursued by Singapore by default rather than choice
   during Singapore's formative years, the United States has since evolved
   into a vital partner of Singapore because of the indispensable role it
   has played in ensuring a stable balance of power in the Asia-Pacific and
   in facilitating the economic prosperity of the region. Their partnership
   has endured rough patches due to political differences. In the post-9/11
   period, Singapore's security has also been affected as a result of its
   close ties with the United States. Moreover, Singapore's reliance on
   hedging has at times fostered doubts-more so now in the era of U.S.
   rebalancing-about the congruence of its interests with those of America.
   However, it is clear Singapore prefers the perceived benign presence of
   the United States over other powers.},

Title = {Responsive to the People? Comparing the European Cognitive Maps of Dutch
   Political Leaders and their Followers},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {54-67},
Abstract = {Political leaders are often perceived as unresponsive to the daily
   concerns of citizens, especially when European integration is concerned.
   Academic research, however, provides at most mixed evidence for the
   existence of such a gap. This article tries to shed light on this
   discrepancy by introducing an alternative measure to study leaders'
   responsiveness-narrative congruence-and explores the assumption that
   responsiveness increases leaders' credibility in the eyes of their
   voters. As narrative congruence is a more intricate measure that
   captures leaders' and followers' policy preferences and argumentation,
   it may better capture the gap between their positions and therefore
   provide a more adequate explanation for citizens' support for their
   leaders than traditional congruence measures like issue saliency and
   ideological distance. To provide a first test of this, the technique of
   cognitive mapping is introduced and used to explore the congruence in
   beliefs on European integration of four Dutch political leaders and
   their followers. Although the study finds a significant gap between some
   leaders and their followers' narratives on Europe, it finds no evidence
   that this narrative congruence is related to the credibility of these
   leaders in the eyes of their followers.},

Abstract = {While it might appear self-evident that the trend toward the New Public
   Management (NPM) in the public administration systems of many Western
   countries is an outgrowth of neoliberalism, the case of Swedish
   education suggests that such policies can have widely different and
   counterintuitive sources. Ideas about education from both sides of the
   political spectrum appear to have paved the way for NPM in the Swedish
   school system. This possibility casts the ideological basis for NPM
   reforms in a new light, at least in the context of the Swedish school
   system.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {143-173},
Abstract = {What light can international relations theory shed on how developing
   countries such as Brazil have achieved regional leadership and
   international influence? This comprehensive examination of Brazilian
   foreign policy over the last few decades argues that Realism provides a
   better account of Brazil's strategy than Liberalism and Constructivism.
   Despite changes of government and regime, Brasilia has persistently
   pursued relative political gain, especially international influence.
   However, because this rising country has faced an established hegemon in
   the form of the United States, it has not been able to employ
   conventionally Realist instruments and tactics. Its subordinate position
   in the current power constellation has forced Brazil to forego political
   or military confrontation and instead use economic cooperation, both
   with the hegemon and its weaker neighbors. Through this collaboration,
   Brazil hopes to derive disproportionate benefits that will enhance its
   relative power. By elucidating these complex calculations, the present
   essay explains the Realist strategy that ambitious nations such as
   Brazil have pursued and helps design a version of Realism that captures
   recent power dynamics in the international system.},

Abstract = {The main topic of this article is the impact of Brexit on EU'S
   cooperation on security and defence. The British government has
   indicated that the UK as an important international actor wants to
   maintain a leading role promoting European security. NATO remains in the
   UK perspective the most important forum for that. But since the Euro
   Atlantic organisation does not cover all aspects of European security,
   new forms of cooperation between the EU and Britain after Brexit have to
   be explored since both share the same ideas about a rules based
   international order and have common interests in maintaining security on
   the continent.},

Title = {What type of Europe? The salience of polity and policy issues in
   European Parliament elections},
Journal = {EUROPEAN UNION POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Pages = {570-592},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {How much and why do political parties emphasize Europe in election
   campaigns? The literature is increasingly focusing on two aspects of
   party issue competition: position and salience. However, recent studies
   on salience tend to ignore the fact that Europe is a compound political
   issue. This article contributes to the debate by highlighting the
   crucial difference between constitutive and policy-related European
   issues. Using data from the Euromanifestos Project for 14 EU member
   states for the period 1979-2009, we first show that Europe is much more
   salient in European Parliament elections than previously assumed.
   Second, EU issue salience depends on party position and party system
   polarization over European integration. However, different explanations
   come into play once we bring in the polity-vs.-policy distinction. This
   has important implications for our understanding of party competition on
   European integration.},

Abstract = {Hot spots policing strategy uses pervasive deployment of police officers
   on the beat to reduce crime, which is highly concentrated in a few
   areas. In Colombia, cities like Bogota and Medellin have systematically
   implemented this model since 2009 regardless changes of their
   administrations. This article assesses the practice of both experiences
   on the way in which the model has been implemented from 2009. It
   concludes that, as result of the lack of scientific evaluations, it is
   impossible to definitely determine that crime has decreased in such
   sensitive areas; notwithstanding, crime reduction seems to be higher
   where police presence has increased.},

Abstract = {In the days after the 2016 election, a variety of explanations has been
   offered to explain Donald Trump's unique ascendancy in American
   politics. Scholars have discussed Trump's appeal to rural voters, his
   hybrid media campaign strategy, shifts in voter turnout, Hillary
   Clinton's campaign advertising strategy, economic anxiety, differences
   in sexist and racist attitudes among Trump voters and so forth. Here, we
   add another key factor to the conversation: Trump's appeal to a smaller,
   often ignored, segment of the electorate: populist voters. Building upon
   our previous work - demonstrating that while - American political elites
   compete across a single dimension of conflict, the American people
   organize their attitudes around two distinct dimensions, one economic
   and one social - we use 2008 American National Elections Study (ANES)
   data and 2016 ANES primary election data to show that populist support
   for Trump, and nationalist policies themselves, help us to understand
   how Trump captured the Republican nomination and the White House.},

Title = {Operational Ideology and Party Identification: A Dynamic Model of

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom suggests that partisanship is the unmoved mover in
   the minds of American voters. Revisionist theories hold that party
   updating is conditional on individual/contextual factors. By delimiting
   the scope conditions of the Michigan model, revisionist models do not
   fundamentally challenge the classic view. This paper proffers an
   unconditional model of party revision. We theorize that beliefs about
   government activismoperational ideologyare widely available and
   heuristically efficacious, and easily map onto party labels. Hence,
   operational ideology should drive party updating. Using data from seven
   panel studies covering 1990-2012, we demonstrate that (1) party shapes
   operational ideology, (2) operational ideology shapes party, (3) the
   ideology-to-party effects are as large as the party-to-ideology effects,
   and (4) neither sophistication nor education or elite polarization
   condition these relationships. These results push the revisionist model
   of party farther than it has gone before and suggest that operational
   ideology is a core predisposition in mass belief systems.},

Abstract = {This article takes food issues in both the advanced capitalist and
   developing worlds, as well as discourses and struggles that have
   developed in response to them, as a point of departure. The exposition
   begins with a description of food sovereignty movements and their
   successful struggles. Third-world campaigns for food security are
   inspiring cases of resistance, of struggle for disalienation. The focus
   then shifts to the problems with the contemporary North American diet,
   and the `foodie' response to the epidemic of poor eating and resulting
   poor health. Foodie culture as it has developed in the advanced
   capitalist world has severe limitations, particularly in regards to its
   treatment of gender and class. Yet it also contains important messages
   about meaningful human interaction with nature in the form of food
   procurement and preparation. The analysis developed here strives to go
   further than a critique of the distribution and availability of
   foodstuffs in the contemporary capitalist economy. The aim is to
   understand contestations over both the production and consumption of
   food in terms of some key categories of Marxist philosophy. It is argued
   that using the concepts of alienation, division of labour, and
   production of consumption can strengthen the case for food sovereignty
   while also mounting a critique of foodie culture that nonetheless
   preserves its constructive insights. More specifically, this means that
   an exploration of the relationship between the division of labour and
   alienation can demonstrate the negative consequences of industrially
   produced foods, while affirming the necessity of alternative forms of
   food production and consumption. Everywhere and in different ways,
   capitalism alienates humans from their species-being. This article
   argues that this fact is particularly evident with regards to the
   industrial food system. However, just as food can be a site of
   oppression, so too can it be a locus of struggle against capital.},

Abstract = {Work on democratic delegation needs coherent and integrated recording of
   parties, elections and cabinets to study aspects of democratic
   representation such as electoral dynamics, cabinet formation and policy
   making. In this article, we present the methodological design of the
   ParlGov database and demonstrate how its operationalization of parties,
   election results and cabinets adds to a better un-derstanding of
   political representation. The most recent version of the database
   includes 1177 parties, 735 elections (580 national, 155 European
   Parliament) and 1067 cabinets for democratic elections in 37 established
   democracies from 1945 to 2015. With this information we provide a
   definition of relevant political parties, a systematic recording of
   electoral results including electoral alliances and an adjustment to the
   definition of cabinets to account for potentially short lived cabinets.
   A replication of a prominent study by Hix and Marsh (2007) on
   second-order elections to the European Parliament (EP) demonstrates the
   added value of an integrated data source for a better understanding of
   electoral dynamics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {After briefly discussing the affective turn' in citizenship studies,
   this afterword discusses the political mobilisation of affect to
   consider when, where and how affect may be connected to citizenship. It
   asks: What does it mean and do to speak of affective acts as acts of
   affective citizenship? I argue that the phrase affective citizenship'
   attaches affect to a very specific object: citizenship. Studying
   affective citizenship requires attention to how some feelings attach
   themselves to citizenship and to how citizenship itself can evoke
   certain feelings. But affective citizenship does not occur naturally':
   it arises from, requires and/or produces knowledge, labour, and (new)
   feeling rules'. I conclude with a call for more research into the
   dynamics of affective citizenship that go beyond a simple opposition
   between those simply conceived of as agents of disciplinary power and
   those seen as (resisting) subjects of disciplinary power.},

Title = {Self-help Governance and State Dysfunction: Exploratory Perspectives on
   the South African State and Civil Society},
Journal = {POLITIKON},

Volume = {43},

Pages = {389-409},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article explores the phenomenon of self-help governance initiatives
   that manifest in the context of state dysfunction in South Africa. It is
   argued that the inability of dysfunctional states to render adequate
   public goods and services prompts civil society to respond in protests.
   Such protest may be violent and destructive, or assume a constructive
   `do-it-yourself' character. The latter forms the focus of the article
   and is explored through means of a case study at local government level.
   It is concluded that self-help governance is one of a range of civil
   society responses to state dysfunction, and the phenomenon is
   conceptualised and integrated into an analytic framework to facilitate
   further scholarly investigation.},

Volume = {4},

Abstract = {This article advances Ambedkar's recasting of pure politics and the
   political within an ethical framework. It explores Ambedkar's ethos of
   radical action grounded in the limitation of the state, law and
   institutional structures to transform society. In foregrounding
   Ambedkar's idea of transformation and change through practices of the
   self, the essay locates self-transformation as going beyond a critique
   of existing social and economic frameworks. In furtherance, this view
   captures an ethics of internal transformation resulting from the change
   in moral conduct achieved through voluntary conversion. Dhamma was based
   on techniques of self-restraint that stressed on an unremitting duty
   owed to the other including an adversary and stranger. It inaugurated an
   inclusive and ecological notion of kinship based on empathy and
   friendship whose aim was to break down all barriers and create a
   compassionate society. Ambedkar furnishes us with an original
   formulation to think through a notion of compassionate justice from the
   moral lexicon of the broken men.},

Volume = {43},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Analysts of environmental impact assessment and sustainability
   assessment tools recognise that ideally different types of knowledge and
   thinking need to be incorporated for such tools to be more effective in
   their sustainability objectives. Broadening thinking help to
   understanding complex issues these tools aspire to uncover. The sole use
   of positivist lenses is inadequate in seeking to better understand
   complexity. Assessment tools are usually formulated in a
   rational-technical or positivist manner. This can be problematic. The
   tools are driven by top-down technocratic motivations, which is not
   always ideal for an ever increasing complex society. Paradigms and
   theories influence our conceptualisation of phenomena and actions we
   take. This has been recognised by International Relations (IR)
   specialists and commentators confronted by the question of the
   discipline, relevance to policy formulation. International Relations can
   add to assessment practitioners' knowledge and skills base since it is
   steeped in theory, deals with issues affecting all levels of society and
   investigates numerous concerns. Concepts and views from the discipline I
   will discuss are change, interactive processes, everyday international
   political economy and agential power and governability. The main
   question is what is the substance of these views and concepts and how
   can they assist the assessment practitioner? Throughout, I will indicate
   the relevance of the views and concepts, to assessment processes with
   practical examples.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {44},
Pages = {307-318},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Autocrats face a dilemma. Continue with fraudulent electoral practices
   and risk revolt, or reduce fraud and risk losing elections. One solution
   is to structure electoral governance such that it allows for
   independence and professionalism at the center, lending credibility to
   the electoral process, and partisan local-level administration, enabling
   fraud at the micro level. Partisan poll workers can help deliver the
   vote by the use of `smart fraud' - fraud that minimizes the risk of
   being caught and is used only when needed. In Armenia, the ruling
   party's vote share, as a proportion of all registered voters, increases
   with 2.5 percentage points in polling stations where the chairperson was
   randomly assigned to the ruling party. Fraud forensics suggests that one
   of the mechanisms behind this was falsification of the results protocol
   during the count. I conjecture that fraud is only used in high-stakes
   elections and that election observers are unable to detect it. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Why do opposition political parties choose to run for parliament in
   semiauthoritarian systems? Existing literature emphasizes the benefits
   that these parties derive from campaigning and running for elections,
   while paying little attention to the politics that occurs within
   legislative institutions under these regimes. Supplementing
   election-centric theories, we argue that opposition actors in
   semiauthoritarian systems also benefit directly from serving in weak
   parliaments and that this helps explain their participation in biased
   elections. We demonstrate this by examining the Muslim Brotherhood's
   legislative performance in Mubarak's Egypt, highlighting the mechanisms
   through which it used its minority presence in parliament to its
   advantage.},

Abstract = {Daesh or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, also known as the
   Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), is one of the most intimidating
   terrorist groups of contemporary world. In addition to many statements,
   resolutions and meetings, various airstrikes have been organized by
   different countries to counteract the terrorist group of ISIS. However,
   the use and success of these airstrikes are open to doubt. Given the
   significance of having a better understanding of this topic and finding
   an efficient method to fight and eradicate terrorism, the present essay
   analyzes the issue in its multifaceted dimensions. More specifically,
   the essay investigates the role of the coalition for the use of
   airstrikes and the indifference of some countries to the problem. In
   doing so, first a definition and brief survey of the concept of
   terrorism are given. Then, the rise of ISIS and its beliefs are
   discussed, followed by discussing the role of anti-ISIS coalition and
   the different meetings in fighting ISIS with an emphasis on the use and
   efficiency of airstrikes. Finally, a conclusion of the discussion is
   presented.},
