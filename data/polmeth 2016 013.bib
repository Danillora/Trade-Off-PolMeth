Abstract = {Notwithstanding the prolific research on the crisis of democracy since
   the 1980s, the attention that has been given to political parties has
   not been enough to fully understand the (increasing lack of) citizen
   support for them. Additionally, there is too little research on how the
   economic context can contribute to changes in support for political
   parties. Focusing on the Portuguese case, this article has three main
   goals: to assess citizen support for parties before and after the
   economic crisis; to explore the contribution of the crisis to changes in
   the explanatory models of support; and finally, to identify the
   consequences of support for parties, with regard to electoral turnout.
   Findings reveal the economic crisis has affected support for parties in
   Portugal, specifically regarding diffuse-institutional support and party
   legitimacy. Changes in public support for parties between 2008 and 2012
   have had consequences on voter turnout.},

Abstract = {Citizenship does not equal belonging. In this paper, we investigate how
   the disjunction between the imagined community' and the formal citizenry
   impacts on citizens' rights. In particular, we analyse decision-making
   on the family migration rights of citizens in France, Germany and the
   Netherlands. Our analysis shows that in these three countries,
   notwithstanding their different migration and citizenship regimes, the
   reduction of citizens' family migration rights is based on the same
   discursive mechanism: the membership' of citizens of migrant origin who
   marry a partner from abroad is called into question. As they are
   excluded from membership of the imagined community, their entitlement to
   family migration rights is decreased. Ethnic conceptions of national
   community, intersecting with gender and class, play a crucial role in
   shaping the rights attached to citizenship in Europe today.},

   (especially procedural instability, noncompliant electors, nation-wide

   questionable Constitutionality, the weakness of its defense, and the

Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {46},
Number = {4},
Pages = {763-784},

Abstract = {This article extends the theory of government agency survival from
   separation of powers to parliamentary government systems. It evaluates
   expectations of increased risk to agencies following transitions in
   government, prime minister or departmental minister, and from
   incongruence between the originally establishing and currently
   overseeing political executive. Using survival models for UK executive
   agencies between 1989 and 2012, the study finds that politics trumps
   performance. Ministers seek to make their mark by terminating agencies
   created by previous ministers, which is reinforced by high media
   attention to the agency. Performance against agency targets is not
   associated with higher termination risk, and replacement agencies do not
   perform any better than those that were terminated. Financial autonomy
   provides some protection for agencies that are less dependent on
   budgetary appropriations.},

Abstract = {Does law habituate republican citizens toward virtue? This article
   addresses the ambiguous relationship between law and civic virtue in
   Quentin Skinner's interpretation of Machiavelli's liberty. I trace
   Skinner's inability to reconcile the role of law with a politics of
   virtue to his humanist interpretation of Machiavelli's theory of
   corruption as a condition caused by mankind's innate selfishness. I
   argue instead that Machiavelli uses the concept of corruption to
   identify the deleterious effects of wealth inequalityand the culture of
   dependence generated by iton the political identity and behavior of
   ordinary citizens. I argue that Skinner's failure to appreciate the
   socioeconomic origins of corruption for Machiavelli prevents him from
   understanding the significance of a constitutional order that nurtures a
   class-based form of social discord for freedom.},

Abstract = {Several of the articles in this volume criticize the use of DW-NOMINATE
   in historical work in American politics and suggest alternative
   approaches to the use of roll call voting data. While many of criticisms
   are certainly valid, their practical implications are often overstated.
   Moreover, the suggested alternatives are either impractical for most
   historically oriented scholars and or do not adequately address the
   underlying problems. Almost all of the criticisms can be addressed by
   correct application of DW-NOMINATE results or those of other closely
   related measures.},

Journal = {REVISTA ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to examine Jose Guilherme Merquior's
   conceptual framework of `social liberalism' in the light of the
   political and social reality of Brazil. This proposal only makes sense
   insofar as it is understood that Brazil forms a part - albeit with some
   reservations - of the West. However, the idea of Brazil as a Western
   country became particularly controversial at a historical time when
   Latin America was regarded as part of a different (or even opposing)
   cultural landscape from that which attracted the West, especially among
   the intellectual mainstream of the Anglo-Saxon countries. On the basis
   of the assumption that our political culture is not exceptional,
   Merquior transformed the liberalism which he believed in and upheld,
   from the prospect of being an ideology of the `second degree' (a term
   used by Roberto Schwartz to describe the liberal ideology in the context
   of 19th Century Brazil), to becoming the most ideal escape route from
   the Brazilian crisis. If our country belongs to the West, and there
   having no a priori incompatibility between liberalism and Brazilian
   political culture, Merquior opens up space for theoretical views of
   different kinds of liberalism to be replaced by the stance of an engaged
   spectator.},

Abstract = {Populism is a means of speaking to voters, a mode of speech that Michael
   Kazin once called ``the populist persuasion.{''} During times of
   economic stress and cultural change, populism often becomes a popular
   means of communication, and has been used by aspirants for the
   presidency ranging from William Jennings Bryan to Bernie Sanders and
   Donald Trump. It is particularly potent when conditions exist that
   refute historian John Crozier's description of the American polity as
   resting on a ``gently graded prosperity.{''} The lack of any ``gently
   graded prosperity{''} in 2016 fueled the candidacies of Bernie Sanders
   and Donald Trump. This article focuses on Trump, noting his penchant for
   action, not adherence to conservative principles or Republican party
   orthodoxy. The ``scourge{''} Donald Trump's populism, like his
   predecessors is that he blames the ``other{''} for the failures of
   American government and the inability of those who aspire to achieve the
   American Dream from achieving their goals. This is the scourge of
   populist candidates who have led their respective parties to ultimate
   defeat and repudiation. In Trump's case, blaming Hispanics and
   immigrants for the country's problems is a scourge that will take the

   policy recommendations for Turkey's refugee crisis, originally published
   in June 2016, in a book titled Sinirlar Arasinda: Insanlik Dramindan
   Insanlik Sinavina (In Between Borders: From A Human Tragedy to a Trial
   of Humanity). The author offers concrete recommendations on a
   structural, humanitarian, and practical level, as well as parses the
   domestic and foreign policy implications of inadequately taking into
   account the likely permanence of the refugees. Advocating for a
   rights-based approach that seeks permanent solutions rather than
   temporary ones, the author emphasizes that the integration of refugees
   in Turkey is vital for the development of a pluralist system.},

Abstract = {This essay critically engages ontological, rhetorical, ethical, and
   political themes pertinent to the concept of sympathy as it appears in
   the poetry and prose of Walt Whitman and Jane Bennett's writing on him.
   I suggest that antagonism is immanent in the ecology of sympathies that
   Bennett theorizes, and that this partly explains why one frequently
   finds antagonistic articulations deeply intertwined with Whitman's most
   sympathetic expressions. I propose that we use the paradoxicaleven
   oxymoronic soundingtrope antagonistic sympathy to evoke this immanent
   relationship between affiliative and antagonistic flows, energies, and
   conditions for ethical and political cultivation. The concept of
   antagonistic sympathy helps us better understand Whitman, the ethical
   and political qualities, pulls, and implications of sympathy, and it
   enables us to theorize entanglements of sympathy and antagonism in ways
   that avoid the worst tendencies of each when isolated from the other.
   Antagonistic sympathy, I argue, is indispensable for radical democratic
   and ecological transformation in a time of rapidly intensifying
   planetary ecological catastrophe.},

Volume = {5},

Abstract = {This article explores the historical roots and temporal centrality of
   the interdependent relationship between liberty and inequality in the
   construction of colonial British America and the early United States. It
   surveys the symbiotic relationship among liberty, law, and civic
   capacity in late medieval and early modern England; the deliberate
   transfer of that relationship to New World polities; the social,
   economic, and demographic conditions that reinforced and stimulated the
   expansion of that relationship during and after the colonial era; and
   its thorough incorporation into the new republican polities and federal
   nation-state constructed during the American Revolution. So deeply
   embedded in colonial and early republican America was this relationship,
   the article argues, that it presented a formidable obstacle to efforts
   by the excluded to uncouple possession of property from civil capacity
   and to widen the scope of the concept and practice of equality in the
   United States.},

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {In presidential nomination campaigns, individual state primaries and a
   national competition take place simultaneously. The relationship between
   divisive state primaries and general election outcomes is substantially
   different in presidential campaigns than in single-state campaigns. To
   capture the full impact of divisiveness in presidential campaigns, one
   must estimate both the impact of national party division (NPD) and the
   impact of divisive primaries in individual states. To do so, we develop
   a comprehensive model of state outcomes in presidential campaigns that
   incorporates both state-level and national-level controls. We also
   examine and compare several measures of NPD and several measures of
   divisive state primaries found in previous research. We find that both
   NPD and divisive state primaries have independent and significant
   influence on state-level general election outcomes, with the former
   having a greater and more widespread impact on the national results. The
   findings are not artifacts of statistical techniques, timeframes or
   operational definitions. The results are consistent-varying very little
   across a wide range of methods and specifications.},

Abstract = {The political representation of women and ethnic minorities has received
   growing attention among political parties around the world. Focusing on
   the British case, we map data and debates concerning the selection of
   female and minority candidates, highlighting the simultaneous and
   interactive role of gender and race in shaping citizens' opportunities
   to stand for and win election. Utilizing data from the Labour Party, our
   analysis illustrates the implications of distinct strategies to include
   members of politically marginalized groupsas well as provides evidence
   for the potential of tandem quotas to result in positive outcomes for
   minority women. Taken together, these findings suggest the need for
   stronger measures on the part of Labour to encourage the selection of
   minority candidates; a shift from single-axis to multiple-axis thinking
   when devising strategies to enhance group representation; and rejection
   of a zero-sum mentality regarding the nomination of female and minority
   candidates.},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of the Crimea annexation in March 2014, the idea of
   hybrid warfare' quickly gained prominence as a concept that could help
   to explain the success of Russian military operations in this conflict.
   Although the concept continues to enjoy widespread popularity in both
   scholarly and policy circles, its utility as an analytical tool is also
   heavily contested. This article adds to the literature critical of the
   hybrid warfare' concept. It argues that in addition to the fact that
   what is now described as a hybrid' approach to war is nothing new, the
   problems pertaining to its utility for the study of contemporary Russia
   go deeper than this. Hybrid warfare' inadequately reflects the direction
   of Russian military modernisation and as such has led to a skewed
   understanding of Russian military capabilities. Moreover, the tendency
   to use hybrid warfare' not only to conceptualise developments in the
   Russian military, but in the country's foreign policy in general, can
   lead to serious unintended consequences.},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Whereas political science has a long history in the higher-education
   provision of many countries, it was only in the early 1970s that it
   became a feature of the provision in Austria. Not only is Austria a
   latecomer to the political science profession, but it is also home to a
   rather small political science community with there only being three
   universities which have established political science departments:
   Innsbruck, Salzburg and Vienna. Today two university political science
   departments have mainstreamed gender into their curriculum, with this
   being the result of the success of feminist entrepreneurs in these
   departments. The provision at the University of Vienna is typified by
   one where professors, associates and external lecturers contribute to
   the curriculum in gender political science. This state of affairs is,
   however, far from secure as the Bologna process, the transformation
   toward an entrepreneurial university as well as budget cuts challenge
   these institutionalizations. This article seeks to explain this mixed
   picture through an analysis of the recent state of the art of teaching
   and gender research in Austrian political science before proceeding to
   point out the favorable factors which fostered the establishment of
   gender studies in Political Science. Finally, the article builds on the
   recent challenging conditions which jeopardizes gender studies within
   the discipline.},

Abstract = {To counter partisan polarization, political theorists like John Rawls
   and political leaders like Barack Obama have sought to locate and
   express consensual elements of American culture that can appeal to or at
   least be accepted by people having political, religious, moral, and
   philosophical differences. While orthodox pluralism previously
   recognized the need for a normative consensus to regulate political
   struggles, a new principled pluralism expands on the contents of the
   American consensus by proposing many political principles and
   philosophical assumptions that are articulated at an intermediate level
   of abstraction, that express the emerging (though not always present)
   common sensibilities of most Americans, and that can be used to justify
   political policies and practices.},

Abstract = {In the mid-1990s, Brazil introduced electronic voting technology that
   reduced residual ballots and consequently expanded de facto
   enfranchisement. We employ a regression discontinuity design similar to
   that of previous studies of the Brazilian electronic voting technology
   to show that electronic technology also caused a sharp rise in party
   label votes (votos de legenda) that can only be explained by voting
   error. We show that this error offsets a large portion of the gains in
   enfranchisement, highlighting the fact that even generally positive
   changes in voting procedures can have negative effects. Our results also
   suggest that party label votes should not be considered a measure of
   party strength in the Brazilian context. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {At the end of the last century, transmission of viral diseases such as
   AIDS and HIV through blood transfusions to patients with
   ``Hemophiliacs'', to kick up a row the discussion about civil liability
   arising from contaminated blood transfusion in the case called
   ``Hemophiliacs'' end trying to get it drew Hemophiliacs material and
   moral damage prompted the judiciary. Among the many factors blood
   transfusion process are involved the responsibility of each of them is
   subject to certain regulation.
   For example blood centers, hospitals, doctors, nurse who transfuse the
   infected blood and resulting that injured party forced to use the
   infected blood and at the end state because of providing and
   distribution of blood as a public service. Blood center has a safety
   commitment and mast distribute a blood to be free of and implication. So
   they are responsible. Just with transfusion unless they reveal other
   factors and causes in fact in this case, the most important issue is the
   way of compensation of injured parties. So not only material remedies
   resulting transfusion of infected blood is indemnify. But in this point
   view that no damages should not be remain compensation. In addition
   moral damages and....
   So because of importance of the subject and importance of the
   compensation of injured parties, it's essential to base on.. Theory,
   implication absolute liability and objective liability for state with
   assuming the direct role of the state in the management of medical
   procedures in public hospitals. And the possibility of the direct role
   of the state in their affliction and regarding the role of the state in
   public health.},

Abstract = {Political theory's deliberative turn has provided novel theoretical
   insights, variously interpreted, into the rationality of communication.
   The goal of this research note is to clarify how these theoretical
   arguments and concepts have informed empirical research. To this end, a
   number of studies in this area are examined, and the argument is made
   that at least two research models inform empirical research, each of
   which embraces different methodological perspectives and understandings
   of the concept of discourse. The standard, political theory approach
   regards discourse as a regulative ideal, with which to assess actual
   political communication and empirically identify cases of deliberation.
   Furthermore, it adopts a co-variational explanatory template. The
   narrative, social theory model sees discourse as a counterfactual ideal
   in the heads of participants in communication, and assumes a narrative
   methodological perspective. These two models imply different theoretical
   choices with different implications for empirical research.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the constitution of the Kirchnerist political
   identity during the government of Nestor Kirchner (2003-2007). The
   hypothesis that guides this research shows that in the period 2003-2007
   Kirchnerist identity was constituted in at least three aspects: I)
   developed a caesura respect to an ignominious past linked to the last
   civic-military dictatorship and the decade of the nineties, also
   identifying the ``corporations{''} as its main antagonist; II) forming
   the image of the ``people{''} by the interpellation to the citizens and
   the ``losers{''} of the neoliberal reforms of the nineties; III)
   appealed to festivities and celebrations typical of the Peronist
   tradition, in line with the vicissitudes of the political situation. He
   also sought to incorporate into its forming political structure the
   Partido Justicialista (PJ), the Confederacion General del Trabajo (CGT)
   and the Central de Trabajadores de la Argentina (CTA), in order to
   acquire political power. The analysis will be based on selected
   Kirchner's speeches during his presidency, useful newspaper articles to
   understand the current political situation and finally relevant
   theoretical literature.},

Abstract = {This article looks at how an electoral reform movement affected
   electoral mobilization during the 13th General Elections in Malaysia.
   The elections are significant because it was the first time an
   opposition coalition, Pakatan Rakyat, managed to secure the highest
   number of parliamentary seats. At the macro-level, the article argues
   that political opportunities have emerged from the development of the
   Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections (Bersih), as well as similar
   groups. A broad set of incentives within authoritarian settings then
   increases citizens' participation in movements on a micro-level. Using
   the structural-cognitive model proposed by Karl Dieter Opp and drawing
   on qualitative evidence through fieldwork observation and interviews, I
   relate the reform movements to citizens' proactive electoral
   mobilization during the 2013 elections.},

Abstract = {Turning away from the project of the common Europe and finding new ways
   for collective identification is a Europe-wide trend today. An
   increasing majority of the EU citizens feel that the EU is mostly
   dealing with non-salient issues that are far away from their everyday
   problems. Additionally, the deadlocks in the management of the recent
   migration crisis and the result of the Brexit referendum also result in
   wide-scale scepticism in both the old and new member states. This paper
   discusses the current dilemmas of European identity with a special focus
   on the East-Central Europeans' attachments. The author builds on the
   constructivist and functionalist theoretical model of identity-net when
   explaining the dilemmas of the common identity. The following questions
   are raised in the paper: Is the civic component of European identity
   fading away in ECE countries? Do ECE citizens trust their European and
   national institutions? Who are ``the others{''} for ECE citizens inside
   and outside its borders? Are there any commonalities and differences
   between ECE member-states with regard to identity formation patterns? In
   order to be able to answer these questions, an interdisciplinary
   approach is taken. The arguments presented in this paper are supported
   by the data of the recent opinion poll surveys.},

Abstract = {Moser et al. provide a formalization of heresthetics, the ``art of
   political strategy{''}, in collective choice settings. In doing so they
   introduce the heresthetically stable set as the set of outcomes least
   susceptible to manipulation of issue dimension. In this note we correct
   a small error in the original paper, and close several open questions
   asked there in. We examine the heresthetically stable set as a
   tournament solution, establishing some basic properties it possesses,
   and many it does not posses. In addition, we relate the heresthetically
   stable set to other tournament solutions, notably the weak uncovered and
   refinements thereof. We find lack of vulnerability to heresthetic
   manipulation is contrary to many desirable properties of choice
   functions, notably majoritarian support.},

Abstract = {15M mobilizations represent the most relevant events of a broader cycle
   of collective actions against austerity and the political status quo in
   the context of recession. This contribution introduces and explores an
   original dataset collected through protest event analysis conducted for
   Spain between 2007 and 2015. It allows us to pin down the longitudinal
   fluctuations of political contention over this period. Based on it, a
   chronology of the cycle of protest is established; moreover, the
   temporal dynamics of some aspects related to protests are analyzed, such
   as protest participants, organizers, levels of disruption, evolution of
   claims and territorial distribution.},

Abstract = {So far, have more written about lawyer, have less successful. Lawyer
   should be independent. Therefore, autonomy of Bar Association has been
   seriously proposed. Autonomy of judiciary and judges has always been
   emphasized in our constitutional law and has been proposed as judiciary
   should be separate of other powers. Judges shouldn't be dependent or
   under power of others. On the other hand, there is no comprehensive and
   sufficient reference in constitutional law about bar association and
   judge and power of attorney is considered under people rights. In spite
   of all emphasis, conception of this deduction is not clear. Attorney
   autonomy is rooted from various bases and has separate and specific
   conception other than judgment. Studying principles of constitutional
   law accurately shows that attorney occupation is not subject of any
   supervisor principle to judiciary, but just having lawyer in procedural
   process is a part of people rights. Therefore, law maker shouldn't see
   them equal to regulate constitutional law and pit attorney power as
   judgment under supervision of judiciary.},

Abstract = {This paper identifies three phases of China's South China Sea policy

   from 2012 to 2013, and proactive adjustment from 2014 to the present.
   These three distinct phases suggest that China does not have a grand
   strategy for the South China Sea. The paper also assesses the
   consequences of China's island building in the South China Sea and the
   costs of its deliberate ambiguity on the international legal front.},

Abstract = {The passage and subsequent implementation of United Nations Security
   Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325 at the international level tend to be
   associated with efforts of governments, non-governmental organizations
   and international organizations that are based primarily in the Global
   North. While such skewed dynamics of global governance are not unique to
   women, peace and security (WPS) issues, widely shared assumptions about
   the Global North being the conceptual, material and (not least)
   institutional home of the resolutions appear to inform debates on UNSCR
   1325 in ways that limit its potential. In response, this article seeks
   to bring attention to the Global South's contributions to the evolution
   of the international WPS agenda. The agency of actors - governmental and
   non-governmental - in the Global South is identified in both
   implementation and non-implementation' of the WPS resolutions. The
   actors are seen to actively contribute to writing' UNSCR 1325, the
   follow-up resolutions, and indeed the broader discourse on women, peace
   and security.},

Abstract = {As with so many aspects of the vice presidency, questions involving
   incapacity in the office have been largely neglected by scholars. While
   discussion of historical episodes involving disability has been
   undertaken regarding presidents, members of Congress, and federal
   judges, no such work has been done regarding vice presidents. Given the
   indispensable role the vice president plays in the continuity of the
   executive branch under the Twenty-Fifth Amendment and the important
   advisory and troubleshooting duties the modern vice president carries
   out, a discussion of the history of vice presidential incapacity is long
   overdue. Such an examination reveals that vice presidential inability is
   not a hypothetical but a real issue.},

Abstract = {Can stronger state-level public policies help protect workers from
   ``wage theft?{''} In recent years, workers' rights groups have responded
   to policy drift and legislative inaction at the national level by
   launching campaigns to enact stronger penalties for wage and hour
   violations at the state level. Many of these campaigns have been
   legislatively successful and formative for the development of
   ``alt-labor.{''} But are such policies actually effective in deterring
   wage theft? Previous scholarship has long concluded that although
   stronger penalties should theoretically make a difference, in practice,
   they do not. But by confining the analysis to the admittedly weak
   national-level regulatory regime, the existing literature has eliminated
   all variation from the costs side of the equation and overlooked the
   rich variety of employment laws that exist at the state level. Using an
   original dataset of state laws, new estimates of minimum wage
   violations, and difference-in-differences analyses of a dozen recently
   enacted ``wage-theft laws,{''} I find that stronger penalties can, in
   fact, serve as an effective deterrent against wage theft, but the
   structure of the policy matters a great deal, as does its enforcement.
   The implications for workers' rights and the changing shape of the labor
   movement are discussed in detail.},

Abstract = {We examine the relationship between material deprivation and different
   types of responses to economic crises by civil society actors. We are
   interested in understanding whether material deprivation has an effect
   on civil society reactions to the crisis and whether political
   opportunity factors contribute to this relationship. In particular, we
   wish to ascertain if the effect of material deprivation is moderated by
   perceptions of political stability, on one hand, and of the
   effectiveness of government, on the other. Our results show that the
   effect of material deprivation on various aspects of responses to the
   crisis varies depending on the perceptions of the political environment.
   This suggests that perceptions of political stability and government
   effectiveness feed into the interpretation of present conditions.
   Therefore, perceptions of political stability and government
   effectiveness act as signals leading material deprivation to become
   politicized as a grievance.},

Title = {New members as party modernisers: The case of the Democratic Unionist
   Party in Northern Ireland},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {65-74},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Amid the literature on members of political parties, surprisingly little
   has been written on the potential or actual impacts that can be made
   upon party strategy or policies by a rapid influx of new members. New
   joiners may have different outlooks and desires than long-standing
   members. Although already sympathetic to the party they are joining, new
   arrivals, if signing up in large numbers, may hold sufficiently
   revisionist views to be able to re-orientate a political party in a
   direction not previously taken. Using data from the first-ever
   membership survey of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in Northern
   Ireland, the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly since 2003
   and the fourth largest UK parliamentary party since 2005, this article
   analyses whether more recent joiners of the Party have brought greater
   pragmatism and moderation to an organisation previously dominated by
   hardline political, religious and ethnic attitudes. Modernisation from
   outsiders who become insiders can be a key aspect of party development.
   The DUP offers one of the stiffest tests of modernisation, given its
   history of opposition to moderation. This article shows that newer
   members have tempered beliefs in one of the most robustly
   ethno-religious parties in Europe. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Human civilization has always generated by great migrations and exactly
   that is why research on migration one of the basic components of
   political science neglected unfortunately. In Islamic culture,
   especially in Shiite political culture, migration is valuable. The value
   of migration in the Shiite political culture is due to migration of the
   Prophet of Islam. Therefore, the main question is what is the roles and
   functions of migration in the Shiite political culture? To answer this
   question, were referred to first-hand and old sources of Shiite Islam.
   Providing a new classification, we concluded that it has important
   status and has five functions in Islam, including political, security,
   educational, social, and Preaching functions.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {44},
Number = {4},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Judges sitting on three-judge panels in the U.S. Courts of Appeals make
   decisions under the shadow of potential review by supervising courts,
   the full circuit sitting en banc and the Supreme Court. Review is more
   likely for published decisions, particularly when a dissent is present.
   Unpublished decisions do not have binding precedential status. These
   factors create the potential for judges to be strategic in deciding
   whether to publish a decision or write a dissent. We develop a formal
   model of decision aggregation that takes the possibility of negotiating
   a tradeoff between the ideological location of a rule and its
   precedential value into account. Implications of our model are tested
   empirically using an original data set of search and seizure cases. Our
   model and results indicate that preferences within the panel and
   judicial hierarchy coupled with discretionary review influence judges'
   decisions regarding publication and dissent, and that these choices have
   important consequences.},

Abstract = {In contemporary feminist theories, transnational and intersectional
   feminisms occupy contested territory. Feminist analyses that are
   situated exclusively within local and national domains and obscure the
   lived impact of globalizing economic and political forces also stand on
   shaky ground. In the following commentary, I will address Tripp's
   nation-centered framing of difference feminisms in specific and
   relational geopolitical contexts. By resituating the author's analysis
   within ongoing debates in feminist theory about the effectiveness of
   transnational and intersectional black feminist analyses, I will
   unsettle the conceptual tidiness of her argument.},

Abstract = {This paper sets out the historical background to the July 15 coup

   tendencies and argues that this is driven by three overlapping
   impetuses. The first is concerns over its civilian colleagues' policy
   towards external threats and internal dissent. The second is the
   military's promotion of its own version of Islamic practice and
   identity. The third is its determination to protect and, where possible,
   advance its economic interests.},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {This article explores the sources of weak party-voting patterns in Irish
   elections, conceptualising this as split-ticket voting. Ireland provides
   a context where election results show split-ticket voting is common, but
   the strategic interpretations of such behaviour that have been very
   prominent elsewhere are not generally applicable. We employ data from
   the Irish national election studies to explore the behaviour of
   individuals embedded in a variety of contexts. The results demonstrate
   the prevalence of split-ticket voting, and they support the validity of
   non-strategic explanations. One source of explanation for the patterns
   we find lies in differences between individuals: partisanship and the
   extent to which voters are attracted to candidates rather than parties
   are important. A second source is contextual: the factors connected with
   the complexity of the choice facing voters have a powerful influence on
   split-ticket voting.},

Abstract = {Differences in the reactions of the Irish Catholic Church to the hunger
   strikes of Terence MacSwiney and Robert Bobby' Sands can be explained
   through the Church's relationship with the British government. The
   Church supported MacSwiney's 1920 hunger strike, whereas the tiered
   hierarchical structure of the Church split in response to Sands' strike
   in 1981. Two major reasons account for the differing reactions to these
   protests: the Church's desire to control Irish education in 1920; and
   the magnification of class and political differences between the Church
   clergy and hierarchy in 1981. The Church was united in its support of
   Irish republicanism during MacSwiney's strike. By the late nineteenth
   century, the British government had ceded most control over Ireland's
   primary and secondary education to Protestant and Catholic churches.
   After the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1921, when the Free
   State government gave the Catholic Church even greater autonomy over
   education, the Church changed its position on hunger striking. During
   Sands' 1981 strike, many lower-class Irish clergymen, who cared less
   about British political sensitivities than the hierarchy, sympathised
   with the hunger strikers' cause. Meanwhile, the Irish and English
   hierarchies continued to condemn violence and hunger striking.},

Abstract = {In 2013-2014, the Parti Quebecois' (PQ) Quebec Charter of Values was
   hotly debated in the province of Quebec and the rest of Canada. For some
   Canadians, it was seen as a calculated move from the PQ to win a
   majority in the next provincial election, highlighting the stereotypical
   Quebec citizen's aversion towards immigrants. For others, it was an
   important policy that confirmed the secular status of Quebec. The media
   played a large role in depicting the average Charter supporter. The goal
   of this study is to empirically test the claims regarding the
   sociodemographic profile of the Charter's supporters. Using opinion poll
   data, we demonstrate that most of these assumptions were false, and that
   the nature of the support evolved during the debate.},

Abstract = {The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000) is the most
   significant international normative framework addressing the
   gender-specific impacts of conflict on women and girls including
   protection against sexual and gender-based violence, promoting women's
   participation in peace and security and supporting their roles as peace
   builders in the prevention of conflict. In the decade since 2004 when
   the UN Secretary-General first called for Women, Peace and Security
   National Action Plans to implement the 1325 agenda in national-level
   peace and security institutions and policies, 55 countries have adopted
   them. This article analyses the global patterns of Women, Peace and
   Security policy diffusion, especially the effects of conflict, democracy
   and women in power on the propensity for states to implement Women,
   Peace and Security National Action Plans. Examining patterns of
   diffusion enables an assessment of how far the Women, Peace and Security
   agenda has spread and what the prospects are for the further diffusion
   of Women, Peace and Security.},

Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {This paper attempts to show the internal unity of the three elements
   -ratio, civitas, libertas- which constitute the political philosophy of
   Spinoza. Methodologically his thought corresponds to the objective model
   of the new science, which implies a break with the normative model of
   practical reason in natural law. Spinoza departs from a physicalist
   ontological conception of nature, which reduces freedom to rational
   necessity and natural right to the natural power of man ({''}tantum
   iuris quantum potentiae{''}). His illustrated program ``from bondage to
   freedom by knowledge{''} does not imply a normative moral solution to
   the problem of living together, but a genetic solution by virtue of the
   need to find an emergency exit to the impasse of the natural state of
   war under the fear of death. In this process, reason itself emerges from
   the womb of affection, through the interaction of the passions of fear
   and sympathy with the biological principle of interest. Once it has
   emerged in the form of ``common notions{''}, this utilitarian reason
   enhances the positive feelings of sympathy and cooperation and underpins
   the agreement to live together under the law. On the basis of this civic
   contract, the difference between potentia and potestas, ius and lex
   respectively, people and State, is established in an internal
   dialectical relationship in which the multitudinis potentia is
   ultimately decisive. This means that the most natural and rational
   regime is democracy, which is the only regime that guarantees that the
   original natural law may become public social right.},

Abstract = {In democracies citizens are supposed to have some control over the
   general direction of policy. According to a pretheoretical
   interpretation of this idea, the people have control if elections and
   other democratic institutions compel officials to do what the people
   want, or what the majority want. This interpretation of popular control
   fits uncomfortably with insights from social choice theory; some
   commentators-Riker, most famously-have argued that these insights should
   make us abandon the idea of popular rule as traditionally understood.
   This article presents a formal theory of popular control that responds
   to the challenge from social choice theory. It makes precise a sense in
   which majorities may be said to have control even if the majority
   preference relation has an empty core. And it presents a simple
   game-theoretic model to illustrate how majorities can exercise control
   in this specified sense, even when incumbents are engaged in purely
   re-distributive policymaking and the majority rule core is empty.},

Abstract = {A researcher's ``pipeline{''} refers to the progression of papers from
   the idea stage to the publication stage. Tenure-track faculty and
   graduate students often are advised that a busy pipeline is the way to
   tenure. However, beyond the simple encouragement to ``work harder,{''}
   ``write more,{''} and ``publish more,{''} not much direction is given to
   junior scholars regarding how they should think about and manage their
   research pipeline. How does one develop a large number of papers from
   their first stages to the pages of respected journals? This article
   discusses the author's system for pipeline management. The system works
   (1) by separating the difficult exercise of publishing a paper into
   eight manageable stages; and (2) by organizing a set of papers using
   these steps according to a practicable timeline.},

Abstract = {Telecommunications was one of the first markets to become part of what
   today comprises the regulatory state, shifting risks and rewards towards
   the private sector, subject to regulation. Parliamentary has oversight
   of policies, the regulator and subventions from HM Treasury, which are
   necessary to extend networks beyond what is commercially viable. Her
   Majesty's Government (HMG) is committed to near universal broadband to
   meet political demands from rural communities and to ensure access to
   `digital by default' government services. Parliamentary committees have
   reviewed the interventions by HMG, especially subventions for network
   extensions, and the work of the regulatory authority, plus work on
   cybersecurity and the collection of metadata. The regulatory system,
   built up over three decades, is too complex for easy oversight and
   review, with significant parts beyond parliamentary reach.},

Abstract = {This essay develops the idea that Analytic and Continental orientations
   to political theory are best comprehended not as mortal enemies, but
   rather as alternative lenses that, together, allow us to better perceive
   a broader range of significant aspects of political life than is
   possible by adhering to only one of these approaches. This claim is
   fleshed out by an analysis of the communicative action paradigm
   developed by Jurgen Habermas. If this paradigm is revised somewhat in
   order to make it less dominated by the ideal of consensuality, it can
   then be taken to be quite attractive in the way it perceptively deploys
   these two lenses.},

Abstract = {The central part of this paper is concerned with the possibilities of
   the Dayton Constitution in the process of accession of Bosnia and
   Herzegovina to European Union. At the first place, this paper contains
   an analysis of the legal power of the general principles of
   international law in the constitutional system of Bosnia and
   Herzegovina, in particular, the pacta sunt servanda principle which has
   significant importance, in legal sense, for implementation obligations
   deriving from the international agreements related to European
   integration. In this regard, it should be emphasized that Article III/3b
   of the BH Constitution implicitly refers to the obligatory
   implementation of the aforementioned principles. In terms of commitments
   deriving from the European integration process, this paper also includes
   an analysis of the other constitutional possibilities for harmonization
   entity legislation and establishment integrated state frame and
   functional unified single market on the territory of Bosnia and
   Herzegovina.},

Volume = {49},

Abstract = {What explains cross-national variation in support for religious
   politics? More precisely, why do even observant believers show uneven
   demand for clerical control of politics? In contrast to theoretical
   alternatives, I argue that demand for clerical control of politics is a
   sign of relative weakness tied to low popular religious participation,
   which alters the risks and benefits of clerical political involvement.
   Two social mechanisms explain this relationship in contexts of active
   religious participation: strong networks between religious and state
   elites, and high levels of political diversity within religious
   communities. World Values Survey data provide statistical evidence that
   (a) support for clerical involvement in politics among regular
   participators is highest and (b) gaps between high and low religious
   participation citizens are largest where aggregate participation is
   lowest. Qualitative evidence regarding the theory's mechanisms draws on
   field interviews in the Philippines during recent church-state tension.},

Title = {Finding Partisanship Where We Least Expect it: Evidence of Partisan Bias
   in a New African Democracy},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {129-154},

Abstract = {Much of the literature on political behavior in Africa's new
   semi-democracies has treated partisan affiliation as weak, purely
   pragmatic, or a proxy for other, more meaningful identities such as
   ethnicity. In this article, I dispute these conceptions by demonstrating
   that partisanship in an African context, like partisanship in
   established democracies, is a psychologically meaningful identity that
   can inspire voters to engage in motivated reasoning. By combining survey
   data with an original dataset of objective indicators of local public
   goods quality in Uganda, I show that supporters of the incumbent
   president systematically overestimate what they have received from
   government, while opposition supporters systematically underestimate.
   Partisan support precedes, rather than results from, this
   mis-estimation. I also show that partisans of the incumbent (opposition)
   are significantly more (less) likely to attribute any bad outcomes they
   observe to private actors rather than the government. I argue that these
   findings are consistent with the predictions of social identity theory:
   the conflict that marked many African political transitions, and the
   mapping of African parties onto existing social cleavages, are
   sufficient conditions for the creation of strong political-social
   identities like those that characterize partisanship in the West. My
   findings indicate that Africanists should take partisanship seriously as
   a predictor of political behavior and attitudes.},

Abstract = {Welfare reforms have been treated intensely in the area of policy
   research. The communication of these reforms have only more recently
   received increased attention. Research on this subject is overall still
   rather heterogeneous, comprising a variety of approaches and emphases.
   This contribution aims at systematizing this literature focusing on how
   reform communication differs depending on the circumstances. The
   overview is structured by prevailing approaches, relevant contextual
   factors, and empirical evidence. It is maintained that treating the
   communication of reforms as a dependent variable-as has been done by
   some more recent studies-opens up a more systematic approach. Finally,
   the literature survey points to conceptual and methodological problems
   and challenges in the systematic comparative analysis of welfare reform
   communication.},

Abstract = {``If only there was a Palestinian Gandhi{''} has been a common refrain
   in recent years. Yet in reality, Palestinians have a long history of
   relying on nonviolence. However, this nonviolence has received no
   constructive response from either Israel or the international community.
   The failure to acknowledge and welcome the Palestinian nonviolent
   movement serves to prolong the conflict and its negative effects, and
   lays bare the refusal of the international community to address the
   rights abuses at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This
   article narrates Palestinian use of both violence and nonviolence in
   their struggle to achieve national self-determination and other basic
   rights, and assesses the potential of nonviolent action to enable a just
   resolution of their situation.},

Abstract = {Has the European Union (EU) succeeded in socializing citizens to support
   the democratic values it claims to promote? On the face of it, the
   prevailing skepticism precludes any expectation of a successful
   socialization of EU citizens to the EU values. Yet, according to the
   socialization hypothesis, citizens' support for these values is expected
   to increase as countries accumulate more years of the EU membership.
   Using survey data to isolate distinct dimensions of democratic values,
   we examine differences among countries in this regard, as well as
   changes within countries over time. Results confirm the socialization
   hypothesis, showing that support for democratic values is generally
   higher in countries with more years of the EU membership, and that this
   support trends upwards over time.},

Abstract = {Rousseau consistently declares that commercial society prevents us from
   being free because it makes us dependent on others and on endless
   desires in ways we cannot control. Yet, in Emile, Rousseau makes the
   surprising claim that it is possible for an elite to be free in
   commercial society. This possibility reveals a third way between the
   model of man and of citizen, that is, the model of natural man in
   society. I argue that it provides an original way of resisting
   dependence through a combination of distance from corrupt values and
   adaptation to the mechanisms of the economic market. Emile's ultimate
   function, however, is critical in addition to being practical and
   pedagogical. By following Emile's experiences, the reader learns the
   unbearably high cost of commercial society: Freedom within it is
   impoverished and available only to the few.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Abstract = {This article argues that the effective participation in systems of
   multilevel governance such as the European Union (EU) requires national
   parliaments to become more `cooperative' institutions. In fact,
   legislatures are increasingly dependent on obtaining information from
   third parties such as other national parliaments and EU institutions for
   effectively scrutinizing EU politics. The Lisbon Treaty provisions also
   encourage this increasing interaction with external actors. Yet, this
   article shows that effective participation in EU affairs also requires
   more regular and more intensive cooperation with domestic actors such as
   the government or upper chambers. Finally, the need for more cooperation
   also applies to the internal parliamentary setting and covers the
   interaction between government and opposition parties, between sectoral
   committees, and between the parliamentary administration and MPs.
   Drawing on specific instances of national parliamentary involvement in
   EU affairs throughout the entire policy cycle, the article will show
   that adopting these cooperative strategies renders national
   parliamentary participation in EU politics more effective. Yet, the
   requirement to act in a more cooperative way risks at the same time to
   undermine a further politicization of the EU among more substantial
   political issues.},

Abstract = {Scott Walker's meteoric rise from a Milwaukee county executive in 2010
   to a leading contender for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination
   surprised many observers. But Walker's trajectory is part of a robust
   tradition dating back to the 1870s of conservative presidential hopefuls
   and presidents advancing and defining their careers through union
   busting. Like Governor Walker, Governor Hayes, McKinley, and Coolidge
   used confrontations with organized labor to thrust themselves into the
   national spotlight and position themselves for a presidential run.
   Challenging labor has also boosted the reputations of incumbent
   presidents for tough and decisive leadership, most recently, as Walker
   knew well, in the case of Ronald Reagan's response to the air traffic
   controllers' strike. Presidents and presidential hopefuls have battled
   organized labor to demonstrate that they are presidential material, and
   Walker learned the lesson well: union busting pays.},

Abstract = {Italy is often presented as a showcase of populist parties. In the 2013
   parliamentary elections, half of the Italian electorate voted for a
   party that has been labelled populist. During the 1994-2011 period,
   Italy witnessed four coalition governments dominated by populists. In
   line with the framework guiding this special issue, Italy thus offers a
   unique opportunity to trace the reactions of political and societal
   actors to populists in government. We propose that it is necessary to
   examine not only how populism's opponents react, but also how fellow
   populists respond. Indeed, we observe in Italy, on the one hand, what we
   will call mutating populism and, on the other hand, a peculiar mixture
   of paralysis, antagonism, and imitation by their opponents. This
   contribution is structured as follows: first, we describe Italian
   populism in the context of the end of the Italian First Republic and the
   emergence of the new party system under the Second Republic. In the
   process we discuss events under the four Berlusconi governments
   (1994-1995; 2001-2005; 2005-2006; 2008-2011). In each phase, we
   distinguish between populist and anti-populist contenders. We also
   describe the reactions abroad to governing Italian populists, especially
   within the European Union.},

Abstract = {My aim in this article is to show that there is distinctive normative
   value to thinking about a liberal polity as an agent with integrity that
   can be threatened, paralleling the integrity of an individual person. I
   argue that the idea of liberal integrity organizes and clarifies
   important moral intuitions concerning the policies of liberal
   democracies, especially with regard to their global conduct. This idea
   provides a novel organizing framework for liberal values that currently
   seem disparate. It also captures important moral intuitions as to how
   the tainted histories of actual liberal societies should bear on their
   global conduct. Finally, this idea explains, in a way that a simple
   appeal to familiar liberal values arguably cannot, why liberal polities
   have identity-based moral reasons not to entangle themselves in
   manifestly illiberal practices beyond their bordersreasons whose
   significance becomes apparent in scenarios and real-world cases that
   global political theory overlooks.},

Abstract = {Being one of the core values of the European Union, human rights have
   been centrally located in the European Union-Turkey relations especially
   since the country gained the candidate status in 1999. In human rights
   practices, the actor who comes to the forefront most on behalf of the
   state against the citizens whose rights must be protected is the police
   force. Therefore, the security practices enforced by the police form a
   huge part of human rights practices in the state and thus play a
   decisive role in Turkey's relations with the Union. This article
   presents an evaluation of the so-called `internal security package',
   which has just passed into law, and its potential impact on European
   Union-Turkey relations. The package includes specific amendments
   regarding the police duties and authorities, which unarguably affect
   human rights practices in the country. As the Union lacks a uniform norm
   relating to the security practices the package in question contains, the
   answer to the question will be sought by screening two sources: EU
   progress reports on Turkey and relevant ECtHR decisions, which provide
   definite judgements regarding the threats and risks posed by the package
   under discussion.},

Abstract = {The fivefold increase of the number of preferential trade agreements
   (PTAs) during the last quarter century has been largely explained by the
   discriminative nature of such agreements, which has triggered
   ``competitive liberalization{''} and PTA formation among nonmembers
   through a domino effect. Based on the author's interviews with European
   Union (EU) trade officials and policy makers at the European Commission,
   this article evaluates EU trade policy developments during the last
   quarter century and lays out EU policy responses to the proliferation of
   PTAs in Latin America and East and Southeast Asia. The article concludes
   that the EU has adopted ``defensive{''} and ``proactive{''} trade policy
   responses in Latin America and East and Southeast Asia, thus augmenting
   the discriminative pressures and reinforcing the discrimination-fueled
   proliferation of PTAs.},

Abstract = {From uncertain beginnings, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM)
   has grown, over almost ten years, into the regional organisation's
   largest peace-support operation. Bolstered by a multilayered mission
   architecture through which the UN and bilateral donors provide
   financial, logistical and technical support, it has achieved important
   gains against the jihadi Islamist organisation Al-Shabaab. The apparent
   viability of these partnerships has seen AMISOM hailed as a successful
   model of collaboration between regional and international structures.
   Peter Albrecht and Cathy Haenlein examine a less-studied dimension of
   this model, namely the intersection of these arrangements with the
   structural fragmentation that has increasingly come to define the
   mission.},

Title = {`Our Whole History has been Ruined!' The 1981 Hunger Strike and the
   Politics of Republican Commemoration and Memory},
Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {44-62},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {This article will analyse the contested and complex commemorative
   politics associated with the Irish republican hunger strikes of
   1980-1981, and the struggle over their legacies during the course of the
   last 40 years, and the last decade in particular. This contest has been
   framed not simply by the expected disputes between the republican
   narrative and those memories associated with the
   Protestant/unionist/loyalist communities or the `official'
   interpretation of the British state. For many years, the broad
   republican `family' could commemorate and celebrate the self-sacrifice
   and martyrdom of the hunger strikers as a foundational and unifying
   narrative for the movement. The first section of the article will
   establish the central significance of the commemoration of these events
   for Irish republicanism's sense of continuity with past incarnations of
   the movement. The second section will analyse the politics of memory in
   the contemporary, post-Good Friday Agreement Republican commemorative
   landscape. This landscape is no longer pristine and uncomplicated. In
   2005, the former Public relations officer for the IRA prisoners in the
   Maze/Long Kesh prison, Richard O'Rawe, alleged in his book Blanketmen,
   that the hunger strike had been prolonged by the Provisional IRA
   leadership outside the jail for political gains. These claims have
   triggered a long-running and ongoing dispute between erstwhile comrades.
   All sides in the contemporary political conflict within republicanism
   have attempted to recruit the historical and mythical `symbolic capital'
   of the hunger strikers to their respective causes. This has seen the
   practices of commemoration become weapons in the battle over the past of
   the movement, but also over the current and future trajectory of Irish
   republicanism. The article will argue that conflict over the
   commemoration of the hunger strikes is now one of the most visible and
   important dimensions of the fragmented character of the republican
   family, and represents a crucial component in the contemporary politics
   of Irish republican memory.},

Abstract = {The political ramifications of the failed Resources Super Profit Tax
   have been widely documented, yet the causes of this political failure
   are more contested. Many accounts highlight the discursive power of
   business and the effectiveness of their campaign against the mining tax.
   Effective business activism certainly played its part, but this article
   argues that strategic failings on the part of government also influenced

Title = {THE ``SECURITIZATION{''} OF THE EAP POLICY IN THE EU: THE EXTERNAL
   EUROPEANIZATION IN THE WIDER EUROPE},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {36-58},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The European Partnership (EaP) has demonstrated that the EU has deep
   concern in ``Wider Europe{''} and it has a vital interest in the
   ``wider{''} Cohesive Europe through an intensive cohesion policy in
   Eastern Europe. This specific policy needs a new conceptual framework
   based on the three analytical pillars of the (1) External
   Europeanization and/or external governance, (2) Deep and Comprehensive
   Free Trade and (3) the largest possible, complex meaning of security.
   The Ukrainian crisis has also triggered divergences in the EU foreign
   policy, but the main tendency of the securitization of the EaP policy
   and the ensuing rediscovery of the geopolitics has been clear. The EaP
   is a ``nested game{''} or two-level game reflecting the dynamics of both
   the domestic and international politics in the countries concerned. The
   paper outlines the key features of this nested game and provides a
   ``horizon scanning{''} on the increasing high uncertainty in Wider
   Europe. The nested game model applies also to the Visegrad Four (V4)
   states. In the present decade there have been ``critical elections{''}
   in the V4 states that have caused deep changes in their domestic
   political systems and, according to the logic of the nested game, they
   have provoked divergences among these states both in their EU and EaP
   relationships. At the same time, the last Quarter- Century has produced
   many common problems and interests in the V4 states in their catching up
   process and in their global security perceptions. This paper argues that
   despite their current divergences, the V4 states could and should
   improve the EU Core-Periphery Divide with the joint interest
   representation in the EU to avoid the further peripherialization.},

Abstract = {Why do bureaucrats from developing countries cooperate internationally?
   I argue that international inter-agency cooperation in the Global South
   results from the need of expert bureaucrats to invest in skill formation
   when governments do not. When states cut funding, expert bureaucrats
   cooperate with foreign peers to upgrade their skillsets because career
   advancement is contingent on up-to-date expertise. To test my theory, I
   use cross-national co-sponsorship data of projects in nuclear energy,
   science and technology (NEST) for 69 countries (1980-2008). Results show
   that bureaucrats cooperate internationally when government spending
   decreases and that cooperation is more likely to occur among bureaucrats
   with higher initial skill levels and similar levels of professional
   development (i.e. homophily). These findings carry implications for the
   study of global governance in the developing world.},

Abstract = {The paper aims to analyze from the perspective of liberal democracy the
   concept of humanistic education within the thought of Martha Nussbaum in
   order to establish some civic competences within democratic practice. In
   order to achieve such a purpose, the paper is divided in two moments:
   first, it identifies the concept of humanistic education in Martha
   Nussbaum's thought in relation to liberal democracy; second, within the
   framework of humanistic formation it establishes the civic competences
   required for democratic practice. Based on the theoretical contributions
   of contemporary thinkers such as Morin, Sartori, Marsh and Stoker, the
   paper links the categories of humanistic education, liberal democracy
   and civic competences. Finally, by demarcating the reach of the paper
   within the field of the political studies, particularly within the
   normative theory and political liberalism, the purpose of the paper is
   not to elaborate an education theory or a pedagogical model that
   explains the different didactic strategies of the teaching of
   humanities, but to reflect on the role played by the humanistic
   formation in a liberal democracy. Therefore, from the perspective of
   political theory the paper aims to offer to academia an analysis on the
   concept of humanistic education within liberal democracy from the
   perspective of Nussbaum's philosophy.},

Abstract = {The European Union can respond by various means to violations of the law
   on the part of member states. Violations of individual provisions can
   lead to treaty infringement proceedings, which can end with substantial
   fines. If a state violates the fundamental values of the EU, proceedings
   in accordance with Art. 7 of the Treaties of the European Union come
   into consideration. That can lead to a state losing some of its
   membership rights within the EU. The hurdles to setting proceedings in
   motion are correspondingly high. In addition, the European Commission
   has developed preliminary proceedings, which are to address grievances
   through dialogue with the state concerned. Such preliminary proceedings
   were used for the first time in the case of Poland. However, it is
   legally controversial. By contrast, treaty infringement proceedings
   under Art. 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union
   could also be successful in this case.},

Abstract = {In Robust Political Economy, Mark Pennington argues for a minimal state
   founded not on neoclassical economic principles but on a return to
   classical liberalism. Pennington makes his case on the basis of Hayek's
   ``knowledge{''} problem and public-choice theory's ``incentive{''}
   problem. While this is a welcome start, classical liberalism is a
   promising agenda for a new economics, and for the ``reform of
   capitalism,{''} only if it is accompanied by an explicit rejection of
   Milton Friedman's subordination of normative to positive economics, and
   by a move beyond the traditional division of the economy into twin
   spheres (the state and the market) to embrace a third element: the
   domestic sphere.},

Journal = {OSTEUROPA},

Number = {3},
Pages = {33+},
Abstract = {Many politicians in the Czech Republic see their country as lacking in
   size and influence. Numerous political scientists also take this view.
   Structuralist theories of international relations reinforce this stance.
   The dominance of the Great Powers is mirrored even in the academic
   world. After 1989, continuous comparison with Western countries or
   Western research was supposed to serve the end of ``catching up{''} with
   them. For several years, however, fatalism has been spreading. Yet a
   look at the history of the field of International Relations in the Czech
   Republic shows that in politics and in academia, complaints about
   marginality have above all one consequence: self-marginalisation.},

Abstract = {Recent debates on collective action and social cognition are changing
   the philosophy of social science from both the epistemological and the
   normative point of view. Evidence in particular turns out to support
   traditionally controversial claims about the nature of social action,
   the normative infrastructure of cooperation, and democratic theory. In
   this paper I will argue that considering the role of social cognition in
   underpinning cooperation and communication is likely to affect the
   theory of communicative action. As for epistemology, it supports an
   account of cooperation and communication that removes language from a
   foundational position and displaces it into a more specific constructive
   position, thus dispensing with transcendental arguments. As for
   normativity, it suggests an account of moral development that runs
   against Kohlberg's view and suggests a different route to moral
   universalism.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICS},

Volume = {48},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Over the past fifteen years, Latin America has seen a wave of leftist
   governments take office with some leaders increasing the state's role in
   the economy, while others continue and even intensify market-oriented
   reforms. Building on the concept of mandates in the American politics
   literature, and supplemented by personal interviews conducted with Latin
   American policymakers and empirical work, I argue that whether leftist
   presidents implement policies away from the market depends on their
   margin of electoral victory combined with whether the president's party
   holds a majority of seats in the legislature. As much American politics
   work shows, presidents that win elections by landslides are better able
   to claim a mandate. However, the capacity of presidents to convert
   massive victories into policy change also requires control of the
   legislature by the president's party.},

Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-44},
Abstract = {Within democratic societies, counter-terrorism is almost exclusively
   about crime prevention. A broad and holistic approach to preventing
   terrorism can be based on nine preventive mechanisms: building normative
   barriers against terrorism, reducing radicalisation and recruitment,
   deterrence, disruption, incapacitation, protecting vulnerable targets,
   reducing benefits to terrorists, reducing harm, and facilitating
   disengagement from terrorism. Counter-terrorist policies which are only
   based on a narrow range of repressive mechanisms and military measures
   tend to become overly heavy-handed, producing serious negative side
   effects which serve to enhance the problem rather than reducing it. A
   more holistic approach, making use of the entire range of preventive
   mechanisms, may lighten the impact of the ``hard{''} measures by relying
   more on the impact of the ``softer{''} and more positive measures to
   build moral barriers, reduce recruitment, and facilitate exit from
   terrorist movements.},

Abstract = {The article studies the specifics of mythologization and stigmatization
   of the peripheral communities in the Soviet empire on the example of the
   civil war in Central Asia. Focusing on the phenomenon of Basmachi
   movement, L.Blyakher and I.Yarulin show the reasons for why the very
   term ``basmachi{''} emerged, how its volume and content were formed, and
   what functions it performed in relation to the peripheral community.
   According to the authors' conclusion, the attempts to reconsider
   Basmachi movement that have been increasingly undertaken in the recent
   years have failed precisely because within the Soviet stigmatizing
   discourse this term referred to the movements that were extremely
   different both in their political preferences and social nature, but at
   some point were declared enemies by the Soviet authorities.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE INVESTIGACIONES POLITICAS Y SOCIOLOGICAS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {49-76},
Abstract = {In October 2014 the national elections in Uruguay took place, the
   expresident Tabare Vazquez won and the Broad Front got again the
   parliamentary majority. The electoral results were quite similar to
   2009, confirming the Broad Front's popular support, with the presidency
   since 2005. This paper aims to analyse the results in both presidential
   and legislative elections in Uruguay in 2014, contextualizing them in
   the Uruguayan party system evolution in recent decades, also focusing on
   the territorial distribution of the vote, and the prior political and
   socioeconomic context to the elections. Likewise, the main key factors
   to explain the third consecutive victory of the Front are highlighted,
   as well as what these results involve for the future, both for president
   Tabare Vazquez and for the party. This election confirms the
   predominance of the Broad Front in Uruguay, in opposition to the two
   historical traditional parties, National and Coloured, which have been
   in the opposition for more than 10 years, as well as the territorial
   division of the country: inland supports center-right traditional
   parties, and the urban zone, Montevideo specially, the left.},

Title = {The Policy Influence of Sustainability Indicators: Examining Use and
   Influence of Indicators in German Sustainability Policy Making},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {480-499},
Abstract = {In 2002 Germany adopted an ambitious national sustainability strategy,
   covering all three sustainability spheres and circling around 21 key
   indicators. The strategy stands out because of its relative stability
   over five consecutive government constellations, its high status and
   increasingly coercive nature. This article analyses the strategy's role
   in the policy process, focusing on the use and influence of indicators
   as a central steering tool. Contrasting rationalist and constructivist
   perspectives on the role of knowledge in policy, two factors, namely the
   level of consensus about policy goals and the institutional setting of
   the indicators, are found to explain differences in use and influence
   both across indicators and over time. Moreover, the study argues that
   the indicators have been part of a continuous process of structuring' in
   which conceptual and instrumental use together help structure the
   sustainability challenge in such a way that it becomes more manageable
   for government policy.},

Abstract = {Liberalism restrains the concept of friendship to the simple private
   sphere in which individuals wish to weave friendly relations only with
   other individuals chosen consciously and independently of being
   citizens. The conception of friendship and citizenship that Ralph Waldo
   Emerson draws up can be considered as the link between his strong
   impulse to the exaltation of liberal individualism and the tension
   towards the construction of the modern state as democratic association.
   Democracy and freedom are derived from the sacred truth that every man
   possesses in himself the divine reason and was created equal to every
   other man, and therefore, according to Emerson, the only principle to
   establish a true republic is represented by goodwill.},

Abstract = {The interview took place in Santiago, Chile in November 2015 and was
   conducted by Gonzalo Bustamante, professor of political philosophy at
   Universidad Adolfo Ibanez. Martin Jay in the course of this interview
   addresses the links between Critical Theory, Cambridge School, and
   Conceptual History,,giving special attention to an ``event{''} as a
   limited category, critical rationality and the contextual genealogies of
   the different branches of historical studies mentioned before. Jay
   concludes that one of the possible limitations of the ``in context' work
   of authors such as Quentin Skinner and the so-called Cambridge School is
   given by the impossibility to reduce the perlocutionary effect of events
   to the illocutionary intentions of the authors. In line with Claude
   Romano, in the interpretation of Jay, an `event' always has an
   ``an-archic{''} condition that makes its limitation to previous networks
   of meaning impossible.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to make a historical path through the
   development of political science in Brazil, considering the background
   of political thought and major milestones in the creation of this field
   of knowledge. To do this, the following dimensions will be taken: 1)
   Teaching institutions; 2) research centers; 3) The main actors in the
   field; 4) academic networks; and 5) The main products ( scientific
   journals and books, mainly). We will try to link the historical
   development of the country ( external history) with the own processes of
   the field of knowledge ( internal history); trying to overcome the
   static view of disciplinary studies to observe from a dynamic
   perspective, the constitution of political science in the country.},

Abstract = {This paper responds to arguments presented by the four contributors to
   the symposium on The Economist's Oath, concerning the failure of the
   economics profession to recognize and respond appropriately to the
   daunting ethical questions that arise in the context of its work. The
   essay first explores the paternalistic sensibilities of many economists,
   who believe that their expertise grants them authority to decide for
   others. Second, the essay acknowledges the risks associated with the
   project to bring professional ethics into economics but expresses the
   hope that ethical awareness of the right sort will undermine the
   extraordinary hubris now on display in the profession. Third, the paper
   endorses assertive pluralism in economics and the view that
   ``monotheoreticism{''} is cause for grave concern. Finally, the paper
   explores the complexity of the matter of harm as well as econogenic
   harm, the harm economists cause as they presumably try to do good.},

Abstract = {During 2015 Prime Minister Cameron found himself under intense domestic
   and international pressure over his apparent reluctance to maintain
   United Kingdom defence spending at the NATO target level of 2 per cent
   of GDP. Most commentators attributed this reluctance to the
   inevitability of defence cuts if the government wished to meet its
   deficit reduction targets. However, the aftermath of the general
   election saw a sudden decision to maintain UK defence spending at the
   NATO target level. This u-turn is one of the more curious episodes in
   recent British defence policy. In this article we explore the reasons
   why, at a time of continuing cuts and austerity measures and against all
   the political signals, a decision was made to meet the 2 per cent
   target, and what this means for the UK's defence policy. In doing so, we
   analyse why most commentators assumed that defence cuts were inevitable,
   the domestic and international factors that explain the government's
   apparent u-turn and what this revised defence budget settlement meant
   for the new 2015 National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and
   Security Review.},

Title = {Narrative Deliberation? On Storytelling as a Necessary Component of
   Public Deliberation},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {53},
Number = {1},
Pages = {79-99},
Abstract = {This paper deals with the place of narrative, that is, storytelling, in
   public deliberation. A distinction is made between weak and strong
   conceptions of narrative. According to the weak one, storytelling is but
   one rhetorical device among others with which social actors produce and
   convey meaning. In contrast, the strong conception holds that narrative
   is necessary to communicate, and argue, about topics such as the human
   experience of time, collective identities and the moral and ethical
   validity of values. The upshot of this idea is that storytelling should
   be a necessary component of any ideal of public deliberation. Contrary
   to recent work by deliberative theorists, who tend to adopt the weak
   conception of narrative, the author argues for embracing the strong one.
   The main contention of this article is that stories not only have a
   legitimate place in deliberation, but are even necessary to formulate
   certain arguments in the first place; for instance, arguments drawing on
   historical experience. This claim, namely that narrative is constitutive
   of certain arguments, in the sense that, without it, said reasons cannot
   be articulated, is illustrated by deliberative theory's own narrative
   underpinnings. Finally, certain possible objections against the strong
   conception of narrative are dispelled.},

Abstract = {The article analysed the electoral system in elections to the Spanish
   Congress, its proportionality and impact on the shape of the party
   system. It is based on the assumption that long-standing dominance of
   two political parties is the result of settings of the electoral system.
   The main aim was to identify the key factors that influence the final
   results of elections. By analysis of the individual components of the
   electoral system, the paper identified the size of constituencies in
   combination with the electoral formula that have key impact on election
   results. Based on quantitative data the text showed that the adjustment
   of the system does not generate two party system format. However, under
   certain circumstances it can produce results with a significant
   disproportionality. The article also explained the institutional factors
   that allow the relevant representation of parties in third and fourth
   place. By knowing the facts, paper reviews previous theories that
   pointed to the direct closeness of the electoral system and the Spanish
   form of the two party system.},

Abstract = {This article discusses possible issues of how media content and exposure
   were linked in previous research. It argues that the original
   conclusions of the article `Who's Afraid of Conflict? The Mobilizing
   Effect of Conflict Framing in Campaign News' do not hold due to the
   chosen operationalization. It also demonstrates that using the proposed
   methodology, both exposure to conflictual and non-conflictual news yield
   the same substantive conclusion. In addition to re-evaluating the role
   of conflict, the article contributes to the discussion on how to
   integrate media and individual-level measures in the study of electoral
   behavior.},

Abstract = {Civil-military relations, a subject of enduring concern in the US and a
   matter of intense debate during the presidential administration of Bill
   Clinton, have receded in the public mind to a matter of little immediate
   concern. As such, it is important to determine what tomorrow's senior
   military leaders are thinking in this regard. Gregory Foster analyses
   the views expressed by a number of these future leaders enrolled in a
   course on civil-military relations at the National Defense University in
   Washington, DC, providing an insight into the minds of those who will
   lead tomorrow's US military.},

Abstract = {After having traced the publishing history of the Notebooks, from their
   first edition in thematic form to the new critical edition presently
   being completed, the essay then deals with the peculiarities of
   Gramsci's prison writing, a full understanding of which is necessary in
   order to capture the author's ``rhythm of thought{''}. Some of these
   peculiarities - starting with the use of school notebooks, rather than
   notepads or single sheets, as writing material - were imposed by prison
   conditions, while others stem from ``rules{''} which he followed more or
   less knowingly (some continually and others only in certain phases of
   his work) in writing the notes. The study of this behaviour, together
   with a minute analysis of the physical nature of the prison notebooks
   (covers, interventions by the prison authorities, handwriting and so on)
   has provided a notable quantity of indirect dating elements which,
   together with Gramsci's (sparse) direct indications, has allowed us to
   reconstruct with ever greater precision the chronology of the individual
   notebooks and the blocks of notes they contain. The composite nature of
   Gramsci's manuscripts has also emerged quite clearly, manuscripts which
   may be divided (with some approximation, due to the presence of ``mixed
   notebooks{''}, into notebooks devoted to translation, miscellaneous
   notebooks and special ones. The new critical edition, devoting one
   volume (in its turn divided into different books) to each of these three
   typologies of notebook, aims at the most faithful restoration possible
   of this essential aspect of the prison work.},

Abstract = {The year 1989 was a breakthrough, not only for the Polish political
   system but also for the situation of mass communication media, which had
   been almost completely state-controlled in the People's Republic of
   Poland. As a result of democratic transformations, pluralism, foreign
   capital and various private media became part of the Polish media
   market. Political system transition occurred along with other changes
   similar to those taking place in other countries, such as the dynamic
   development of electronic media, Internet expansion, concentration on
   media markets, globalisation, media convergence, etc. Legal,
   organisational and technological transformations significantly affected
   the contemporary media system in Poland and the professional situation
   of journalists. This paper outlines the most important aspects connected
   with the functioning of mass media in the Polish Republic.},

Abstract = {The article examines the transformations of the geopolitical order in
   the post-Soviet space. According to A. Goltsov's assessment, the
   geopolitical order in the territory of the former USSR is determined
   primarily by the ratio of power between the Russian Federation and
   macro-empire of the West. However, in some sub-regions the geopolitical
   order also largely depends on other external actors' policy. For
   example, Turkey and Iran play a significant role in the South Caucasus,
   and the geopolitical and geo-economic influence of China continues to
   increase in the Central Asia. As regards the geopolitical order
   established in the Central and Eastern Europe, Goltsov classifies it as
   bipolar. At the same time, he points out the possibility of a compromise
   between the EU and Russia in the distribution of spheres of primary
   influence, which will pave the way for the transformation of the
   confrontational order into the bi-centric order of peaceful interaction.},

Title = {ONCE AGAIN ON ETHICS OF SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2016},
Number = {5},
Pages = {144-151},
Abstract = {Over the past few years, a lot of publications by Russian authors have
   been devoted to assessment of the quality of scientific publications -
   as a rule, with the focus on bibliometric indices that arc calculated on
   the basis of the number of scientist's publications and the number of
   their citations. Such emphasis is, on the one hand, based on the
   relative novelty of the widespread use of bibliometric indices in the
   Russian academic community; on the other hand, on the fact that these
   indices have acquired the status of one of the main and sometimes the
   only criterion for assessing the contribution to science and the quality
   of work of individual scientists, research teams and entire academic
   institutions. Due to this fact, little attention was paid to other
   aspects of the preparation of manuscripts for publication, such as
   correctness of citation, peer review process, interaction with editors.
   Such underestimation of their significance is fraught with decline m the
   quality of scientific publications. Understanding of scientific ethics
   is of particular importance for young researchers. These factors led to
   organization of a large event: in February 2016, the round table
   ``Ethics of Scientific Publications{''} was held at the Institute of
   Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Representatives and chief
   editors of the leading sociological and political science journals took
   part in the event. Agenda of the round table included relevant problems
   of academic publishing, such as ethical issues of interaction between
   authors, editors and reviewers, rules of citation, rules of assessment
   of the originality of scholarly texts, reprints of articles, and
   feasibility of signing an author's contract M a printed form. After
   discussing the question of the criteria of originality of the scientific
   text, the audience came to the conclusion that the degree of originality
   is determined by whether the article contributes to the scholarly
   knowledge: it should either outline some new propositions and
   conclusions or offer a different approach to representation of the
   material. The experts agreed that bibliography of academic paper should
   include only the sources used in the process of its preparation. The
   editors unanimously stated that improper citation cannot be allowed in
   any form, while it is the author of the manuscript (and not the
   editorial team) who guarantees the credibility of used data and accuracy
   of citation. Considerable attention was paid to the issue of ethical
   standards related to the publication of the article in the Internet. The
   participants drew attention to the fact that publication of the article
   metadata is possible without any restrictions, while the publication of
   its full text requires a mandatory consent of the editors. The editors
   exchanged a number of their knowhow: for instance, it was suggested that
   authors should submit their manuscripts along with a ``passport{''} of
   their study, which includes additional information on it and facilitates
   work of editors and peer reviewers.},

   Throughout the analysis, an attempt is made to prove that the evolution
   of palm oil plantations in the region did not only respond to
   agricultural policies of corporate promotion in the Catatumbo region, in
   the ``Norte de Santander{''} province, but to international policies on
   the eradication of illegal crops. Also an attempt is made to prove that
   the peasant farmer economy was displaced in pro of developing extractive
   economies within the global agro-fuels market where a new order of
   capital accumulation was promoted, framed within the large scale
   commercial agriculture.},

Abstract = {Scholarship on primary election outcomes has largely ignored the ability
   of political parties to shape outcomes and influence the decisions of
   candidates to compete for the party's nomination. Only recently have
   theories of parties as networks of policy demanders suggested that
   parties influence the candidate nomination process. Previous attempts to
   document party control of primaries, however, have only tested these
   theories on small or unrepresentative samples of primary races or have
   looked at general election results after the party's nominee has already
   been selected. Using a simple and easily understood measure of party
   support, I show that candidates who are less connected to the party are
   less likely to win and also less likely to remain a candidate in the
   primary. I find that parties not only are effective in helping
   candidates win but also are influential in excluding certain electoral
   options from being presented to primary voters.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the results of the 2016 parliamentary election in
   the Slovak Republic, with a special emphasis on the regional aspects of
   participating political parties' election campaigns. It summarizes the
   election results for the country as a whole, as well as separately by
   region. An empirical analysis of party electoral performance at the
   district level suggests that the incumbent Smer party tended to do well
   in districts with higher rates of unemployment and a lower proportion of
   university-educated population. Similar patterns hold for the Slovak
   ethnic nationalist Slovak National Party and the far-right People's
   Party Our Slovakia. By contrast, the two parties that presented
   themselves as being starkly opposed to the Smer government's
   policies-Freedom and Solidarity and Ordinary People and Independent
   Personalities-exhibit greater support in districts with more
   university-educated voters and lower unemployment rates.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},

Volume = {26},

Abstract = {Most attention in British electoral studies has been paid to the pattern
   of voting for parties, with relatively little to that for individual
   candidates. In intra-party elections, however, candidates may perform
   better in some areas than others, illustrating V. O. Key's well-known
   ``friends and neighbours{''} effect. This paper explores whether that
   was so at the election for the leader of the UK Labour party in 2010,
   expecting each of the five candidates to perform better in their own
   constituency and its environs and also with those constituency parties
   whose MPs supported their candidature. The results are in line with the
   expectations, especially for one of the candidates who ran an explicitly
   geographical campaign.},

Abstract = {The media hold democratically elected leaders accountable by exposing
   corruption and policy failures. Although many politicians accept media
   criticism as intrinsic to liberal democracy, some politicians rein in
   freedom of the press or intimidate media outlets to silence their
   critics. We identify circumstances that motivate and enable presidents
   to curb media freedom in presidential democracies. We argue that (a)
   presidents who hold ideological positions contrary to those of the
   mainstream media adopt the media as viable opponents in the absence of
   an effective electoral opposition, and (b) the media are vulnerable to
   presidential infringements on their freedom where legislatures and
   judiciaries hold weak powers relative to presidents, and are therefore
   unable to constrain presidents' actions against media freedom. We
   support our argument with quantitative analyses of press freedom ratings
   in presidential and semi-presidential democracies from 1993 to 2013.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {687-705},
Abstract = {This paper analyses the implementation of new debt rules and the
   function of the new Stabilitatsrat since its establishment in 2011. The
   new rules are explained and the effect of the new limit for public debt
   is examined. Furthermore, the composition, tasks and procedures of the
   Stabilitatsrat are described and evaluated. Finally, its activity is
   judged with individual examples. As a result, it is shown that for the
   new rules of Art. 109 para. 3, Art. 115 and Art. 143d GG to be
   successful, a normative commitment and corresponding political
   discipline not to incur new debts is required. The Stabilitatsrat alone
   is insufficient as an institutional framework to encourage budgetary
   discipline. Abolishing the Stabilitatsrat would be a first step in
   giving back control to politics in regard to debt and in dispelling the
   illusion that technocratic determination of the possibility to take new
   debt could end the debt problem.},

Abstract = {This study examines the day-to-day experiences of persons with
   disabilities in three small New Brunswick Acadian communities where
   little is known about the challenges and opportunities they face in
   daily life. While we can piece together a narrative from studies of
   rurality, its applicability is far from certain. This research examined
   (1) how and to what degree their needs are being met; (2) their personal
   and social support systems; and, (3) their message for decision makers.
   Analysis of 23 interviews revealed general consistency with the rurality
   literature and uncovered the need to more closely consider issues of
   gender and re-integration in disability policy.},

Abstract = {Recent antiregime protests throughout the world have been publicized,
   and arguably facilitated, by social media and other communication
   technologies. I develop formal models that examine the implications of
   communication technology generating information about two distinct
   factors: (1) the level of dissatisfaction with the regime and (2)
   logistical information about when, where, and how potential protests
   will occur. Making grievances against the regime more public has an
   ambiguous effect on protest levels as citizens can learn that it is more
   or less popular than expected. Even when publicizing more complaints
   about the regime does increase average protest levels, some if not most
   of the observed correlation between antiregime content and protest is
   not causal. In contrast, providing information about logistics almost
   always lowers the effective cost of protest, leading to larger (and more
   cohesive) antiregime action. The models explain a wide range of
   empirical results linking communication technology, antiregime beliefs,
   protest, and censorship.},

Abstract = {This essay aims to analyze the ontological and epistemological aspects
   that have nurtured and shaped the theoretical construction of
   International Relations (IR). The argument is a conditional statement
   and is simple: If the ontological and epistemological foundations of IR
   are not understood then there is no precision in the theoretical
   approach on case studies. Case studies can be facts, problems or
   situations that take place in the world and the appropriate application
   of theories for its interpretation allows researchers of this discipline
   to find better explanations and to achieve better understandings of them
   in order to, eventually, propose affordable solutions to those problems
   or situations. We conclude that: 1) depending on the problem (dependent
   variable) the observer choses the theory that provides the best
   explanation attributing some causality (independent variable), with the
   respective ontological, epistemological and methodological implications;
   2) the scientific nature of the discipline is not an exhausted issue; 3)
   to refer to theories as paradigms may not be as useful as it is
   believed; 4) that there are dialogic possibilities between positivism
   and post-positivism to pose research questions in International
   Relations; and that 5) in the way we see the world is the theoretical
   approach we use. The contribution consists in guiding scholars and
   students of IR in their theoretical choices, within several options for
   their social scientific research on international affairs.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the main constitutional dimensions of gun possession
   in the United States of America: individual rights and freedoms, public
   safety and the distribution of powers between the Federation and the
   States. Our study focuses mainly in constitutional history and
   constitutional case law interpretation, especially in Heller and Lopez
   cases. We conclude that this case law breaks dramatically with the
   progressive federalization of competencies developed because of the
   commercial clause. Furthermore, we see no means for a constitutional
   development in favor of gun control.},

Abstract = {Scholars of race, ethnicity, and politics have long questioned why the
   discipline of political science has taken so long to recognize the
   legitimacy of the study of the politics of America's racial minority
   groups. The answer to this question, we believe, lies in the historical
   roots of the discipline. This article examines the complex relationship
   between racial ideologies and the development of the discipline of
   political science in the United States. Using a genealogical analysis,
   we analyze the racist origins of the discipline that arose from the work
   and attitudes of one of the founders of American political science, John
   W. Burgess. In an effort to legitimize political science as an empirical
   field rooted in the scientific method, Burgess and other prominent early
   political scientists turned to existing scientific notions of race. The
   racial ideologies that spurred the early development of political
   science continue to influence the ways in which issues of race and
   ethnicity are embraced and understood within the discipline today and
   contribute to its lack of diversity.},

Abstract = {We develop a new approach for modeling public sentiment by micro-level

   Recent production of detailed geospatial political data means that
   modeling and measurement lag behind available information. The output of
   the models gives not only nuanced regional differences and relationships
   between states, but more robust state-level aggregations that update
   past research on measuring constituency opinion. We rely here on the
   spatial relationships among observations and units of measurement in
   order to extract measurements of ideology as geographically narrow as
   measured covariates. We present an application in which we measure state
   and district ideology in the United States in 2008.},

Abstract = {Modern Russia experiences a phase of changes in its political landscape.
   Contrary to calculations for the modern Russian policy hoping for a
   ``reasonable{''} political economic gains approach, what has developed
   are national emotions and instincts, in short, nationalism. Thus the
   modern oppositional movements of Russia are usually considered as a
   unitary movement. However, there is a variety of coexisting movements.
   In this paper it is possible to see the existence of very active
   oppositional movements, ranging from those on the extreme right to those
   on the extreme left.},

Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {This essay deals with the majority principle, its nature and its effects
   on political development in various contexts. It argues that the
   implementation of that principle varies according to distinct forms of
   government: while the parliamentary democracies in Europe have
   continuously restricted the application and impacts of majority rule,
   the presidential democracies in Latin America have seen quite the
   opposite. Recent constitutional reforms have reinforced these patterns.
   In some countries, the majority principle has seriously affected other
   key principles of pluralist systems and the rule of law, and political
   practice has exceeded tolerable limits to still be considered
   democracies. However, both the academic and political debates, as well
   as the human rights dialogue, have remained relatively impervious to the
   increasing disparities between different types of presidential regimes.},

Abstract = {`Social Purity' appears in a part of the French and Anglo-Saxon (Britain
   and the United States) nineteenth twentieth century's feminisms, as a
   mean for many claims: from the full recognition of sexual difference in
   Huber tine Auclert's social and `clifferentialise republicanism in
   France to Josephine Butler's refusal of any purity imposed from above in
   England, until the absolute turn of the idea of women's moral
   superiority and the equal and opposite force to the final exit from `the
   social' by the American `New Womanism', individualizing and de
   -feminizing the act of sexual liberation. All this in a continuous play
   of actions and reactions, sometimes paradoxical, weaving together
   suffragism and anti-suffragism, contestation of the conjugal
   complementarity and the never overcome temptations of hetero or
   self-control.},

Abstract = {In Belarus, the Lukashenka regime has dealt another blow to independent
   scientific work. The opinion research institute IISEPS is suspending its

   the autocratic state exercises even more control over society. The niche
   where reflection about the country's past, present, and future takes
   place has become even smaller.},

Abstract = {U.S.-Thai security relations are ``underperforming{''} due to major
   shifts in Thailand's and the United States' relations at the interactive
   domestic, regional, and international levels. The recent predominance of
   the military in Thailand's domestic politics has clashed with
   Washington's interpretation of the Shinawatra family's prior ascent to
   power through electoral processes. China's rise and its efforts to court
   the current Thai government by staying out of Thailand's internal
   politics has further exacerbated tensions with American policymakers who
   had already reduced the scope and depth of ties with Bangkok. How
   Thailand's political polarization is resolved will be most consequential
   to the future of Thai-U.S. security relations. However, continued U.S.
   alliance relations remain essential for Thailand in view of China's
   intense campaign to woo Thailand's coup leaderships in 2006 and 2014. A
   lopsided Thai-Chinese relationship puts at risk Thailand's traditionally
   masterful and clever foreign policy pragmatism and undercuts the
   traditional benefits that both the United States and Thailand have
   derived from their longstanding alliance relationship.},

Abstract = {This article sheds light on the limits of the institutionalization of
   the comprehensive approach among the military when they are involved in
   European crisis management operations. Based on an analysis of EUFOR
   Chad/CAR, two contrasted observations stand out. European soldiers react
   positively to the comprehensive approach, as it provides them with new
   professional and social skills when they interact with one another and
   with the other actors of the European security field. For the military,
   the comprehensive approach functions as a norm that contributes to
   shaping the EU's role as a crisis management actor. However, the
   comprehensive approach's implementation leads to an assemblage of
   diverse practices, and some of its principles are rejected by the
   military, when the latter clash with the conduct of operations on the
   ground.},

Abstract = {As we think about how to develop a life-affirming spirituality, we need
   to be attentive to the social perspectives from which we are speaking.
   This essay attempts a critique of the widespread conflation of Spinoza
   and Nietzsche in both mainstream research and poststructuralist
   interpretations. The assumption of a continuity of their concepts of
   power overlooks that the late Nietzsche took a sharp anti-Spinozian turn
   and introduced his ``will to power{''} against Spinoza's conatus.
   Whereas Spinoza's potentia agendi designates a collective and
   cooperative capacity to act, Nietzsche's ``will to power{''} naturalizes
   the principle of domination. A spirituality inspired by Nietzsche's
   philosophy can never get rid of its inherent ``pathos of distance,{''}
   which manifests itself even in its most ``leftist{''} forms as a
   celebration of social distinctions against ordinary people. Recourse to
   Spinoza can help redefine life affirmation in a democratic-socialist
   way, constituting a dynamic component of counterspirituality from below.},

Abstract = {This study explains the limits of institutional transformation in Korea
   from the developmental state to a post-developmental state, in terms of
   regulatory institutions instead of developmental institutions. The
   Korean state has taken advantage of the government's discretionary
   policy changes and power formed by both informal state institutions and
   informal policy networks, while the regulatory state has placed a
   special emphasis on social consensus as well as political support for
   changes of market institutions. New market rules and laws have also been
   inefficient and ineffective for fair market competition. Limits of
   regulatory governance change have occurred due to misalignments between
   informal regulatory institutions in the developmental state and formal
   regulatory institutions in the post-developmental state. State managers
   have created discretionary state intervention in policy implementation,
   politicized the roles of regulatory agencies, and brought ministry-type
   regulatory state institutions back in. The establishment of effective
   market institutions has failed due to informal market institutions
   (unfair and illegal market practices) that have interfered with the
   policy implementation of new formal market regulations.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the ``nexus{''} between terrorism and organized
   crime in the Sahel. The arguments animating recent debates can be
   grouped into two distinct positions: the apocalyptic approach, which
   tends to exaggerate the threat of terrorism and its links with organized
   crime, and the conspiratorial approach, which reveals how the specter of
   terrorism comes to be manipulated by a range of actors for their own
   particular interests. This study offers an alternative view: thus far
   the region has not been subject to the spread and consolidation of
   Islamist ideology but rather to hybrid orders that are a complex dynamic
   of instrumental adaptation on the part of Islamist terrorists, criminal
   organizations, and the local population.},

Title = {The Statecraft Simulation and Foreign Policy Attitudes Among
   Undergraduate Students},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Professors of international relations are increasingly realizing that
   simulations can be a fun and effective way of teaching the complexities
   of the field to their students. One popular simulation that has emerged
   in recent years-the Statecraft simulation-is now used by more than 190
   colleges and universities worldwide. Despite Statecraft's popularity,
   however, little scholarship has attempted to assess its impact on
   learning objectives and students' perceptions of the real world. This
   article attempts to help fill that void by evaluating Statecraft's
   influence on foreign policy attitudes among undergraduate students. It
   finds that, while participation in Statecraft did not generally change
   students' foreign policy preferences, it did have the effect of inducing
   foreign policy moderation among students who were initially very hawkish
   or dovish in their foreign policy orientations. The most important
   individual characteristics predicting foreign policy attitudes include a
   student's political orientation and interest in the Statecraft
   simulation itself. The article concludes with some potential avenues for
   future research.},

Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},

Number = {51},
Pages = {589+},
Abstract = {In this concluding chapter we take up main and transversal findings and
   research experiences from the contributions to this book in order to,
   first, fill our double taxonomy of democracy with non-Western
   conceptions of democracy and, second, further develop our new approach
   of,global-transcultural democracy research' (GTDR). To this end, we now
   differentiate between four basic research designs within
   global-transcultural democracy research: 1) the deduction from the
   heuristic and abstract `minimal' concept of democracy towards concrete
   conceptions of democracy, 2) the contextualistic analysis of these
   concrete conceptions, 3) the induction towards a more abstract
   global-transcultural concept of democracy, and 4) the abduction by
   which, in a reflexive loop, the original `minimal' concept of democracy
   is continuously being questioned by the experiences with the concrete
   conceptions of democracy. Finally, we discuss the implications and
   consequences of our new approach of global-transcultural democracy
   research for democratic theory and empirical democracy research.},

   making a leading actor in European policy out of Poland. However, with
   the country's departure from the principles of liberal democracy and the
   weakening of ties to the European Union, they are tending to Putin's
   business. Russian publicists already see an ``ideological community{''}
   of Warsaw and Moscow. Of all people, those who most talk of patriotism
   are pursuing a policy that harms the country most. In Poland, the party

Abstract = {Why are some countries prone to ethno-nationalist conflict, whereas
   others are plagued by class conflict? This is a question that has seldom
   been raised and rarely been examined empirically. This paper presents a
   social-structural theory to account for the variable incidence of these
   two forms of political instability. These two types of conflict result
   from distinct principles of group solidarity - ethnicity and class - and
   since each individual is simultaneously a member of an ethnic group (or
   many such groups) and a particular class, these two principles vary in
   the degree to which they are mutually exclusive or cross-cutting. The
   degree of economic stratification between groups and economic
   segmentation within them shapes the relative salience of each principle
   of group solidarity in any society and is associated with a
   characteristic form of political mobilization. In places where
   between-group inequalities are high, and within-group inequalities low,
   ethnicity should be the dominant principle of group solidarity and serve
   as the primary basis of group conflict. By contrast, in countries where
   between-group inequalities are low, and within-group inequalities high,
   class is more likely to serve as the dominant principle of group
   solidarity, and conflicts along class lines are more likely. We test
   these conjectures with data in over 100 countries on cross-cutting
   cleavages, ethnic war, and class conflict. The results are supportive of
   the theory, and provide evidence that how groups are stratified and
   segmented in societies shapes the type of civil war.},

Abstract = {Armed groups often transform into political parties, which involves a
   profound transformation of the organizational culture. How these parties
   condition the continued political mobilization of their members is
   unclear. Using life history interviews with former combatants of the
   armed group M19 in Colombia, this article demonstrates what aspects of
   the party mobilize and stymie their political mobilization. Through
   exploring three typical political life paths - the Resilient, the
   Remobilized and the Removed - this article demonstrates the long-term
   challenges of post-war politics, the role of the party, as well as the
   personal journey from (war and) peace to democracy.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},

Volume = {12},

Pages = {101-120},
Abstract = {The interface between politicians and the electorate is a vital
   component of the infrastructure of democracy and politicians now have
   many more tools available to communicate and engage with the electorate.
   Direct contact between politicians and the electorate is associated with
   increased levels of civic engagement. In this article, we examine the
   responsiveness of politicians in the UK by conducting: (i) an innovative
   test of responses to an undecided voter's email and (ii) follow-up
   interviews with electoral candidates. We found that a majority of
   electoral candidates had an identifiable email address and more than
   half responded to our undecided voter's email. However, there were
   considerable differences in the content relevance of the responses.
   There were also very few follow-up emails or further contact from the
   electoral candidates, suggesting only limited evidence of an integrated
   communication strategy. Electoral candidates also expressed concerns
   about communicating in a way that was `on record'. The findings provide
   a unique insight into the dynamics of communication between politicians
   and the electorate and the changing nature of the representation
   interface. Whilst the Internet has the scope for more personalized and
   two-way communication and for electors to hold politicians to account,
   it seems that politicians are more focused on campaign advantage rather
   than renewing the representation interface.},

Abstract = {This study investigates whether immigration affects the extent to which
   children of migrants are likelier to vote if their parents vote (and
   vice versa). It combines intergenerational transmission theories with
   migrant political participation theories. Existing studies of migration
   and intergenerational transmission mainly focus on (Latino) immigrants
   in the United States and have not assessed migration's true impact
   through comparison with non-migrants from the origin society. This study
   analyses unique data on Turkey-Europe migration, which include migrant
   and non-migrant child-parent dyads, applying logistic regression
   analysis. The results show a clear ;intrahousehold similarity in
   electoral participation' among migrant dyads in European national
   elections, which is weaker (but present) among the non-migrant dyads in
   Turkey. Though migration thus seems to strengthen transmission, the
   effect is only present if the child grew up in Europe, suggesting that
   children also stimulate their parents' political engagement.
   Additionally, results show that the electoral participation of parents
   in the Turkish elections is not associated with the electoral
   participation of the adult children in the European national elections.
   Taken together, the analyses indicate that the underlying mechanism of
   transmission is not just one of (two-way) political socialization;
   `household mobilization' also plays an important role.},

Abstract = {The period of democratisation known as the Third Wave resulted in
   widespread democratisation in diverse parts of the world. In this study
   we use data from the World Values Survey to measure five dimensions of
   active citizenship (considered important for democracy) in four
   countries of the Third Wave: Chile, Poland, South Africa and South
   Korea. We compare the Third Wave countries with two consolidated
   democracies (Germany and Sweden) as well as one unique case study
   (Turkey). We find that the oldest democracies tend to record high levels
   of participation as well as high levels of trust and tolerance. The
   newer democracies often have moderate to high scores as well, but still
   face various obstacles. Turkey faces the most challenges to active
   citizenship and democratic consolidation as it most often recorded low
   levels of participation and low levels of trust and tolerance.},

Title = {Falling into the justice gap? Between duties of social and global
   justice},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {19},
Number = {6},
Pages = {645-661},
Abstract = {The literature on cosmopolitan justice has yet to address what
   principles to adopt when duties of global justice and duties of social
   justice are in conflict. In this paper, I address David Miller's
   contention that some may fall into the justice gap since we need to
   prioritize duties of social justice in cases of conflict. I argue that
   Miller's analysis depends on three stipulations: the incommensurability
   of the values underlying duties of social justice and those of global
   justice; the need to justify duties of justice to their holders; and the
   need to consider the necessary institutions to realize and implement
   justice obligations. I argue against the incommensurability clause by
   showing that both conceptions of justice pursue moral equality as the
   underlying and commensurate value. Instead, I propose that the
   currencies of justice we employ in the two contexts of justice are
   different. Discussing the justifiability clause I agree with the
   stipulation that we have to justify decisions that affect the
   realization of justice to those who have to carry the burden of
   realizing them. This implies, however, that we may have to accept that
   some prioritize duties of global justice over duties of social justice.
   If this is the case, it seems as though the state has little recourse to
   prioritize duties of social justice. Finally, discussing Miller's
   institutional clause I ask why the justice relevant institutions can
   only be those of the state. It is plausible to say that in our current
   world, institutions of humanitarian aid are effective means to satisfy
   duties of global justice.},

Abstract = {Both Liberia and the USA make their independence from the
   imperial/colonial systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries an
   integral part of their national identities. Despite an upsurge in the
   use of the term `American Empire' since the invasion of Afghanistan and
   Iraq, the American government has firmly identified itself as a republic
   with no colonial ambitions. Liberia, dubbed `Africa's oldest republic',
   has similarly fashioned a national self-image of freedom and
   independence. This article uses the concept of Colonialism without
   Colonies to critically evaluate these claims, and further open up
   questions about the nature of imperialism in contrast to colonialism.},

Volume = {44},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Using Regression Discontinuity diagnostics we document a number of
   statistical anomalies in the 2004 Turkish mayoral elections. The
   governing party that controls the parliament is much more likely to win
   close races than lose. Moreover, compared to close governing party
   losses, there is a sharp drop in turnout and contending party votes in
   close governing party wins. Finally, the parties that disproportionately
   lose very close races are exclusively ideological competitors of the
   governing party. Among the potential mechanisms that may create those
   anomalies, electoral manipulation seems to a plausible explanation.
   Those anomalies show that the outcomes of very close popular elections
   can be non-random and that the assumption of the continuity of the
   expected potential outcomes at the threshold could be violated. We
   discuss implications of our findings for Regression Discontinuity
   Designs and for understanding the consolidation of the right-wing
   electorate in Turkey during the last decade. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The 1981 Australian Financial System Inquiry, known as the Campbell
   Committee, is widely seen as the start of the reform movement of the
   1980s and 1990s. Accounts of its origins have been dominated by a debate
   about which policy actor can take credit. This paper utilises cabinet
   and Reserve Bank archives to reassess the origins of the Campbell
   Committee. The inquiry had its origins in an earlier attempt by the
   Whitlam government to take federal control of the regulation for
   non-bank financial institutions and the building society crisis of the
   mid-1970s. In its response to these political and economic challenges we
   can identify the moment in which the Fraser cabinet turned towards
   market-based reform. The political decisions made in the context of
   crisis set the path for regulatory change in subsequent decades,
   particularly in the area of prudential regulation, where we have seen
   regulatory consolidation and expansion rather than deregulation'.},

Title = {Trust and Safety in the Segregated City: Contextualizing the
   Relationship between Institutional Trust, Crime-related Insecurity and
   Generalized Trust},

Abstract = {Trust is a crucial asset for any society, and the quest to generate and
   uphold trust is as crucial as ever. Several contemporary societal
   developments are proposed as being particularly challenging for
   upholding and restoring the levels of trust in society, including
   increasing ethnic diversity, rising inequality and the related
   geographical segregation. It has been convincingly argued that
   democratic institutions may generate trust by neutralizing some of these
   effects. This article explores how the mechanisms of trust differ in
   segregated, disadvantaged neighbourhoods as opposed to the surrounding
   general society. The empirical material consists of individual-level
   data from a segregated neighbourhood (Vivalla) in a medium-sized city in
   Sweden (Orebro), with a random sample from the population of the city
   (the Vivalla area excluded) as the comparison reference point,
   representing the general society. In the article, perceived safety is
   introduced as an important mediator between trust in legal and
   government institutions and generalized trust, through which the
   differing mechanisms become evident. In the disadvantaged neighbourhood,
   it is shown that trust in government institutions has the function of
   primarily decreasing crime-related insecurity, which in its turn affects
   generalized trust. Thus, the relationship is indirect. In the city
   population, the effect instead goes directly from trust in government
   institutions to generalized trust. The results suggest that the
   potentials of different means to build and restore trust are dependent
   on local context.},

Abstract = {We analyze the determinants of left-wing and nationalist-separatist
   terrorism for 18 Western European countries for the 1970-2007 period.
   Focusing on the influence of the Cold War, we find that it predicts
   left-wing but not nationalistseparatist terrorism, suggesting that there
   is indeed some heterogeneity in the causes of terrorism. However, we
   also find that a number of factors determine both kinds of terrorism,
   indicating that there were differences but also commonalities in the
   causes of left-wing and nationalist-separatist terrorism in Western
   Europe during our observation period.},

Title = {Direct and Indirect Welfare Chauvinism as Party Strategies: An Analysis

Abstract = {This article develops a theoretical distinction between direct and
   indirect welfare chauvinism in order to analyze how electorally
   successful populist right-wing parties transmit social policy
   preferences with significant redistributive implications for the shape
   of the welfare state. Direct welfare chauvinism occurs as a result of
   legislative changes that explicitly exclude recipients from social
   protection or reduce the level thereof on the basis of ethnicity.
   Indirect welfare chauvinism is the result of policy measures that apply
   to both natives and immigrants, but which deliberately negatively affect
   immigrants the most. Combining quantitative and qualitative analysis of
   labour market reforms in Denmark, where one of the most successful
   populist right-wing parties in Europe - the Danish People's Party - held
   a pivotal position in the period 2001-11, the article traces the
   intentions and deliberate policy-making strategies of the party. It
   shows that the distinction between direct and indirect chauvinism is a
   useful theoretical tool for understanding how the Danish People's Party
   can fulfill the expectations of both its electorate and its coalition
   partners, even if they point in different directions.},

Abstract = {Small states, and those in the Caribbean and Pacific regions in
   particular, are among the most stubbornly and disproportionally
   democratic countries in the world. And yet, they are rarely studied
   comparatively, despite sharing seemingly obvious similarities - aside
   from being small island states with developing economies they also tend
   to share a British colonial heritage and Westminster-inspired political
   institutions. This omission is all the more puzzling if we consider that
   the group does not conform to the standard battery of explanations
   developed by democratization theorists. To pave the way for further
   research across these two regions, this article provides a synoptic
   comparison of the process of democratization in Caribbean and Pacific
   small states. We highlight important similarities and differences that
   stem from the interaction between formal institutions and informal
   practices. We conclude by reiterating the benefits for scholars of
   democratization by looking at these significant yet hitherto rarely
   compared cases.},

Title = {The impact of incumbency on turnout. Evidence from Italian
   municipalities},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {44},
Pages = {98-108},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We analyse how the presence of an incumbent among candidates at an
   election affects electoral turnout. We use a rich data set which
   provides information on the results of Italian municipal elections over
   the period 1993-2011. We find that the impact of incumbency is
   heterogeneous across geographical areas: incumbency produces a positive
   effect on turnout in the South of Italy, whereas we find a negative and
   statistically significant effect in the North. We speculate that the
   north-south divergence is related to differences in social capital and
   in clientelistic relationships established by incumbent politicians. Our

Abstract = {Sometimes political theorists like to imagine that they are lonely
   humanists misplaced in social science departments. In fact, political
   theory was created as part of a political science composed of both
   humanistic and social-scientific elements. Rather than trying to locate
   political theory somewhere between the humanities and the social
   sciences, we should instead dismantle the boundary between the two and
   create a unified discipline of questioning that embraces both kinds of
   inquiry.},

Volume = {17},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {This article compares the effectiveness and the fairness of four
   alternative policies aimed at managing multilingual communication in the
   European Union. The current multilingual regime, based on the formal
   equality among the official languages of the European Union Member
   States disenfranchises only a small percentage of residents. On the
   contrary, an English-only language policy would exclude 45\% to 79\% of
   adult residents in the 25 countries for which data are available,
   depending on the indicator used. A language regime based on English,
   French and German would disenfranchise 26\% to 49\% of residents,
   whereas a regime based on six languages would bring the shares of the
   excluded population down to 9-18\%. In addition, results show that
   economically and socially disadvantaged individuals are less likely to
   speak languages other than their own native tongue, and therefore they
   are much more likely to be adversely affected if the European Union
   stops using their language. The current full multilingual policy of the
   European Union based on translation and interpreting not only is (and
   will be for the foreseeable future) the most effective language policy
   among the alternatives examined; it is also the only one that is truly
   inclusive at a relatively reasonable cost. The British withdrawal from
   the European Union is likely to increase rather than decrease the
   importance of a multilingual language policy.},

Title = {Don't Tread on Me: Constraint-Challenging Presidents and Strategic
   Conflict Avoidance},
Journal = {PRESIDENTIAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {46},
Number = {4},
Pages = {808-827},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Recent research demonstrates that U.S. presidents' psychological
   predispositions influence the frequency with which they choose
   diversionary foreign policy strategies. The purpose of this article is
   to extend the expectations of this first-image theory of diversion to
   the strategic behavior of potential diversionary targets. We posit that
   U.S. presidents whose spontaneous public rhetoric indicates a
   willingness to challenge pacifying constraints should be viewed by
   potential enemies as more likely to engage in diversionary conflict.
   Building upon the strategic conflict avoidance perspective, we expect
   that when such presidents encounter diversionary incentives, other
   states will increase cooperation toward and avoid initiation of military
   disputes against the United States. Time-series analyses of behavior
   toward the United States for the period 1953-2000 largely bear out this
   expectation, as interstate rivals increase cooperation toward, and all
   states decrease militarized incident initiation against, the United
   States when economic misery is high and presidents whose rhetoric has
   revealed a proclivity for challenging constraints are in office.},

Abstract = {This article examines a broadly accepted assumption that presence of
   women personnel makes police forces more gender-just, and makes an
   attempt to study in the context of Delhi Police, how the inclusion of
   women personnel impacts gendered hierarchies and patriarchal social
   norms operative within the space of a thana. Drawing on ethnographic
   research, I argue that the day-to-day practices and relations between
   men and women personnel in a police station do not give out a picture of
   a gender-just institutional set-up. Further, I argue that abuse and
   humiliation of women personnel within the thana is not something totally
   disconnected from what the institution's official attitude towards women
   is, as could be read from various public campaigns of Delhi Police that
   infantilize and objectify women while talking of `protective' men as
   role models. In this context, it is argued that merely inducting women
   into the institution without an active feminist practice against
   essentialization of women would not bring emancipatory outcomes.},

Abstract = {Uncertainty about the state of the new global order and the dynamics
   that govern it permeate academic literature and policy inquiries. In
   this new world order ``picking allies, making friends and containing
   adversaries {[}...] promises to be an unclear, ambiguous and delicate
   process.{''}(1) Using Brazil and Turkey as an example, this paper aims
   to understand how and why emerging countries choose to ``partner up.{''}
   The paper focuses on the growing relations between the two countries in
   the areas of political and economic cooperation between 2008 and 2012.
   The theoretical proposal of the paper is to test whether realist or more
   constructivist explanations can account for the approximation of these
   seemingly unlikely partners. This is done by examining the ideas and
   interests behind the moves towards stronger bilateral ties between the
   two states.},

Abstract = {This article integrates ideology into a game-theoretical model of
   centre-periphery bargains. Ideological differences between national and
   sub-national elites constitute a major obstacle for the accommodation of
   autonomy claims. While reforms bringing about decentralization are often
   analysed systematically as well as through case studies, cases where,
   despite claims to autonomy, decentralization does not occur have been
   largely neglected by scholars of territorial politics. Turkey is such a
   `negative case'. We argue that ideological distance prevents national
   parties from accommodating peripheral authority claims. We test our
   expectation with a mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative
   analysis of party positions with in-depth qualitative analysis of party
   documents showing how the different ideological positions of national
   and Kurdish parties affect decentralization demand and national response
   in Turkey between 1987 and 2015. Our findings support the theoretical
   expectations, but also point to additional inferences. Whereas
   asymmetric authority demands have been widely ignored, symmetric local
   autonomy has become an important issue in territorial politics.},

Abstract = {The paper examines the domestic politics explanations to Japanese
   security policy expansion between theColdWar and post-ColdWar periods.
   In response to the various explanations offered in the literature, such
   as the implementation of administrative and institutional reforms since
   1994 that resulted in the centralization of the decisionmaking process,
   changes to the balance of power of political parties within the Japanese
   political system, and shift in the type of politicians that dominate the
   LDP, opposition parties and security policymaking structure, this paper
   argues that it is important to incorporate collective identity into
   understanding Japanese security policy expansion. Two reasons highlight
   the importance of collective identity -first, without collective
   identity, it is difficult to understand the type of security policy
   produced as the discussion of vision is omitted; and, second, collective
   identity reveals the organizational make-up of the security policymaking
   structure that is responsible for the formulation of security policy. To
   explicate the collective identity-institution relationship, this paper
   focuses on Japanese security identity and the Japanese security
   policymaking regime in the Cold War and post-Cold War periods. Two
   security identities for Japan are examined -the peace-state and
   international-state; and three elements of the regime are studied -the
   agents involved or marginalized in the security policymaking process,
   the decision-making structure of the security policymaking, and the role
   of the US. This paper aids in our understanding of how collective
   identities are sustained and supported within an institution, and how
   Japanese security policy expanded in the post-ColdWar period.},

Abstract = {Focused on democratic and hybrid regimes in sub-Saharan Africa, this
   article explores the factors and conditions that dissuade or restrain
   governments from clamping down on press freedoms. We suggest that
   governments might hesitate to interfere with the media for three
   reasons: they may face excessive political or legal costs for such
   interference; they might have limited options available to them to
   curtail media freedoms, and, finally, under some circumstances,
   governments may obtain a limited payoff from efforts to clamp down on
   the media. Consistent with anecdotal evidence that motivates some of our
   hypotheses, our findings suggest that strong media sectors within civil
   society encourage government respect for media freedoms. We also find
   that the rule of law is associated with more favourable climates for the
   media. This likely reflects the protection free media receive from
   independent judiciaries.},

Abstract = {Between 1997 and 2013, more than 5000 recall referendums were activated
   against democratically elected authorities from 747 Peruvian
   municipalities (45.5\% of all municipalities). This makes Peru the
   world's most intensive user of this mechanism of direct democracy which
   is designed to remove elected authorities from office before the end of
   their term. What are the reasons for this extensive use of recall
   referendums in Peru and, more importantly, what consequences do they
   have in terms of democratic legitimacy and government efficiency? This
   paper sets out to answer these questions by comparing the Peruvian case
   against the background of other countries in the Andean region. It
   proposes an explanation for the intensive activation of recall
   procedures through the combination of two factors: first, the features
   of the institutional design of the mechanism, which affect the
   probability of a successful activation of recall referendums, and
   second, the degree of institutionalization of political parties, which
   influences the incentives of political actors to gain power between
   regular elections.},

Abstract = {If Richard Simeon's ``Studying Public Policy{''} sought to inspire a
   theory of policy making, however tentative or crude, its conceptual
   cornerstone was no doubt the ``funnel of causality.{''} Yet references
   to the funnel of causality have all but disappeared from the policy
   literature. This article traces the evolution of the thinking that
   underlies the funnel of causality with the aim of demonstrating its
   lasting relevance to policy studies. Being a method for understanding
   how inputs from various levels of abstraction impact policy outcomes,
   the interaction and feedback effects implicit in the funnel metaphor
   have been maintained in subsequent neo-institutionalist work that takes
   seriously the institutional and sociological environment in which policy
   making takes place, particularly that which is interested in the origins
   and operation of policy subsystems, policy communities or networks, and
   policy regimes.},

Abstract = {What explains individuals' support to government social policy
   provision? Many scholars consider economic factors, such as income and
   risk, as the key determinants of social policy preferences. However,
   economic self-interest is not the solo determinant of policy preference,
   particularly in the health care domain. The social identity approach of
   policy preferences argues one's social identification shapes her policy
   preferences. We recognize the strength of the social identity
   literature, but view its lack of consideration for the intersection of
   multiple identities as a shortcoming. Using an intersectional approach
   and data from the 2012 General Social Survey, we examine how political
   ideology colors the effects of two ascriptive identities - race and
   gender - in shaping individuals' health care preferences. Findings
   suggest that neither race nor gender independently explains health care
   attitudes. Instead, connecting ideology with the intersection between
   race and gender offers a more comprehensive account of how
   sub-population groups differ in their attitudes toward the role of
   government in health care. This timely analysis captures the complexity
   of Americans' health care attitudes and brings the intersectionality
   approach to the social policy literature.},

Title = {THE ECONOMY AS A DISCURSIVE CONSTRUCTION: THE CASE OF REPRESENTATION OF

Abstract = {This paper aims to demonstrate the significance and relevance of the
   poststructural gaze towards the economy by both tracing the conceptual
   common-places of this approach as well as practicing this theoretical
   position in the concrete analysis of indebtedness of the financial
   system. A brief and localized, but nonetheless significant tradition of
   the poststructural problematizing of the category of economy is here
   presented through three key disciplines: governmentality studies,
   economic sociology and international political economy. After portraying
   the contributions and limitations of those disciplines, the second part
   of the paper analyzes the apparatus of standardification and
   validification of credit risk within banks, namely the Basel Capital
   Accord and practices of securitisation. By offering a genealogy of those
   techniques, we interpret finance as a discursive space (re) articulated
   through an aggregate of normalized mechanisms and practices which
   collectively form a rationality of governance. In this way, we point out
   the importance of performative, symbolic, relational, decentered and
   contingent moments in the critical conception of (financial) economy, as
   well as show that the critique of economy does not necessarily have to
   be organized and conducted through the capital - class - ideology
   matrix.},

Abstract = {Many scholars have investigated the relationship between ideological
   orientations and mass participation, and there is also a growing number
   of studies comparing political attitudes and behaviour between electoral
   winners and losers. This article seeks to bring together these two
   strands of literature with respect to political participation, focusing
   on the interaction between citizens' winner/loser status and ideological
   distance from their government. Analysis of data from 34 countries
   highlights the importance of this interactive effect: while previous
   works suggest that losers have a greater propensity to take part in
   political activities, it is shown here that this relationship holds true
   only when losers occupy a position along the left-right spectrum distant
   from the government. Furthermore, while the hypothesised interactive
   effect is empirically confirmed for turnout, the magnitude of its impact
   is much greater for more costly modes of participation such as
   contacting, campaigning and protesting},

Abstract = {In 2015, Comparative Political Studies embarked on a landmark pilot
   study in research transparency in the social sciences. The editors
   issued an open call for submissions of manuscripts that contained no
   mention of their actual results, incentivizing reviewers to evaluate
   manuscripts based on their theoretical contributions, research designs,
   and analysis plans. The three papers in this special issue are the
   result of this process that began with 19 submissions. In this article,
   we describe the rationale for this pilot, expressly articulating the
   practices of preregistration and results-free review. We document the
   process of carrying out the special issue with a discussion of the three
   accepted papers, and critically evaluate the role of both
   preregistration and results-free review. Our main conclusions are that
   results-free review encourages much greater attention to theory and
   research design, but that it raises thorny problems about how to
   anticipate and interpret null findings. We also observe that as
   currently practiced, results-free review has a particular affinity with
   experimental and cross-case methodologies. Our lack of submissions from
   scholars using qualitative or interpretivist research suggests
   limitations to the widespread use of results-free review.},

Abstract = {It is typically held that Sartre is a thinker of transcendence, inasmuch
   as he retains a subject predicate structure via intentional
   consciousness and ruptures an otherwise insular domain through his
   dialectic of the self. Against such interpretations, this article argues
   that in following the progression of Sartre' s thought, we will come to
   see a deepening engagement with, and development of, immanence in the
   spirit of Deleuze. Specifically, Sartre steadily develops a dialectic in
   which consciousness, while relating to an `outside', is construed as
   also thoroughly embedded in that outside through the subject body of the
   flesh and relations of desire. From this comes a conceptualisation of
   the in-itself and for-itself as simulacra or topological variations of a
   more primordial intertwining or fabric of univocal Being. In this sense,
   we are immediately taken away from the subject of social contract
   theory, insofar as this presumes an asocial self, and the notion of
   identity as the sine qua non of politics, insofar as this presumes the
   terrain of an inexplicable transcendent Other. This brings with it a
   take on politics that prefigures and is concomitant with Deleuzian
   micropolitics, while also serving to complement it through the retention
   of the ego as a practical function.},

Abstract = {Arbitration is as old as human history, and disagreements between people
   can be resolved through arbitration thousands of years before the
   judicial institutions can be formed in their very primary form.
   Gradually communities were established growing, and it would be
   necessary to be approved various laws and prosperity in the field of
   arbitration. In this regard, Iranian legislator was discussed
   arbitration issue, in one of his legislative actions on April ninth of
   two thousand during approval of the Civil Procedure Code and in its
   seventh, but surprisingly in this law is not only considered notable
   authority to judge, but there was also silence regarding the authority
   interim command exportation by arbitrator. On this basis of the
   aforementioned attributes and aims to improve of arbitration process in
   the rights of Iran, we try to review and analyze authority issue interim
   command up to a clear possibility of issuing a temporary order by the
   ship's helm justice, in accordance with the provisions of our law.},

Abstract = {On 8 February 2013, the European Council agreed on the EU's multiannual
   financial framework for 2014-20. The agreement includes a reduction of
   the overall spending level and significant reprioritisations. This paper
   asks how this agreement has been reached. Scharpf's actor-centered
   institutionalism is applied, including the concept of the joint-decision
   trap. The paper finds that the outcome was made possible by compensating
   the member states that were worst affected by the policy changes. A
   coalition of net contributors, centered on Germany and the United
   Kingdom, was influential regarding the overall spending level. In
   addition, the external environment with the fiscal and economic crisis
   created a momentum for reduced expenditures. Those against the
   reduction, the member states in favour of agriculture and cohesion, were
   not able to avoid cutbacks. Member states in favour of the cohesion
   policy faced hard conditions for maintaining unity in their coalition,
   whereas member states in favour of agricultural spending could more
   easily negotiate for their common interests.},

Title = {Assessing the Merits of Decentralization: A Framework for Identifying
   the Causal Mechanisms Influencing Policy Outcomes},
Journal = {POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {Decentralization is a structural change designed to influence policy
   outcomes by changing the policy-making process. Critical to assessing
   the merits of decentralization is an articulation of the causal
   mechanisms through which it alters the motivations and behavior of
   officials which, in turn, influence policy decisions. This article
   offers a new theoretical framework that explicates these causal
   mechanisms. It yields two sets of hypotheses. The first posits causal
   relationships between decentralization and the mix of resources and
   constraints that a government faces when addressing a policy problem.
   The second set of hypotheses explores how these resources and
   constraints influences decisions makers' preferences, incentives, and
   capacity. This framework captures the potential ways through which
   decentralization could alter policy outcomes, pointing to a new research
   agenda that will allow scholars to empirically sort through the mixed
   and inconclusive findings on decentralization's impact.},

Abstract = {The candidacies of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders typify populist
   protests launched in the name of the people going back to before the
   American Revolution. They express, however, very different populist
   impulses: Trump rode a mostly reactionary populism to the Republican
   nomination, echoing earlier reactionaries by exploiting nativist and
   racial resentments and prejudice among whites while inconsistently
   embracing progressive policies that unsettled traditional Republicans.
   Sanders launched a strong challenge for the Democratic nomination but
   with a consistently progressive populist message. Both campaigns
   appealed to their supporters by coming across as
   ``anti-establishment{''} and unrepresentative of politics-as-usual.},

Abstract = {Scotland in 2014 and 2015 provides an ideal context for examining EU
   citizenship political rights as established in the Maastricht Treaty of
   1993 from the perspective of Polish migrants resident in Scotland. We
   argue that the contrast between Polish migrants' full enfranchisement in
   the Scottish Independence Referendum in 2014 to then being
   disenfranchised from the UK General Election in 2015 is a significant
   site for observing how EU laws interact with state-centric and also
   post-national' notions of citizenship. Our participants' experiences of
   voting in the Referendum and subsequently not being able to vote in the
   General Election were articulated in the following terms: (a) the
   justification of their political rights in terms of their stake and
   contribution in the UK; (b) their frustrations with regards to
   anti-migration rhetoric and the limitations of European citizenship; and
   for some, (c) their plans of apply for British citizenship in the
   context of EU membership uncertainty.},

Abstract = {The real socialism's crisis, the communism's renewal in Europe and the
   electoral defeat of the sandinism in 1990, placed publically a view of
   the inevitable communism's decline. Nevertheless, the Chilean Communist
   Party (PCCh) and its Youths survived, becoming in a case, if not
   exceptional, at least particular. We propose that as a result of the
   marginalization of the PCCh of the democratic transition, the Jota
   entered the `90 decade defending its identity, shutting itself to defend
   a own legacy of a party with a long history. In this defensive identity,
   while everything was changing and renewing, the rebelion's sons, forged
   in the 80's politics culture, abandoned bolshevisms at the time they
   revalued Cuba and the Che Guevara; they reinterpreted their own history,
   passed from a testimonial style to a pragmatic one, gradually ascribing
   to the new social movements that emerged under the ``corrected
   socialism{''}. From that politic refuge, the Jota survived, starting a
   slow transition to a new politic strategy in the dawn of the XXI
   century.},

Volume = {51},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Although the cliched status of the phrase `the party's over' makes it
   almost redundant, the esteem in which parties are held has never been
   lower. One facet of party decline is the renewed interest in
   independents. Previously confined to transition states and
   non-democracies, they have begun to make some political headway in more
   established states. This is a worrying development for both political
   parties and those who profess their normative value. This article
   examines the source of the re-emergent independent presence via a case
   study of Ireland, a party democracy where they have had the greatest
   impact. Using constituency-level data, the influences of political,
   cultural and institutional factors are examined. It is found that
   independents are a product of both a small political system and
   declining party attachment. They are a protest option for those not
   drawn to ideological anti-establishment parties, while there is mixed
   evidence concerning the influence of a centre-periphery socioeconomic
   divide.},

   defence organisations of former communist states in Central and Eastern

Title = {Does survey mode matter for studying electoral behaviour? Evidence from
   the 2009 German Longitudinal Election Study},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {43},

Abstract = {Online surveys are becoming increasingly popular in the social sciences,
   particularly in electoral research. However, several studies have shown
   that participants who take part in online surveys differ significantly
   from those in other surveys. Still, since electoral research aims
   primarily at explaining voting behaviour (i.e., looks at slopes and
   intercepts in statistical model output), online surveys are deemed to be
   useful tools if models based on this data source arrive at similar
   conclusions than models based e.g. on random sample face-to-face or
   telephone surveys. This paper analyses these relationships by comparing
   models of voting behaviour based on data from various survey modes with
   different sample selections conducted by the German Longitudinal
   Election Study (GLES) 2009. The results indicate that the data quality
   of the different survey types is comparable; online surveys are thus
   useful for electoral research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Why are some institutions quickly replaced while others endure for more
   than a century? Majority cycling over institutions is theoretically
   unavoidable, but politics provides few opportunities to study it
   empirically. Using data on state constitutional characteristics and
   legislative composition from 1834 to 2012, this article advances the
   theory that institutions are more likely to be endogenously replaced
   when the society of actors differs from the time of enactment, and that
   institutional characteristics can exacerbate or mitigate these risks.
   Results show that political change interacts with institutional
   particularism to preserve or undermine state constitutions. More
   particularistic constitutions have shorter life spans because they are
   more vulnerable to changes in the political environment.},

Abstract = {A superordinate identity improves intergroup relations and bolsters
   support for the political system. Yet, why do only some identify
   superordinately? I argue that personality is an important determinant. I
   test this using an original survey in the United Kingdom, where European
   Union integration has increased the salience and feasibility of the
   European identity option in addition to a national one. Several Big Five
   traits matter: openness and extraversion increase identification with
   Europe while agreeableness decreases it. Mediation analysis subsequently
   shows that personality's effects also travel through the mechanisms of
   risk aversion, knowledge, and ideology. Results imply that certain
   predispositions prompt some to be more receptive than others to seeing
   themselves in superordinate terms and that European identification may
   be at least partly more primordial than previously thought.},

Abstract = {This article evaluates the relevance and viability of holding corporate
   agents accountable under the Rome Statute for their role in
   international crimes. The legal analysis focuses on two modes of
   liability: contribution liability under article 25 (3) (d) (ii) and
   superior responsibility under article 28 (b). Three case studies will
   assess the potential individual criminal liability of corporate
   officials in relation to situations currently either under investigation
   or preliminary examination by the Prosecutor, namely the Democratic
   Republic of Congo, Palestine, and Honduras. The article aims to advance
   insights into how the involvement of corporate actors in international
   crimes can and ought to be an integral part of the legal and factual
   analysis of international crimes.},

Abstract = {The aim of this note is to present the main results of a survey carried
   out in 2011 which gathers information on French academics' opinions and
   attitudes toward politics, economics, religion and ethical beliefs. The
   sample of respondents is large (N = 2,000) and the survey allows a
   comparison between academics and the overall French population by
   replicating questions of traditional surveys (EVS and Dynegal). We
   observe that French academics are considerably more left-wing, more
   hostile to free-market economy and more atheist than French citizens.
   Interestingly, a significant share of academics tends to adopt ethical
   guidelines that are similar to those of religious people.},

Abstract = {Diversity has been blamed for poor public goods provision in a number of
   different contexts. It is associated with reduced spending on services,
   meager rates of tax collection, and poor policies. I argue in this
   article, however, that in semidemocratic or authoritarian countries,
   where political parties are weak, diversity can be an important source
   of electoral competition, leading to better services. In diverse
   communities where multiple identity groups are politically mobilized,
   candidates are forced to seek the support of voters outside of their
   group, who are more likely to vote based on qualifications than on group
   affiliation, resulting in better public officials who provide superior
   services. Moreover, I find internal group fragmentation to be important
   in understanding the impact of heterogeneity on public goods provision:
   Candidates in areas where only one identity group is politically
   mobilized but where that group is politically fragmented will also seek
   votes from other groups within the community similar to candidates in
   locations with multigroup mobilization, leading to improved public goods
   provision. These arguments are confirmed through the analysis of tribal
   mobilization and public goods across Jordan's municipalities.},

Abstract = {This study offers a new perspective on the development of political
   parties in the Australian House of Representatives. We analyse a data
   set of 3060 legislative votes to estimate how parties influenced the
   behaviour of 287 legislators who served in the first 12 parliaments
   (1901-31). We show that the socialisation of members and cohort
   replacement effects, as well as a decline in private member business and
   committee votes, explain why partisanship increased over time. Our
   results challenge two widely held beliefs about the organisation of
   political parties in the legislative arena and the Australian party
   system. First, the analysis demonstrates that the government's ability
   to increase party discipline through control of the legislative agenda
   is limited when parliament is engaged in nation-building projects.
   Second, our study suggests that introducing restrictive parliamentary
   procedures played a role in consolidating Australia's unique two-party
   system, which opposes Labor to the Liberal-National coalition.},

Abstract = {This article reflects on the varied and complex dynamics faced by
   humanitarian agencies working in the Goma area during a six-week period
   from mid-July 1994, shortly after the exodus of an estimated 850,000
   refugees fleeing Rwanda who settled in the vicinity of Goma town in
   eastern Zaire, until the end of August 1994, which marked the period
   when the emergency phase of the humanitarian action in support of this
   refugee population began to stabilize. It considers three main dynamics,
   which were salient at the time: (1) the speed and size of the emergency;
   (2) the political environment inside the camps; (3) the traumas
   affecting the humanitarian environment. It covers the period when the
   author was assigned to support the emergency response to the crisis, and
   so combines personal reflections with reviews of some of the academic
   critique of the response by the international community. The article
   identifies the action as being critical to the evolution of
   international humanitarian response over the following two decades and
   concludes with a reflection on some of the lessons learned.},

Abstract = {This article examines the nature of first-year international relations
   (IR) teaching in Australia. Cost pressures in the university sector have
   been met by economies of scale with foundational classes becoming very
   large, often with hundreds of students. The article critically reflects
   on current strategies for teaching these courses to meet the challenge
   of providing an engaging and high quality learning environment in large
   classes with widely fluctuating student entry scores, university
   preparedness, and educational capital and language competence. The
   article argues that a successful approach to improving the quality of
   first-year IR teaching and to accommodating the diverse learning needs
   of all students is to run these courses in multiple streams, with one
   dedicated to providing a richer, more active IR learning experience. In
   the era of massification', allowing students a level of guided autonomy
   in aligning their learning preferences with teaching methods is likely
   to increase engagement and motivation, thereby improving retention and
   degree progression.},

Abstract = {Since its establishment, the Group of Twenty (G20) has undergone three
   phases of institutional transition: from an informal forum among finance
   ministers and governors of central banks at the beginning, to a
   crisis-management mechanism mainly to cope with the global financial
   crisis, and increasingly to a long-term platform for global governance
   in recent years. With increasing representation and mandates, the G20
   has been playing a key role in forging high-level consensuses and
   coordinating policies and actions among major economies so as to keep
   the world economy and development on track. Faced by the many challenges
   within itself and from the changing dynamics of the world economy and
   development, the G20 has to improve its cooperative spirit,
   representativeness and effectiveness before it can become a full-fledged
   institution for global governance.},

   on the one hand, that this decline is a result of Western policies and,
   on the other hand, that the decline follows naturally from the
   characteristics and aspirations of the Russian state and its leaders. It
   suggests that the deterioration is best understand as a result of
   multiple, reinforcing factors related to the internal characteristics of
   Russian political culture and the political system, and also to Russia's

Abstract = {Voter ID is a contentious issue in electoral democracies worldwide. This
   article surveys arguments for and against voter ID in the Australian
   context, presenting data from the first election in the country to
   require it. The data demonstrate a differential impact on regional
   electorates and on electorates with concentrations of Indigenous voters.
   While the law in question (from the State of Queensland) was moderate in
   its overall impact, confusion created by it may have suppressed turnout.
   The law has since been repealed, but voter ID now has the support of a
   conservative majority on the Commonwealth Parliament's electoral matters
   committee. We conclude that voter ID is not a solution to eliminating
   fraud, but an additional bureaucratic layer upon the ritual of casting a
   ballot and a hurdle with unintended consequences.},

Abstract = {What is democracy? To many citizens of post-Soviet countries it is
   synonymous with the disorder, instability, chaos, and hardship that was
   widespread throughout the 1990s. Importantly, these beliefs have been
   remarkably durable despite the subsequent economic recovery. While
   strong majorities remain supportive of democracy, the dynamics of
   transition have resulted in a subpopulation that is quite skeptical of
   democracy's ability to deliver on its promises, a fact that has
   important implications for future regime development in these countries.
   The present article combines qualitative interview data and
   nationally-representative surveys of Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and
   Latvia to explore the long-term consequences of economic collapse on
   beliefs about democracy and dictatorship among citizens of the
   post-Soviet states.},

Abstract = {It is increasingly evident that China has attached more attention to
   discursive power in foreign policy since the early 21st century. Both
   top leaders and government agencies have been active in advocating for a
   new discourse on various international occasions. Previously, China has
   been reluctant to join the debate in international affairs, and been
   instead preoccupied with domestic affairs since the late 1970s. The
   situation has changed since 2009 because of China's rapid rise to become
   the world's second largest economy. With regard to the motivations
   behind the Chinese government's support for discursive power, the
   dominant explanation is based on the ``rise of China{''} argument.
   However, this argument does not explain the causal relationship between
   China's rise and its discursive power strategy. So, this paper aims to
   clarify the motivation behind China's discursive power strategy through
   document reviews and interviews with mainstream scholars. It concludes
   that a discursive power strategy has been the fundamental principle of
   the Communist Party of China since its establishment in 1921. Since
   China's adoption of an opening-up policy in 1978, this tradition has
   been suppressed but not eliminated entirely by top leaders. As China
   continues to rise on the world stage, the principle will drive China to
   create a new political model rather than be a mere follower of the
   established political order.},

Abstract = {Researchers seeking to establish causal relationships frequently control
   for variables on the purported causal pathway, checking whether the
   original treatment effect then disappears. Unfortunately, this common
   approach may lead to biased estimates. In this article, we show that the
   bias can be avoided by focusing on a quantity of interest called the
   controlled direct effect. Under certain conditions, the controlled
   direct effect enables researchers to rule out competing explanations-an
   important objective for political scientists. To estimate the controlled
   direct effect without bias, we describe an easy-to-implement estimation
   strategy from the biostatistics literature. We extend this approach by
   deriving a consistent variance estimator and demonstrating how to
   conduct a sensitivity analysis. Two examples-one on ethnic
   fractionalization's effect on civil war and one on the impact of
   historical plough use on contemporary female political participation.

Abstract = {Policy issues compete for the attention of political actors, and the
   size of the agenda an issue can occupy is largely determined by the way
   in which it is defined. This logic constitutes a simple agenda-setting
   model in which factors related to the participants in the policy process
   and their context influence the attention a single issue receives after
   being problematised. In order to be able to apply this model to the
   construction of a whole agenda, we need to add an intermediate step.
   This study proposes to do so by incorporating the notion of issue
   character and offers an empirical application of the adapted model to
   the European Council, a crucial informal player in European Union (EU)
   agenda setting. Using a dimensionality reduction technique, the
   composition of the agenda is broken down to two constitutive dimensions
   - core vs. non-core themes of government and economic vs. non-economic
   character. Since the first structuring element is in line with existing
   knowledge and the role expectations for the European Council, the
   analysis concentrates on the second type. Changing saliency levels of
   the economic issue character of the agenda are used as a dependent
   variable in a model, including predictors related to the nature of the
   institution and contextual factors. The results show that leftist
   European Council party ideology and growing government deficit in the EU
   contribute to the increasing prominence of the economic dimension, which
   in turn explains rising levels in attention to various issues,
   especially of the non-core themes type.},

Abstract = {Theories of economic globalization suggest that public opinion-public
   policy congruence should be affected by a state's degree of integration
   with international markets. With as much attention researchers have
   given to the opinion-policy linkage in the American states, it is
   surprising that this literature has neglected these well-known
   globalization frameworks. We take advantage of the wide variation in
   U.S. states' integration in global markets, public policies, and
   political orientations of citizens, to assess whether global market
   integration depresses the association between citizen opinion and public
   policies. Using three decades of state-level data, our results suggest
   that high global market integration does not attenuate the relationship
   between state opinion and state public spending. Not only does this
   finding run counter to the well-known policy convergence thesis, but our
   results also suggest that the association between opinion and policy in
   the American states may be strongest under conditions of high global
   market integration.},

Abstract = {Citizenship rights is a legal term which has several definitions in
   diverse social and ideological schools; in some cultures its political
   and social aspects are emphasized more and terms such as nationality and
   voting right are mentioned and there is no theoretical agreement on it.
   But generally it can be said that citizenship rights are a collection of
   legislations and laws intended to protect human personality and dignity
   in all judicial-political and social fields and a citizen enjoys
   citizenship rights through living in a special geographical region and
   by virtue of the relationship existing between he/she and the ruling
   government. Based on this approach citizenship rights branching out the
   basic laws of every country, lay a responsibility upon both the citizen
   and the government and are also entry into force and performance
   guaranteed such as observing privacy, environment protection and so on.},

Title = {Notes from a refugee protest: ambivalences of resisting and desiring
   citizenship},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {In 2014, Afghan asylum-seekers and refugees in Turkey staged the longest
   refugee demonstration thus far in the country's history. They protested
   the UNHCR's office in Turkey and its decision to suspend new
   registrations, an action that they perceived to be discriminatory, and
   demanded the right to mobility. In the process, multiple forms of
   citizenship were enacted, illustrating refugees' ambivalent' relation
   with citizenship. Instead of dismissing this multiplicity as merely
   contradictory, this paper attempts to focus on it as a lens into

Abstract = {The rise of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) has been one of the most
   dramatic and widely discussed features of British politics in recent
   years. This article argues that one vital but largely overlooked facet
   of this phenomenon has been the politics of national identity. It argues
   that despite UKIP's ostensibly unionist stance, Englishness is an
   important pivot around which key elements of the party's appeal revolve,
   notably in terms of its Euroscepticism, its opposition to immigration
   and its anti-establishment narrative. It argues that the
   Anglo-Britishness promulgated by UKIP allows space for the celebration
   of English identity rather more easily than of other sub-state national
   identities, as it does not challenge the legitimacy of the UK state,
   which is itself seen as the expression of Anglo-British identity and
   sovereignty. Scottish nationalism, on the other hand, is seen as a
   threat to the Union and therefore anti-English.},

Abstract = {We examine the effect of democracy as an institutional context on
   individuals' perceptions of government corruption. To do so, we compile
   an integrated dataset from the Asian, Afro, and Latino Barometer Surveys
   and use a hierarchical linear regression model. Our primary finding is
   that the effect of democracy has different effects on ordinary citizens'
   perceptions of corruption in different contexts. In general, people in
   countries with higher levels of democracy tend to perceive their
   governments to be more corrupt. However, more importantly, conditional
   models show that in countries with more developed democratic
   institutions, individuals with stronger democratic values are less
   likely to perceive the government to be corrupt. Moreover, people in
   such countries are less likely to assess their government based on their
   perceptions of economic situation.},

Abstract = {This article explores the origins of local governance in postcolonial
   contexts. Focusing on migrant communities in the Indonesian island of
   Java and the networks of elite political and economic relations that
   emerged under colonial rule, I develop a theory of social exclusion and
   competition that specifies the conditions under which trading minorities
   will forge cooperative relations with local political elites in the
   absence of well-functioning property rights institutions. These informal
   relationships under colonial rule affect contemporary economic
   governance. To clarify the importance of social exclusion rather than
   other factors that may differentiate colonial districts with large
   Chinese populations, I exploit variation in the settlement patterns of
   Chinese and Arab trading minorities in Java, which played comparable
   roles in the island's colonial economy but faced different degrees of
   social exclusion. These findings contribute to recent work on
   colonialism and development, ethnicity and informal institutions, and
   the origins of democratic performance.},

Abstract = {Scholarship in comparative democratization finds that dialogue between
   the opposition and the old regime before the advent of democratic
   elections has consistently produced stable democracies least susceptible
   to reversals. This is because such pacted transitions promote values
   such as conciliation, compromise building, and consensus seeking. Yet
   the debate concerning how historical pact making affects the quality of
   democracy remains mainly anecdotal. Using a dataset of transitional
   states, I find that not all variants of pacted transitions facilitate
   consolidation. Pacted transitions initiated by the ancien regime are
   susceptible to democratic reversal, while transitions where the balance
   of power between the ancien regime and civic forces is equal in
   initiating regime change are associated with better democratic outcomes
   least susceptible to democratic collapse. The article also shows that
   regime transitions are very much influenced by other historical
   path-dependent factorsspecifically the role of civic associations and
   coalitions during the transitional process.},

   opposition Kurds view the way in which Turkish authorities manage water
   resources, policies and politics within the basins, affecting local
   society and the environment. It has been found that beyond establishing
   hydro-hegemony over co-riparian states along the Tigris and Euphrates
   (Syria and Iraq), the Turkish state has sought to deploy its soft and
   hard power over Kurds. The opposition Kurdish movement has responded by
   developing its own counter-hegemonic measures. Their proposals seem to
   aim at winning over Kurds, but also Turks and other peoples. Their
   framing of a different type of stakeholder participation in
   decision-making calls for a model of direct democracy covering different
   aspects of life, including water management and environmental soundness.
   The research is based on academic and government literature and a number
   of semi-structured interviews with Kurdish municipal officials, faculty
   and activists.},

Abstract = {This article considers the historical development of a characteristic
   crucial for the functioning and normative appeal of Westminster systems:
   cohesive legislative parties. It gathers the universe of the 20,000
   parliamentary divisions that took place between 1836 and 1910 in the
   British House of Commons, construct a voting record for every Member of
   Parliament (MP) serving during this time, and conducts analysis that
   aims to both describe and explain the development of cohesive party
   voting. In line with previous work, it shows that - with the exception
   of a chaotic period in the 1840s and 1850s - median discipline was
   always high and increased throughout the century. The study uses novel
   methods to demonstrate that much of the rise in cohesion results from
   the elimination of a rebellious `left tail' from the 1860s onwards,
   rather than central tendency shifts. In explaining the aggregate trends,
   the article uses panel data techniques and notes that there is scant
   evidence for `replacement' explanations that involve new members
   behaving in more disciplined ways than those leaving the chamber. It
   offers evidence that more loyal MPs were more likely to obtain
   ministerial posts, and speculates that this and other `inducement'-based
   accounts offer more promising explanations of increasingly cohesive
   parties.},

   perform a comparative analysis of the values that are fostered by the
   codes of conduct from Mexican and Colombian local governments. The main
   findings show that there are significant differences in the values
   transparency, honesty and equity. In this regard, the Colombian local
   governments pay a greater attention to the importance of the access to
   public information while those Mexican give more emphasis in promotion
   conducts that guarantee the honesty and equity of the public servants.},

Abstract = {Ideological semantics have long served as a means of political
   communication and an informational shortcut between voters and political
   elites. As the usage of ideological labels spread to non-Western
   settings, questions have been raised concerning whether and how these
   concepts can reflect issue dimensions beyond the economic debates that
   have traditionally defined ``left{''} and ``right{''} in most Western
   democracies. The present study explores what issue dimensions citizens
   in Japan associate with ideological labels, and the degree to which
   ideological orientations and proximity to parties affect vote choice. We
   use longitudinal survey data covering a quarter-century to investigate
   (i) to what extent do citizens understand the ideological space in terms
   of foreign and security policy at the expense of other issue dimensions,
   as previous studies have documented; and (ii) whether ideological
   orientations have remained a relevant guide to voting behavior for four
   major parties in the past three decades.},

Abstract = {Interpreters of Robert Nozick's political philosophy fall into two broad
   groups concerning his application of the `Lockean proviso'. Some read
   his argument in an undemanding way: individual instances of ownership
   which make people worse off than they would have been in a world without
   any ownership are unjust. Others read the argument in a demanding way:
   individual instances of ownership which make people worse off than they
   would have been in a world without that particular ownership are unjust.
   While I argue that the former reading is correct as an interpretive
   matter, I suggest that this reading is nonetheless highly demanding. In
   particular, I argue that it is demanding when it is expanded to include
   the protection of nonhuman animals; if such beings are right bearers, as
   more and more academics are beginning to suggest, then there is no
   nonarbitrary reason to exclude them from the protection of the proviso.},

Volume = {48},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Electoral rules and party candidate selection processes both affect
   legislators' behavior, specifically, their tendency to either toe or
   break their party's line. However, elections and selections may produce
   contradictory incentives for legislators, leading us to ask how
   conflicting motivations affect legislators' tendencies to dissent. I
   argue that the effect of these two institutions is conditional and that
   legislators who face contradictory incentives will tend to maintain
   voting discipline. On the other hand, when the incentives of elections
   and selections align, they tend to amplify one another. This is
   especially true when elections and selections both incentivize
   personalization. In this article, I test and find support for the
   conditional hypothesis using an original individual-level dataset with
   more than 6,700 legislators from thirty country-sessions.},

Abstract = {Structural equation modelers judge multi-item constructs against three
   requirements: (a) multiple items converge in a single dimension; (b)
   individual-level patterns of item convergence are invariant across
   countries; (c) aggregate-level patterns of item convergence replicate
   those at the individual level. This approach involves two premises:
   Measurement validity hinges solely on a construct's internal
   convergence, and convergence patterns at the individual level have
   priority over those at the aggregate level. We question both premises
   (a) because convergence patterns at the aggregate-level exist in their
   own right and (b) because only a construct's external linkages reveal
   its reality outreach. In support of these claims, we use the example of
   emancipative values to show that constructs can entirely lack
   convergence at the individual level and nevertheless exhibit powerful
   and important linkages at the aggregate level. Consequently, we advocate
   a paradigm shift from internal convergence toward external linkage as
   the prime criterion of validity.},

Journal = {POLITY},

Abstract = {A debate has emerged among international relations theorists over the
   importance and existence of audience costs in international politics.
   Yet tests of audience costs theory have focused mainly on a two-party
   presidential democracy, the United States, and have largely ignored
   multi-party parliamentary democracies. This article explores a case in a
   country previously ignored by proponents and critics of audience cost
   theory: the Second Lebanon War of 2006 in Israel. Consistent with the
   theory, this article finds that the general public disapproved of the
   Olmert government's backing down after issuing threats against
   Hezbollah, and that public disapproval greatly weakened the government.
   However, this case study also shows that leaders can still retain office
   when they face multiple audiences (or principals), by cutting side deals
   with other parties in parliament.},

Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between the recent discoveries of
   hydrocarbon resources in the Eastern Mediterranean and the resolution of
   the long-standing division of Cyprus. The relationship is examined from
   two different perspectives: whether the findings can become a catalyst
   to resolving the problem, and conversely whether a possible resolution
   can provide the impetus for regional cooperation on the basis of
   energy-related considerations. We argue that, while both causal pathways
   would result in positive consequences both on a bilateral and a regional
   level, it is unlikely that either will be achieved as a result of the
   complicated security relations and negotiating framework among the
   relevant regional actors.},

Title = {Does the Commonwealth Electoral Act Satisfy the Requirement That
   Representatives Be `Directly Chosen' by the People?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {78-92},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The electoral system embodied in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918
   (Cth) is notable for its startling unfairness to voters who support
   minor parties. This article argues that the disparity between voter
   preferences and the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives
   means that the electoral system cannot be said to provide for the
   election of members `directly chosen by the people', as required by s 24
   of the Constitution, and is therefore open to challenge. Although
   challenges to the electoral system in Attorney General (Cth); Ex rel
   McKinlay v Commonwealth and McGinty v Western Australia were
   unsuccessful, dicta by majorities in both cases support the argument
   that at some point - albeit unstated by the courts in those cases - an
   electoral system will be so unrepresentative as not to be consistent
   with s 24. Subsequent decisions in Roach v Electoral Commissioner and
   Rowe v Electoral Commissioner, to the effect that franchise laws must be
   appropriate and adapted to the system of representative government, also
   provide grounds for a constitutional challenge to the current electoral
   system. The article ends with a discussion of the criteria to be used to
   determine what system would be consistent with direct representation of
   the people, and argues that the Single Transferrable Vote system
   satisfies the requirements of accurate reflection of voter sentiment and
   provision to voters of identifiable local representatives.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {44},
Number = {4},
Pages = {587-617},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Many observers are concerned that campaign contributions could affect
   the decisions of elected judges. However, the empirical correlation
   between contributions and judicial decisions is consistent with two
   different explanations of judicial behavior: (a) money influences judges
   or (b) contributors choose to support candidates with a similar
   philosophical or legal perspective. In this article, we take advantage
   of North Carolina's shift to a voluntary public finance system for state
   Supreme Court candidates to obtain more credible estimates of the
   contributions-behavior relationship. Applying a
   difference-in-differences research design, we provide evidence that
   justices who opted into public financing became relatively less
   favorable toward attorney donors. We also find partial support for our
   hypothesis that participating justices became more moderate in their
   voting patterns. Taken together, these findings suggest that public
   financing reduced responsiveness to donors among participating justices.},

Abstract = {Much of the political theory literature on Thoreau is divided, with one
   camp focusing on resistance and civil disobedience, while the second
   concentrates on withdrawal. This bifurcation is not borne out in
   Thoreau's texts, and it can lead to a mischaracterization of Thoreau as
   an essentially instrumental thinker and an idiosyncratic political
   actor. In this article I argue against this bifurcation of withdrawal
   and resistance, maintaining that Thoreau's exit was simultaneously a
   mode of resistance. His resistant exit has double political significance
   because it was instrumental and expressive. In addition to the change
   that it can produce in the individual, Thoreau's resistant exit is
   consequential because the action itself symbolizes opposition.},

Abstract = {Citizens and activists in Brazil were optimistic about their role in
   shaping public policies after the democratic wave of the 1980s,
   particularly in the field of international trade negotiations. Observers
   point out that the state is more open than in previous decades and that
   Itamaraty ( the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs) is losing its
   grip over the decision-making process. In this article, we dispute this
   affirmation. First, we demonstrate the analytical overlap between
   participation and influence in the literature. Second, we argue that the
   decision-making process was far more democratic, and Itamaraty less
   powerful, from 1946 to 1973 than it is today; participation in the
   policy arena was associated with influence. Democratization in the
   political regime in Brazil after 1985 did not bring democratization to
   the decision-making process in our case. We conclude by presenting some
   suggestions on how to bridge the current chasm between participation and
   influence in Brazilian foreign policy.},

Abstract = {It is a noticeable feature of the contemporary revival of interest in
   realist political thought that it has very much hesitated from exploring
   its implications for international political theory. This is interesting
   both because realism is one of the dominant intellectual traditions in
   international relations, but also as much of the recent debates
   surrounding global justice have engaged with themes that are at least
   germane to those of realism. This article will therefore try and extend
   some of the themes of realist political thought into the realm of global
   justice. While there might be several areas worth exploring, the focus
   here shall be on the realist emphasis on making sense of politics as a
   sphere of activity that has internal sources of normativity which cannot
   be reduced to moral first principles, the relationship between politics
   and legitimacy, and how these pose fundamental questions for the
   political nature of global justice. It ends by arguing that, viewed
   through the realist lens, the question of the legitimacy of
   international institutions should take greater priority in global
   justice debates insofar as this is fundamental to enabling us to
   understand justice in political and not exclusively moral terms.},

Abstract = {How does the Chinese government pay its officials in different regions?
   What determines regional variation in civil service pay? These are
   important questions for understanding the Chinese government. We argue
   that regional difference of civil service pay is shaped by both
   political and economic factors. After review of policy changes in
   government salaries since the 1950s, we conduct an empirical analysis
   using a panel of 31 provinces from 1997 to 2008. The results indicate
   that, fiscal transfers, local and self-raised revenues significantly
   raise wage levels across provinces under certain conditions of
   government size. Furthermore, Civil service pay positively correlates
   with level of regional economic development, and also, according to a
   certain base, central policy of wage adjustment accelerates the rate of
   increase in civil service remuneration.},

Abstract = {This paper sets out to explain the preferences of the seven northern
   euro area member states on the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM)
   concerning the threshold set for direct European Central Bank (ECB)
   control over bank supervision. Building on the concept of the `financial
   trilemma', it argues that different bank internationalisation patterns
   in the seven northern member states explain different preferences on the
   transfer of supervisory powers over less significant banks to the ECB.
   In particular, the reach of internationalisation into a national banking
   system - notably the extent to which even smaller banks were exposed to
   foreign banking operations - is shown to be the core factor explaining
   different national preferences on threshold. In the five countries with
   a large number of small and parochial alternative (cooperative and
   savings) banks, it is necessary to examine the system-specific
   structures of these banks to explain better the reach of
   internationalisation and national preferences on the threshold.
   Determined German opposition to ECB supervision of smaller alternative
   banks is juxtaposed with either less hostile or more positive support of
   at least four other countries despite the important presence of small
   alternative banks.},

Abstract = {Research into how civilian casualties influence public opinion largely
   focuses on citizens' support for the use of force by their own
   countries. This study explores how civilian casualties and partisan cues
   shape support for the use of force by an ally in a foreign conflict.
   Specifically, it assesses the effects of civilian casualty inequity -
   the uneven distribution of civilian casualties across two sides in a
   conflict - on Americans' support for Israel. Drawing on an original
   survey experiment conducted during the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, the
   article bridges work on inequity aversion theory, party identification,
   and social identity theory. It finds that civilian casualty inequity
   information reduces support for Israel, particularly among Independents.
   The study also finds that adding explicit partisan criticism cues to
   civilian casualty inequity information does not appear to induce
   motivated evaluations of Israel among Republicans or Democrats. An
   important implication is that under conditions of greater media coverage
   of civilian casualty inequity, Americans - particularly Independents -
   might become less supportive of Israel even in the absence of elite
   criticism of Israel.},

Abstract = {The article traces the unfolding of the human security agenda as the
   primary organising framework for constructing the security outlook of
   the South African military. Questions are raised about the utility of
   human security as a conceptual basis for thinking about and the
   construction of defence. Human security is historically contextualised
   within the security conceptualisations of the 1990s. Since then,
   however, various geo-strategic changes in the world necessitated a
   return to a more traditional outlook on security and strategy. This
   reality was also increasingly visible in South Africa's foreign policy
   approaches and, more specifically, the employment of its armed forces in
   Africa. The article concludes by arguing, firstly, that the South
   African armed forces did not at any time critically question how a
   military should be organised, trained, and equipped for human security
   operations and, secondly, that the South African National Defence Force
   never questioned its own operational deployments through the human
   security perspective.},

Abstract = {This study examines if prime minister's parties are punished or rewarded
   by voters to a lesser extent in candidate-centred electoral systems
   compared to party-centred systems. Candidate-centred systems allow the
   voters greater choice in determining the fate of individual candidates
   at the district level and create incentives for candidates to cultivate
   a personal vote rather than pursuing a party vote. Voters in these
   systems are more likely to focus on individual candidates than on
   parties, thus fostering individual accountability at the expense of
   collective (party) accountability. Cross-sectional time-series data for
   23 OECD countries between 1961 and 2014 were analysed. Two indices of
   intraparty efficiency (the Farrell-McAllister Index and the Shugart
   Index) were used to capture the candidate-centredness of electoral
   systems. The analysis of aggregate-level data with almost 300
   observations showed that incumbent parties tend to win or lose fewer
   votes in candidate-centred electoral systems. This effect has become
   stronger over time. Candidate-centredness has a weak moderating impact
   on the state of the economy on the degree of public sanctioning of
   government parties.},

Abstract = {The Philippine labour migration regime has been praised as one of the
   best examples of government-led migration management in the developing
   world, with some of the most extensive policies and bureaucratic
   organisations to manage and protect its citizens working abroad.
   However, not much knowledge has been accumulated that explains its
   origins or why it emerged in the Philippines and not in other
   large-scale migrant-sending countries. Contrary to current explanations
   that emphasise the economic benefits of labour migration and civil
   society mobilisation, this paper highlights the migration regime's
   compatibility with the political economy interests of the country's
   ruling elites. Bringing together the country's two important political
   and economic features, oligarchic rule and labour export, this paper
   suggests that the unique genesis of the Philippines' migration regime
   casts doubts on the replicability of the Philippine model in other
   labour-sending countries as currently pursued by the international
   development community.},

Abstract = {In most political systems, the community of policy insiders represents a
   small subset of the total interest group population. Therefore, one key
   question is which factors explain why some mobilized interests become
   insiders and others remain outsiders. By contrasting a bottom-up
   registration of interest groups with a top-down census of all groups
   that enjoy access to policymakers, we present a unique approach to
   distinguish insiders from outsiders. This approach allows us to
   systematically analyze which factors - such as resources, constituency,
   scale of organization and policy portfolio - predict who becomes a
   policy insider. Our analysis focuses on interest group politics in
   Belgium, and shows that next to resources, the size of the membership,
   the scale of organization and a group's policy portfolio are strong
   predictors of the likelihood to gain access.},

Abstract = {Imagine a world where households have to apply to be considered a family
   by the state. They would need to document how their domestic grouping
   fulfills the requirements of ``family{''} through bank statements,
   passports, Social Security numbers, and perhaps even recommendations
   from those in their community attesting to the strength and quality of
   their relationships or their health and fitness. In reality, this
   scenario is not as far-fetched as one might think. We contend that
   family is a status bestowed by the state. The state invokes, imposes,
   and relies on the family as an instrument of policy implementation and
   enforcement and as way of organizing and managing a productive society.
   In disseminating the benefits and protections that hinge on family, the
   state holds significant autonomy in determining whether certain
   households will be perceived and treated as families in the eyes of the
   state. Through the lens of policy debates regarding LGBTQ-headed
   households, single-mother headed households, and group homes, we argue
   the following: concepts of family operate as an arm of the state; as
   more policies hinge on familyhood, more households seek that
   determination from the state; and state actors are at once exclusive and
   inconsistent in granting this status. In all, this suggests that rather
   than operating only as a matter of individual choice - a way of naming
   our private relationships - family should also be understood as a
   state-appointed and -anointed status.},

Abstract = {In this article, we compare the phenomenon of working-class literature
   in Sweden and the United States. After examining how working-class
   literatures have evolved in both countries, we analyze how they have
   been conceptualized in two academic fields: contemporary U.S.
   working-class studies and the study of Swedish literary history. We
   discuss the material and historical contexts shaping these
   conceptualizations, critique them on theoretical grounds, and offer ways
   that comparative approaches help us better understand the phenomenon of
   working-class literature. Our main argument is that our analysis makes
   visible two important features of this literature. The first of these,
   inscribed in the very concept of the term, is that working-class
   literature is both a literary phenomenon and a phenomenon relating to
   working-class life. The second feature - a far less obvious, but not
   less important one - is that working-class literatures are always
   historically and geographically situated and, thus, assume divergent
   shapes in different times and locations. We argue that working-class
   literature as a phenomenon is, therefore, always in a process of new
   formations. In doing so, we move away from narrow nationalistic views of
   working-class literature as a defined term and, using a comparative
   approach, allow for new vantage points in the analysis of the
   relationship between class and culture.},

   operating from 1968 to 1979. It presents its history in the context of
   the development of an alternative to armed struggle and party politics.
   The research is grounded in the testimonies of former militants,
   internal documents of the organization and a comprehensive literature
   review with a focus in regional history studies. Delving into Politica
   Popular's history we find that political context and the group fixation
   with mass line resulted in union and social activism.},

Abstract = {Using data on national parliamentary election outcomes in 32 OECD
   countries from 1975 to 2013, we investigate the importance of economic
   voting. We focus on the relevance of income inequality which has
   resurfaced to the forefront of public debate since the last global
   economic downturn. Additionally, we examine whether the degree of
   economic voting varies with the political orientation of the incumbent
   government. Finally, we check whether the Great Recession of 2008-2009
   alters the degree to which voters hold the incumbent government,
   specifically left parties, responsible for poor economic performance and
   rising inequality. We find that economic growth is the most robust
   variable for economic voting, before and after the Great Recession. The
   vote share for left-leaning parties declines when income inequality
   rises during normal economic times. However, voters are more likely to
   vote for left-wing incumbents if domestic income inequality and
   unemployment rate rose during the Great Recession. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {The debate that has arisen around the weakening of the traditional
   cleavages' heuristic power in explaining vote suggests considering the
   role of lifestyles in designing politically meaningful social
   aggregates. We investigated the relationship between lifestyle and
   voting behavior, establishing the degree to which this relationship
   traces the effect of the socio-structural categories (e.g. social class)
   or is, at least in part, independent of them. Through a k-means
   clustering, we individuated a typology of four Italian lifestyles; we
   showed its relation to socio-demographic features and its ability to
   discriminate participants' political attitudes. The subscription to each
   lifestyle was significantly associated with voting behavior, net of the
   variance accounted for by the traditional cleavages. The theoretical
   implication and further direction of research are discussed.},

Abstract = {We investigate institutional explanations for Congress's choice to
   fragment statutory frameworks for policy implementation. We argue that
   divided party government, which fuels legislative-executive conflict
   over control of the bureaucracy, motivates Congress to fragment
   implementation power as a strategy to enhance its control over
   implementation. We develop a novel measure of fragmentation in policy
   implementation, collect data on it over the period 1947-2008, and test
   hypotheses linking separation-of-powers structures to legislative design
   of fragmented implementation power. We find that divided party
   government is powerfully associated with fragmentation in policy
   implementation, and that this association contributed to the long-run
   growth of fragmentation in the postwar United States. We further find
   that legislative coalitions are more likely to fragment implementation
   power in the face of greater uncertainty about remaining in the
   majority.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {41},
Pages = {244-249},

Abstract = {This paper develops a three-stage method to forecast parliamentary
   election results from vote preferences in British opinion polls: (1)
   adjusting and aggregating vote-intentions from different polling
   organizations; (2) forecasting how public support for parties will
   change in the period before election day; and (3) translating, through
   simulations, the forecast of election day vote shares into seat totals
   while incorporating constituency-level information, including local
   vote-intention polls. Overall, this approach seeks to combine relevant
   national, regional and local information, and uncertainty about that
   information, to better reflect the fragmentation and diversity of
   political contexts found in the new era of five/six-party British
   politics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article presents results from a survey among political candidates
   standing in parliamentary elections in Iceland in the spring of 2013
   regarding their use of media in the election campaign. The purpose of
   this study was twofold; first to determine the extent to which
   politicians have adopted new technologies. Thereby adapting their
   election strategies to new realities and a transformed media environment
   characterized by hybridization between new networked media and
   traditional media logic. Secondly, to examine whether in a digitalized
   media era, there is a difference in media use between old and new
   political parties. The findings suggest a process of normalization and
   the potential advantage for new parties, due to easier access to
   communication channels created by less expensive new media outlets, was
   by and large negated by a more complex and diverse media environment.},

   parties of the last century that is essential for the development of a

   accurate study, from the very beginning of political party formation to
   the present, three forces are distinguishable in Iranian Society and the
   partial activities during the past 100 years can be framed in three
   movements:

Abstract = {Constitutional referendums are an opportunity to showcase direct
   democracy and popular sovereignty over the shape of the institutions
   that govern representative democracy. But to be deliberatively
   meaningful, referendums on such legal questions require lengthy voter
   education, and fair structuring of questions. In 2016, Queensland voted
   narrowly to join the other Australian States and Territories in having
   fixed, four-year terms. This article explains the context behind the
   referendum, and analyses the partisan and regional drivers of its
   outcome. It also critiques the process, which bundled two distinct
   questions, in a hurried `campaign' that offered minimal voter education.
   In the result, the major parties won the longer terms they had long
   craved. However Queensland is left with less frequent elections, and a
   powerful executive with neither an upper house nor proportional
   representation to check it.},

Abstract = {In this work we offer results drawn from a dataset of a post-provincial
   election survey in eight Canadian provinces to assess the impact of
   party system congruency on partisanship. We postulate that partisanship
   will be more likely and stronger in provinces that share a similar
   political party system to the federal level. We extend this preliminary
   analysis to test the underlying mechanism by examining the impact
   holding partisan ties at the provincial level has on the likelihood and
   strength of federal identification, according to party system
   similarity. Our results show very limited support for the party system
   congruency factor, raising further questions of its applicability in the
   Canadian context.
   Resume Dans cet article, nous presentons les resultats provenant d'un
   ensemble de donnees tirees d'un sondage post-electoral provincial
   realise dans huit provinces canadiennes pour evaluer l'impact de la
   coherence du systeme des partis sur la partisannerie. Nous partons de
   l'hypothese que la partisannerie serait plus previsible et plus
   importante dans les provinces qui ont le meme systeme de partis
   politiques qu'au niveau federal. Nous allons plus loin dans cette
   analyse preliminaire, afin de tester le mecanisme sous-jacent, en
   examinant l'impact qu'a le fait d'entretenir des liens partisans, au
   niveau provincial, sur la probabilite d'une identification federale et
   sur son intensite, en fonction de la ressemblance du systeme des partis.
   Nos resultats montrent que l'influence du facteur de coherence du
   systeme de partis est tres limitee, soulevant de nouvelles questions
   quant a son applicabilite dans le contexte canadien.},

Title = {Women's human rights may be unicorns, but they can fight wicked witches},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},

Pages = {58-66},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This essay responds to Alasdair MacIntyre's skeptical claim that human
   rights are like ``witches{''} and ``unicorns{''}-as in, they don't
   exist, and thus cannot be subject to abstract rational justification.
   Putting aside the issue of the abstract rational justification of human
   rights, I focus on the more urgent practical question of how human
   rights might be meaningfully alleged when they do not yet exist within
   society, culture, law, or policy. Borrowing from MacIntyre's narrative
   theory of ethics to undermine his skeptical view of human rights, I
   contend that human rights-whether understood as moral rights or as
   political rights-can be coherently alleged through the same kind of
   narrative framework that MacIntyre argued was essential to any
   intelligible ethical system of thought. In particular, imaginative
   narrative frameworks-such as those found in stories and films-have been
   crucial for the enterprise of demanding human rights for the powerless,
   especially girls and women. Putting at its center a feminist
   interpretation of the classic American film, The Wizard of Oz (1939),
   this article playfully, yet ultimately seriously, challenges MacIntyre's
   dismissal of rights as ``witches and unicorns{''} by showing how
   allegations of women's human rights derive much of their power for
   fighting human wrongs from their historically (although not essentially)
   imaginative character as well as their deeper narrative structure.},

Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {181-215},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Some studies of policy representation test hypotheses about the
   relationship between citizens' views and elites' positions on multiple
   issues by proceeding one issue at a time. Others summarize citizens' and
   elites' preferences with ideology scores and test hypotheses with these.
   I show that approach is flawed. It misinterprets citizens' ideology
   scores as summaries of policy preferences, but these scores actually
   measure ideological consistency across areas: how often citizens' ideal
   policies are liberal or conservative. Examples show how attending to
   this distinction overturns conventional wisdom: legislators appear
   similarly moderate as citizens, not more extreme; however, politically
   engaged citizens appear especially moderate.},

Abstract = {This article asks the following question: Is Adam Smith a conservative?
   Smith is usually seen as a key author of the liberal tradition, but some
   of his claims have a strong conservative overtone. Although he
   frequently defends the individual and his capacity to be the agent of
   his own history, Smith simultaneously limits this space, arguing that
   the very same individuals are incapable of understanding their own
   action, and arguing in favor of socially controlling and disciplining
   them. Three themes are discussed: (1) Smith's metaphor of the invisible
   hand, (2) the question of institutional design, and (3) the question of
   social hierarchy. This article points towards certain tensions in the
   work of Adam Smith, the Scottish enlightenment, and the liberal
   tradition which was built, to a large extent, on these foundations.},

Abstract = {Most electoral fraud is not conducted centrally by incumbents but rather
   locally by a multitude of political operatives. How does an incumbent
   ensure that his agents deliver fraud when needed and as much as is
   needed? We address this and related puzzles in the political
   organization of electoral fraud by studying the perverse consequences of
   incentive conflicts between incumbents and their local agents. These
   incentive conflicts result in a herd dynamic among the agents that tends
   to either oversupply or undersupply fraud, rarely delivering the amount
   of fraud that would be optimal from the incumbent's point of view. Our
   analysis of the political organization of electoral fraud explains why
   even popular incumbents often preside over seemingly unnecessary fraud,
   why fraud sometimes fails to deliver victories, and it predicts that the
   extent of fraud should be increasing in both the incumbent's genuine
   support and reported results across precincts. A statistical analysis of
   anomalies in precinct-level results from the 2011-2012 Russian
   legislative and presidential elections provides preliminary support for
   our key claims.},

Abstract = {In 2014, the UN Security Council emphasized the dangers of terrorism,
   criminal activity (especially drug production and trafficking), and
   state weakness in conflict areas. However, neither policy debates nor
   scholarly analyses have focussed on the potential impact of these
   elements on conflict dynamics and characteristics, and the investigated
   partial relationships have led to inconclusive results. This article
   explores the presence in armed conflicts of terrorist groups among
   fighting parties, major drug production (indicating the presence of
   activities typical of criminal organizations), and state failure in the
   period 1990-2011. Focussing on intrastate conflicts, this article
   highlights that, while when they are isolated their impact on armed
   conflicts is limited, when the three factors are simultaneously present,
   the interactions among them create a sort of threshold effect capable of
   affecting conflict characteristics and, in particular, conflict duration
   and incompatibility.},

Abstract = {In this commentary, an outside perspective, mainly informed by
   International Relations (IR) and Political Theory (PT), is taken. From
   there, three issues are identified that point to the next steps in
   extending the research programme on politicisation. First, it is argued
   that an exclusive focus on public media might be too narrow in scope, as
   important features of politicisation are not taken into account. Second,
   it is highlighted that chances are missed by placing exclusive focus on
   the EU, and again an opening up by comparing findings from the study of
   the EU with developments on other political levels is argued for. Third,
   the emerging focus on the consequences of politicisation is to be
   applauded from an opening-up perspective.},

Title = {The perspective of multi-religious Society on Islamization policy in
   Malaysia},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Pages = {196-213},
Abstract = {Support for Islam has often been described as part of the Malaysian
   government's drive for Islamization, commonly known as `Islamization
   policy'. The concept of an `Islamization policy' is contested, open to
   various interpretations since it is not officially defined in any
   government blueprint. This paper highlights the perspectives of a number
   of religious groups on Islamization policy. The study covered the period
   from 1981 until 2009, which includes the Mahathir Mohamed and Abdullah
   Ahmad Badawi administrations. Using a policy analysis lens, the paper
   focuses on the perspective of the groups regarding the idea of
   Islamization as a public policy; the meaning and status of Islamization
   policy. The patterns indicate that the views are more complex than just
   `for' and `against,' although the patterns of perception are based on
   two divergent views: those who support the policy (the proponents) and
   those who oppose it (the opponents). This diversity is significant in
   that it helps to provide a better understanding of some multi-religious
   perspectives towards Islamization policy, as well as highlighting the
   different interests and concerns of both Muslim and non-Muslim
   communities towards the policy.},

Abstract = {``Is democracy compatible with Islam?{''} Even if democracy could not be
   established across the entire region after the alleged Arab spring,
   there seems to be little doubt about the fact that ``Islam is able to do
   democracy{''} in the mind of the populations of Arab countries and Iran.
   Is there a reason for assuming that the widely travelled ideas of
   democracy and human rights have turned into a norm? Under the heading
   ``circulating norms{''} the article is about the discourse of democracy
   and human rights in Iran. The paper starts with a description of the
   negative and critical attitudes towards democracy taken by some
   illustrious Iranian intellectuals in the 60s and 70s. Then, hoWever, at
   the beginning of the 90s some outstanding thinkers turned towards
   democracy. Liberal thinkers such as Shabestari and Soroush grounded the
   concept of democracy in traditional views of justification. This
   indicates that democracy was apparently recognized as a norm.},

Abstract = {Relationship management in firms is as important as resources and skills
   management. To minimize uncertainty, enterprises try to organize their
   partner relationships into a network, in which the principles of trust
   and reciprocity prevail. By definition, a network is a collaborative
   structure, which depends neither on the market; nor on the hierarchy.
   Such networks are formed by several financially and legally independent
   partners with autonomous management that are, however, mutually
   dependent to achieve common goals. Thus traditional theories on
   governance, such as control of the board of directors in the private
   enterprise or the state's supervision of public bodies, may not apply to
   the network. In this chapter, we focus on governance network theory.},

Abstract = {According to the Constitution of Slovenia ( 1991), the general
   representative body of the Slovenia nation is the National Assembly. In
   this article author deals with some characteristics and doubtfulness of
   the regulation of the National Assembly such as structure, competences,
   management, mode of decision - making, legislative procedure and
   efficiency. Key questions of legislative activity are still attached to
   the failure to comply with the regular legislative procedure,
   insufficient role of the legal profession, inadequate assessments of the
   effects of regulation, insufficient public cooperation and lack of
   transparency in lobbying. The operation of Slovenian parliament is the
   result of political and historical heritage, the peculiarities of the
   transitional development and the structure of the political space.},

Abstract = {Events since I published my book Post-democracy in 2004 suggest that
   democracy continues to decline in effectiveness in those parts of the
   world where it has been most strongly established. The global financial
   crisis, the consequent euro crisis, the likely shape of a Transatlantic
   Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and growing evidence of the
   political power of giant mass media corporations all suggest that the
   dominant forces in today's politics are not those of democratic will.
   Movements like Syriza in Greece possibly suggest a democratic
   reawakening, but that is too early to determine. Meanwhile, it is
   important also to be aware of democracy's limits, and to try to resolve
   the problem of post-democracy by extending its reach beyond its
   competence.},

Volume = {8},

Pages = {135-159},
Abstract = {Since September 11, 2001, various Western democracies have reformed and
   strengthened their national security apparatuses by introducing new
   organizational structures and policies to curb incidence of terrorism by
   violent extremist organizations. These changes have catalyzed several
   prominent intelligence communities into formidable challengers against
   large-scale centralized acts of terrorism. These successes, however, are
   being overshadowed by the emerging threat of lone wolf terrorism. Many
   scholars and policy- makers have attempted to create typologies of lone
   wolf terrorists by identifying behaviors akin to some type of
   radicalization processes. Although these potential categorizations have
   effectively provided reactive analysis, their research and policy
   prescriptions have been problematic and failed to provide proactive
   solutions or recommendations for law enforcement and the intelligence
   community. In this paper, we examine the literature on lone wolf
   phenomena. We then attempt to fill a gap in the extant literature by
   offering a new theoretical understanding of lone wolf behavior. Our
   proposed theoretical approach illustrates a fundamental understanding of
   the lone wolf terrorist through a complex hierarchical structure.},

Abstract = {In this essay, I evaluate Philip Pettit's theory of republican political
   legitimacy and maintain that it fails to provide a more satisfactory
   account of legitimacy than consent-based theories. I advance two
   interrelated theses. First, I argue that in so far as Pettit
   successfully narrows the scope that his theory of political legitimacy
   has to address, his arguments could be adapted to support consent-based
   theories. Second, I argue that Pettit's theory fails to satisfy the high
   standards it sets for itself and is thus unsuccessful. My critique
   focuses on Pettit's notions of historical, political and normative
   necessity, before evaluating whether his requirement of equally
   individualised popular control of government should be endorsed.},

Abstract = {Education has always been, and still, is an indispensable factor for
   human, economic and social development in such a way that strengthening
   and improving it becomes something indispensable and to do that, many
   countries are looking for indicators to evaluate their educational
   system. One of the tests used in Galicia, Spain is the grant of the
   Extraordinary Prizes of Secondary Education to the most brilliant
   students, being an indicator of quality and excellence. They are very
   demanding tests with five compulsory exams and an optional one to choose
   where only 20 awards are given which represent around 6-7\% of the
   students that attended the exams. In this article it is going to be
   analyzed if the test is equitable and if there is statistically
   significant influence of the optional subjects chosen at the time of
   obtaining the Extraordinary Prize of Secondary. In particular, it will
   be studied the case of two optional subjects which are Physics-Chemistry
   and Biology-Geology, that for the period 2008-2013 represent the 85\%
   whereas the other four represent the 15\%. This way, the main hypothesis
   presented is: ``The students that choose the optional subject
   Physics-Chemistry over Biology-Geology get worse final marks and have
   fewer probabilities to win the Extraordinary Prize of Secondary
   Education{''}.},

Abstract = {Leading theories of race and participation posit that minority voters
   are mobilized by co-ethnic candidates. However, past studies are unable
   to disentangle candidate effects from factors associated with the places
   from which candidates emerge. I reevaluate the links between candidate
   race, district composition, and turnout by leveraging a nationwide
   database of over 185 million individual registration records, including
   estimates for the race of every voter. Combining these records with
   detailed information about 3,000 recent congressional primary and
   general election candidates, I find that minority turnout is not higher
   in districts with minority candidates, after accounting for the relative
   size of the ethnic group within a district. Instead, Black and Latino
   citizens are more likely to vote in both primary and general elections
   as their share of the population increases, regardless of candidate
   race.},

   social disaffection with politics. After three years in office,
   President Pena Nieto faced adverse economic conditions and a significant
   decrease in approval rates after damaging events such as the Ayotzinapa
   tragedy, corruption scandals and low economic growth. However, due to an
   unprecedented vote fragmentation, the ruling coalition was able to
   retain its majority in the Chamber of Deputies.},

Abstract = {Secularization is an important phenomenon for understanding modern
   societies. Besides, if we observe the social reality of the beginning of
   XXI century, we confirm that religious not only doesn't disappear, but
   it emerges new and diverse ways of religiosity. This state obliges us to
   consider if `classic theory of secularization' is valid -and if it is
   valid in what terms-for analyzing these concepts nowadays. To achieve
   this aim, we resort to two sources: the work of Jose Casanova
   Genealogias de la secularizacion (2012) -in which he proposes a revision
   of three of the main sub-thesis associate to secularization- and the
   evenly data of Religion monitor (Pickel, 2013) of Bertelsmann
   Foundation. After making this analysis we consider that-in the current
   context-it's more suitable talk about `secularizations' and `religious
   manifestations' than `secularization'.},

Pages = {748-776},
Abstract = {During the twentieth century, theoretical and empirical studies aimed to
   analyse changes in individual participation and in social and political
   dynamics. A great emphasis was attributed to the process of
   individualization. Young people were described as a generation with a
   limited political involvement, especially considering traditional forms
   of political participation, but more and more likely to search an
   ``individualized{''} way towards the participation. Furlong and Cartmel
   bring back the youth identity to the thesis about the reflexive
   rebuilding of identity, according to which the individualization is a
   process due to some structural characteristics of post-industrial
   society. Employing data from European Values Study researches, we test
   if and how structural variables and contextual dynamics affect political
   involvement and its changes, with particular attention on youth
   involvement. Actually, participation takes the form of a multifaceted
   reality and youth individual profiles are heterogeneous. The process of
   individualization has, in this sense, different effects and various
   consequences on participation's profiles. According to these
   considerations, this analysis shows the incidence of structural,
   contextual and cognitive dimensions on individual choices to
   participate, focusing on longitudinal plan and cohorts. A second step
   compares the causal importance of structural and cognitive dimension on
   different typologies of involvement.},

Abstract = {This article explores the relationship between ethnic representation in
   security sector institutions and perceptions of safety. While most
   studies on post-conflict institutional reform focus on national
   institutions and outcomes, this article argues that a more nuanced view
   on ethnic representation is fruitful in order to account for the
   everyday perceptions of local people. Drawing on post-conflict Kosovo,
   the article analyzes how the representation of ethnic minorities in
   security institutions affects perceptions of safety among individuals
   across Kosovo's municipalities. It also analyzes original interview data
   collected in the Pristina and Mitrovica municipalities that are typical
   cases of our sample. Both approaches validate that those municipalities
   that have ethnically representative security institutions also have
   higher levels of perceived safety.},

Abstract = {Far from reopening classic debates on EU modes of governance, this
   special issue uses the governance notion as an organizing concept in
   order to examine the governing of the EU in times of crisis. More
   specifically, we argue that focusing on modes of governance contributes
   to the understanding of `where the power lies in the EU system'
   especially when an external shock - such as the crisis - hits the EU
   governance system. A systematic investigation is not possible given the
   limitation on space, but this introductory article highlights some of
   the aspects that we consider have been at the heart of the new political
   challenges to the EU. Our main hypothesis is that the 2008 crisis has
   offered a new opportunity for the intergovernmental mode of
   decision-making to prevail, left marginal space for further including
   citizens in decision-making processes and has provided a very narrow
   definition of effectiveness. This change of context calls for a
   re-examination of forms of governing in the EU, and more specifically
   the so-called `softening narrative', in order to go beyond a mere
   distinction between `hard' and `soft' law and focus more on the
   governing processes that are in place in various institutional and
   policy areas.},

Title = {International accompaniment, reflexivity and the intelligibility of

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},

Volume = {18},
Number = {2-3, SI},
Pages = {189-205},
Abstract = {`International accompaniers' use their physical presence as a form of
   peaceful intervention to deter political violence against local human
   rights defenders. Threatened members of Guatemala's civil society have
   relied on accompaniment as part of their security strategy since the
   early 1980s. Approximately one thousand volunteers from a dozen
   countries have accompanied in Guatemala. International accompaniment has
   been a key component of the effort to prosecute former military general
   and president Efrain Rios Montt and other perpetrators of mass human
   rights violations in Guatemala. Victim witnesses and their legal counsel
   have included accompaniment as part of their protection strategy since
   2000. Important questions have nonetheless been raised with respect to
   accompaniment's effectiveness as a tool for witness protection and the
   possibility that it reinforces power inequalities. This article builds
   on Gada Mahrouse's critique of accompaniment and draws on Michel
   Foucault's understanding of reflexivity and power. The authors use
   insights from two case studies to support the argument that
   accompaniment's usefulness as a tool for witness protection depends on
   its ability to accommodate the witnesses' position within webs of
   interconnected power dynamics and the multiple ways in which they
   conceive of security. It also depends on how intelligible these
   different power dynamics are to accompaniers. This argument is used to
   highlight how accompaniment in Guatemala is relevant for other
   situations where the prosecution of human rights atrocities is long term
   and depends on witness testimony.},

Abstract = {Framing metaphors for counterterrorism have been analyzed theoretically
   but their effect has not yet been fully understood empirically. One
   framing metaphor that has been employed for counterterrorism is a `War
   on Terror'. The present study examined the effect of using the phrase
   `War on Terror' on support for security policies that unfairly target
   Muslims. We manipulated the frame to make federal action or community
   action salient. Additionally, we tested the effect of the release of
   Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/ISIS/Daesh, hereafter ISIS)
   propaganda films by collecting data before and after the February 2015
   video featuring the execution of 21 Egyptian Copts by a Libyan ISIS
   group. We found that, after the video was released, a community-based
   framing of the `War on Terror' significantly increased support for
   anti-Muslim security policies. We also examined the demographics of
   those who had seen ISIS videos versus those who had not and the factors
   that predicted whether participants were distressed by the videos. Those
   who had seen the videos were more likely to be male and have personal
   ties to the military or law enforcement. Those who were distressed by
   the videos were more likely to be politically conservative, female,
   younger, and have personal ties to the military or law enforcement.},

Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2016},
Number = {51},
Pages = {188+},
Abstract = {This article focuses on the appropriation of the concept of
   `deliberative democracy' among Chinese intellectual and political elites
   since the turn of the 21st century. Based on Lydia Liu's approach of
   `translingual practice', it examines the process of translation,
   selective adoption and gradual assertion of the concept's interpretation
   by the socialist party regime. The analysis finds that a gradual shift
   of meaning has taken place from `deliberative' to `consultative
   democracy' that is interpreted in a more vertical fashion of soliciting
   popular views from above. At the same time, this semantic shift
   constitutes specific legitimacy claims of the party-state. Against this
   backdrop, the seeming paradox of an authoritarian party regime framing
   itself as `democratic' can be resolved by looking at the ongoing
   ideological contestations among Chinese elites about regime legitimacy.},

Abstract = {Contrary to standard narratives on the declining function of parties in
   fostering political participation, this article argues that far from
   abandoning the cause of participation, post-communist political parties
   diversified the understanding of the party as a mobilizing agency by
   adapting their internal organizations. On the basis of a mid-range
   number of cases (e.g. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland,
   Romania, and Slovakia) the study identified different patterns of
   evolution within a complex interaction effect between participation and
   organizational development. The peculiarity of the parties' organization
   and functions has shaped political participation both as an opportunity
   structure (legitimizing the political system and increasing citizens'
   involvement in politics) and as a democratic challenge (increasing the
   propensity of parties towards populism, `seasonal' membership,
   corruption and clientelism).},

Abstract = {The author analyzes the power distribution among political groups in the
   European Parliament from 1979 till 2014. Agent's voting power is treated
   as the capability to influence the result of collective decision-making
   process. Often the voting power is not equal to votes share the agent
   possess. We obtain the values of classical and modified power indices
   for European political groups and compare their performance. The Banzhaf
   power index is employed to measure European political groups' a priori
   power that does not impose any restrictions on coalition formation, and
   power indices that take into account groups' preferences in coalition
   formation in order to measure actual voting power. Classical power
   indices 60 are calculated using only votes' distribution in the
   committee and a quota to pass a decision. Pairwise preferences allow to
   have respect to different willingness of groups to form a single
   coalition. In this paper preferences are modeled using the roll-call
   data from the votings on important issues of European politics. The less
   popular is the MP's position, the smaller is the number of coalitions
   she can enter and the less is the voting power. We demonstrate that
   factions can exploit their position and acquire higher relative power
   than both share of seats and the Banzhaf index measures, and the Liberal
   group of the European Parliament forming coalitions with both partners
   from the left and the right is the case. Conversely, hard restrictions
   on formation of coalitions due to ideological differences can lead to
   less actual voting power than a priori.},

   Cost Theory},

Abstract = {According to a growing tradition in International Relations, one way
   governments can credibly signal their intentions in foreign policy
   crises is by creating domestic audience costs: leaders can tie their
   hands by publicly threatening to use force since domestic publics punish
   leaders who say one thing and do another. We argue here that there are
   actually two logics of audience costs: audiences can punish leaders both
   for being inconsistent (the traditional audience cost), and for
   threatening to use force in the first place (a belligerence cost). We
   employ an experiment that disentangles these two rationales, and turn to
   a series of dispositional characteristics from political psychology to
   bring the audience into audience cost theory. Our results suggest that
   traditional audience cost experiments may overestimate how much people
   care about inconsistency, and that the logic of audience costs (and the
   implications for crisis bargaining) varies considerably with the
   leader's constituency.},

Abstract = {The article examines the relationship between corruption and voting
   behavior by defining two distinct channels: pocketbook corruption
   voting, i.e. how personal experiences with corruption affect voting
   behavior; and sociotropic corruption voting, i.e. how perceptions of
   corruption in society do so. Individual and aggregate data from Slovakia
   fail to support hypotheses that corruption is an undifferentiated
   valence issue, that it depends on the presence of a viable
   anti-corruption party, or that voters tolerate (or even prefer)
   corruption, and support the hypothesis that the importance of each
   channel depends on the salience of each source of corruption and that
   pocketbook corruption voting prevails unless a credible anti-corruption
   party shifts media coverage of corruption and activates sociotropic
   corruption voting. Previous studies may have underestimated the
   prevalence of corruption voting by not accounting for both channels.},

Abstract = {Political philosophers commonly tackle the issue of climate change by
   focusing on fundamental interests as a basis for human rights. This
   approach struggles, however, in cases where one set of fundamental
   interests requires one course of action, and another set of fundamental
   interests requires a contradictory course of action. This article
   advances an alternative response to climate change based on an account
   of global justice that gives weight to utilitarian, prioritarian, and
   luck egalitarian considerations. A practical application of this
   pluralistic account is provided, which shows that it handles trade-offs
   between individuals' interests in an appealing way and that it supports
   an aggressive policy of climate change mitigation. This account provides
   a more plausible justification for rights against the harms of climate
   change.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2016},
Number = {3},
Pages = {108-122},
Abstract = {There are grounds to assume that in 2011-2012 the World System
   experienced to some extent a phase transition to a qualitatively new
   state of global protest activity. This phase transition is shown to bear
   some resemblance to the one which the World System experienced in the
   early 1960s. The first (after 1919) phase transition of this sort
   occurred in the early 1960s and was related to the growth of global
   informational connectivity after the World War II, as well as the
   improvement of the means of protest self-organization due to the spread
   of television, portable radio receivers, portable electric loud-speakers
   and other technologies of the Fourth Kondratieff Cycle. The phase
   transition of the early 2010s was prepared by a new wave of growth of
   global informational connectivity, as well as the improvement of the
   means of protest self-organization due to the spread of various
   technologies of the Fifth Kondratieff cycle (the Internet, satellite
   television, Twitter and other social networks, mobile telephony etc.).
   Similarly to what was observed during the Fourth Kondratieff Wave,
   during the Fifth Cycle while the spread of these technologies was going
   on for many years before 2011, their internal colossal potential for
   generating and spreading protest activity was realized in one leap.},

Abstract = {In the article the history and features of the Russian political science
   community's formation are analyzed. Apart from the milestones, the
   authors consider the main versions of the community's emergence, as well
   as the phenomenon of community itself. In the course of the research the
   authors used various methods and sources: content analysis of
   information resources and documents of the professional organizations of
   political scientists of the Russian Federation, surveys and interviews
   of experts-political scientists and public servants. All this allowed
   not only to characterize the political science community by its features
   description, but also to reveal the existing development problems,
   considering regional political science schools' development and
   functioning dynamics, as well as the role of political science community
   as an expert community in the state policy-making. The wide range of
   experts having taken part in surveys helped to describe the situation
   from various sides and to show a picture both from political scientists'
   position and from high-ranked decision-makers' viewpoint. In the
   conclusion of the article authors form conceptual conclusions which can
   be used by the professional organizations of the Russian community of
   political scientists to increase efficiency of their activity, develop
   regional political schools in the Russian Federation, and also produce
   constructive dialogue between the authorities and expert communities to
   improve quality of the decisions made and provide academia's involvement
   in the research field. Authors emphasize that the present article is not
   exhaustive, and express their hope that other researchers will join the
   discussion on the role of political scientists' professional community,
   which will considerably increase the quality of the research.},

Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {339-357},
Abstract = {What is neo-liberalism? I'm going to affirm here that, as well as being
   a political doctrine born in the 1970s, neo-liberalism is the
   construction, the extension and the final reinforcement of a number of
   classical elements. My argument is that many of the typical aspects of
   contemporary neo-liberalism were already present in theories expressed
   by thinkers such as L. von Mises and F. A. von Hayek. As proof of this
   fact, I reclaim some characteristics of the present neo-liberal
   phenomenon as having been conceived by the above authors. These
   characteristics actually imply the ongoing spread of a dominant ideology
   that tends to pit the concept of liberty against those of rationality
   and critical consciousness. First, the article will analyse the changes
   that have occurred within the phenomenon of consumerism, which becomes
   entwined with the competitive and entrepreneurial spirit of the
   individual; second, it will reflect on the widespread aversion to
   socialist policies, and in fact to all policies that provide for public
   intervention by the State and that change the relationship between State
   and economy; finally, it will relate these investigations to the
   ideological and structural model that supports the European Union.},

Title = {Toward Epistemic Justice: A Critically Reflexive Examination of `Sanism'
   and Implications for Knowledge Generation},
Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-78},
Abstract = {The dominance of medicalized ``psy{''} discourses in the West has
   marginalized alternative perspectives and analyses of madness, resulting
   in the under-inclusion (or exclusion) from mainstream discourse of the
   firsthand experiences and perspectives of those who identify as Mad. We
   argue that this marginalization of firsthand knowledge(s) demands closer
   critical scrutiny, particularly through the use of critical reflexivity.
   This paper draws on Fricker's concept of epistemic injustice, whereby a
   person is wronged in his or her capacity as a knower, as a useful
   framework for interrogating the subjugation of Mad knowledge(s). Also
   examined is the problem of sanism, a deeply embedded system of
   discrimination and oppression, as an underlying component of epistemic
   injustice. Sanism assumes a pathological view of madness, which can be
   attributed to what Rimke has termed psychocentrism: the notion that
   pathologies are rooted in the mind and/or body of the individual, rather
   than the product of social structures, relations, and problems. The
   paper examines how sanism marginalizes the knowledge(s) of Mad persons
   and contributes to epistemic injustice, and considers possibilities for
   advancing social justice using Mad epistemological perspectives.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to study the influence of education
   achievement (cultural capital) in the processes of
   precariousness-affluent of Spanish population from the years after the
   crisis of 1990 to the beginning of the hardest years of the current
   crisis. From the ECHP (European Community Household Panel) data and the
   SILC (Living Conditions Survey) of Instituto Nacional de Estadistica
   (INE) four indicators are built to measure the evolution of job labour,
   income, health and housing and their distribution according to different
   demographic variables. Studying different living conditions in times of
   growth and economic crisis it is intended to test the hypothesis that
   more education means more protection. By the use of multivariate
   analysis we attempt to determine the level of impact of cultural
   capital, its scope, its evolutionary dynamics and, above all, whether
   positive or negative effects are being expanded or deceleration. The
   result is a double contribution: on the methodological side consisting
   of the construction of the indicators; on the other hand, the results,
   with whom it is possible to question some generalizations about the role
   of education in contemporary societies.},

Abstract = {Following the post-election violence (PEV) of 2007-8, which almost
   jettisoned the country into civil war, Kenya put in place a number of
   transitional justice mechanisms, such as truth telling, as a
   peacebuilding strategy. One of the major recommendations of Kenya's
   Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC) is the creation of
   institutions and mechanisms for peacebuilding, reconciliation, and early
   warning with a view towards harmonising their activities and adopting a
   coordinated approach. This article explicates the centrality of
   democratic institutional reforms in the process of reconciliation,
   peacebuilding, and long-term stability. In tackling the notion of
   national reconciliation as a central pillar in post-conflict recovery
   and peacebuilding, this paper proposes that reconciliation happens
   within strong and properly functioning institutions of governance that
   are supportive of transitional justice mechanisms. Based on the
   transitional justice process in Kenya and building upon a view of
   reconciliation as a process, rather than an end, this paper argues that
   strengthening institutions that function within governance structures
   will go a long way towards placing Kenya on the path to reconciliation,
   national cohesion, and long term stability.},

Title = {The Prefect Face to Face with Autonomist Teachers in French Guiana from
   1946 to the Turn of the 1960s. An Unprecedented Administrative Encounter
   in a Post-Colonial Context},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {29},
Number = {116},
Pages = {53+},
Abstract = {As a result of the departmentalization of the French old colonies in
   1946, the prefect became the head of the State services of these
   territories. In French Guiana, although the population initially
   welcomed this unprecedented administrative encounter, the latter was in
   a very short time disrupted. From the mid-1950s onwards, political life
   was articulated between a local Creole and autonomist left-wing party
   and a departmental right-wing party affiliated to the Mainland and taxed
   to be under the prefect's control. Teachers engaged in movements of this
   local left-wing party were the main actors in this unprecedented
   bipolarization of political life which resulted in violent conflicts.
   After assessing the phenomenon on the basis of reports from the prefect,
   the Government promulgated a Law order on October 15, 1960 following the
   recommendation of the same prefect. This Law order established the
   automatic recall to the Mainland of civil servants perceived as virulent
   propagandists of subversive ideas. Most of them were autonomist
   teachers. This article shows how, in less than twenty years, the
   opposition between the prefect and the autonomist teachers shed light on
   a new political space in France. This new political space was
   characterized by an intense political change during which French
   Guianese Creole teachers became a leading elite of their department,
   both opposed and allied to the prefect of the overseas department who
   had excessive powers in virtue of the perceived threat of separatism.},

Title = {Economic Behavior and the Partisan Perceptual Screen},
Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {363-383},
Abstract = {Partisans report different perceptions from the same set of facts.
   According to the ``perceptual screen{''} hypothesis, this difference
   arises because partisans perceive different realities. An alternative
   hypothesis is that partisans take even fact-based questions as an
   opportunity to voice support for their team. In 2009, Gerber and Huber
   conducted the first behavioral test of the perceptual screen hypothesis
   outside of the lab. I re-analyze Gerber and Huber's original data and
   collect new data from two additional U.S. elections. Gerber and Huber's
   finding of a relationship between partisanship and economic behavior
   does not hold when observations from a single state-year (Texas in 1996)
   are excluded from their analysis. Out-of-sample replication based on the
   two U.S. presidential elections since the original study similarly shows
   no evidence of an effect. Given these results, the balance of evidence
   tips toward the conclusion that economic perceptions are not filtered
   through partisanship.},

   RELIGIOUS REFERENCES},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2016},
Number = {1},
Pages = {157-174},
Abstract = {Extension of the theory of politics to include sociocultural meanings in
   its explanatory scheme reflects the current uncertainty of its
   theoretical and methodological foundations, politico-institutional
   references, political and ideological implications. Fluctuation of the
   contours of the ``familiar world{''} corresponds to rising distrust in
   the existing institutions and actors, suggesting a crisis of their
   legitimacy and effectiveness. A qualitatively new nature of conflict in
   society, archaization of political ideologies and practices,
   transformation of the structures of social and power configurations
   indicate a change in the reference values of load-bearing structures of
   political life, reflexive schemes and ideological intentions.
   Redefinition of the standard linear epistemes and ideological discourses
   of modernity is accompanied by incorporation of socio-cultural referents
   and new references of modernity into the theoretical constructs.
   Religion ceases to be just a private affair of a particular person, and
   returns to the public space in various forms, reflecting the
   diversification and diversity of the semantic and practical presence in
   the theoretical schemes and political practices. Many political issues
   acquire social resonance only because they are given a religious
   meaning, whereas religious intentions are in demand primarily in the
   political space. The religious reference is perceived differently in the
   modern world, causing controversy and debate about the prospects for
   human development, actualizing new methodological and ideological
   constructions.},

Title = {Has Eurosceptic Mobilization Become More Contagious? Comparing the 2009

Abstract = {With the lingering Euro crisis, personalized competition for the
   Commission presidency, and a surge of Eurosceptic parties, the 2014
   European Parliament elections took place against an unknown level of
   European Union politicization. How does this changing context affect the
   supply side of party competition on European issues in EP election
   campaigns? This article compares the 2014 and 2009 EP elections in two
   EU founding members with high electoral support for radical left and
   radical right Euroscepticism-France and the Netherlands. We study
   publically visible patterns of partisan mobilization in the written news
   media with semi-automated content analyses. The data indicate that
   visible party mobilization on EU issues was on average not significantly
   higher in 2014. While particularly mainstream and especially incumbent
   parties publically mobilize on European issues during both campaigns,
   the radical right's mobilization efforts have become more visible during
   the 2014 elections. Examining the temporal dynamics within electoral
   campaigns, we show that the Eurosceptic fringes exhibit significant
   contagion effects on the mainstream parties, but that the extent of this
   contagion was surprisingly lower in the 2014 campaign. As a result, the
   increasing EU politicization between the 2009 and 2014 electoral
   contests has not resulted in an enhanced and more interactive supply of
   partisan debate about Europe.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses two main theses in Ronald Dworkin's legal theory:
   (i) law is institutionalized political morality and (ii) there is
   pervasive theoretical disagreement about how to fix truth conditions for
   the propositions of law. The author argues that the first thesis is
   compatible with the distinction between the law as it is and the law as
   it should be. Regarding the second thesis, the author attempts to show
   that the need for a fulcrum of disagreement requires accepting that law
   contains certain institutional parts whose role makes them unsuitable
   subjects for a moral reading.},

Title = {NEW SYSTEM OF RELATIONS BETWEEN GREAT POWERS FOR THE 21st CENTURY:
   ``CONCERT{''} OR CONFRONTATION?},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2016},
Number = {1},
Pages = {44-59},
Abstract = {The year 2015 marks the 200th Anniversary of the Vienna Congress of 1815
   that initiated so called ``Concert of Europe{''} - relatively stable
   century-long system of interstate negotiations between that time ``great
   powers{''} and empires. The article introduces the international
   research projects of 20 researchers from 9 countries who elaborated and
   proposed principles and mechanisms for a new ``concert of powers{''} for
   the 21st century. Basing upon statistical and qualitative parameters the
   author figured out three models (for 10, 13 and 17 countries) for the
   required modern system of negotiation on global issues. Such a system
   should rather compliment to than compete with the existing international
   institutions like UN or G7. But it may provide better legitimacy (by
   involving new actors - rising powers and collective actors like EU) and
   higher efficiency in reaching compromises (by avoiding excessive
   formalization that breaks the UN SC). Difficulties and weaknesses on the
   way towards a new ``concert of powers{''} are inspected too. Project is
   focused not only on redesigning the geopolitics of the global
   political/security dialogue, but as well on ways for reforming the
   existing interfaces between powers and international organizations like
   United Nations, OSCE, and non-Western integrative formats like SCO,
   CSTO, BRICS.},

   conservative party, the choice of moderates and liberals has ultimately
   emerged as the nominee in the last two nomination cycles.},

Abstract = {The following article discusses methodological challenges in surveying
   support for democracy in countries beyond the West. Considering the
   traveling premise of this book, a universal understanding of democracy
   cannot be assumed. As traditional methods mostly ignore the variety of
   how people view democracy worldwide, they produce data with limited
   meaning, especially for countries beyond the West. The article reviews
   the empirical and methodological literature on the understanding of
   democracy and discusses methodologically innovative and differentiated
   survey methods. As a continuation of this relatively `young' debate, the
   article presents the Repertory Grid-Method as an approach to-survey
   abstract concepts and terms like democracy and illustrates this method
   with an interview example.},

   discuss Honduras main socioeconomic indicators and the social turmoil
   that was prevalent during the past year. Next, we provide an analysis of
   the 2013 electoral process and its effect on the transformation of the
   electoral system. At this point we make an assessment of the dimensions
   of change and continuity in the partisan landscape over the near future.
   In the third section we carry out an analysis of the Honduran executive
   branch, emphasizing the main. policies enacted by the new government
   headed by the National Party. Next we discuss the legislative dynamic
   during this period and the relationship between Congress and the
   President. We conclude by describing the general state of democracy in
   this country and the more pressing challenges that it faces.},

Abstract = {The US and India have strengthened their borders against illegal
   immigration. However, the two states have striking differences with
   respect to their border control methods. The US strengthened its Mexican
   border through fences and militarization. In sharp contrast, even though
   India fenced some parts of its border, it has relied on shooting
   practices which have resulted in the deaths of thousands of Bangladeshi
   immigrants. Drawing upon Narrative Policy Analysis (NPA), this paper
   identifies patterns in justification strategies regarding border control
   against illegal immigration in the US and in India. The findings
   indicate that in the US, border control was justified by the restoration
   of law at the border. To the contrary, in India, border control was
   associated with arbitrariness. The majority of Indian policymakers
   encourage arbitrary border practices by adopting the view that `any
   method' is legitimate to curb illegal immigration from Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {This article puts forward a synthesis of work from Security Studies and
   Cultural Studies in order to trace the link between popular culture and
   security. This analysis contributes to the growing research in Critical
   Security Studies on the role of popular culture in the representation
   and reproduction of terrorism, security, and identity. It brings in
   approaches from Television Studies to Critical Terrorism Studies to
   theorise the process of meaning creation for audiences of terrorism
   shows on television. This synthesis enables an original contribution to
   the conceptualisation, theorisation, and methodology of the study of
   terrorism discourse, which allows me to draw together and operationalise
   the growing concerns with identity, emotions, and the everyday in
   Security Studies. It brings in examples from an analysis that applied
   this approach to an analysis of the television series Homeland, which
   considers both the meaning within Homeland and the process of meaning
   making by members of the show's British audience. Using data gathered in
   focus groups, it shows how viewers read, reproduce, and resist the
   dominant narratives within the text demonstrating the utility of
   audience studies.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the impact of government alternation on
   ideological congruence, going beyond the traditional distinction between
   the majoritarian and proportional visions of democracy that
   characterises the literature. I postulate that the effects of
   alternation on congruence differ according to the concept of alternation
   adopted and the time frame considered. While the possibility of
   alternation has no significant effect on congruence, the actual levels
   of alternation do play an ambivalent role. Higher levels of alternation
   increase the distance between the median voter's and the government's
   preferences at the time of the election. However, in the long run, the
   level of alternation accumulated over time reduces the average level of
   ideological distance, compensating for gaps in one direction with
   opposing gaps in the other direction. Empirical analysis conducted on a
   sample of 32 democracies confirms all of the hypotheses advanced.},

Abstract = {In the last decades modernization theory, once dominant in the mid-20th
   century, has faced strong criticism, if not outright rejection.
   Especially postcolonial studies criticized its ethnocentrism and the
   ignorance of indigenous possibilities of development. This critique was
   also applied to western-dominated democracy research, even if it was not
   rejected as fully as modernization theory. Keeping this in mind, it is
   surprising that differences in the degree of modernization seem to have
   significant power in the empirical explanation of democratization.
   Results show a strong effect of modernization on political culture. One
   reason is the example set by Western countries, another reason are other
   aspects of modernization. Thus, worldwide cross-national analyses reveal
   high support for basic democratic principles nearly everywhere. Even if
   the understanding of democracy can differ between cultures and regions,
   it does not support the thesis of the complete irrelevance of a
   democratic theory relying on modernization theory; not even if conflicts
   between political cultures and identity groups have diversified the
   paths of political-cultural developments.},

Abstract = {In this paper we relate two fields of study in social sciences: social
   mobility and labour market. We complement the analysis of class
   origin/destination relationship with the analysis of the conditions of
   participation in the labour market. Thus, we question the view of the
   functionalist approach of social mobility, which assimilates mobility
   with equality and reproduction with inequality. For the Argentine case,
   in the years 2007-2008, it has been observed that a significant portion
   of the population has been improving their labor market position,
   although, in terms of class, they reproduces their origin position.},

Title = {On a Successful Road to `More Federalism' in Lander Politics? The Case
   of Smoking Bans after Germany's Federalism Reform},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {210-226},
Abstract = {The Federalism Reform I of 2006 was aimed at reversing interlocked
   policy making and thereby transferred 16 legislative competences to the
   Lander to provide them with more autonomy. Yet, the impact of the reform
   depends primarily on the way the Lander actually make use of these new
   competences. This contribution examines ensuing Lander legislation using
   the case of the protection of non-smokers. With regard to the question
   of `uniformity vs diversity', the analysis of laws shows that alongside
   great uniformity in principle there are considerable differences
   concerning the arrangements in detail. The analysis of the legislation
   processes shows that only part of the uniformity is caused by the
   intention of harmonisation. Instead, it was the convergent development
   of public opinion in the Lander that led the legislation in the same
   direction. To some extent therefore, while autonomous Land legislation
   took place concerning the processes, it resulted in uniformity.},

Abstract = {This essay explores wage relations, social work, and the interplay of an
   array of class and nonclass processes in the context of NGOs in
   Bodhgaya, India, site of Buddha's enlightenment. It argues that
   discourses of ``social work,{''} `collaboration,{''} and ``socially
   engaged Buddhism{''} have enabled foreign NGO directors, many of whom
   moved to India for humanitarian purposes, to rationalize wages below
   poverty level, to fetishize NGO projects as distinct from the work
   relations that have produced them, and to capitalize on exchangerate
   inequalities in the name of producing as much ``social work{''} as
   possible in a poverty-stricken area of the Indian state of Bihar. Though
   Bihari NGO workers have resisted this framing and have pursued NGO work
   as a source of employment and as an avenue for upward mobility, a
   scarcity of waged work opportunities has made it difficult for
   resistance to take forms other than absenteeism and jockeying for
   better-paying jobs.},

   coalition with three other parties. Robert Fico, the old and new prime
   minister, may have moderated his xenophobic rhetoric since the election
   campaign, and the ruling coalition may have committed itself to the
   European Union. But Bratislava has not wavered in its decision to take
   legal action against the European quota system for the distribution of

   the popularity, in addition to his decision to abstain from seeking
   reelection in 2017, have created a difficult scenario for correismo. The

Abstract = {Is the success of the Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) a protest
   phenomenon or the mobilization of a political potential? We test both
   hypotheses on the grounds of the German National Election Study 2013.
   The analysis reveals that disenchantment with party politics is indeed
   relatively high among the AfD voters. However, they also hold homogenous
   positions on the most relevant issues. Moreover, these positions have a
   significant impact on the vote choice for the AfD, even when we control
   for voters' disenchantment with party politics. This supports the idea
   of the party's success being rooted in the mobilization of a neglected
   political potential rather than just being a protest phenomenon.},

Title = {CLASSIFYING ETHNIC CONFLICTS: CHALLENGES FOR POLITICAL THEORY AND
   METHODOLOGY},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2016},
Number = {6},
Pages = {69-94},
Abstract = {The authors assess the theoretical and methodological problems arising
   in the definition and in the study of ethnic conflicts in the
   contemporary transforming world order, and give their definition of
   ethnic (ethnopolitical) conflict with a focus on the political
   mobilization of ethnic identity. Building on a qualitative analysis of
   27 cases of ethnic contention in different countries and regions of the
   world chosen by expert evaluation, they elaborate an analytical model
   for studying ethnic conflict using a factor-based approach. The key
   factors that drive ethnic contention are detected, considered and
   compared: these include collective memory and claims for language and
   cultural autonomy, religious and confessional differences, economic and
   social disparities, clan and tribal interests overruling the common
   interest, as well as external influence and the political accommodation
   of ethnic interests. The comparative study brings to light, as the
   article arguments, three types of ethnic conflict: territorial,
   institutional and policy-oriented. Three cases are presented to
   illustrate these findings, with special attention to contention in the
   post-Soviet political space. The study brings forward arguments to
   support middle range theory: it can be adapted to evaluate ethnic
   conflict as a driver of political change in the contemporary world,
   whereas ``grand theory{''} has in this case considerable limitations
   which are due both to the complex nature of these conflicts and of the
   transformations of the world order, and to the highly contested
   contemporary theoretical discourse on conflict and ethnicity. This does
   not, however, overrule prospects for further steps towards elaborating a
   broad theoretical framework for conflict assessment and regulation. The
   authors see the transformation of identity conflicts into conflicts of
   interests and the formation of appropriate institutions for their
   reconciliation as an effective instrument for incorporating ethnic
   identities into the identity politics agenda on the national level.
   Depoliticizing ethnicity is a marker of effective conflict regulation
   and prevention. This can be achieved by promoting public policies in the
   social sphere, with special attention to education, and by a positive
   convergence of civic and ethnic identities over a national ``accord on
   development{''}. To achieve a positive outcome, it has to be sustained
   by thriving community activities in various spheres where different
   identities meet.},

Title = {IDEOLOGICAL AND STRATEGIC EUROSCEPTICISM IN EU POLITICS},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {13-24},
Abstract = {After the 2014 European Parliament elections the voices of Eurosceptic
   forces have become increasingly louder, with their activity beginning to
   have direct influence on the EU politics, which can be proved by the
   results of the 23rd June UK's EU referendum. Consequently, the
   interpretation of the term ``Euroscepticism{''} and its typology is of a
   particular interest in the academic world. This article compares such
   varieties of Euroscepticism as ``ideological{''} and ``strategic{''}.
   Basing on the definitions, given by N. Sitter, P. Kopecky and C. Mudde,
   the author analyses the policies of the United Kingdom Independence
   Party and the Italian ``Five Star Movement{''}. While both parties,
   calling for the withdrawal from the EU and the Eurozone respectively,
   and being members of the same European Parliament political group
   (Europe for Freedom and Direct Democracy) are considered anti-EU forces,
   Euroscepticism is not playing the same role in their policies. This can
   be explained by different historic attitude of the British and the
   Italians towards the European integration as well as different problems
   which the countries have to face being the EU members. Through examining
   the process of the parties' institutionalization, their structure, and
   analyzing their initial aims, election programs, party leaders' speeches
   and voting tactics in the European Parliament the author consistently
   proves that while in case of UKIP Euroscepticism is ideological and
   completely defines the party policy, in case of M5S it is purely
   strategic and aimed at attracting the electorate.},

Title = {Yes, structurally low turnout favors the right},
Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Pages = {444-461},
Abstract = {It is well known that socioeconomically disadvantaged citizens tend to
   vote less than other citizens. Does this cause democratic politics to
   systematically favor conservative causes? Surprisingly, the conventional
   wisdom in a very large scholarly literature says no. Whether turnout is
   high or low, according to numerous studies, makes no substantive
   difference on political outcomes. This article refutes the scholarly
   conventional wisdom on theoretical and empirical grounds. It points out
   that the evidence marshaled in the mainstream turnout debate focuses
   almost exclusively on partisan vote shares as the dependent variable and
   nonstructural variation in turnout. Unfortunately, many studies do not
   consider the policy consequences of turnout, a more substantively
   interesting variable for studying patterns of disadvantage that may
   result from unequal voting rates. Moreover, conventional research
   designs do not distinguish between structural changes in turnout caused
   by legal changes to the voting regime and nonstructural changes
   precipitated by partisan mobilization, candidate valence, or other
   election-specific factors. This distinction has substantial implications
   for understanding turnout's impact. The article employs nonparametric
   meta-analytic methods to synthesize a large number of empirical studies
   and demonstrates that low structural turnout does indeed favor the right
   in theoretically predictable ways.},

Abstract = {The modern view of economic conspiracies stands in stark contrast to the
   view in the eighteenth century. Such classical economists as Adam Smith
   took conspiracy to be the natural result of our tendency to associate
   with one another. It manifested itself in collusion among both laborers
   and manufacturers to raise their income. By the mid-twentieth century,
   however, economists had come around to an entirely different view,
   according to which voluntary collaboration, especially in large groups,
   was unnatural and irrational, such that the only way to sustain cartels
   and trade unions was via compulsory, tyrannical measures. The notion of
   rationality that underlies such a view-as seen in the parallel notion
   that it is irrational to vote-threatens the understanding of agency that
   is essential to democracy.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyse the essay ``Lo que le falta a
   Colombia{''} written by William Ospina. In this essay, Ospina delves
   into the main social and political problems that Colombia was going
   through at the end of s. XX. In addition, he presents a number of
   solutions that could be taken. The approaches used by the Colombian
   writer can relate to a wide variety of concepts from the field of
   politics and sociology. Throughout this work, we are going to show the
   similarities between the analysis of William Ospina and the ideas of
   thinkers as distant in time as Thomas Hobbes, Rousseau, John Rawls or
   Charles Tilly.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the recent reform of the Organic Law of the
   Constitutional Court (LOTC) to strengthen the enforcement powers of the
   resolutions by the Constitutional Court. The author examines the origin
   of the reform, its content, the enforcement procedure and the doctrine
   of the Constitutional Court on the matter. Likewise, the Resolution of
   the Constitutional Court 141/2016 in which the Court has had the first
   opportunity to apply Article 92 LOTC after its reform. The author's
   thesis is that the reform has clarified and improved LOTC enforcement
   proceedings TC resolutions, providing the TC specific powers to ensure
   compliance its resolutions by public authorities and individuals.
   However, the author draws attention to the questions of
   constitutionality which raise some of the implementing measures provided
   for in Article 92 LOTC as the temporary suspension of public office in
   constitutional or regional public Institutions.},

Abstract = {The Eurasian Economic Union, founded in 2015, is the most important
   integration project in post-Soviet space. After more than two decades of
   disintegration and failed reintegration, Russia, Belarus, Armenia,
   Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan now have for the first time a common market
   for goods and services. However, some goods are exempt and non-tariff
   barriers are numerous. For now, coordination of monetary and fiscal
   policies remains only a goal. Just as important as internal integration
   is the expansion of cooperation with China and the European Union as the
   new common market's most important partners. The creation of a
   ``Fortress Eurasia{''} would be suicide.},

Abstract = {Economic statistics inform citizens of general conditions, while central
   leaders use them to evaluate local officials. Are economic data
   systematically manipulated? After establishing discrepancies in economic
   data series cross-nationally, this article examines Chinese sub-national
   growth data. It leverages variation in the likelihood of manipulation
   over two dimensions, arguing that politically sensitive data are more
   likely to be manipulated at politically sensitive times. Gross domestic
   product (GDP) releases generate headlines, while highly correlated
   electricity production and consumption data are relatively unnoticed. In
   Chinese provinces, the difference between GDP and electricity growth
   increases in years with leadership turnover, which is consistent with
   juking the stats for political reasons. The analysis points to the
   political role of information and the limits of non-electoral
   accountability mechanisms in authoritarian regimes.},

Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2016},
Number = {51},
Pages = {98+},
Abstract = {Globalization generates new structures of human interdependence and
   vulnerability while also posing challenges for models of democracy
   rooted in territorially bounded states. The diverse phenomena of
   globalization have stimulated two relatively new branches of political
   theory: theoretical accounts of the possibilities of democracy beyond
   the state; and comparative political theory, which aims at bringing
   non-Western political thought into conversation with the Western
   traditions that remain dominant in the political theory academy. This
   article links these two theoretical responses to globalization by
   showing how comparative political theory can contribute to the emergence
   of new global ``publics{''} around the common fates that globalization
   forges across borders. Building on the pragmatist foundations of
   deliberative democratic theory, it makes a democratic case for
   comparative political theory as an architecture of translation that
   helps deliberative publics grow across boundaries of culture.},

Abstract = {Besides the Islamic State in the Middle East and the immigration crisis,
   the Ukrainian crisis still deepens internal cleavage between Russophone
   and Ukrainophone regions. At the same time, it continues to affect
   negatively international relations and security situation in Europe.
   Moreover, 20 February 2015 marked Ukraine's first anniversary of
   Euromaidan protests. What are the actual results of the Revolution of
   Dignity?(1) Has Kiev really started a process of closer political and
   economic cooperation with the European Union; or, on the contrary, are
   we witnessing of potential long-term instability in Ukraine? Due to many
   tumultuous events is certainly worth analysing the one-year-period after
   Euromaidan. The article discusses some problems related to fundamental
   changes in Ukraine that have implications for further political
   development and its economic recovery. Based on the Fragile States Index
   and general indicators of ``fragile{''} or ``unstable{''} state, the
   author came surprisingly to the conclusion that Ukraine has fullfiled
   many of them. The aim of this study is particularly to demonstrate the
   ambivalent development of Ukraine in the respective period.},

Abstract = {This is a study of urban Organized Crime in Mexico City. The article
   proposes a conceptual framework to understand the development of what is
   called urban criminal It also explains why these firms develop, what is
   their structure, their spaces and the limitations to expand into other
   areas of the metropolis and maintain market power. This paper proposes a
   new model to explain the way Organized Crime organizations work in Latin
   American cities. Their actions have a high impact in the cost of
   violence, the quality of life of their habitants and in the urban
   governance. The oc literature partially explains the articulation
   between the international market of products and illegal services and
   the local commerce. However, it doesn't explain how the urban local
   organizations emerge and operate and which are their specificities. To
   solve this problem, I propose the concept urban criminal firm.},

Abstract = {The empirical evidence indicates that ethnic autonomy arrangements
   (EAAs) survive more often than not, but this mixed track record raises
   an important question. What accounts for the survival of some systems
   and not others? We theorize that that this differential survival rate is
   partly a function of variation in their internal structure. EAAs that
   are structured to create and best sustain an equilibrium in bargaining
   relations between center d periphery have the highest probability of
   survival. It follows logically that the more unbalanced the system in
   favor of either the center or periphery, the less likely to survive. We
   test the theory using logit analysis on an original data set drawn from
   the universe of post-1945 EAAs. After controlling for level of democracy
   and wealth disparity, the key finding is that the internal structure of
   an EAA matters for its survival. One important implication of these
   findings is that, for any given level of democracy, ethnofederal systems
   can be systematically designed to maximize survival prospects},

Abstract = {This paper explores the networks that intergovernmental organizations
   (IGOs) create in the international system and explore how states relate
   to each other in such networks. It focuses in particular on the network
   of IGOs that act as creators of and agents for hard international law.
   We introduce new data that allows us to investigate which institutional
   traits and functions are most closely related to IGOs' contribution to
   the implementation and enforcement of informal international law. We map
   out and explore the network of ``highly legalized{''} IGOs for the years
   1980-2005 as well as the affiliation networks emerging from states'
   membership in such IGOs. Combining international relations theory with
   network theory, we raise novel hypotheses on the potential impact of
   highly legalized IGO networks on states' conflict behavior and peace.},

Abstract = {This article argues that external factors of EU coverage in the media
   need to be reassessed against domestic factors, in particular how
   parties modulate media attention to EU affairs. We explain which parties
   may set the EU on the media agenda, and how parties interact with events
   depending on the level of conflict over EU issues. Drawing on the first
   long-term analysis of partisan agenda-setting of EU affairs in the media
   - based on ARIMA time-series models of monthly data collected for six
   newspapers from 1990 to 2015 - we determine the scale of partisan
   agenda-setting and find partial support for our model. Political parties
   do not face the intrusion of EU issues, but some of them are actively
   involved in this process.},

Abstract = {Consistent survey evidence supports the notion that Latinos are more
   ideologically conservative than their party identification would
   predict, making them ripe for party switching. However, when controlling
   for citizenship, generational differences, and policy attitudes, the
   partisan picture looks much different and much less optimistic for
   Republicans hoping to keep Latino voters in-play. Much of this puzzle is
   caused by a lingering confusion about Latino respondents versus Latino
   voters. Socially conservative Latino respondents are much more likely to
   be non-citizens and non-voters, providing them with little plausible
   electoral role. Previous research has underestimated this problem
   because scholars have been more interested in the acquisition of Latino
   partisanship, regardless of whether the respondents are viable voters or
   not. Using the 2006 Latino National Survey I demonstrate that ignoring
   citizenship and voting likelihood produces the misleading (but
   venerable) truism that conservative Latinos are available Republican
   voters.},

Abstract = {As the two major non-Arab powers of the Middle East, Turkey and Iran
   have, for a long time, walked the fine line between cooperation and
   rivalry while competing for regional primacy. In this article, the
   author argues that recent developments have added new layers of
   complexity to bilateral relations and that the current nature of the
   Turkey-Iran relationship can be primarily characterized as interactions,
   contradictions, and their unintended consequences that revolve around
   three major concentric circles: the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), the
   Syrian civil war, and economic-based cooperation. According to the
   author, the economic convergence of interests between Turkey and Iran,
   particularly in a post-sanctions environment, counterbalances sharp
   geopolitical differences, thereby preventing the escalation of friction
   between the two regional powers.},

Abstract = {The concept of alienation is a condition for consideration that has many
   interpretations and in jurisprudence, especially Shiite jurisprudence.
   Civil law has no reference to alienation of property a condition for
   consideration or or dealers. By commenting on legal provisions, some few
   jurists have noted ``non-belonging to a third party{''} as a general
   condition for the accuracy of transactions. The impact of alienation in
   the correctness of contracts and other financial possessions belongs to
   certain object or an indirect possession as well as the absence of clear
   legal carrier to verify this requirement has signified the importance of
   explaining the provisions, the position, and the procedure of the
   subject's involvement in the correctness of financial seizure. From the
   perspective of jurisprudence, lack of reasons preventing possession by
   others for the correctness of a transaction results in the fact that the
   necessary alienation in each instances of this discussion requires a
   particular reason; in the absence of such reason, the owner's seizure
   becomes effective. This article tries to explain ownership, the process
   of transfer, and its extinction at first; then, it reviews alienation
   (literally and legally), its history, the conditions for alienation in
   Shiite jurisprudence in Iranian positive laws.},

Abstract = {The rise of micro-targeting in American elections raises new questions
   about the effects of identity-based mobilization strategies. In this
   article, we bring together theories of expressive voting with literature
   on racial and ethnic identification to argue that prior studies, which
   have found either weak or null effects of identity messages targeting
   minority groups, have missed a crucial moderating variable - identity
   strength - that varies across both individuals and communities. Identity
   appeals can have powerful effects on turnout, but only when they target
   politicized identities to which individuals hold strong prior
   attachments. Using two innovative GOTV field experiments that rely on
   publicly available data as a proxy for identity strength, we show that
   the effects of both ethnic and national identity appeals among Latinos
   in California and Texas are conditional on the strength of those
   identities in different communities and among different Latino
   subgroups.},

Abstract = {In Western European democracies opposition to the European Union is
   commonly found at the ideological extremes. Yet, the Euroscepticism of
   radical left-wing and radical right-wing parties has been shown to have
   distinct roots and manifestations. The article investigates whether
   these differences are mirrored at the citizen level. Using data from the
   European Election Study (2009/2014) and the European Social Survey
   (2008/2012) in 15 West European countries, it is found that left-wing
   and right-wing citizens not only differ in the object of their
   Euroscepticism, but also in their motivations for being sceptical of the
   EU. Left-wing Eurosceptics are dissatisfied with the current functioning
   of the EU, but do not oppose further European integration per se, while
   right-wing Eurosceptics categorically reject European integration.
   Euroscepticism among left-wing citizens is motivated by economic and
   cultural concerns, whereas for right-wing citizens Euroscepticism is
   solely anchored in cultural attitudes. These results refine the common
   horseshoe' understanding of ideology and Euroscepticism.},

Abstract = {In this article we assess the electoral effects of the nomination of
   ethnic minority candidates. We argue that descriptive representation is
   an important factor in how parties in SMD systems establish their
   coalitions over multiple elections. We demonstrate this by showing that
   descriptive representation has a consistent effect on voting behavior,
   and thus that parties can rely on descriptive representation to win over
   specific segments of the voting population. Previous studies have been
   limited to single election years and single countries, but we collect
   original data from multiple election cycles in Australia and the UK to
   test our argument. We find that descriptive representation is
   consistently associated with a 10-percentage point bump in support from
   ethnic minority independents and Labour supporters. We conclude by
   highlighting the importance of this finding for party competition.},

Abstract = {The effects of precariousness, as a product of the neoliberal
   transformation of the labour markets, go beyond the workplace to become
   a factor of everyday life, and as such can be regarded as a constitutive
   factor in the formation of a working class within the neoliberal
   context. Despite having similar experiences under precariousness, it
   would appear that tourism workers in Antalya do not develop a class
   consciousness, and as such do not constitute an organised class
   movement. According to the findings of a qualitative case study of 42
   tourism workers in various tourism centres of Antalya, the spatial
   dispersion of workers is the predominant factor preventing the formation
   of a class consciousness.},

   cabinet position, career advancement in the political and public sector
   is difficult. Therefore, ex-ministers will seek positions that provide
   prestige, power and high enumeration in the private sector. Factors on
   the demand-side of the private sector, and personal commitment of the
   ministers are investigated to explore patterns of the revolving door.
   Empirically the study draws on a new data set of career paths of German
   ministers from 1949 until 2014. The analysis indicates that among German
   ministers the revolving door is not very common, but there has been a
   significant increase since the 1980s. The study provides support for
   several demand-side explanations, but more mixed patterns regarding
   personal commitment factors. This suggests diversity of minister career
   goals and that ministers typically do not systematically plan a second
   career in the private sector.},

   Republican and Democratic national conventions},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {Protests at national party conventions are an important setting in which
   political parties and social movements challenge one another. This
   article examines the motivations of participants in these events.
   Drawing upon data from surveys of protesters outside the 2008 national
   party conventions, it focuses on how partisan and independent political
   identifications correspond with the reasons that individuals give for
   protesting. The results demonstrate that there are some conditions under
   which independents place a greater focus on issues than do partisans and
   under which partisans place a greater focus on presidential candidates
   than do independents. However, there are also conditions under which
   independents are inclined to work alongside partisans, such as trying to
   stop the election of a threatening candidate and in championing an issue
   outside their opposing party's convention. The article argues that
   micro-level partisan identifications are thus likely to affect the
   broader structure of party coalitions. These considerations promise to
   become increasingly relevant as social movements - such as the Tea
   Party, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter - launch new campaigns
   against or within established parties.},

Abstract = {A remarkable deal of social research is based on data collected through
   the use of Likert-type scales. The optimal number of response categories
   in Likert-type scales has been subject to an academic debate for years.
   This article studies the differences between 5- and 7-point Likert-type
   scales using the SERVPERF Scale, which was developed by Cronin and
   Taylor in 1992, as the measuring instrument. A pretest-posttest control
   group experimental design was used to test whether the differently
   pointed response categories lead to any statistical differences in data
   characteristics, dimensional structure of the scale and data fit.
   Results do not show any statistically significant differences in terms
   of normality and reliability whereas different dimensional structures
   are achieved for the 5- and 7-point scale formats of SERVPERF using
   Exploratory Factor Analysis. ANCOVA results reveal that the number of
   response categories is not affective on the participants' evaluations of
   SERVPERF. The results of confirmatory factor analysis show that the best
   fit is achieved for the 7-point SERVPERF.},

Title = {Nigeria: The challenges of Reintegrating Niger Delta Militants},
Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2016},
Number = {17},
Pages = {57-72},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Federal Government of Nigeria granted amnesty to all persons
   involved in militant activities in the Niger Delta as a last ditch
   effort to save the region from continued havoc and devastation. The
   amnesty led to Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) of
   ex-militants in order to bring peace and development to the area by
   transforming ex-militants to meaningful and productive citizens. This
   study assesses the reintegration part of the DDR process. Analysis of
   the reintegration of ex-militants in the Niger Delta of Nigeria
   highlights its uniqueness, slightly different from other reintegration
   practices in Africa. While the Niger Delta reintegration program targets
   ex-militants, most practices in Africa are planned towards ex-combatants
   and other associated with fighting groups including communities. The
   limited participation of others stakeholders, the absence of a
   commission on DDR, the training of militants beyond the shores of
   Nigeria, as well as the exclusive funding of the reintegration program
   by the Nigerian government without donor support, are special features
   of the reintegration program in the Niger Delta of Nigeria. It is
   recommended that community participation and collaboration with the
   private sector would promote job creation for ex-militants and the
   committee should as well establish a post reintegration program.},

Abstract = {This article looks at Jose Guilherme Merquior's conceptual framework of
   `social liberalism' in light of Brazil's political and social reality.
   Such proposal only makes sense insofar as one understands Brazil as part
   - even with reservations - of the West. However, the idea of Brazil as a
   Western country had become particularly controversial in a historical
   moment when Latin America was regarded as part of a different (or even
   opposed) cultural background from the one of the West, especially among
   the AngloSaxon intellectual mainstream. Assuming our political culture
   is not exceptional, Merquior transforms the liberalism which he believes
   in and stands up for, from a potential `second degree' ideology (a term
   used by Roberto Schwarz to describe the liberal ideology in the context
   of nineteenth-century Brazil), into the best way out for the Brazilian
   crisis. If our country belongs to the West, and given that there is no a
   priori incompatibility between liberalism and the Brazilian political
   culture, Merquior paves his own way to become an engaged spectator,
   instead of only a philosopher of liberalism.},

Abstract = {In this work we will analyze the theoretical and political positions of
   Otto Bauer (an Austrian intellectual, member of the Social Democratic
   Party of Austria and of the so called Austro-marxist school) on crisis
   theory and the issue of imperialism in the framework of the Second
   International. Firstly, we will analyze his formulation of Marxist
   crisis theory as a business cycle theory. Secondly, we will study his
   formulation of a theory of imperialism during his intervention in the
   debate on nationalities in Austrian Social Democracy, as well as his
   reception of the canonical works of Hilferding and Luxemburg on the
   subject. Finally, we will consider his political intervention on the
   Austrian State, its foreign policy, and the national conflicts that
   developed inside it (and the impact of all these elements on his Party).
   Our hypothesis is that an organic relationship existed between these
   aspects: a position that considered crisis solely as a cyclical
   phenomenon favored a conception of imperialism as a particular policy
   that was not intrinsically necessary for the development of capitalism.
   In the political terrain this led to a stance that upheld the status quo
   of the Austrian State configuration, which was modified only gradually
   and belatedly, owing to the impact of national conflicts and the general
   evolution of Austrian and European imperialism. In our conclusion we
   will judge this idea in detail summing up the different subjects of our
   work.},

Abstract = {Agrarian resistance often occurs as a result of expropriation and
   dispossession of poor farmers' land and other properties. This paper
   examines how cost-benefit rational choice determined the government of
   Cambodia's response to poor farmers' resistance to large-scale land
   acquisition for an agro-industrial investment. Theoretically, whatever
   mechanism a government chooses to respond to resistance, the aim is to
   retain more benefits, especially political legitimacy. In this study,
   the government, in collaboration with private companies, opted for a
   combination of strong repression and partial concession in response to
   the resistance by the communities. The study argues that this response
   is basically determined by cost-benefit calculations. However, the
   purpose is not to retain political legitimacy as theoretically argued,
   but to protect the economic interests of the client-patron networks that
   had developed between foreign companies and the powerful local
   politico-commercial personages associated with the regime.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the role of cultural diplomacy in Slavic EU
   Member States. Its basic idea is to present the main characteristics of
   cultural diplomacy as a field of possible cooperation between the Slavic
   EU member countries. The conclusions of the research are three: firstly,
   the cultural diplomacy of the Slavic EU Member States is fragmented and
   diversified. Secondly, each country promotes its own cultural diplomacy
   and there is almost no cooperation between countries in the cultural
   field. Finally, cultural diplomacy is still an omitted instrument of
   Slavic EU Member States and a fertile ground for future collaboration
   within the EU and in the region of Central Europe.},

Abstract = {Today, terrorist groups are recruiting, inspiring, and guiding global
   strategies not just by Internet operations, but through an organized,
   steady infusion of propaganda videos and call-to-action messages. Most
   worrisome: increasing evidence that the youth population represents a
   particularly susceptible cohort, being drawn into the ranks of terrorist
   organizations operating worldwide. In response, this article will
   address the pros and cons of social media banning, its effects on
   constitutional rights, and its effectiveness towards decreasing
   radicalization and recruitment. The research presented here aims to
   further the field of Homeland Security and to encourage debates on how
   to decrease terrorism and youth recruitment and whether banning social
   media would assist the Department of Homeland Security's mission. In
   conclusion, this article explores both sides of the spectrum while
   offering insight for scholars, organizations, and practitioners
   regarding the attainability of social media banning in the United
   States.},

Abstract = {First published just over twenty years ago, La Mesentente is an
   important text in Jacques Ranciere's oeuvre. This paper examines a few
   of its complexities: the logic of the mesentente, the relationship
   between philosophy and politics, and post-democracy. In this way, the
   author's thought will be evaluated in light of its critics and the
   debate into which it was inserted. Further, emphasis will be placed on
   the way his discourse suggests a ``suspensive{''} dynamic of recognition
   which, despite some problematic knots, presents itself as an experience
   that twists the wrong to which someone has been subjected. Therefore,
   attempting an assessment of the book, this paper states that there may
   be found, in the reflection on the notion of ``la politique{''}, both
   the result of his theoretical itinerary and the most enduring legacy of
   his work.},

Abstract = {This article revolves around the role of the urban poor or the
   ``informal proletariat{''} in popular political protests in West Africa.
   It critically surveys instructive accounts of their participation in the
   1990s movement for democracy in Lagos, youth politics in Dakar, and a
   recent insightful analysis of popular uprisings in various parts of the
   continent in the 2000s. Various aspirations for change anchor these
   accounts. Against this backdrop, I turn to everyday life and politics in
   zones of urban informality and juxtapose it to a discussion of the
   acclaimed Nigerian artist Jelili Atiku's street performance towards the
   end of the Occupy Nigeria movement as a generative figure of protest.
   The scripts in which we read dispositions of the informal proletariat,
   their protest actions, relationship to state and power, and hopes for
   the coming community are central here. At stake I believe is our own
   ability to grasp agentive democratic possibilities for the future, which
   the protests and Atiku's performance illuminate.},

Abstract = {In this response to Whitman's Sympathies by Jane Bennett, I show how
   Whitman broke with Romantic poetic convention by representing sympathy
   as an involuntary, embodied affectas, in Bennett's terms,
   (onto)Sympathy. However, as I argue, the ontology of Whitmanian sympathy
   undermines the notion of individual identityof autonomy, singularity,
   and differenceupon which sympathy's traditionally inclusive, pluralist
   politics depends. Instead of persons and interpersonal ethical
   relations, Whitmanian sympathy conjures a networked and processual
   ontology in which discrete entities cannot finally be distinguished.
   Thus, I argue that Bennett's notion of (onto)Sympathy is incommensurable
   with the syntax of individual identity and (race, sex, gender, class,
   species) difference. But even if this makes it incompatible with a
   politics of recognition, I argue that this networked ontology may
   nevertheless be strategically better adapted to address the political
   challenges of ecological crisis.},

Title = {Elusive East Asia: Methodological Suggestions for the Study of
   East Asian Security},
Journal = {JAPANESE JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {451-467},

Abstract = {This article attempts to fill a gap in International Relations (IR)
   literature on East Asian security. East Asia' appears to be mostly an
   indeterminate conceptual construct, allowing scholars to look
   selectively at those aspects and areas that could justify their security
   thesis, albeit security dynamics in the region are all too difficult to
   comprehend and predict. This problem has been frequently pointed out in
   IR literature, but its methodological implications and suggestions have
   neither been appropriately illuminated nor been systematically offered,
   and the main solution commonly found in the literature was the
   tautological one of better defining' the region. As an alternative, this
   article suggests that one needs to tighten geographical focus and
   differentiate the subjects of analysis. When it comes to the study of
   East Asian security, one needs to aim to develop specific and
   differentiated generalizations as opposed to generalizations of a broad
   character. To showcase the fact that research outcomes can be more
   determinate when the target of analysis is more focused and specified,
   this article takes Northeast Asian security as an example and challenges
   the so-called peaceful East Asia' thesis, one of the mainstream
   perspectives on East Asian security. This article ultimately argues that
   while apprehending East Asian security dynamics through delimiting the
   scope of analysis and circumscribing the subjects of investigation is
   often deemed to be a modest enterprise?in particular, in terms of
   generalizability?the merits are substantial: research outcomes will be
   able not only to give us a truer mapping of the real world, but also
   bring us closer to building knowledge which satisfies the scientific
   criterion of falsifiability.'},

Abstract = {The rise of green politics and new social movements posed serious
   challenges for existing party families. Social democratic parties, in
   particular, found themselves increasingly crammed between old demands of
   rising industrial productivity and a stable economic growth on the one
   hand and new demands regarding ecological sustainability and
   environmental protection on the other. In this study, I examine the
   influence of green politics on social democratic party ideologies in
   Western Europe (N=19) during the last decades of the twentieth century.
   In the first step of the analysis, I carry out a descriptive examination
   in order to identify parties where ecological demands are clearly
   present. Here, the empirical observations indicate that parties
   domiciling in the northern and central parts of Europe generally have
   been more prone to establish ecological views than parties in Southern
   Europe. The second step of the study presents at least indicative
   evidence regarding possible causes of these ecological shifts. Building
   on previous research on party change - but using a qualitative
   comparative analysis (csQCA) in order to detect equifinal and
   conjunctural causality - I identify four sufficient paths leading to
   considerable ecological change within social democratic parties.},

Abstract = {Much recent research has focussed on the manner in which women political
   leaders are portrayed in media. This article examines the press
   discourses around Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, beginning
   before her participation in the 2004 Scottish National Party leadership
   contest, after which she was appointed deputy leader, and continuing
   through to her appointment as First Minister in 2014. Starting before
   her deputy leadership, a variety of definitional strategies positioned
   Sturgeon as aggressive and shrewish. Subsequently, in keeping with the
   obligations of a more `intimate' politics, we find a softening and
   domestication of Sturgeon's media image, alongside discourses of
   political competence and professionalism. Yet, the article shows how
   these shifts took place in a manner that continued to call upon
   established gendered discourses, often with newspapers using tactics of
   distancing. We suggest this illustrates the competing pulls of media
   logic, where the mediatisation of Sturgeon's image produces a marketable
   political persona, but accompanied by those residual gendered discourses
   long associated with the political press.},

Title = {Fast-Tracked or Boxed In? Informal Politics, Gender, and Women's
   Representation in Putin's Russia},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {643-659},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Why hasn't the marked increase in women in politics over the last half
   century led to the expected results of increased gender equality and
   more democracy? In order to propose a new answer to this question, which
   is central for both theoretical and empirical feminist political
   science, I look at the case of Putin's Russia as one of the
   authoritarian-leaning regimes that have promoted women into politics
   while simultaneously becoming more misogynist. Building on feminist
   institutionalism and the study of Russia's regime dynamics, both of
   which are extending the study of informal institutions, I claim that
   women are being fast-tracked into politics informally, not just formally
   such as by party or legislative quotas. Yet these women are then boxed
   in by informal rules and by parallel institutions and posts, with
   virtually no opportunities to advocate for women's interests. Putin's
   regime has promoted women to be stand ins during times of crisis or
   change, loyalists and showgirls when the regime needs to showcase
   elections and representation, and cleaners when the appearance of
   corruption threatens the regime. Even demonstrations of ultimate loyalty
   have not protected those women who once advocated for feminist policies.
   This exercise in concept building suggests a framework for thinking
   about the importance and operation of informal institutions, sustained
   by gendered and homophobic rules, as a bulwark of male dominance that
   undermines women's representation. There are also important policy
   implications, as advocates have been pushing for more women in politics
   to address a variety of ills that, my analysis suggests, will not be
   solved by numbers alone.},

Abstract = {This study investigates Israeli presence in Iraqi Kurdistan and its
   challenges for the Iran's national security. Although the informal
   presence of Israel in Iraqi Kurdistan dates back to the 1960s and 1970s,
   its presence has been more conspicuous, in the recent years, due to the
   changes in the international political equations, informal collapse and
   attenuation of social, geographical, and political Iraqi borders, the
   opportunities arising from 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the weakening of
   the central power in Iraq. This has exposed the security of the
   neighboring countries of Iraqi Kurdistan, especially Iran to
   unprecedented challenges. With this in mind, this paper is conducted to
   analyze these challenges using the library and archival research methods
   and following an analytical approach. Based on the findings, it can be
   said that the Israeli government, mostly driven by its political
   isolation amid the regional countries, has been trying to create
   security and political divergences, undermine the regional powers, and
   support the Iraqi Kurdish independence and secession of the country,
   which in turn could influence the Iranian Kurds who may be under the
   effect of federalism in the Iraqi Kurdistan, and enhance the ethnicity
   movements in Iran, which can also pose a potential security threat for
   Iran.},

Abstract = {How do inter-state conflicts affect foreign investment flows to
   developing countries? Conventional wisdom says conflicts disrupt
   economic interactions. This article develops and tests two competing
   causal mechanisms of the wisdom by focusing on foreign investment flows
   to developing countries. The first hypothesis states that conflicts
   carry enduring risk to foreign investors, making conflict-prone
   countries persistently less attractive. The second hypothesis says that
   the risk of conflict is ephemeral, allowing foreign investment to
   recover during peace-time. A monadic analysis of 95 developing countries
   from 1980 to 2000 provides strong evidence for the enduring risk
   hypothesis. However, the finding is limited by both the level of
   conflict hostility and the ex post immobility of foreign investment. The
   enduring risk of conflicts is significant for both actual warfare rather
   than use of force, and foreign direct investment (FDI) rather than
   foreign portfolio investment (FPI). The finding is robust in a series of
   subsample analyses, which reflect the distinctive experiences of
   developing countries in the late 20th century.},

Abstract = {In this article I argue that countries exporting fossil fuels, such as
   Australia, have an obligation to bear some of the costs of the harms
   caused by the use of those fuels. I argue that there is an analogy
   between other harmful exports - medical waste, tobacco, unsafe jobs,
   uranium - and fossil fuels. If this is the case, then current methods
   for allocating emissions and responsibilities for their harms are
   inadequate and more complex than they appear. I consider several
   counter-arguments to this claim, such as that it does not recognise the
   benefits of coal and that exporters are not really responsible. Finally,
   I consider some of the consequences of this argument and claim that
   Australia and other fossil fuel exporters ought to have a higher carbon
   budget' if this argument is true and that exporters ought to bear a
   higher share of the costs of climate harms.},

Volume = {51},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {There is a tension between a key principle underpinning liberal
   democratic governments and the associated political practice.
   Responsible government demands that the Executive is responsible to the
   Legislature. Governments, however, are generally inclined to evade or
   limit their accountability to Parliament wherever possible. In addition,
   ministerial advisers have thus far been excluded from the accountability
   framework of responsible government. This has led to an accountability
   deficit in terms of ministerial advisers appearing before parliamentary
   committees. Indeed, Ministers in the Australian Commonwealth and State
   of Victoria have claimed that there is a constitutional convention that
   ministerial advisers do not appear before parliamentary committees. This
   article challenges this claim and argues that there are no strong
   grounds based on precedent, reason, and the beliefs of political
   participants to conclude that there is a constitutional convention
   preventing ministerial advisers from appearing before parliamentary
   committees.},

Abstract = {The role of marriage and family strengthening with regard to religious
   commandments and ethics is not concealed from people who follow the
   divine commands and basic teachings of the Holy books and prophets.
   However, nowadays in many western societies, the principles of natural
   marriage are violated. The new forms of marriage are called abnormal,
   unnatural, and unusual forms of marriage among individuals including the
   same or opposite sex. Unnatural marriage can't be classified as a
   natural and legal contract. Note that both natural and unnatural forms
   of marriage have their own principles. Therefore, the recent research
   aims at analyzing the main reasons against unnatural marriage using
   analytical and library methods with regard to the fact that unnatural
   marriage has threatened standard marriage and family foundation. In this
   research, we rely on verses of Quran. All the data have been gathered by
   experts in the field of family affairs especially those who witnessed
   homosexual marriage and observed both personal and social difficulties
   of homosexual individuals.},

Abstract = {In 1989 at the height of the Bicentenary celebrations the Abbe Henri
   Gregoire, one of the leading figure of the French Revolution, received
   the symbolic acknowledgement of the transfer of his remains to the
   Pantheon. During all his long public life, started in the days of the
   meeting of the Estates-General in May 1789 and ended at the beginning of
   the July Monarchy, Gregoire claimed an attitude of personal consistency
   and political integrity. The article focuses on the legitimacy of such
   claim in the perspective of some crucial moments of the revolutionary
   epoch and paying a particular attention to the role of Gregoire at the
   moment of the Girondin crisis at the National Convention, in May-June
   1793.},

Abstract = {In this article, I examine legal, political, and cultural reasons behind
   the genocides in Iraq and Syria of 2007-2015, that decimated the Yezidi
   communities of Sinjar or Shingal (Sengal/Singal/Singar). It is typically
   argued that failures to prevent genocide occur due to imaginative
   deficits or fear of a military quagmire. However, I show that atrocities
   are quickly recognized and sanctioned in some cases, and that
   substantial resources in terms of international support, military
   assets, and political rhetoric have been generated in several cases in
   which groups were less threatened than the Yezidis. To explain the
   disparate responses to claims of imminent persecution or massacre, I
   develop the theory of the Reverse CNN Effect, in which some tragedies do
   not receive the requisite attention of the mass media to mobilize
   action. The phenomenon extends beyond the media to the resolutions and
   reports of the United Nations and, at times, those of the US government.},

Abstract = {Benefits of organs refer to non-material forces put by God in human
   organs definite or indefinitely e.g. eyesight in the eyes, wisdom in
   brain, or heart beating. The benefits of internal organs are like the
   organs outside the body and is under cover of the general rule of
   whatever there is only one of it in the body, the blood money will be a
   full one. Many scholars have mentioned the obligation for a full
   compensation for destruction of each organ. Several studies have been
   conducted on the elimination of benefits or determination of the value
   of the organ in religious regulatory books and their evaluation in
   Islamic jurisdiction and Islamic penal code. This penalty is sometimes
   called blood money or in other cases compensation. This money is
   determined by religious codes and should be paid by the criminal for
   compensating the damage induced by him. Elaboration on these benefits in
   religious books and then discussing the rules and regulations and
   finally comparing them with Iranian legal system is the goal followed by
   the author of the present work.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {49},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1270-1300},

Abstract = {Are political parties willing to partially forgo their office and policy
   goals to maximize their coalition governance capacities? Multiparty
   governments are plagued with preference heterogeneity and uncertainty
   about policy outcomes. In this article, we argue that parties choose to
   make a strategic allocation of portfolios to curb delegation perils.
   They use portfolios with jurisdiction overlaps to shadow each other at
   the ministerial level. We define a wary partners' situation when
   different parties control the portfolios that form a jurisdiction
   combination. We test this hypothesis for 12 West European parliamentary
   democracies since 1945. Our contribution conjugates a Monte Carlo
   simulation, which estimates whether real-world distribution differs
   significantly from expected allocation under nonstrategic behavior, with
   in-depth interviews with more than 40 former ministers. Results show
   that wary partners are used extensively as coalition governance
   mechanisms, particularly because of their capacity to curb information
   asymmetries and to avoid interministerial gridlock.},

Title = {International Tariffs in a Mixed Oligopoly with Research Spillovers},
Journal = {PEACE ECONOMICS PEACE SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {22},

Pages = {277-293},

Abstract = {This paper merges three strands of the literature-industrial
   organization, international trade, and economics of technical change-to
   examine the effect of tariffs on international mixed oligopolies which
   conduct research and development (R\& D) that is prone to spillovers.
   Mixed oligopolies are prevalent in the defense sector, among other
   sectors. Using a two- stage sequential game with R\&D in the first stage
   and production in the second stage, results show that higher tariffs
   reduce outputs of both the domestic public firm and foreign private
   firms, and private R\&D. Effects on domestic R\& D and welfare, and
   profits of foreign private firms depend upon spillovers. Within a large
   range of research spillovers, higher tariffs can in fact lower welfare.
   Some of these findings are different from traditional oligopolies and

Abstract = {Although John Locke's educational curriculum has traditionally been seen
   to aim at creating free citizens capable of independent thought, the
   centrality of habituation to his pedagogy has recently raised concerns
   that the Education is no more than ``indoctrination{''} for compliant
   subjects. I argue here that by re-examining habituation in light of
   Locke's epistemology, we find that Locke's education does aim at
   freedom, but that this freedom requires a strong will and a cultivated
   skepticism. The habits which Locke asks parents to instill are aimed not
   at programming specific behavior and opinions, but rather at training
   children to ``cross their desires{''} to strengthen their wills against
   the impositions of nature, custom, and fashion, which Locke argues pose
   an far more serious threat to independent thought than parental
   discipline. Locke's education aims to cultivate a skeptical mental
   disposition that permits individuals to resist these other sources of
   habit and to continually question and revise their own convictions.},

Abstract = {Human dignity, and respect and commitment to it, is considered as one of
   fundamental principles of divine religions and international instruments
   on human rights. Benefit from valuable moral and theological virtues in
   order to provide of human growth and development exclusively is in the
   light of fundamental rights and the principle of preserving human
   dignity. Accordingly, today the concept of human rights and commitment
   to follow it in the international and national legal systems has a very
   important position. Rejection of all forms of exploitation humiliation
   and torture is one of the first underlying layer of human rights which
   known as negative human rights or social Don'ts. Although as the
   interpretation of the famous French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau in
   the eighteenth century, human is born free but in the process of social
   life and adapting to social situations in different ways to be
   distracted from their pure nature. Countless people in the world today
   are subject to oppression, even are subject to varying degrees of
   slavery instances including humiliation and degradation and
   prostitution. This research attempts to analyze the irreparable
   consequences of this phenomenon on human society, and also to look
   beyond national and transnational criminal measures and policies on this
   phenomenon.},

Abstract = {This paper forecasts current senators' votes on Merrick Garland's
   nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, in the unlikely case that a vote
   actually takes place. The forecasts are necessarily conditional,
   awaiting measurement of the nominee's characteristics. Nonetheless, a
   model that combines parameters estimated from existing data with values
   of some measurable characteristics of senators-particularly their party
   affiliations, party loyalty levels, and ideological positions-is
   sufficient to identify potential swing voters in the Senate. By
   accounting for a more nuanced and refined understanding of the
   confirmation process, our model reveals that if President Obama were to
   nominate almost any nominee (conservative or liberal) today, that
   nominee would be rejected if a vote was allowed to take place. So why
   nominate anyone at all? Obama's hope for a successful confirmation must
   come from the stochastic component, that is, from outside the
   traditional decision-making calculus.},

Abstract = {This article asks whether an academic boycott is morally justified. It
   does not relate to the question whether academia and politics should be
   mixed. Instead, relying on the case study of the debate surrounding the
   academic boycott of Israeli academia by British, and later American
   academics, the article analyzes the various arguments applying
   analytical political philosophy tools. Broadly speaking two families of
   argumentsconsequentialist and deontologicalare found. Consequentialist
   arguments rely on three psychological, sociological, and political
   assumptions that are false and make them counterproductive (bearing in
   mind the overall goal declared by the boycott promoters). Despite some
   initial appeal, the deontological arguments also fail, at least to a
   certain extent, to justify the boycott. Finally I discuss what I call
   selective boycotting.},

   fulfill its mission and achieve its objectives if the man live without
   next love, whose goal of the law is the peace that is sustained by
   justice, and the path to righteousness is love, because without it there
   is no justice, there is no love without dignity, and there is dignity is
   not respected Human rights. Currently earn interest body on issues
   involving the protection of these rights and it is understood the
   paramount importance of construction of Fundamental Rights in order to
   achieve peace, the purpose of which is defended by the Constitution. The
   study aims to demonstrate how this noble feeling concatenate with the

Volume = {49},

Abstract = {Across the social sciences, growing concerns about research transparency
   have led to calls for pre-analysis plans (PAPs) that specify in advance
   how researchers intend to analyze the data they are about to gather.
   PAPs promote transparency and credibility by helping readers distinguish
   between exploratory and confirmatory analyses. However, PAPs are
   time-consuming to write and may fail to anticipate contingencies that
   arise in the course of data collection. This article proposes the use of
   ``standard operating procedures{''} (SOPs)-default practices to guide
   decisions when issues arise that were not anticipated in the PAP. We off
   er an example of an SOP that can be adapted by other researchers seeking
   a safety net to support their PAPs.},

Abstract = {In the US House, the Suspension of the Rules procedure provides a route
   by which vote buying may occur. To investigate the conditions under
   which partisan theories anticipate that this behavior is more likely to
   happen, I use a dataset of all bills on which a final passage vote was
   taken in the House between 1975 and 2010. The House is more likely to
   consider bills by suspension to provide side payments to three types of
   bill sponsors from the majority party: ideologically distant members of
   this group; members whose preferences are located within the first 30\%
   of the space in the majority party blockout zone; and members whose
   preferences are located on the minority party side of the chamber
   median.},

Title = {Urban architecture in traditional centers. Case study. Milla sector},
Journal = {PROVINCIA},
Year = {2016},
Number = {36},
Pages = {115-135},
Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {We seek to understand the elements that constitute the urban structure
   in order to define models that provide intervention strategies for a
   specific urban space; the case that we present, approaches the study of
   a sector of the traditional hull of the city of Merida - Venezuela.
   The work was developed through three fundamental stages: the first one
   of analysis, seeks to understand the urban-architectural characteristics
   of the sector under study with the aim of apprehending guidelines that
   guide the subsequent stages of intervention; The second of urban
   intervention, seeks to recover the wealth of traditional centers, but
   incorporating the advantages of contemporary urban planning in terms of
   image, landscape and mobility; The third and last stage, of
   architectural intervention, seeks to enrich the sector by means of the
   insertion of an urban equipment according to its activities and scale.
   Methodologically, the research was carried out through both quantitative
   and qualitative approaches, which allowed us to combine data from field
   inspection and documentary review, with the study of
   theoretical-conceptual and urban-architectural theories, concluding with
   the formulation of criteria of urban and architectural design that
   defined the final proposal.
   The proposal seeks to rescue different urban sectors within the city,
   giving them architectural value and gradually connecting them in a
   coherent way from the morphological, functional and landscape points of
   view. The results of the intervention of the Plaza Sucre as an urban
   proposal and the incorporation of the Municipal Theater as an
   architectural proposal, prove precisely that Merida lacks spaces
   suitable for the enjoyment of the pedestrian and for the visual
   recognition of its architecture.},

Abstract = {Chinese President Xi Jinping has demonstrated a distinctive leadership
   style and established his personal dominance by setting up a number of
   small leading groups, reducing the decision-making authority of his
   politburo colleagues. He has also made himself a populist leader by
   using the whole party-state propaganda machine to promote his
   personality. The power concentration and a distinct personal leadership
   may help Xi push long-delayed reforms, while making decision-making more

Abstract = {The article analyses the ways African migrations determine the
   construction of the African Diasporas, in order to understand the
   possibility of consolidation of a decentralized World, beyond the
   Nation-State. It examines the African migrations and their Diaspora
   throughout history, while taking into account essentially two temporal
   axes: the contemporary history of the 20th Century and the slave-trade
   epoch (ss. XV-XIX); as well as the socio-cultural, economic and
   political impacts (or legacy) of these African Diasporas in their
   destination countries.},

Abstract = {Over recent months, the Islamic State (IS) in Syria and Iraq has lost
   territory to the Syrian army, opposition forces in Syria, the
   reorganised Iraqi Security Forces and the Hashed Al-Sha'bi (Popular
   Mobilization Forces - PMF), as well as to Kurdish Peshmerga forces in
   Iraq. These losses have led to heightened speculation that an assault on
   the IS stronghold of Mosul may happen sooner rather than later. However,
   with such speculation comes the fear of the day after', and what could
   be expected to happen in Mosul - a traditional focal point of Arab and
   Iraqi nationalists - and a city that was the centre of Iraq's military
   establishment throughout the twentieth century. Tallha Abdulrazaq and
   Gareth Stansfield investigate this day after' question, highlighting the
   potential problems that may emerge following IS's departure from the
   city.},

   Suicide Bombers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {30-42},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In the past two decades, suicide terrorism in its different forms has
   become a popular topic of research and debate. It has contributed to a
   different sense of normalcy and regularity in various societies across
   the world given that suicide bombings are relatively inexpensive and
   effective, compared with other kinds of terrorist methods. This study
   primarily focuses on suicide bombings in the Palestinian/Israeli
   territories, an area that has experienced conflict and tension for over
   six decades. In doing so, the research study uses Durkheim's typology of
   suicide as a theoretical framework to trace the history of suicide
   bombings in the Palestinian/Israeli territories, outline the
   characteristics of suicide bombers, their motivations, and how suicide
   bombings have been used as a form of resistance to occupation. The data
   collected cover suicide bombings that have occurred from April 1994 to
   February 2008. The research study uses logistic regression to examine
   the characteristics of the suicide bombers and their attacks. The
   results show, among other things, that the attacks possess elements of
   both altruistic and anomic types of suicide in the Durkheimian sense of
   the word.},

Abstract = {Xi Jinping, a ``princeling{''} scion of China's revolutionary
   aristocracy, rose from a blameless but unprepossessing background as a
   provincial official as blank as a Rorschach inkblot, prudently keeping
   his political agenda under wraps. Belying early expectations of
   political reform, Xi has instead since his ascension prioritized the
   monopolization of political power and implementation of a sweeping
   rectification campaign. Yet his quest for personal power is also clearly
   motivated by vast ambition to strengthen China, both domestically and
   internationally. This paper is a preliminary attempt to assess that
   effort. The first section briefly and in very broad outline reviews the
   political economic context Xi inherited, from the Tiananmen crackdown
   and subsequent slowdown to Xi's simultaneous election to chairmanship of
   the Politburo Standing Committee and the Central Military Commission in
   2012. The second part summarizes the domestic reforms initiated since
   the 18th Party Congress in 2012 and offers a tentative assessment of how
   well the various reforms are suited to correct the respective problems
   and how well they fit together. The third section turns to the impact of
   Xi's reform and rebalancing program on Chinese foreign policy. This is
   followed by brief concluding remarks.},

   electoral support in Croatia},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {42},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In spite of a rapidly expanding literature on democratization,
   elections, and conflict, we lack systematic understanding of what
   determines electoral results in post-conflict societies. This article
   offers a novel initiative in revealing electoral patterns in states
   recuperating from painful experiences of war by analyzing data from more
   than 500 Croatian municipalities during five post-war electoral cycles.
   While the findings suggest voters do respond to parties' economic
   policies, the underlying pattern of electoral support demonstrates that
   competition is heavily constrained by the legacy of conflict, with the
   communities more exposed to the violence being more likely to vote for
   the principal party of the center right which led the country into
   independence and throughout the war. This tendency exhibits a remarkable
   level of stability over time, which suggests conflict dynamics can
   become firmly embedded in post-conflict democratic electoral competition
   - even in societies that are not ethnically diverse. (c) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {This study aims to measure the social perception created by the impact
   of the July 15 coup attempt. The social picture that emerged during and
   after July 15 deserves greater sociological attention. A total of 250
   people were martyred in this upheaval, making it the bloodiest coup
   attempt in the history of coups in Turkey. Social resistance to the
   perpetrators transformed into ``democracy watch{''} countrywide which
   lasted 27 days. As part of the study, interviews were conducted with 176
   people who participated in the democracy watch in 9 cities and 12
   squares. Hence, the codes of social consciousness developed about the
   coup attempt and the perpetrators, amongst others, are captured by how
   the society perceives the coup attempt.},

   level of compliance with international conventions that Turkey is party
   to. Reasons of rampant corruption and examples of the widespread culture
   of impunity are also evaluated. Ultimately, the post-July 15th climate
   provides a precious opportunity to address these issues and install

Abstract = {The economic literature has focused on the traditional factors impacting
   foreign direct investments (such as fiscal factors), while the
   non-traditional factors (such as institutional factors) have been less
   analyzed. The aim of this paper is to present an econometric analysis
   using Least Squares Method for emphasizing the political institutional
   factors, economic institutional factors and the quality of labor force
   factors impacting on the foreign direct investments attracted in
   Bulgaria and Romania. We used yearly data series from 1999 to 2014,
   provided by the World Bank. These two countries display a very friendly
   climate (low income corporate tax), but they attracted large amounts of
   foreign direct investments only for a short period of time during the
   mid-2000s'. Our results show that, in Romania, a high-skilled
   labor-force has attracted foreign direct investments in the economic
   sectors that have contributed to an intensive economic growth, but the
   low quality of the infrastructure has negatively impacted foreign direct
   investments inflows. Political and fiscal instability, mainly during
   pre-election periods, has also attracted foreign direct investments. In
   Bulgaria, lax laws and weak governance effectiveness have attracted
   foreign investors that avoided bureaucracy and numerous business
   regulations. In Bulgaria, foreign direct investments seek mainly cheap
   and low-skilled labor force in the sectors that contributed to an
   extensive economic growth. Romania should focus on improving its
   infrastructure, while Bulgaria should focus on diminishing corruption.},

Abstract = {Political scientists often assume that parties listen to some voters
   more than others. However, this theoretical perspective has rarely been
   applied to explain political responsiveness to advocacy groups. This
   article argues that the type of voter mobilised by protest activities
   plays a role in determining whether advocacy groups are able to
   influence political decisions. The explanatory value of this approach is
   demonstrated by a study of the geographic distribution of school
   closures among Swedish local governments during the 2002-10 period.
   School issues have been important drivers of contentious politics in
   Sweden. Two hypotheses are tested. The first hypothesis predicts that
   protesters in districts with numerous swing voters are more likely to
   achieve their goals. The second hypothesis predicts that protesters in
   districts with numerous core voters are more likely to achieve their
   goals. In line with the swing hypothesis, the main results suggest that
   protesters are more likely to stop school closures in volatile polling
   districts.},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates the important role that the European
   statistical agency - Eurostat - plays in shaping tools for responding to
   banking crises. From 2009, Eurostat used its position as the interpreter
   of member state budget statistical rules to implement increasingly
   stringent rules for how financial crisis responses would affect public
   budgets. Rather than mere technical details, these rules affected crisis
   responses. Elected politicians, and especially those under bailout
   programmes, have strong incentives to minimise the direct budgetary
   effects of aiding failing financial institutions. By establishing and
   enforcing new rules about which crisis responses directly hit member
   state budgets and which did not, Eurostat created incentives to choose
   certain policies. The article explores this process by examining the
   creation of bad banks and the European Stability Mechanism. It makes an
   original contribution to both the study of the European banking union
   and the general role that statistical agencies can play in shaping
   crisis responses.},

Abstract = {The banking union constitutes not only a major advance in supranational
   economic integration but also increases differentiated integration among
   the member states of the European Union. Although the banking union is
   open to all EU member states, only euro area countries participate.
   Other member states have been opponents, bystanders, or interested
   non-participants. This article explains the variation in participation
   as a result of path-dependency arising from the original differentiation
   between euro area countries and the rest of the EU. In the euro crisis,
   these two groups of member states were subject to differential pressure
   to integrate further. In addition, the banking union reinforced the
   causes that had led to the original differentiation of the monetary
   union. This path-dependency overrides variation in sector-specific
   economic interests, governance capacity, and policy paradigms that might
   otherwise explain governmental preferences in banking regulation. These
   factors can, however, partly explain variation in preferences among the
   non-euro area countries.},

Abstract = {A major issue in the philosophy of human rights today concerns the
   divide between the orthodox and the political/practical view. The former
   focuses on and emphasizes the moral dimension of human rights, the
   latter their political/legal function. The present article displays the
   main strengths and weaknesses of each competing conception by providing
   a thorough analysis of all relevant theoretical aspects of the issue as
   well as of its practical significance. It then sustains that a
   compelling theory should include a social conception of human dignity in
   the grammar of human rights - as suggested by Buchanan's and Forst's
   interpretations - which takes into due consideration the equal status of
   human beings, and in doing so it is able to reveal all the complexity of
   the notion of human dignity, in particular in its intersubjective
   dimension. Thus, we might obtain an essential mediation between the
   moral dimension and political/legal function of human rights, in a way
   that covers almost entirely the list of human rights as it is spelled
   out in the major official documents, and secures adequate normative
   force for their justification.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article considers Baruch Spinoza's contribution to a theory of
   constituent power. Modern theories of constituent power generally agree
   on its paradoxical essence: a power that comes before the law and founds
   the law is at the same time a power that, once the juridical sphere is
   established, has to be obliterated by the law. Spinoza's ontology has
   been recognised as one of the early modern sources of constituent power,
   yet he argues for a strict equivalence between law and power. This
   article argues that by reading Spinoza's political theory through the
   lens of a radical immanence between ontology and history, we can
   understand him as a source for a theory of constituent power. It also
   argues that, through this immanence, Spinoza's thought offers a solution
   to the paradox of constituent power and enriches contemporary
   discussions on the origin of juridical sphere and the relationship
   between politics and law.},

Abstract = {This study argues that three recent societal trends have increased
   parties' incentives to give election promises in campaigns: the
   increasing volatility of voters, the professionalization and
   marketization of politics, and the mediatization of politics. Arguments
   are empirically tested on the case of Sweden between 1991 and 2010. All
   promises presented in election manifestos by Swedish parliamentary
   parties are analyzed, enabling analyses of six elections, nine parties,
   44 manifestos and almost 4000 election promises. We find that Swedish
   parties increased their pledge making considerably during the period,
   from an average of 46 per manifesto to 149. Specific promises have
   increased, as have the pledges that are unrelated to other parties'
   pledges. Altogether, the results point at an increasingly specific vote
   choice for voters.},

Abstract = {This study uses roll-call voting data from 16 legislatures to
   investigate how the institutional context of politicssuch as whether a
   country is a parliamentary or presidential regime, or has a
   single-party, coalition or minority governmentshapes coalition formation
   and voting behavior in parliaments. It uses a geometric scaling metric
   to estimate the revealed space in each of these legislatures and a
   vote-by-vote statistical analysis to identify how much of this space can
   be explained by government-opposition dynamics as opposed to parties'
   (left-right) policy positions. Government-opposition interests, rather
   than parties' policy positions, are found to be the main drivers of
   voting behavior in most institutional contexts. In contrast,
   issue-by-issue coalition building along a single policy dimension is
   only found under certain restrictive institutional constraints:
   presidential regimes with coalition governments or parliamentary systems
   with minority governments. Put another way, voting in most legislatures
   is more like Westminster than Washington.},

Abstract = {In democratic Africa, where ethnicity is a key driver of vote choice,
   politicians must attract voters across ethnic lines. This article
   explores one way politicians can do this: by appealing to a coethnic
   bond through their spouse. We propose that cross-ethnic spouses can help
   candidates send credible signals of coalition building before an
   election. We test this argument with a survey experiment in Benin, where
   President Yayi has married across ethnic lines. Our results confirm that
   priming the first lady's ethnicity increases support for President Yayi
   among her coethnics. We generalize these results by combining new data
   on leader-spouse ethnicity with Afrobarometer survey data. Our results
   suggest that cross-ethnic marriages are one tool leaders can use to
   shore up support in multiethnic elections.},

Abstract = {The EU is divided between member states that have adopted the euro and
   those that have not. This article looks at the issue of differentiated
   integration with particular reference to eurozone integration and the
   euro-outsiders. I explore the recent public debate in the UK on
   euro-outsiderness, comparing this with debates in Denmark. The article
   highlights some striking differences between the UK and Denmark when it
   comes to the actual management of euro-outsiderness in Brussels as well
   as some of the dilemmas facing euro-outsiders such as the UK, Denmark,
   Sweden and Poland as the EU struggles to exit its crises. Finally, I
   discuss the future of two-speed European integration and the UK's
   possible exit from the EU. The UK cannot escape the dilemma of favouring
   either influence or autonomy; whether the UK remains in or leaves the
   EU, it will need to allow the eurozone to proceed in order to prevent
   further eurozone crises.},

Abstract = {Evans and Mellon's `Working class votes and Conservative losses: solving
   the UKIP puzzle' seeks to resolve a puzzle: how substantial levels of
   UKIP support among traditional working class voters, and in Labour-held
   constituencies, can be reconciled with evidence that a majority of
   current UKIP supporters recall voting for the Conservatives in 2010.
   Evans and Mellon (2015, Journal of Parliamentary Affairs,
   doi:10.1093/pa/gsv005). advance two arguments to resolve this puzzle.
   First, that the political impact of UKIP has been misunderstood due to a
   failure to consider long-term political shifts. Second, that the class
   basis of support for UKIP has been misunderstood due to poor measures of
   class. We find much to agree with on both of these points. This reply
   focuses on clarifying our arguments on three issues: the social basis of
   UKIP support; the role of value divisions and the importance of
   geography and the electoral system for understanding UKIP's longer-term
   prospects.},

Abstract = {The revolution in information technology that began in the 1990s has
   been transforming Finland into an information society. Imaginative data
   processing and utilization, arising from the needs of citizens and the
   business community, are some of the most important elements in a
   thriving society. Information and know-how have become key `commodities'
   in society, and they can be utilized all the more efficiently through
   information technology. For all nations, the information technology
   revolution quietly changed the way business and government operate, as
   well as the daily life of citizens. Our daily life, fundamental rights,
   social interactions and economies depend on information and
   communication technology working seamlessly. An open and free cyberspace
   has promoted political and social inclusion worldwide; it has broken
   down barriers between countries, communities and citizens, allowing
   interaction and sharing of information and ideas across the globe.
   Individuals, public and private organizations alike depend on the cyber
   world. From the citizens using social media, to banks growing their
   business, to law enforcement supporting national security-every sector
   of the society is increasingly dependent upon technology and networked
   systems. While the public sector, the economy and the business community
   as well as citizens benefit from globally networked services, the
   digital IT society contains inherent vulnerabilities which may generate
   security risks to citizens, the business community or the vital
   functions of society. Without sufficient awareness of the risks in cyber
   world, however, behavioral decisions and unseen threats can negatively
   impact the security of the critical infrastructure and can cause
   physical damage in the real world. On an individual level, what is at
   stake is the vulnerability of each individual user in cyber world. As
   the world grows more connected through cyber world, a highly skilled
   cyber security workforce is required to secure, protect, and defend
   national critical information infrastructure. Across the private and
   public sector organizations are looking for well-trained professionals
   to assess, design, develop, and implement cyber security solutions and
   strategies. While the demand for cyber security professionals is high,
   the supply is low. Meeting the growing demand for cyber security
   professionals begins in the education system. The most efficient custom
   to increase cyber security is the improvement of the know-how. The cyber
   security strategies and development plans require the improvement of the
   know-how of the citizens and actors of the economic life and public
   administration. Pursuant to Finland's Cyber Security Strategy (2013)
   ``the implementation of cyber security R\&D and education at different
   levels does not only strengthen national expertise, it also bolsters
   Finland as an information society.{''} In this article are analyzed the
   cyber security research and education which is offered in Finland's
   universities and universities of applied sciences.},

Abstract = {The reading of some recent work suggests a number of considerations from
   the perspective of constitutional law. It is curious that in the search
   for effective social rights, the corroboration of the state system in
   making these rights possible is not defended. The mere mention of the
   financial nature of all rights, especially of those studied here, is
   enough to highlight the need to change the paradigm. From the
   perspective of social rights, an adequate theoretical construct that
   highlights its personal character could contribute both to overcoming
   the present uncertainty and to linking these rights to the principle of
   responsibility. This principle, without having been studied, should
   occupy an important place in proposals to overcome the present economic
   crisis, which is also a crisis of values.},

Abstract = {This article examines how emotions are understood, in deeply gendered
   ways, within gender and clientelism debates in Argentina. By looking at
   the case study of the voluntary network of neighborhood representatives
   of Plan Vida, which distributes food aid in the Province of Buenos
   Aires, I distinguish two ways of conceiving affects in grassroots
   women's political participation. While the first one emphasizes the
   management of the external expression of emotions as part of doing
   politics, the second one considers affective labour in a given urban
   territory as fostering connections among actors, creating social capital
   and allowing the flow of relevant information. The conclusion suggests
   that the second approach gives greater relevance to the possibilities of
   agency and transforming relations of domination of these women doing
   politics at the local level.},

Abstract = {This article shows that key to understanding the referendum outcome are
   factors such as a profoundly eurosceptic public, high levels of citizen
   uncertainty, divided mainstream political parties on the EU and lack of
   unity within the `Leave' campaign. The Brexit referendum is more than
   just about domestic issues and government approval. Utilitarian concerns
   related to economic evaluations of EU integration coupled with support
   of or opposition to EU freedom of movement are very likely to influence
   vote choice. Those campaigns that focus on rational utilitarian
   arguments about the costs and benefits related to EU membership as a
   whole but also to EU freedom of movement are expected to swing voters.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {41},
Pages = {60-69},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Civic duty is a central concept in the study of turnout, yet little
   attention has been paid to how it should be measured. After a careful
   review of previous measures we constructed an original battery of 13
   questions that were administered in a survey conducted in seven
   countries at the time of the 2014 European election. We show that the
   battery indeed taps the duty construct. We then propose a reduced
   battery of four questions. We show that the four questions achieve good
   fit measures and pass several tests of robustness and validity across
   the seven countries. We invite researchers to implement this battery in
   future research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The existence of political uncertainty has been identified in the
   literature as one of the main determinants of cabinet bargaining delays.
   Still, practically all studies on the topic expect uncertainty to play a
   relevant role only during the immediate post-election period, ignoring
   the variety of different government experiences, especially in countries
   characterized by a high cabinet turnover in the between-elections
   period, such as Italy. To overcome this shortcoming, we estimate the
   magnitude of change in the bargaining environment as a determinant of
   bargaining delays, taking into account partisan, ideological and
   institutional variations that can happen across two subsequent formation
   processes. Our results help to better explain the variance in the
   Italian government bargaining experience throughout almost 70 years of
   history. Moreover, once we control for the effect of such changing
   circumstances, the relevance of the timing of negotiations disappears.},

Title = {Extraction and Violent Resistance in the Early Phases of State Building:
   Quantitative Evidence From the ``Maji Maji{''} Rebellion, 1905-1907},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {Does extraction increase the likelihood of antistate violence in the
   early phases of state-building processes? Although research has focused
   on the impacts of war on state building, the potential ``war-making
   effects{''} of extraction have largely been neglected. The article
   provides the first quantitative analysis of these effects in the context
   of colonial state building. It focuses on the ``Maji Maji{''} rebellion
   (1905-1907), the most substantial incidence of anticolonial violence in
   Eastern Africa. Analyses based on a new historical data set confirm the
   correlation between extraction and resistance. More importantly, they
   reveal that distinct strategies of extraction produced distinct
   outcomes. Although the intensification of extraction in state-held areas
   created grievances among the population, it did not drive the rebellion.
   Rather, the results indicate that the expansion of extractive authority
   threatened the interests of local elites and provoked effective
   resistance. This finding provides insights into the mechanisms driving
   the ``extraction-coercion cycle{''} of state building.},

Abstract = {Research on executive action often assumes that presidents face an
   either/or decision between issuing an administrative order and seeking
   legislation. This premise, however, ignores differing structural
   characteristics of administrative and legislative policy vehicles. This
   article will argue that, rather than see administrative actions as
   equivalent to legislation, presidents understand the distinct advantages
   and disadvantages each policy instrument brings and act accordingly.
   Using data linking executive orders (EOs) and presidential legislative
   proposals, as well as a case study of the creation of the Department of
   Homeland Security, we show that when presidents issue more EOs, they do
   not issue fewer legislative proposals. In fact, presidents sometimes
   follow up on significant EOs with proposals to enshrine them in statute.
   Our research supports viewing EOs as a tool in the legislative toolbox
   rather than a challenge to the legislative process.},

Abstract = {The transnational anti-apartheid movement was heavily motivated by the
   postwar emphasis on human rights and decolonisation, and challenged by
   Cold War politics and economic interests. The aim of this article is to
   examine Iceland's involvement in the anti-apartheid struggles with focus
   on the establishment of the unified anti-apartheid movement SAGA
   (Sudur-Afrikusamtokin gegn apartheid), its organisation and activities.
   What were the motives of SAGA's activists and their subjective
   experiences? The political background in Iceland is outlined as well as
   a historical overview of anti-apartheid activities including Iceland's
   voting on resolutions against apartheid at UN and adoptions of sanctions
   against the South African regime. Iceland's involvement in the
   anti-apartheid struggle was contradictory. During two periods Iceland
   voted for more radical UN resolutions than did other Western countries,
   including the Nordic ones. Yet, Iceland adopted sanctions against the
   South African regime later than the neighbours and the same applies to
   the establishment of a unified anti-apartheid movement. The branding of
   the African National Congress (ANC) as communists allowed many to ignore
   the human right breaches of the South African regime. Most of the
   activists belonged to left-wing groups or the labour movement, and the
   relative absence of religious organisations and the Students' Council of
   the University of Iceland is notable. Embedded in the transnational
   anti-apartheid network with particular ways of organisation and
   mobilisation, the activists became emotionally engaged and worked for a
   moral cause.},

Abstract = {As a widespread agreement in literature, global market conditions have
   enforced localities to be more competitive. In this context competition
   means to become more proactive and entrepreneurial. This study attempts
   to indicate competitive attitudes of eight Turkish greater city
   municipalities by penetrating subtitles of strategic plans - vision,
   strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats-which manifest basic
   policy directions. In this analysis it can be easily seen that Turkish
   metropolitan government system substantially routing in a competitive
   world by identifying global scale for its future. By so doing Turkish
   greater city municipalities have utilize public facilities in accordance
   with local growth approach relying on market conditions instead of
   redistribution of them according to equity between local residents. It
   is evaluated that this process may increase the financial dependency of
   metropolitan system to global forces and removal of cities from its real
   owners.},

Abstract = {We investigate the Twitter activity of all congressional candidates
   leading up to the 2012 U.S. House elections to assess whether there are
   significant differences in the tone and content of the tweets from male
   and female candidates. We argue that the electoral environment will have
   a significant effect over whether candidates engage in negative
   tweeting, address political issues, and discuss so-called women's issues
   on Twitter. We find that gender has both a direct and contextual effect
   on candidates' communication style on Twitter. Female candidates tweet
   significantly more attack-style messages than their male counterparts,
   discuss policy issues at a significantly higher rate, and women
   representatives focus more on women's issues. We also find strong
   contextual effects in races with more female candidates: There is
   significantly more tweeting about political issues as well as
   significantly more negative attack-style tweets. However, with more
   female candidates, the number of tweets about women's issues declines.},

Abstract = {This article provides a critique of neo-liberal, supply-side austerity
   policies as they unfold asymmetrically in the EU/Euro-zone and beyond.
   The main argument advanced is that, contrary to claims by the European
   Commission and Germany's elite, growth and austerity are incompatible
   policy magnitudes. The Euro-zone constitutes the worst form of Gold
   Standard from which countries cannot escape and advance the imperative
   of domestic growth as external devaluation and import-substitution are
   no-options. The article shows neo-liberal austerity is currently being
   implemented via authoritarian forms of governance from above while
   cultivating racist and xenophobic movements from below.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the EU's response to the Syrian refugee crisis,
   both inside the EU and in the Syria's neighboring countries. It first
   focuses on the background of the common asylum policy of the EU and
   major challenges posed by the refugee crisis to the common EU refugee
   policy. The article then focuses on an analysis of the impact of the
   refugee crisis on the EU, the failures of the EU to adopt a common
   approach towards the refugees from Syria, and the EU initiatives. As the
   Syrian refugees/asylum applicants constitute a large part of the asylum
   applicants/refugees in the EU and because the core documents do not
   differentiate among the refugees based on their nationality, we will
   simplify the EU position towards the refugees by assuming that it holds
   true for the Syrian refugees specifically. Should there be a special
   condition applied to Syrian refugees only, this will be explicitly
   mentioned.},
