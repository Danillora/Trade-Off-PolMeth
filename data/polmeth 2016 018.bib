Abstract = {ObjectiveThis essay explores the ways in which memorial culture reflects
   contemporary attitudes about the United States and its history.
   MethodAn examination of the role of the U.S. National Park Service,
   which manages and maintains many American memorials, illustrates the
   evolving relationship between official memory and history. Memorials to
   dissent and disaster are considered as part of an emerging trend in
   American memorial culture in which trauma, conflict, and loss are
   commemorated.
   ResultsAmerican memorial culture is increasingly driven by ethical
   imperatives to remember those believed to be forgotten or ignored in
   history.},

Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {Married women in the early nineteenth century United States were not
   permitted to own property, enter into contracts without their husband's
   permission, or stand in court as independent persons. This severely
   limited married women's ability to engage in formal business ventures,
   collect rents, administer estates, and manage bequests through wills. By
   the dawn of the twentieth century, legal reform in nearly every state
   had removed these restrictions by extending formal legal and economic
   rights to married women. Legal reform being by nature a public good with
   dispersed benefits, what forces impelled legislators to undertake the
   costs of action? In this paper, I argue that interjurisdictional
   competition between states and territories in the nineteenth century was
   instrumental in motivating these reforms. Two conditions are necessary
   for interjurisdictional competition to function: (1) law-makers must
   hold a vested interest in attracting population to their jurisdictions,
   and (2) residents must be able to actively choose between the products
   of different jurisdictions. Using evidence from the passage of the
   Married Women's Property Acts, I find that legal reforms were adopted
   first and in the greatest strength in those regions in which there was
   active interjurisdictional competition.},

Abstract = {As dozens of British women and girls travel to join Islamic State in
   Syria and Iraq, there are increasing concerns over female radicalization
   online. These fears are heightened by the case of Roshonara Choudhry,
   the first and only British woman convicted of a violent Islamist attack.
   The university student in 2010 stabbed her Member of Parliament, after
   watching YouTube videos of the radical cleric Anwar Al Awlaki. Current
   radicalization theories portray Choudhry as a ``pure lone wolf,{''} a
   victim of Internet indoctrination, without agency. This article explores
   how gender factors in her radicalization, to present an alternative to
   existing theoretical explanations. An engagement with gender reveals its
   role in Choudhry's radicalization, first, in precluding her from a real-
   world engagement with Islamism on her terms, pushing her to the
   Internet; then in increasing her susceptibility to online extremist
   messages; finally, in fomenting an eventually intolerable dissonance
   between her online and multiple `` real{''} gendered identities,
   resulting in violence. The article emphasizes the transgressive nature
   of this act of female violence in Salafi-Jihadi ideology; also, the
   importance of this gendered ideology as the foundation of ISIS
   recruitment online. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the
   operation of gender in the Jihad's production of violence, and roles for
   men and women alike.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis article analyzes the operational dynamics of Boko Haram,
   the largest radical Islamist organization engaged in acts of terrorism
   in Nigeria.
   MethodWe analyze Boko Haram's terrorist campaign using information
   gathered from 1,086 successful attacks that occurred between July 2009
   and December 2014. We examine the operational tempo of attacks on a
   monthly basis, identify the primary tactics employed in and targets of
   those attacks, and assess the outcome of each successful attack in terms
   of severity metrics.
   ResultsWe find that despite leadership changes, Boko Haram has increased
   the frequency of attacks, gained international media attention, and
   continues to pose a serious threat to security in West Africa.
   ConclusionsThe analysis provides a series of insights into why Boko
   Haram was able to complete a leadership succession and achieve this
   success after its initial defeat despite internal and external factors
   that have undermined prior terrorist campaigns. Consequently, unless the
   internal and/or external dynamics are altered, Boko Haram is likely to
   continue to conduct attacks and remain a serious threat to Nigeria and
   to the security of adjoining countries in West Africa.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis article considers the sociopsychological implications of
   terrorism, which are sometimes neglected in preparedness plans.
   MethodsUsing Israeli experiences as a case study, this article briefly
   reviews four points of connection between terrorism and its
   psychological and social legacies: the sociopolitical aspects of
   terrorism, the unexpected nature of terrorism, normalization of
   terrorism and public resilience, and social aspects of medical care for
   terror-related injuries.
   ResultsThe Israeli experience suggests preparedness plans should include
   planning for the sociopsychological effects of terrorism on targeted
   populations and may, in certain contexts, use Israeli approaches as a
   model.
   ConclusionsExperience gained in Israel and elsewhere can set the stage
   for an appropriate response plan striving not only for preparedness but
   also resilience. Efforts should be made to advance local capabilities,
   response plans, and resilience by drawing on the experience of others in
   coping with the terror threat.},

   They Want},
Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-59},

Abstract = {Activists need mass media to reach the largest audience possible, but
   getting media attention is difficult. Although disruptive protests are
   more likely to get covered by journalists, scholars claim that the
   resulting coverage is usually undesirable. Getting beneficial coverage
   presents a tactical dilemma for activists, and an analytical one for
   scholars. How do activists get the quality of media coverage they want
   when the tactics getting them attention result in negative coverage?
   This project contributes to the literature on movements and media in two
   ways: (1) I offer a new measure of desirable coverage that will be
   useful to media scholars: graphic description of grievances; (2) I use
   this measure to show that disruptive and controversial protest tactics
   may not always result in negative media attention. The new measure of
   `good' media coverage helped determine conditions under which newspapers
   provide activists with the coverage they want. I used the Dynamics of
   Collective Action dataset to analyze all animal advocacy protests
   covered in the New York Times from 1960 to 1995, and found that the
   reputation of the involved organization may be associated with `good'
   coverage. Organizations that have established a controversial identity
   may garner coverage that activists want, even if controversial actions
   do not. Put simply, it is less what activists do than who activists are
   that determines the quality of coverage they receive.},

Abstract = {While non-sovereignty is often presented as a rational and pragmatic
   political status option, this paper asserts that the smallness of
   overseas territories in various ways obstructs and distorts the
   formation of an informed local public debate about this political
   status. Due to personalistic politics, patron-client relations,
   excessive executive dominance, and the lack of professional media, which
   all are consequences of a small population size, the extent to which
   citizens of overseas territories are involved and represented in status
   debates is limited. The paper uses the 2010 political reforms of the
   Dutch Caribbean islands as an illustrative case study, to show how the
   smallness of these islands has obstructed a balanced consideration of
   status options among the population.},

Abstract = {This paper highlights the voices of some Muslim American women and
   identifies the processes of gendered racialization in a context of White
   supremacy. Informed by Rita Dhamoon's (2011) intersectional ``processes
   of differentiation{''} and interviews with 20 Muslim American women, we
   find gendered patterns of racial violence emanating from state and
   society. According to the interviews, the primary source of the racial
   violence against women is ``society{''} while men are targeted in a
   complex configuration of state and society. We argue that this binary is
   a mirror of the gendered racialization process of maintaining White
   supremacy in the United States.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {13},

Pages = {22-36},
Abstract = {We test whether connective use of social media mobilizes individuals to
   engage in political consumerism. Analyzing data from a 2013 survey of
   LGBT adults (N = 1,197), we find that those who use social media for
   connective activities, (e.g., to meet new LGBT friends, discuss LGBT
   issues), are significantly more likely to engage in boycotts or buycotts
   to promote equality. We find significant interactions between connective
   social media use and political interest. Specifically, connective social
   media use mobilizes people with low levels of political interest to
   participate and reinforces the likelihood that people with high levels
   of political interest participate.},

Abstract = {This chapter addresses the question of why conflicts that are deeply
   rooted in historical injustice tend to defy straightforward resolution.
   It traces the historical roots of the conflict in Mindanao and the
   various efforts of the government in the Philippines to reach a
   political settlement. In particular, it examines the peacemaking efforts
   by the Macapagal-Arroyo and Aquino administrations, the contexts in
   which they made progress but also stalled and the ways in which the
   general public reacted to these efforts. It argues that it takes more
   than political will and historical sensitivity on the part of the
   government to address the problem. If a broader segment of the public,
   especially in political elite circles, do not share the need to
   recognize historical injustice and address restorative justice then
   obstacles to resolution remain.},

Abstract = {One of the consequences of Al-Qaeda's terrorism has been its blurring of
   the distinction between national and international politics, both of
   which have lost a great deal of their former autonomy by serving as
   hosts for a set of new global concerns and practices. The Global War on
   Terror can be seen as an effort to externalize Al-Qaeda's global threat
   by internationalizing it in a conventional war, and thus reinforcing
   both the autonomy of international politics and its separation from that
   of a national variety. More than a conservative move to protect the
   international order, however, the War on Terror was also an ambitious
   attempt to remake global politics in the wake of the cold war. But
   despite the transformations it has wrought, the War on Terror failed to
   create either a new global order or even a new global politics.},

Abstract = {At the beginning of 1947 the first elections in fourteen years were held
   for state governors. Adhemar de Barros, elected in sao Paulo with large
   support from the communists, was an old ally of Vargas who ran his own
   political party, the Progressive Social Party (PSP), and began to
   compete with Vargas himself for the working-class vote. His campaign for
   the Government of the State of Sao Paulo had been based on lowering the
   high cost of living. He promised strict price controls on basic
   necessities and an intensive campaign against price rises. Therefore,
   when the Mayor of Sao Paulo announced a rise in transport fares a few
   months after the election of Adhemar, the hostile reaction spread
   through the city like wildfire. Rapid growth and the disregard of public
   authorities contributed to a chaotic and profoundly unequal urban
   landscape, where the most visible problem was the public transport
   system. The aim of this article is to understand the popular reaction to
   the rise in bus and tram fares which led to the largest urban riots in
   the history of the city, at that time already the largest industrial
   metropolis in Latin America.},

Abstract = {America has been a basic and permanent ingredient in the definition of
   spanish national identity during the Franco's Regimen: ``Spain was
   considered mother of nations that brought language, religion and culture
   to that continent in the past and that was able to create a community
   that can recognize itself in that shared past and can aspire to a common
   future in the present{''}. This sort of naturalization of a historical
   event as a foundational element of the spanish national identity can be
   trace along the Franco's dictatorship in the political discourse and in
   the foreign relations as well. In fact America was not the point but a
   symbolic capital with which the Regimen could magnify his image and
   increase his impoverish bargaining power. America appeared as an excuse
   in order to glorify the spanish colonial past. But, What happened with
   the myth of America after the restoration of democracy? The new
   political system made any difference in the way the myth of America was
   organized? I will try to find out this in one public institution, the
   Museo de America in Madrid.},

Abstract = {The economic policies applied by the technocrats as mechanism to ensure

   Spain and Portugal to the bosom of the civilized and modern European
   nations, conferred the businessmen an unknown importance as essential
   actors in charge of its implementation. That leading role, however, had
   an inevitable counterpart. The{''}desarrollismo{''} demanded the
   appearance of a new model of company and an unusual type of businessman,
   a schumpeterian professional manager, and, in agreement with it, the
   eradication of practices and traditional methods of management. In
   summary, the modernization of these businessmen required the promotion
   of values and learning of skills scantily appreciated and hardly
   historically cultivated: a new mentality of development that compelled
   the businessmen but also the whole society and to the own

Title = {Reflection on Political Economy of Global Society Today},
Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {64},
Number = {2},
Pages = {218-236},
Abstract = {Recently we could observe an accumulation of problems in the global
   society. Beeing more serious and complicated these problems have become
   a kind of the historical excess when all possibilities of the countinous
   development have been exhausted and consequently a crucial societal
   transformation must be done. This article deals with the reflection on
   the roots of the present political and economical problems and how to
   solve them. It demonstrates some theoretical conclusions of the articles
   published in the Political Economy in the previous ten years.
   Successively, the attention is paid to the most important works which
   illustrate the possibilities of a radical societal transformation from
   the different perspectives. To be concrete there are presented works of
   R. Richta (the 50th anniversary of his well - known work will be
   commemorated in 2016), of Francis Fukuyama (whose very optimistic
   original visions had to be reviewed later) and of S. Huntington (who
   focused on searching the causes of global conflicts in a broader
   context). Finally, it is proposed a new concept of solving problems - a
   transition to the society whose economy is based on the productive
   services which means on the services linked to the human capital in its
   three phases: gaining, preservation and realization. At the same time
   the barriers of this transition and possibilities how to overcome them
   are identified.},

Abstract = {The final chapter draws together several issues referred to throughout
   the book, and through these summarizes integrity. First, it examines the
   relationship between trust and integrity, arguing, with a focus on
   recovering trust after integrity violations, that trust is based on the
   practice of dialogue and narrative development, professional and
   procedural integrity and. Second, it examines three related concepts
   corruption, counterfeit integrity and confusion arguing that these are
   engrained in the practice of business, and noting how the practice of
   integrity can address these. Finally it returns to the identity of
   business, to consider just what can be re-presented.},

Abstract = {Thailand has recently faced significant civil and political unrest. The
   election of Thaksin Shinawatra as Prime Minister in 2001 and his
   subsequent overthrow by a military coup in 2006 has negatively affected
   the country's nascent democratization. Furthermore, it has brought about
   a significant polarization of Thai society. Two mutually opposing camps
   have emerged with distinct political ideologies and different visions of
   democracy, namely the anti-Thaksin camp and the Thaksin support camp.
   The unprecedented rivalry between these two opposing camps has caused
   ``personal insecurity{''} as well as ``political insecurity{''} for many
   in Thai society. This has led to the destruction of private and public
   property and violence toward government officials, police, military
   personnel, and citizens alike. These insecurities have dented Thailand's
   international reputation; damaging tourism and foreign investment. The
   following chapter examines the complex character of this period. It
   unpacks the factors and consequences of this civil turmoil in Thai
   society in terms of human security and evaluates the efforts to cope
   with such problems.},

Title = {Analysis of the Development of the Economic Condition and Efficiency of
   the Privatization Process of Banks in the Czech Republic},
Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},

Pages = {804-832},
Abstract = {Banks which underwent the privatization process in the Czech Republic,
   i.e. Ceska Sporitelna, a.s., Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, a.s.,
   Investicni a Postovni Banka, a.s., Komercni Banka, a.s., Zivnostenska
   Banka, a.s., have been very widely discussed by both professional and
   lay public from several perspectives. Namely, what the actual economic
   condition of these banks was on the date of completion of the
   privatization, as well as the transfer of graded loans, or rather low
   performing assets, which the state took over and reimbursed to the banks
   through consolidation institutions (hereinafter Cl), and all this
   obviously in relation to the purchase price obtained within the scope of
   privatization.
   The aim of this article, within the possibilities stipulated by its
   scope, is:
   1) To analyse the development of the banks' economic condition in the
   time interval of 1990-2010;
   2) To identify factors that determine the volume of income from the sale
   of the state's investments in privatized banks;
   3) To confirm or refute the hypothesis that the bank rescues before the
   completion of the privatization process were excessive;
   4) To analyse the overall balance of the privatization process, or
   rather the efficiency of the sale of the banks;
   5) To test the practical applicability of the economic theories
   connected to the issue in question. With regard to the above, the
   article is structured in the following manner. Firstly, literary
   research of articles on the theme of The Privatization Of Commercial
   Banking in reputable economic impact magazines is processed. This is
   followed by the actual economic analysis of the privatized banks in the
   Czech Republic, where economic parameters are examined in an interval of
   approximately 20 years total assets, costs, revenue, profit, capital
   adequacy, etc. The conclusion firstly evaluates the development of the
   economic condition, then identifies factors that determine the volume of
   income from privatization, the excessiveness of the banks' rescue, the
   overall balance of the privatization process, and the practical
   applicability of the economic theories in question.},

Title = {Policing mobilities through bio-spatial profiling in New York City},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {55},
Pages = {72-81},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In 2003, the Bloomberg administration launched Operation Impact, a
   hot-spots policing program which identified high-crime areas in New York
   City and flooded them with high concentrations of new police officers.
   These hot-spots, labeled Impact Zones, are sites of mobility constrained
   and structured by biometric and spatial technologies borrowed from the
   military. This article analyzes the city's advanced police profiling
   technologies as they play out within Impact Zones. The profiling is
   racial, social, biometric, bio-political, and spatial, and works to
   demarcate dangerous people and places. Because this profiling technology
   is enacted spatially and governs residents' mobility, I argue for a new
   conceptual apparatus, which I call bio-spatial profiling. Drawing on
   ethnographic fieldwork in police hot-spots, policy analysis, and textual
   analysis of media articles, I argue that the lived experience of
   biospatial profiling is one of pervasive fear which governs mobilities
   in Impact Zones. Next, I trace the experiences of Northeast Brooklyn
   residents back to their sources, and find three bio-spatial practices:
   both biometric and spatial data collection, and police street-stops.
   These symbiotic practices inform and strengthen each other, congealing
   to produce fear and immobility for those they target. The article
   concludes with a discussion of the conflicting understandings of
   (in)security in Impact Zones that connects the practices with the
   experiences of bio-spatial profiling, to illuminate the human costs of
   militarized securitization of domestic urban life. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {Objective. Since 2008, the StandardizedWorld Income Inequality Database
   (SWIID) has provided income inequality data that seek to maximize
   comparability while providing the broadest possible coverage of
   countries and years. This article describes the current SWIID's
   construction, highlighting differences from its original version, and
   reevaluates the SWIID's utility to cross-national income inequality
   research in light of recently available alternatives. Methods. Coverage
   of inequality data sets is assessed across country-years; comparability
   is evaluated in terms of success in predicting the Luxembourg Income
   Study (LIS), recognized in the field as the gold standard in
   comparability, before those data are released. Results. The SWIID offers
   coverage double that of the next largest income inequality data set, and
   its record of comparability is three to eight times better than those of
   alternate data sets. Conclusions. As its coverage and comparability far
   exceed those of the alternatives, the SWIID remains better suited for
   broadly cross-national research on income inequality than other
   available sources.},

Title = {Conditional coercion versus rights diagnostics: Two approaches to human
   rights protection},
Journal = {POLITICS PHILOSOPHY \& ECONOMICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {405-423},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Scholars in philosophy, political science, and the policy community have
   recently advocated for a sticks and carrots', or conditional-coercion,
   approach to human rights violations. On this model, rights violators
   (usually states) are conceived of as rational agents who should be
   rewarded for good behavior and punished for bad behavior by other states
   seeking to improve human rights abroad. External states concerned about
   human rights abroad should impose punishments against foreign rights
   violators, and these punitive measures should not be lifted until rights
   violations in target countries cease. Against these scholars, I argue
   that the conditional-coercion model is mistaken. In this article, I
   explicate the sticks and carrots' approach to human rights, criticize it
   on both theoretical and empirical grounds, and suggest an alternative
   approach that I term rights diagnostics. The model I propose is
   sensitive to the internal political struggles in rights violating states
   and the incentive structures faced by rights violators. This model takes
   account of relevant empirical evidence on the role of external coercion
   and inducements in producing institutional change. I conclude by
   sketching an institutional design that would potentially implement
   rights diagnostics' policy.(1</SUP)},

Abstract = {Enlightenment reformers in France had very different visions about
   whether military men should marry. In one view, acting as a good soldier
   and citizen drew on new models of masculine virility, and required
   separating oneself entirely from the restraints of domestic life.
   Conversely, being a soldier-citizen could mean building on changing
   ideas of domestic virtue and respectability, combining a patriotic
   obligation to fight with responsibility to family. The marital status of
   soldiers provided a potent flash point for negotiating these tensions,
   while also engaging with pragmatic questions of providing for
   dependents, promoting military efficiency, and reinforcing population
   and state power.},

Abstract = {The seminal contribution known as the Condorcet Jury Theorem observes
   that under a specific set of conditions an increase in the size of a
   group tasked with making a binary decision ({''}guilty or ``innocent,
   say) leads to an improvement in the group's ability to make the correct
   choice. An assumption that is not properly appreciated in the relevant
   literature is that the competency of the group members is assumed to be
   exogenous. In numerous applications, members of the group make
   investments to improve the accuracy of their decision making (e.g.,
   pre-meeting efforts). We consider the collective action problem that
   arises. We show that if individual competence is endogenous, then
   increases in the group size encourages free riding. This trades off with
   the value of information aggregation. Thus, the value of the larger
   group size is muted. Extensions illustrate that if committee members are
   allowed to exit/not participate, the equilibrium committee size is
   reduced. Additionally, supermajority voting rules encourage investments
   and, consequently, individual competence.},

Title = {Dancing on the graves: Independence, hot/banal nationalism and the
   mobilization of memory},

Abstract = {Nationalism is frequently considered as an extreme, `hot' phenomenon
   related to often violent nation/state-building processes. Billig's Banal
   Nationalism turned the attention to how nationalism is also `flagged'
   and routinely reproduced in existing states. This article studies the
   mobilization of these forms of nationalism and suggests that
   independence is a useful notion in bridging the hot/banal divide and for
   tracing the `hot in the banal'. Whereas for separatist movements
   independence is primarily a goal aspired to, in existing states
   independence/sovereignty is used to bring together hot and banal forms
   of nationalism which are mobilized in reproducing the
   discourses/practices related to the purported national identity. This
   paper first outlines a heuristic framework for conceptualizing
   independence and its key dimensions in relation to hot and banal
   nationalism as well as state-territory building. Secondly, the paper
   will study empirically the merit of the notion of independence regarding
   nationalism research via four themes: (1) the role of independence in
   Finland's state/nation-building process, spatial socialization and in
   mixing hot and banal nationalism; (2) the use of the `independence card'
   by (nationalist) parties; (3) the mobilization of nationalist
   practices/discourses in the performativity of Finnish Independence Day;
   and (4) the resistance that the independence celebrations have incited.
   This study shows that the idea of independence in this context is
   inward-looking, draws on Othering, and is flagged in media and spatial
   socialization (e.g. education) using particular iconographies,
   landscapes, events, and memories related above all to wars. Rather than
   expressing hot or banal nationalism these discourses/practices
   effectively merge the two, challenging any simple dichotomy between
   them. The performativity of Independence Day in particular displays this
   blending. (C) 2016 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Americans are reluctant to support foreign military intervention.
   However, if victims of violence are identified as Christians, support
   for intervention is higher. We term this a Brother's Keeper effect as
   Americans, especially more religious Americans, will support
   intervention that aids co-religionists. To test our argument, we use a
   survey experiment that randomly assigns respondents to varying accounts
   of violence in the Central African Republic. Respondents who read
   Christians are the victims of violence are more supportive of military
   intervention compared to respondents who read vignettes that do not
   identify the religious identities of victims. Moreover, these Brother's
   Keeper effects are stronger among more religious respondents. We also
   find even stronger effects when extrapolating results as a population
   effect with survey weights. Our findings reveal that labeling otherwise
   unknown foreign actors as Christian have significant effects on support
   for foreign military intervention.},

Abstract = {Throughout the twentieth century, California farm workers endeavored to
   build viable farm labor unionism. In 1966, Filipino and Mexican farm
   workers merged their respective farm labor unions, the Agricultural
   Workers Organizing Committee and the National Farm workers Association,
   which laid the foundational base for the United Farm Workers of America
   (UFW). The merger constituted a moment of interracial unity, which
   Filipinos and Mexicans had previously lacked; by 1970 the UFW would
   negotiate landmark collective bargaining agreements. This article
   demonstrates how Filipinos and Mexicans resolved deeply rooted racial
   division and that doing so built a path to successful farm labor
   mobilization. The study complements previous farm worker scholarship
   that concentrates on exogenous causal factors of success by drawing
   focus to endogenous causal factors, particularly racial identity within
   the movement.},

Abstract = {This article examines the emergence of democratic deliberation in a
   crowdsourced law reform process. The empirical context of the study is a
   crowdsourced legislative reform in Finland, initiated by the Finnish
   government. The findings suggest that online exchanges in the
   crowdsourced process qualify as democratic deliberation according to the
   classical definition. We introduce the term ``crowdsourced
   deliberation{''} to mean an open, asynchronous, depersonalized, and
   distributed kind of online deliberation occurring among self-selected
   participants in the context of an attempt by government or another
   organization to open up the policymaking or lawmaking process. The
   article helps to characterize the nature of crowdsourced policymaking
   and to understand its possibilities as a practice for implementing open
   government principles. We aim to make a contribution to the literature
   on crowdsourcing in policymaking, participatory and deliberative
   democracy and, specifically, the newly emerging subfield in deliberative
   democracy that focuses on ``deliberative systems.{''}},

Abstract = {Aboriginal Australian public intellectual Noel Pearson has gained
   prominence and influence for his brand of policy reform in Indigenous
   affairs by drawing upon the capabilities approach. This article
   challenges the coherence of Pearson's position, arguing that his
   unrelenting focus on personal responsibility leads him to conflate
   different elements within capabilities thinking. Pearson 1) mistakes
   social capabilities (to which people are entitled) for human potential
   to be unfolded, and 2) casts and prescribes personal responsibility as a
   type of latent capability. The latter a) inverts the capabilities
   approach wherein phenomena such as personal responsibility arise as an
   effect of the realization of latent capabilities rather than serving as
   latent capabilities themselves, and b) is at odds with the liberal basis
   of the capabilities approach that rejects imposing good ways of life on
   people. This is illustrated through reference to Pearson's advocacy of
   Direct Instruction teaching and engagement with the real economy. The
   paper recognizes Pearson's contribution to the policy debate and that
   the problems he highlights are real, but argues that the remedial
   approaches adopted are problematic, including in terms of Pearson's
   stated stance against assimilationist policy agendas.},

Abstract = {In a series of recent articles, Matthew Clayton, Andrew Williams and
   Rasmus Sommer Hansen and Soren Flinch Midtgaard argue that a key virtue
   of Ronald Dworkin's account of distributive justice, Equality of
   Resources, is that it provides a distribution that is continuous with
   the evaluations of the individuals whom it ranges over. The idea of
   continuity, or as Williams calls it the continuity test', limits
   distributive claims in at least one important way: one person cannot
   claim compensation from another when she does not believe she is worse
   off than him. In this article, I challenge whether an account of
   distributive justice should be continuous with the evaluations of the
   individuals whom it ranges over. My argument is that continuity competes
   with another consideration, namely, correctness. An account of
   distributive justice should track who actually is disadvantaged, not
   whether individuals believe they are disadvantaged. In addition, I offer
   an account of how we can get closer to a correct account of who is
   disadvantaged based on two sources of evidence.},

Abstract = {Protesters employed a great variety of organizational forms in the
   cycles of popular contention that rocked the West African country of
   Burkina Faso from early 2011 through the overthrow of President Blaise
   Compaore in October 2014. While some actions appeared largely leaderless
   and unstructured, others were clearly better organized and under some
   central direction. The organizations ranged from very local and loosely
   linked networks of student and community activists to professional
   national structures, such as union federations and political parties.
   The latter may have been better at articulating grievances and directly
   confronting state power and policies. But the former exhibited
   considerable tenacity and could more quickly draw in wider sectors of
   the population. Activists did not necessarily see one form as superior
   to the other; they had different strengths and weaknesses, depending on
   the particular conjuncture and goal. The big challenge, many agreed, was
   how to better coordinate their struggles.},

Title = {The risk of civil conflicts as a determinant of political institutions},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {36-59},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a mechanism to explain differences in political
   institutions based on a particular feature of civil conflicts that has
   not been previously explored. Under asymmetric and uncertain costs of
   civil conflicts members of the elite would like to commit in advance to
   a strong response to insurgencies, but ex-post they have the incentives
   to block any response if the conflict mainly affects other members of
   the elite. One way of solving this commitment problem is empowering the
   executive so he may react forcefully to conflicts, despite the
   opposition of some fraction of the elite. The main prediction is that,
   conditional on asymmetric and uncertain costs, the higher is the
   likelihood of a conflict in the future, the lower are the constraints
   imposed on the executive. The paper validates this implication using a
   sample of former colonies and geographic variables to identify the
   exogenous component of the likelihood of conflicts. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {In this paper, we examine the potential for developing a stronger
   connection between the two significant discourses of sustainable
   development and nationalism. While there has been limited academic
   enquiry into the relationships that might exist between these two
   discourses, we draw on the case study of Wales since 1999 to show how
   policy-makers are increasingly examining the potential for promoting a
   more fruitful dialogue between them. We examine how nationalist
   discourses in Wales have led to the development of a form of sustainable
   development that is allegedly more attuned to Welsh national values and
   identities. We also show how sustainable development is being used to
   imagine new and possibly more inclusive kinds of futures for the Welsh
   nation. We conclude by reaffirming the fruitful synergies that might
   exist between sustainable development and nationalism while
   acknowledging the tensions that arise in seeking to make connections
   between them. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Despite arguments to the contrary, the state continues to defiantly
   resist efforts to ``extend the reach of legality{''}, especially as it
   pertains to attempts to bound the use of organised violence within
   international legal mechanisms. Yet this defiance is something of a
   paradox, where the evolution of the modern laws of war are characterised
   by a contradictory pattern. By focusing on important junctures in the
   short evolution of the codification of the laws of war it will be argued
   here that the writings of Swiss jurist Emer de Vattel provide the best
   insights into this contradictory development.},

Title = {Does Party Finance Regulation Create a Level Playing Field?},
Journal = {ELECTION LAW JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-82},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The major objective of party finance laws is to create equitable, free,
   and fair party competition in which the true popularity of policy
   proposals matter most for electoral outcomes. But to what extent have
   party finance laws encouraged homogenous financial conditions for fair
   party competition? This article draws on the level playing field
   conception prominent in theories of egalitarianism and tests the
   assumption that party finance regulation eliminates or reduces
   inequalities arising from unequal starting points. It analyzes data on
   the party finances of 47 parties in six European countries between 1960
   and 2010. The findings indicate that party finance law has been
   effective in some countries. Specifically, despite significant
   legislative differences, the introduction of party finance law in
   Denmark and the Netherlands was most effective in encouraging financial
   convergence amongst parties and thus more similar financial conditions.
   The findings suggest that party finance regulation has not always
   accomplished creating a level playing field; wherever it did, quite
   different structures achieved similar outcomes. When it comes to party
   finance regulation there appears to be no one-size-fits-all policy to
   create equal opportunities between parties.},

Abstract = {Philip Pettit's conception of freedom as nondomination is modally robust
   in that it requires not simply reducing the probability of uncontrolled
   interference by others but entirely eliminating that possibility. In
   this article, I consider whether freedom as nondomination provides an
   attractive analysis of official discretion, particularly in the context
   of the criminal law, an area of recurring interest for Pettit. I argue
   that not only does the modally robust character of freedom as
   nondomination have some rather unattractive implications in the criminal
   law, but that it sits poorly with Pettit's more general ambitions to
   provide a consequentialist framework for the evaluation of social
   institutions. Drawing on recent work by Niko Kolodny, I develop an
   anti-deference' interpretation of nondomination and contrast it to
   Pettit's modally robust conception.},

Abstract = {This article presents In Time (Andrew Niccol, 2011) as a film that
   illuminates the role of borders at a local level and their relationship
   with the transnational interests of financial corporations. In Time
   imagines a near future in which time has replaced money as the currency.
   In this world, people have been genetically engineered to stop aging at
   25, so, when they reach that age, they have to earn time or they die
   within a year. The film, shot in Los Angeles, portrays a world divided
   into ``zones{''} and focuses on two of them: Dayton, a working-class
   area, and New Greenwich, a financial district. Drawing on this setting,
   In Time explores the roles of borders in the processes by which the
   later extracts value from the former. In order to investigate such
   processes, I consider the different kinds of borders that appear in the
   film, including not only fences and walls, but also other borders
   related to wealth, time, etiquette, behaviour, race, and surveillance.
   Close examination of borders, spatial dynamics, and characters'
   behaviour elucidate the rationale behind the socioeconomic structures
   that the film depicts, who benefits from them, and what their interests
   are. Focusing on such aspects, this article argues that the different
   borders that appear in the film control the movement of people and
   money, thereby contributing to several conditions that benefit financial
   firms: the generalisation of debt, the casualisation of labour, workers'
   resignation, the protection of the financial sector, and the
   criminalisation of the poor.},

Abstract = {Abstract
   This article examines the concept of governance as a process of making
   and implementing decisions about the European Capital of Culture (ECOC)
   mega-event. In considering the actors who prepare and realize the event,
   as well as the temporary or permanent societal structures formed around
   it, ECOC governance becomes not merely an issue between the European
   Union on the one hand, and the `branded' cities and their relevant
   national authorities on the other. Rather more creative, mixed
   partnerships emerge transcending spatial-administrative hierarchies,
   initiating co-operation along more horizontal, relational networks.
   Moments of inclusion and exclusion, conflict and cooperation play out in
   the governance of such mega-events, governance processes which are
   therefore contingent, emergent and transient. The study is based on ECOC
   documents, media sources and in-depth interviews with actors engaged in
   the projects. Through a focus on the Hungarian Pecs 2010 and Finnish
   Turku 2011 projects ECOC governance is characterized not only by
   compromises and hard decisions but also by new co-operation, increasing
   social involvement as well as the emerging and resolved conflicts that
   ensue. Besides the analytical accounts of the governance of the two
   projects the research explores the ways and reasons regional governance
   practices are diversified by dissimilar relational processes.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the phenomenology of the ambiguous body, Simone de Beauvoir's
   categories of the subject, the other and the inessential other, and Jean
   Baudrillard's discussions of scandals and simulacrums, this analysis of
   the genocidal rapes in the former Yugoslavia and the International
   Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) judgment that
   condemned them as crimes against humanity, finds that ending this
   military tactic requires that we expose the injustices of current
   gendered meanings of vulnerability. It argues that in affirming the
   dignity of the phenomenological body we discover that human rights
   claims are best understood as protecting the spaces within which our
   embodied life with others is lived.},

Abstract = {This paper decomposes global inequality in redistribution, using data
   from the World Development Indicators data set of the World Bank. It
   finds that per capita income has a modest, yet persistent effect on
   redistribution. More provocatively, the paper also demonstrates that,
   over and beyond the impact of per capita GDP, global inequalities in
   redistribution over the last generation or so strongly reflect the
   double legacies of colonialism (improving the likelihood of
   redistribution in former-colonizer societies and sharply reducing it in
   erstwhilecolonized, recently independent societies). In addition, it
   also finds that the history of recent exposure to state socialism
   increases the presence of redistributive institutions, partly
   counter-balancing the effects of lower national incomes. The data have
   been obtained from the World Bank's online open-access data site World
   Development Indicators, http://data.worldbank.org.},

Abstract = {This article is a response to Anthony King's Women Warriors: Female
   Accession to Ground Combat. King rightly asserts that the accession of
   women to combat roles is a notable historical departure in warfighting.
   He critiques Brownson's conceptual ideal of equivalency as a potentially
   profound force of transformation of gender relations in the military.
   While conceptually progressive, he errs in framing the potential
   transformation within the concept of patriarchy. Further, King is unable
   to recast binary gendered language to acknowledge fully the concept of
   kinship. For females to maximally succeed in the military, and
   particularly in combat roles, patriarchy as the defining explanation for
   male-female interaction must be discarded and the enabling concepts of
   equivalency and kinship must be embraced. The continued strength of
   military organizations and the individuals within them emerges from the
   reciprocity of these two concepts.},

   Parallelism and the Legitimacy Gap},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {523-543},
Abstract = {Recent work has explored how individual and institutional factors affect
   the gap in perceptions of political legitimacy between electoral winners
   and electoral losers, but has ignored the role that the political
   information environment, in general, and ideologically biased media, in
   particular, plays in exacerbating or diminishing this gap. By combining
   individual-level public opinion data in 28 countries, an expert survey
   on media systems, and a variety of country-level indicators, I find that
   higher levels of political parallelism in a country are associated with
   a larger winner-loser gap in institutional trust and satisfaction with
   democracy. The relationship is contingent on whether or not people are
   actually exposed to said media. This research, which links the study of
   political communication with the study of comparative political
   behavior, indicates that the increasing availability of partisan news
   around the world is a cause for concern.},

Abstract = {This article addresses a gap in the scholarly literature. Students of
   militarism do not link the propensity to use force to the broader issue
   of what type of civilian control may restrain the use of force.
   Similarly, even students of civilian control who acknowledge that
   civilian control and military restraint do not necessarily go hand in
   hand have not questioned the extent to which we should decouple the two
   different processes as different modes of control rather than different
   effects of control. A revised conceptualization of civilian control is
   therefore offered that distinguishes between two modes of civilian
   control over military affairs: control of the military, which concerns
   itself primarily with the military organization, and control of
   militarization, which draws on the political discourse in which the
   citizenry plays an active and autonomous role aimed at subjecting the
   decision to use force to a deliberative process that addresses its
   legitimacy.},

Abstract = {In this study, being the first Hungarian qualitative study devoted to
   this subject, we focus on the work-life balance situation of Hungarian
   women acting as main breadwinners within their family. The empirical
   base of our study consisted of 22 in-depth interviews conducted with
   Hungarian mothers of dependent children younger than 14, living in
   (heterosexual) couple households, who bring in at least 60 per cent of
   the total household earnings. We examined how the main breadwinner role
   might affect the gender norm expectations acquired during socialisation,
   the division of domestic labour and child care duties between the
   partners, as well as the internal power relations of the couple.
   According to our findings, various versions of work-life balance
   management could be identified even within our small-scale qualitative
   sample on the basis of two main dimensions. On the one hand, on the
   basis of our interviewees' accounts we examined whether the partners had
   similar role expectations in terms of egalitarian sharing of family
   related tasks or traditionally gendered role specialisation. On the
   other hand, we have also considered to what extent other contextual
   factors contributed to women becoming primary breadwinners, and whether
   these were perceived in terms of external constraints or preferred
   choices (or both). On the basis of our analyses we have identified four
   models of family relations in the context of primary female
   breadwinning: the traditional, the egalitarian, the externally forced
   role reversal and the consciously implemented role reversal models.},

Abstract = {This paper offers a historical micro-level analysis of the impact of
   climate shocks on the incidence of civil conflict in colonial Nigeria
   (1912-1945). Primary historical sources on court cases, prisoners and
   homicides are used to capture conflict. To measure climate shocks we use
   the deviation from long-term rainfall patterns, capturing both drought
   and excessive rainfall. We find a robust and significant curvilinear
   (U-shaped) relationship between rainfall deviations and conflict
   intensity, which tends to be stronger in agroecological zones that are
   least resilient to climatic variability (such as Guinean Savannah) and
   where (pre-) colonial political structures were less centralized. We
   find evidence that the relationship is weaker in areas that specialize
   in the production of export crops (such as cocoa and palm oil) compared
   to subsistence farming areas, suggesting that agricultural
   diversification acts as an insurance mechanism against the whims of
   nature. Additional historical information on food shortages, crop-price
   spikes and outbreaks of violence is used to explore the climate-conflict
   connection in greater detail. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Experimental Evidence},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3},
Pages = {481-502},
Abstract = {Across two studies of race and interracial families in political
   advertising, this article finds that significant benefits accrue to
   Black candidates who present themselves as part of interracial families.
   These findings suggest Black candidates are more likely to succeed when
   they engage in displays of racial novelty, or counter-stereotypical
   behavior, provided that behavior signals closer affinity to White
   voters. For Study 1, we tested four original advertisements for a
   fictitious political candidate, in which we varied only the candidate's
   race and the race of his son. The Black candidate with the White son
   prevailed over all other combinations, with respondents finding him the
   most trustworthy, most qualified for office, most likely to share their
   values, and most likely to care about people like them. For Study 2, we
   tested four new original advertisements for a fictitious Black
   candidate, varying only the candidate's profession and the race of his
   son. We find, again, that Black candidates who display non-Black
   children do significantly better than Black candidates who display
   racially homogeneous families. However, we observe much more modest
   benefits for a Black candidate who practices a racially novel
   profession. We view these results as demonstrating that Black candidates
   are more likely to reap the rewards of racial novelty only when they are
   willing to provide a personal, rather than professional, signal of their
   affinity for Whites. As Study 2 shows, White voters in particular are
   responsive to personal (rather than professional) demonstrations of
   racial novelty. This affirms the logic of New Racism, whereby Blacks are
   looked favorably upon if they exhibit behavior associated with Whites,
   but penalized otherwise.},

Title = {A Geopolitics of the Horse in Finland},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {945-968},
Abstract = {The disregard of animal subjectivity in geopolitics is challenged as
   outdated and arrogant in light of the growing interdisciplinary
   understanding of the relational, dispersed, and co-evolving nature of
   agency. First, the war horse is examined by joining the instrumental
   approach of military history with the emphasis on emotion in animal
   studies. Knowledge about animal subjectivity is expanded by
   demonstrating how the horse itself has co-produced the Finnish
   experience in World War II and the national narrative about this
   conflict. Calculable territory, biopolitical state intervention, the
   political ecology of war, affect, and the body build connections between
   the horse's war and theory, methodology, and concepts in political
   geography and geopolitics. Equine labour and response to the state's
   geopolitically motivated breeding exercises during peace then bridge
   animal studies and critical geopolitics, showing how the horse has
   supported the formation of Finnishness. Finally, a look at contemporary
   mobility, geopolitics of disease, and biometric bordering exemplifies
   how the horse continues to adapt to new roles in Finnish society and
   contribute to human institutions and governance. The examination
   demonstrates the importance of other-than-human beings in the making of
   Finland as a political space and place. Suggestions for further studies
   and data point to opportunity. The article serves those who question
   rigid categorisations and segmentation of research and pedagogy into
   intellectually self-contained islands.},

   mainstream media},

Pages = {142-158},
Abstract = {This paper investigates intermedia agenda setting between old and new
   media platforms through a study of the Norwegian Twitter and mainstream
   media agendas. The study tracks top tweets and headline news, asking
   whether Twitter mainly rehashes mainstream media content or actually
   produces original content. The study finds that Twitter and mainstream
   media are consistent on the salience of many issues, but also that
   Twitter gives attention to issues that are overlooked by mainstream
   media, such as news about environmental challenges and gender equality.
   The paper also suggests that Twitter contributes to an expansion of the
   elite, meaning that it has become an important platform for eloquent and
   media-savvy people outside the traditional political, economic, or
   academic elites.},

Title = {Tax Evasion in the Lab: How Context Affects Tax Compliance},
Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {64},
Number = {5},
Pages = {524-540},
Abstract = {The issue of tax compliance represents one of the topics where
   laboratory experiments may provide important insights into human
   economic decision making. The empirical evidence on the topic is limited
   as the decision on tax evasion is purely private information of the
   taxpayer. The experiment presented in the paper focuses on two main
   topics. At first, we analyze potential influence of two factors
   probability of being caught while cheating on taxes and penalty rate
   imposed on subject who evade. We conclude that behavior of the Czech
   subjects corresponds to foreign results. At the same time, there is a
   stronger effect when probability of being caught increases. The effect
   of increasing penalty rate is rather moderate. Second research question
   focuses on the terminology used during the experiment. We find that the
   rate of tax compliance is higher within experimental sessions where
   subjects face neutral language in the instructions compared to the group
   with loaded instruction (tax language). This behavior contradicts the
   results to date and indicates possible country effect which could be
   linked to specifics of post transformational society.},

Abstract = {It is widely thought that the international community, taken as a whole,
   is required to take action to prevent terrorism. Yet, what each state is
   required to do in this project is unclear and contested. This article
   examines a number of bases on which we might assign responsibilities to
   conduct counterterrorist operations to states. I argue that the ways in
   which other sorts of responsibilities have been assigned to states by
   political philosophers will face significant limitations when used to
   assign the necessary costs of preventing terrorism. I go on to suggest
   that appealing to the principle of fairness-which assigns obligations on
   the basis of benefits received from cooperative endeavours-may be used
   to make up the shortfall, despite this principle having received
   relatively little attention in existing normative accounts of states'
   responsibilities.},

Title = {Securing disunion: Young people's nationalism, identities and (in)
   securities in the campaign for an independent Scotland},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {This paper explores ethnic and religious minority youth perspectives of
   security and nationalism in Scotland during the independence campaign in
   2014. We discuss how young people co-construct narratives of Scottish
   nationalism alongside minority ethnic and faith identities in order to
   feel secure. By critically combining literature from feminist
   geopolitics, international relations (IR) and children's emotional
   geographies, we employ the concept of `ontological security'. The paper
   departs from state centric approaches to security to explore the
   relational entanglements between geopolitical discourses and the
   ontological security of young people living through a moment of
   political change. We examine how everyday encounters with difference can
   reflect broader geopolitical narratives of security and insecurity,
   which subsequently trouble notions of `multicultural nationalism' in
   Scotland and demonstrate ways that youth `securitize the self (Kinnvall,
   2004). The paper responds to calls for empirical analyses of youth
   perspectives on nationalism and security (Benwell, 2016) and on the
   nexus between security and emotional subjectivity in critical
   geopolitics (Pain, 2009; Shaw, Powell, \& De La Ossa, 2014). Funded by
   the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), this paper draws on
   focus group and interview data from 382 ethnic and religious minority
   young people in Scotland collected over the 12 month period of the
   campaign. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {We explain Tullock's puzzle of small payments from special interests to
   policy-makers by the hold-up problem between the two parties. We
   construct a simple lobbying environment where an uninformed policy-maker
   is a price-setter who sells access to two opposed and privately informed
   lobbyists. The key equilibrium property is the curse of the ex ante
   favored lobbyist; the lobbyist proposing a project with the higher
   expected public value ends up worse off than the lobbyist proposing a
   project with the lower expected public value. In the absence of
   contribution caps, the ex ante favored lobbyist strategically devalues
   her project, and the resulting competitive devaluations destroy private
   values, revenues, as well as correlated public values. Ex ante, the
   policy-maker benefits from a binding contribution cap protects the ex
   ante favored lobbyist, eliminates competitive devaluations, and thus
   remedies the hold-up problem.},

Abstract = {Ostracism, the removal of a political leader from ancient Athens for a
   period of ten years without any additional financial sanction or other
   punishment, was an important and rather unique institutional aspect of
   the direct democracy. The present study explains the adoption of
   ostracism as the utility maximizing choice of a self-interested
   constitutional writer-cum-political actor to resolve violent political
   conflict and illustrates that it acted as a type of negative referendum
   on politicians. Using notions from game theory and spatial decision
   modeling, the paper goes on to attribute the infrequent use of ostracism
   to its two-stage decision making process wherein the decisive voter of
   the first stage differed from the decisive voter of the second stage.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis study illuminates the communicative and social qualities
   of naturally occurring public resistance to authoritative debunking of
   political misperceptions, rumors, and conspiracy theories. Developing
   the concept of a rumor community, it highlights aspects of rumoring
   processes overlooked by psychological approaches common in misperception
   research.
   MethodsOver 2,000 user-generated comments from the vaccines cause autism
   rumor community, produced as the medical study that had sparked the
   rumor was retracted and ultimately denounced as fraudulent, are examined
   for their contribution to the public conversation about vaccine safety.
   ResultsRumor community members publicly counterargue debunking messages,
   which creates a communication environment offering argumentative
   resources to community members and reaffirming the community's
   solidarity. Members assert their credibility to gain authority to speak,
   countering science with personal experience. Highlighting their
   interconnection with more conventional social groups and venerable
   social truisms, members generate discourse that legitimates their
   beliefs.
   ConclusionsThe process of rumor debunking does not solely involve
   psychological persuasion but must also account for the social geography
   of rumor communities and their contributions to the communication
   environment.},

Abstract = {Objectives: This article examines whether the descriptive representation
   of race and ethnicity influences how constituents respond to the
   substantive representation of their policy preferences. Hypotheses
   derived from theories of descriptive representation suggest that voters
   may overestimate policy congruence, or downplay its importance, while
   evaluating politicians who look like them. Methods: A unique sample of
   black, Hispanic, and white Americans was asked to evaluate a
   (fictitious) member of the U.S. Congress whose race/ethnicity and policy
   positions are randomly manipulated. Results: Regardless of their actual
   policy positions, blacks perceived greater substantive representation
   from black politicians. Also holding policy congruence constant, whites
   approved of white politicians at distinctly higher rates. Education
   moderates this effect, such that less-educated whites respond more
   negatively to representation by nonwhite legislators. Conclusions: Being
   represented by someone of the same race can diminish accountability for
   legislators' substantive records, an important cost of descriptive
   representation.},

Abstract = {Digital technologies have struggled to achieve more equal participation
   in politics, the so-called ``unresolved dilemma of democracy.{''}
   Previous research has emphasized the drivers of involvement in digital
   politics from an individual perspective, but studies looking at the
   general prerequisites of online engagement in politics are lacking. Not
   much attention has been directed toward the supply side, namely the
   online presence of political actors and the structures created by them.
   Applying a mixed-method design, this article examines the supply of
   channels for digital politics distributed by Swedish municipalities.
   Quantitative data collected from municipality websites are used for both
   a description and explanation of the varying opportunities for
   involvement encountered by Swedish citizens as a result of where they
   live. Two extreme cases are then examined in depth in which
   preconditions for involvement are particularly weak. We find that
   significant variation exists between municipalities and that these
   patterns are explained primarily by population size, but also by
   economic conditions and education levels. The cases show how a lack of
   policies and unenthusiastic politicians creates poor possibilities for
   development. The findings also verify previous notions that without
   demand from citizens, in combination with internal ambition from
   politicians, successful provision of services for digital politics will
   be hard to achieve.},

Abstract = {In barely two years the jurisdiction of Responsabilidades Politicas
   became a state-wide problem. A mountain of unresolved cases with pending
   bureaucratic procedures were accumulated in courts. This paper seeks to
   look into the contributing factors in the rapid collapse of this special
   jurisdiction in the province of Valencia until the reform in 1942. In
   order to this end, this paper analyze the creation and the interventions
   of competent bodies in Ley de Responsabilidades Politicas' first phase;
   especially focus is put on three stages of the process: the Court order,
   the commencement of the judicial proceedings and the examination of the

Title = {Local institutional quality and conflict violence in Africa},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {53},
Pages = {30-42},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {All politics is local. In spite of this familiar dictum, most studies
   that have investigated how institutions shape the conditions for
   violence and peace have focused on national institutions, and neglected
   the local dimension. This paper investigates the effects of high-quality
   local political institutions on the location of violence in internal
   conflicts in Africa, demonstrating that the quality of local political
   institutions matters even when the characteristics of national
   institutions are accounted for. We combine georeferenced survey data
   from the Afrobarometer surveys with georeferenced conflict data,
   allowing us to study the links between institutional quality at the
   subnational level and the occurrence of conflict-related violence.
   Crucially, we find that administrative districts with high-quality local
   government institutions are less likely to experience violence in an
   internal conflict than poorly governed districts. This relationship
   holds when controlling for a number of relevant factors like economic
   development, demographics, political opinions, urbanization and
   country-fixed effects. We also use matching techniques to improve
   inference, finding rather robust indications that local institutional
   quality pacifies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   international egalitarian obligations},
Journal = {ETHICS \& GLOBAL POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUN 6},
Abstract = {To whom do we owe obligations of socio-economic justice? How are such
   obligations generated? Internationalism denotes a range of approaches to
   these questions. This paper examines Andrea Sangiovanni's{*}-an
   internationalist{*} response to these questions. Sangiovanni argues that
   we owe egalitarian obligations only to those in the state, and that
   egalitarian obligations are generated through relationships of
   `reciprocity'. His is a `reciprocity-based internationalism' (RBI). RBI
   has two components-one normative and another empirical. In this paper, I
   will assume the normative component, but reject its empirical component.
   My rejection of the empirical component has normative implications for
   RBI, which generate egalitarian obligations beyond the state. In other
   words, my revision of RBI is an argument in favour of international
   egalitarian obligations not generated through cosmopolitanism, but
   through internationalism.},

Abstract = {Objective. Brands communicate information to consumers about a good or
   service. As school-choice policies become more widespread and more
   parents are faced with the task of choosing a school for their child,
   schools may be branding themselves to differentiate themselves from
   other schools. This article seeks to determine whether schools possess
   name brands that influence the choices of parents. Methods. We use
   multinomial logit to model the relationship between the educational
   preferences and the selection of schools for 2,600 parents participating
   in a large, urban private school voucher program. Results. We find that
   parental choices are systematic. Parents who value particular school
   characteristics tend to choose schools with brands that espouse those
   characteristics. Conclusion. These findings are consistent with the
   hypothesis that schools carry brands that communicate information to
   parents who then use the brands to help them select schools for their
   children.},

Abstract = {A central question in political economy is whether decision-making in
   representative democracies is biased towards local public investments or
   other types of policies which have locally concentrated benefits. The
   model by Weingast et al. (1981) predicts that a legislature with members
   from different areas will spend more in total on local public goods when
   the geographic constituency of each member is small. I test this
   prediction using panel data on the 18 Norwegian regional councils,
   exploiting that the geographic allocation of regional council seats
   varies considerably over time. Consistent with the theory, I find robust
   evidence that investments in regional public roads are lower when many
   council members come from the more populated areas in the region. This
   gives a more direct test of the prediction by Weingast et al. (1981)
   than existing empirical evidence, which concerns the relationship
   between public spending and legislature size. I find similar but less
   robust results for the maintenance of existing roads. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {According to the political opportunity structure (POS) framework,
   mobilization tends to intensify when channels of access to the
   authorities open, leading the protest actors to hope for success. This
   happened during the protest campaign aimed at the reopening of the
   occupied Social Centre Experia' in Catania (Italy), after the eviction
   by police, because unexpectedly moderate centre-left political actors
   supported mobilization and the centre-right local government accepted to
   put the issue on the institutional agenda; nevertheless the social
   centre was not reopened. In order to explain why the mobilization was
   unsuccessful, we analysed the protest campaign combining the POS
   framework with the approach to strategic dilemmas by James Jasper; if
   opportunities and restraints of the political system influence the
   choices and behaviours of unconventional actors, in their turn the
   actions and decisions made by movement activists affect the POS. In this
   case, the social centre activists filtered the constraints and
   opportunities of the local political system through their cognitive
   lenses and faced some dilemmas (Naughty or Nice?, Extension, Shifting
   goals), whose strategic choices extended or reduced these constraints
   and opportunities, thus affecting the opening and closure of the POS.
   The failure of the solution attempted by the social centre activists to
   keep both options of the various dilemmas, i.e. the strategy of double
   track', demonstrates how it is very difficult to be successful by
   maintaining dilemmas rather than making the strategic choices they
   demand, when the local institutional POS is substantially closed.},

Abstract = {The past decade has witnessed an explosion of interest in the partisan
   polarization of the American electorate. Scholarly investigation of this
   topic has coincided with the media's portrayal of a polity deeply
   divided along partisan lines. Yet little research so far has considered
   the consequences of the media's coverage of political polarization. We
   show that media coverage of polarization increases citizens' beliefs
   that the electorate is polarized. Furthermore, the media's depiction of
   a polarized electorate causes voters to moderate their own issue
   positions but increases their dislike of the opposing party. These
   empirical patterns are consistent with our theoretical argument that
   polarized exemplars in journalistic coverage serve as anti-cues to media
   consumers. Our findings have important implications for understanding
   current and future trends in political polarization.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on Carl von Clausewitz's ideas regarding
   civil-military relations and in particular how those ideas relate to
   Samuel Huntington's models of objective and subjective civilian control.
   Huntington believed that Clausewitz supplied the foundation for his
   concept of objective control. Yet an examination of Clausewitz's own
   experiences, as well as his theoretical writings, rejects the basic
   tenants of objective control: a politically neutral military, the
   separation of political from military considerations during the
   professional officer's analytical processes, and the reliance on the
   professional military as opposed to the citizen soldier. Instead,
   Clausewitz embraced something similar to Huntington's concept of
   subjective control and with it a fusionist model of civil-military
   relations.},

Abstract = {This article attempts to shed light on Israel's civil-military relations
   by employing the public's trust in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) as a
   key parameter. The study is based on a series of public opinion polls
   conducted between 2001 and 2010, during periods of military
   confrontation as well as periods of relative quiet. The findings show
   that despite increased criticism toward the IDF and claims by
   researchers, the Jewish-Israeli public's trust in the IDF generally
   remains very high and stable and strengthens significantly when the
   cannons start to roar. We also found a fixed pattern of change in public
   opinion during low-intensity conflicts. In a comparative perspective,
   the findings suggest that the rally `round the flag effect is relevant
   in the Israeli case both in conventional war and in limited conflicts.
   Moreover, the findings indicate that the public's trust in the army is
   not a uniform perception but a complex one that may have different and
   sometimes conflicting facets.},

Abstract = {In this article I explore how geographers might go about studying the
   everyday contexts of police power, given specifically the emphasis today
   in political geography on the practice of state power. Rather than
   endorse police practice as a relatively accessible and straightforward
   realm for researchers, I emphasize instead the uneventful and sometimes
   disappearing aspects of police work which makes it hard to excavate and
   interrogate, especially for non-police. Reflecting on various fieldwork
   experiences, I argue that the basic methodological tools that
   geographers have at their disposal to bring down the `blue wall' of
   police practices can do the opposite: produce a tentative mode of
   knowledge which grasps, qualitatively and quantitatively, at the problem
   of the social and force relations of policing. I conclude that rather
   than a fix to the cruddiness of police power, accepted qualitative and
   quantitative methodologies constitute the `blue wall' of police
   practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a new approach to the comparative analysis of
   multilevel governance (MLG). Using water governance in North America as
   an illustrative example, it advances an innovative approach for
   scrutinizing the varieties of actor constellations in multilevel
   settings. While MLG is commonly conceptualized rather broadly as a
   system, we define MLG instead as an instance of a specific actor
   configuration that can rigorously be distinguished from other
   configurations, most notably intergovernmental relations (IGR). With
   this more conceptually bounded classification, we suggest that scholars
   can now more fruitfully engage in systematic analyses of MLG and IGR
   across different types of political systems (e.g. unitary, federal and
   supranational). Our hope is that this paper will provide some much
   needed conceptual and analytical clarification to an increasingly
   nebulous debate on what MLG actually is and what it means for students
   of political science, public policy and public administration.},

   Typicality for Vote Choice},

Abstract = {Facial cues are consequential for voters' behavior at the polls. Yet the
   facial cues that are associated with vote choice remain under-examined.
   We predicted that vote choice judgments rely, in part, on the sex
   typicality of facial cues (i.e., the degree of facial masculinity and
   femininity) that vary as a function of candidate gender and partisan
   identification. Stimuli included image pairs of winners and runners-up
   in the elections for the 111th U.S. House of Representatives. In Study
   1, we found that female Republican candidates who appeared relatively
   more feminine and male Republican candidates who looked relatively less
   masculine in their appearance were more likely to win their election.
   Democratic candidates' electoral success was not related to their sex
   typicality. In Study 2, we found that relatively masculine-appearing
   Democrats and feminine-appearing Republicans were more likely to be
   selected in a hypothetical vote choice task. Implications for U.S.
   partisan politics are discussed.},

Title = {Politics of Precarious Childhood: Ill Treatment of Palestinian Children
   under the Israeli Military Order},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},

Volume = {21},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {This paper examines the corollaries of the exceptional treatment of
   Palestinian children under the Israeli military rule. It is shown how
   the widespread and systematic ill treatment of Palestinian children
   accrues from exceptional provisions and lack of legal cover of the
   Israeli military law. Such lack constitutes a precarious condition under
   which Palestinian children are not treated as children but as a security
   threat legally accountable for their acts, in many respects with ways
   similar to adults. Precarity, the paper argues, is produced through
   three conditions. First, the lack of protection is institutionalised
   through the legal, territorial and population-regulating techniques
   internal to state channels. Second, the lack of protection delegates
   significant power to the discretion of what Judith Butler calls the
   `petty sovereigns' - to the soldiers, interrogators, police officers,
   etc., who are asked to rely on their own judgment when making decisions
   on the fundamental matters regarding the order and justice, even life
   and death of children. Third, the use of discretionary power is not only
   encouraged by the legal system and its exceptions; it also works in
   tandem with the institutional culture of impunity that accepts the
   violent disciplining, even torture, of Palestinian children.},

Title = {The Contingency of Voter Learning: How Election Debates Influenced
   Voters' Ability and Accuracy to Position Parties in the 2010 Dutch
   Election Campaign},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},

Abstract = {Election campaigns are expected to inform voters about parties' issue
   positions, thereby increasing voters' ability to influence future policy
   and thus enhancing the practice of democratic government. We argue that
   campaign learning is not only contingent on voters' characteristics and
   different sources of information, but also on how parties communicate
   their issue positions in election debates. We combine a two-wave panel
   survey with content analysis data of three televised election debates.
   In cross-classified multilevel auto-regression models we examine the
   influence of these debates in the 2010 Dutch parliamentary election
   campaign on voters' knowledge of the positions of eight parties on three
   issues. The Dutch multiparty system allows us to separate voters'
   ability to position parties from their accuracy in ordering these
   parties. We reach three main conclusions. First, this study shows that
   voters become more able and accurate during the campaign. However, these
   campaign learning effects erode after the elections. Second, whereas
   voters' attention to campaigns consistently contributes to their ability
   to position parties, its effect on accuracy is somewhat less consistent.
   Third, televised election debates contribute to what voters learn.
   Parties that advocate their issue positions in the debates stimulate
   debate viewers' ability to position these parties on these issues. In
   the face of the complexity of campaigns and debates in multiparty
   systems, campaigns are more likely to boost voters' subjective ability
   to position parties than their accuracy.},

Abstract = {The experimental evidence suggests that groups are inefficient at
   providing threshold public goods. This inefficiency appears to reflect
   an inability to coordinate over how to distribute the cost of providing
   the good. So, why do groups not just split the cost equally? We offer an
   answer to this question by demonstrating that in a standard threshold
   public good game there is no collectively rational recommendation. We
   also demonstrate that if full agreement is required in order to provide
   the public good then there is a collectively rational recommendation,
   namely, to split the cost equally. Requiring full agreement may,
   therefore, increase efficiency in providing threshold public goods. We
   test this hypothesis experimentally and find support for it.},

Abstract = {I argue that the specter haunting multiculturalism is
   incommensurability. In many discussions of multiculturalism there is a
   `picture' that holds us captive - a picture of cultures, religious or
   ethnic groups that are self-contained and are incommensurably radical
   with each other. I explore and critique this concept of
   incommensurability. I trace the idea of incommensurability back to the
   discussion by Thomas Kuhn; and especially to the ways in which his views
   were received. Drawing on Gadamer's understanding of hermeneutics, I
   argue that the very idea of radical incommensurability is incoherent.
   This does not entail an abstract universalism but rather sensitivity to
   the ways in which all languages and cultures are in principle open to
   the real possibility of enlarging one's vision and mutually
   understanding.},

Volume = {5},
Pages = {1-5},
Abstract = {The ambitious and normative expansion of the remit of ``security{''} as
   both policy and practice risks being as difficult to focus and
   prioritize as to implement. In Southeast Asia, threats and impediments
   to ``human security{''} are part of the daily lived experiences of large
   numbers of people. They live in vulnerable and precarious circumstances
   ({''}human insecurities{''}) that are largely beyond their immediate
   control. Yet, this is not a set of ``insecurities{''} that is readily
   understood or measurable. There is a complex nexus of interrelated
   conditioning factors and interests underlying them. The following volume
   attempts to address the latter problem by giving voice to a broad
   spectrum of views and diversity of experiences which in turn articulates
   the varying consequences of ``human insecurities{''} particular to
   Southeast Asia. By contextualizing ``human insecurities{''} and locating
   them conceptually within relationships of risk, uncertainty, safety and
   trust, the volume's contributions bring grounded but critical reflection
   on the ways in which we approach the study of ``human insecurities{''}
   in Southeast Asia and how some of these might be ameliorated.},

   versus proportionality},
Journal = {ETHICS \& GLOBAL POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {1-16},
Abstract = {Current views on global justice often hold that affluent states are
   under at least two duties: a duty to reduce socioeconomic inequalities
   at home and a duty to reduce extreme poverty abroad. Potential duty
   conflicts deriving from resource scarcity can be solved in broadly two
   principled ways. The `lexical' principle requires all disputed resources
   to be allocated to the weightiest duty. The `proportionality' principle
   requires resources to be distributed between the two duties according to
   their relative weight (the weightiest duty receives the largest resource
   share, but the less weighty duty receives a share too). I argue that the
   proportionality principle is morally preferable. I show that it is
   sensitive to a number of factors that are intuitively relevant when
   solving duty conflicts: the number of affected individuals, the size of
   the benefits each individual could get, and the time it could take to
   eventually comply with the less weighty duty. Some argue that the
   lexical principle should nevertheless be preferred because domestic
   egalitarian duties are duties of justice, and they are therefore
   lexically prior to mere humanitarian duties to reduce global poverty. I
   reject this view by showing that duties of justice are not necessarily
   lexically prior to humanitarian duties, and that (even if they were)
   duties to reduce global poverty can be regarded as duties of justice
   too.},

Booktitle = {DEMOCRACY, CULTURE, CATHOLICISM: VOICES FROM FOUR CONTINENTS},
Year = {2016},
Pages = {134-148},
Abstract = {Can the lessons learned from the encounters between democracy, culture,
   and Catholicism have a ripple effect upon, or serve as models for, the
   encounters between democracy, culture, and other religious identities?
   In this note, and in the light of the analysis of democracy, culture,
   and Catholicism in Indonesia, we hear from two scholars who attempt to
   answer this question from the Muslim perspective. This is a perspective
   that, not unlike Catholicism, is often perceived to be incompatible with
   democracy and democratization. At a time when the contemporary Muslim
   world is dealing, every day, with struggles between movements to
   democratize and the faith claims of Islam, this conversation could not
   be more timely, and the lessons that might be learned from the Catholic
   experience could not be more important.
   Marcia Hermansen looks to the Catholic Church and its encounters with
   democracy, particularly in the recent history of the Catholic Church,
   for examples from which the Muslim world can learn about navigating
   these inevitable encounters. Noting that Catholics have held both
   minority and majority positions in different democratic countries,
   Hermansen argues that the history of Catholic engagements with democracy
   can be a model for the Muslim world as it continues to deliberate over
   whether or not democracy is the most appropriate political system for it
   to embrace. Through an analysis of the practice of reserving seats for
   religious minorities in government bodies, and an analysis of how this
   practice affects the identities of said minorities, Hermansen suggests
   that, in the wake of the Catholic experience, Muslim countries can
   responsibly and faithfully envision the possibility of creating
   alter/native democracies.
   Russell Powell focuses on the experience of democracy in the nation of
   Turkey, a Muslim nation with a strictly secular constitution. In looking
   to Turkey and the recent legal and political shifts that have taken
   place there, particularly regarding the type of secularism they practice
   and the rise of religiously inspired political parties, Powell suggests
   that the possibility of a shift in Turkey from an assertive secularism
   (e.g., the French model) to a more passive form of secularism (e.g., the
   United States model) might actually have a positive effect on Turkish
   politics and the Turkish people. The dangers, however, that religiously
   motived political parties present to democracy cannot be underestimated.
   In the end, religion can have a transformative, prophetic voice in
   secular society if it continues, as it has in some strands of Catholic
   and Muslim thought, to emphasize authenticity and justice within the
   structures of democratic governments.},

Abstract = {the purpose of this article is to analyse the role played by organized
   political violence in pre-1914 Europe, with special regard to labour
   conflicts, through an analysis of the social composition and the
   practices of four movements which deliberately resorted to armed
   organization: the Somaten in Catalonia (Spain), the Jaunes trade union
   in the French Departement du Nord, and the Citizen Patrols and agrarian
   squads in the Province of Bologna (Italy). Despite their different
   origins and contexts, these movements pursued similar political
   strategies based upon the deliberate use of violence and guns, and
   shared anti-socialist, authoritarian and anti-democratic purposes.
   Analysis of their practices and political cultures enables us to
   evaluate the nature of the democratic processes in pre-1914 Europe and
   also helps to contextualize and understand the political and social
   violence which came to the fore after the end of the war in 1918.},

Abstract = {The latest financial crisis has led to significant changes in the
   central bank's monetary policies. They have tried to respond by
   expansionary monetary policy in the different forms. We analyze if
   commercial and other banks use a higher quantity of reserves in order to
   increase granting of loans into the economy. Analysis is focused on the
   tendencies in money and credit multipliers. There are four analysed
   economics during the period 2008-2014: Czech Republic, European Monetary
   Union, Great Britain and the USA. No surprise that multipliers had
   tendencies to decline, especially from high values in the Great Britain
   and the USA. Development was quite surprising in the EMU, where all
   multipliers were very stable. We have observed the biggest exceptions in
   the USA, and the Czech Republic, respectively. Money multiplier of M1 is
   still less than 1 in the USA. Czech Republic is specific according to
   the values of credit multiplier. They are lower than values of money
   multiplier of M2, and even lower than multiplier of M1 since 2012. The
   most likely reasons for all trends are presented in the article.},

Title = {Is centralization a solution to the soft budget constraint problem?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {45},
Pages = {57-75},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper focuses on the centralization program implemented in Israel
   in 2004 to analyze whether the administrative subordination of
   municipalities is an effective policy to deal with problems related to
   soft-budget constraint of lower level governments. The results
   consistently show, for different specifications and samples of
   municipalities, that this program brought a substantial decrease of
   municipalities' expenditures (mostly because of decreases in salary
   payments), and an increase of local property tax collection. Our
   analysis shows that all of the fiscal impact of the program is due to
   the appointment of an accountant that reports directly to the central
   government, a relatively mild form of administrative subordination. In
   contrast, more intrusive forms of subordination, like the central
   imposition of a recovery program, do not result in any substantial
   improvement of municipalities' fiscal situation. This leads us to
   conclude that a mild form of administrative subordination is an
   effective tool to cope with problems related to soft-budget constraints,
   whereas political subordination is not an effective tool to reach that
   goal. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article aims at explaining religious actors' influence on
   democratic transition in Mali (1987-1992). It argues that it takes more
   than political theology to effectively influence democratization
   processes. Although Muslim actors used their political theology during
   democratization, they had neither the organizational means nor the
   legitimization to convince others of their preferences for a
   post-authoritarian institutional set-up. They had very limited influence
   on the institutions that today are supposed to regulate the relations
   between religion and the state under democratic rule. In fact, this high
   path-dependency of institutional factors since the colonial era led to
   an informalization of non-liberal Muslim politics in the 2000s. It is
   likely that accepting Muslim actors' demands for institutionalized
   cooperation between the state and religion during democratic transition
   would have caused fewer problems for democracy in the long run. The
   article concludes with general lessons for the study of religion in
   democratization.},

Abstract = {This paper assesses the perceived individual psychological costs of
   adhering to the Euro. We use the difference-in-differences approach
   (DD), comparing individual levels of satisfaction with the economy in
   Slovakia immediately before and after the introduction of the Euro, with
   similar individuals in neighboring Czech Republic, which did not adopt
   the Euro. Both countries were economically and politically integrated
   for decades, and display similar macroeconomic behavior before and after
   the currency change in Slovakia. What we assess is not the actual,
   economic, costs stemming from the Euro adoption, but the change in
   utility as perceived by the individuals. There is evidence of
   substantial psychological costs associated with currency transition,
   especially for the old, the unemployed, the poorly educated and
   households with children. Our results are robust to the use of
   alternative control groups and to estimation procedures using the DD
   matching approach. The significant perceived costs uncovered in this
   paper suggest policy-makers should not ignore them when considering a
   sweeping economic change such as the adoption of a new currency.},

Abstract = {In the United Kingdom, as in several other countries, increasing life
   expectancy is leading to a shift in the age distribution of the
   population. Meanwhile, at the level of individuals, spending patterns
   change as people age. This paper investigates the extent to which
   demographic change is likely to affect household spending patterns by
   combining the techniques of dynamic microsimulation with an imputation
   method known as random assignment. While there has been significant
   concern about the economic cost of the ageing population, this paper
   finds a potentially beneficial effect in the form of an increase in
   total spending for most expenditure categories.},

Abstract = {We argue that personal religiosity and political religiosity are
   distinct attributes of a political candidate. Personal religiosity
   reflects a candidate's level of personal religious commitment and
   political religiosity reflects the candidate's policy regarding
   separating versus blending religion and politics. The paradoxical
   religiosity hypothesis predicts that, within a democracy, personal
   religiosity will increase voters' endorsement of a candidate whereas
   political religiosity will decrease voters' endorsement. We test this
   hypothesis comparatively in two experiments, one performed within a
   long-standing democracy containing predominantly Christian voters (the
   United States), and the other within a more recent democracy containing
   predominantly Muslim voters (Indonesia). We demonstrate the robustness
   of the paradoxical religiosity effect and its persistence across the two
   countries, suggesting that Muslim Indonesians are no less capable than
   Christian Americans in separating the sacred and the secular.},

Abstract = {Since the fall of the monarchy in 1931 and until the late 1940s, the
   Spanish aristocracy actively participated in monarchist circles that
   sought to restore the Bourbon dynasty on the throne. As part of this
   policy, the nobility articulated a coherent program with their nature as
   a status group, which sought to preserve the old liberal order,
   safeguard elites versus mass society and eliminate the double menace of
   democracy and ``social demagogy{''}. However, aristocratic politics went
   beyond a simple counter revolutionary formula and saw in corporatism a
   perfect solution to bring harmony among social actors.},

   mixed duopoly in which a firm is able to select the market in which it
   intends to develop its activity (here, national market or foreign
   market) and we identify two effects, namely regulatory effect and
   structural effect, whose combination explains several results. We first
   show that the setting up of a nationalization policy is locally
   efficient only for high levels of horizontal product differentiation
   degree in the national market. We secondly highlight that such a policy
   is nevertheless likely to introduce market distortions and lead to
   suboptimal outcomes in a rather united economic framework.},

Abstract = {This article explores the key to the successful mobilization process of
   the Trianon demonstration, organized by local Hungarians in Melbourne's
   CBD in 2005. I argue that mobilization-countermobilization (hereafter
   MCM) dynamics holds the key to the understanding of the relatively high
   number of protest participants. In particular, I argue that we need to
   take a closer look at the dialogic framing activities within the MCM
   dynamics in order to understand this case of mobilization. It was not
   until a particular form of frame developed within the MCM interplay
   between the organizers and the protest opposition that the mobilization
   attempts gained a clear local focus and target. Equally importantly, it
   is argued that emotions, embedded in and as a reaction to particular
   framings, significantly contributed to the success of the mobilization.
   The article shows that as a response to the CM framing toward the end of
   the mobilization process, a strong moral outrage was generated and felt,
   which allowed the supporters to focus their blame and anger on their
   opponents and to create a particularly resonant enemy figure.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the legitimation dynamics of the student protests in
   Chile 2011, explaining how the support of strangers' strengthened its
   position and endurance. By analysing interviews with both activists and
   uninvolved citizens, I describe a steady pattern whereby they express
   the strength and legitimacy of the movement by assessing the
   abstraction' of the link between protesters and their supporters. The
   more abstract these relations - the stranger supporters are - the most
   relevant and meaningful is their support. Beyond establishing the
   worthiness of protesters' claims, strangers provide protesters with a
   mandate, fostering the movement's cohesion and thus affecting its
   ability to endure through the conflict. While the literature has mostly
   looked at adherents as only potential (or failed) constituents, I argue
   that support that remains external plays a crucial role in social
   movements' chances of success. This support needs, however, to avoid
   being framed as insufficient engagement. Further analysis shows that the
   distinction between protesters and strangers often requires active
   boundary work, allowing the movement to maximize the benefits of
   strangers' support while managing its risks. The relation between these
   boundaries, the efficiency of different contention tactics and their
   adaptation is analysed here. The study argues that strangeness can
   involve very different, even opposed phenomena, which are often
   confounded, namely otherness' and abstraction'. Critically drawing upon
   Simmel, I explain how it is abstraction' in particular that helps our
   understanding of the role of strangers in social movements and consider
   how this distinction could enrich research on the symbolic aspects of
   contentious politics.},

Abstract = {Words are believed to be indicators of the values that are important to
   politicians and an impressive amount of empirical research has analyzed
   variations in language use. While it is generally accepted that there
   are value differences between Democrats and Republicans, the extent to
   which these differences are reflected in word usage has been theorized
   but is largely untested. The connection between values and language is,
   theoretically, not limited just to politicians, but should be especially
   evident among politicians as representatives of existing ideological
   poles. In this article, we examine elite rhetoric through the lens of
   four value-centered theoretical frameworks (Lakoff's Parenting Styles
   model, Moral Foundations Theory, Schwartz's Values Theory, and Motivated
   Social Cognition Theory). Contrary to the expectations posited by these
   four theories, we find little reliable evidence of value-related
   language differences between Democratic and Republican politicians. Our
   findings suggest that, at least when it comes to elite rhetoric, widely
   accepted theoretical claims about the value-based nature of political
   language and political differences are not consistently supported by
   empirical analysis.},

Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},

Volume = {167},
Number = {1-2},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The logic of expressive voting implies that some will find voting for a
   government policy more appealing the more costly it is. This result is
   consistent with public opinion polls and the trajectory of government
   spending. And it adds to the ability of rational voter ignorance and
   apathy to explain the latitude politicians have to ignore the cost they
   impose on taxpayers without losing votes. The appeal of higher costs to
   voters makes it easier for organized-interest groups to exploit the good
   intentions of voters by capturing private advantage and sabotaging the
   hopes upon which those good intentions are based. The appeal higher
   costs have for some voters also suggests another way bootleggers can
   benefit from the moral cover Baptists provide for their rent-seeking
   activities. We also point out that expressive voting implies that there
   is no reason for believing that the special-interest activity that
   sabotages the moral intentions of voters are in general any less moral
   than morally motivated voters.},

Number = {2},

Abstract = {Recent studies have examined how the conventions of cultural genres help
   advance frames. This line of scholarship can be used to study how
   activists might popularize radical frames that fundamentally challenge
   widespread beliefs. In this article, I analyze how the gendered
   character of suffrage community cookbooks aids in frame alignment. I
   determine how these cookbooks advance `femininity frames' that drew on
   widespread beliefs about femininity (and thus were more likely to
   resonate with a broad audience). I also examine how suffrage cookbooks
   advance `republican citizenship frames' that argued that women should
   vote because they could embody the masculinized republican ideals of
   civic virtue and public responsibility. Republican citizenship frames
   challenged widespread beliefs about femininity (and thus were likely to
   be viewed as more radical). I find that the embrace of domestic
   femininity in community cookbooks amplifies femininity frames by
   intensifying traditional beliefs about women. Furthermore, the gendered
   character of community cookbooks extends republican citizenship frames
   to the average housewife by proving that women could incorporate new
   practices into their lives without abandoning their traditional feminine
   roles. This study enriches our understanding of the roles of cultural
   genres in framing, and it demonstrates how activists may try to
   popularize radical frames.},

   for Palestinian Jordanians},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {69-91},

Abstract = {In this paper, I delve into the complex ways in which Palestine is
   conceptualised as both a concrete and amorphous territory through an
   examination of the everyday practices of displaying images and imagining
   Palestine. Building from fieldwork conducted with Palestinian
   Jordanians, I analyse and contextualise images and maps of Palestine
   that they display in their homes and communities. I complicate what
   these images seem to represent with insights from interviews I conducted
   about how they spatially imagine Palestine. Throughout the paper I show
   that images and imaginings of Palestine are quite diverse and have
   various territorial meanings. Yet, as varied and seemingly different as
   these images and imaginings may be, they are nevertheless intimately
   linked through territorial discourses of displacement and rootedness, as
   well as through the everyday practices of remembering and resistance.
   Thus, I contribute to recent scholarship within geopolitics by
   highlighting (1) the value of examining images and imaginings of
   everyday geopolitics in tandem with one another, (2) the complex and
   fluid ways in which territory configures into everyday geopolitics, and
   (3) that amorphous notions of territory need to be integrated into work
   on territory more broadly.},

Abstract = {Asymetric regulation in networks industries have impacted regulatory and
   competitive contexts. Questions of economic efficiency, collusion or
   fundings of sunk stranded costs go with asymetric regulation. Thus,
   regulators must adapt their policies to internalise these questions and
   to maximise the welfare. We show with a Cournot model regulators could
   fund sunk stranded costs, keeping allocative efficiency constant.
   Positive results on welfare rely on incumbent's efficiency and on prices
   of alternative supplies.},

Abstract = {Many experts claim that religious cleavages are one of the major reasons
   for suicide attacks. To test this hypothesis, we investigate whether the
   total number of suicide attacks per violent conflict and the annual
   number of suicide attacks per country are associated with simmering
   religious conflicts. We distinguish between two kinds of religious
   cleavages: cleavages at the macro level between the groups engaged in
   violent conflicts and cleavages at the micro or battlefield level
   between the actual perpetrators and victims of suicide attacks. Our
   results do not indicate that religious cleavages are an important
   precondition for the incidence of suicide attacks over the period
   1981-2010.},

Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {64},
Number = {3},
Pages = {245-263},
Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to quantify the implementation lag of
   discretionary fiscal policy in the Czech Republic between 1997 and 2013.
   Based on a unique dataset created for this study, the length and
   structure of implementation lag is analysed. Dataset is extending the
   original dataset used by the Czech National Bank. This study further
   analyses factors with an impact on implementation lag. Implementation
   lag is the length of period between decision of the economic policy
   makers on the actual response to the fundamental change in the economy
   and implementation of this response to the legislation. Average
   implementation lag of discretionary fiscal policy in the Czech Republic
   is 2.4 quarters. The greatest deal counts for the implementation lag in
   the Chamber of Deputies. Length of implementation lag of discretionary
   fiscal policy is influenced especially by the total occupancy of the
   Chamber of Deputies, majority, which the government parties have in the
   Parliament, and the frequency of the veto power usage.},

Journal = {ARMED FORCES \& SOCIETY},

Volume = {42},
Number = {1},
Pages = {51-74},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The implications for funding a military, though important, are still not
   fully understood. Existing work often surmises that military spending is
   higher in majoritarian electoral systems that are predicated on
   personalistic ties. However, further examination casts doubt upon these
   findings. Accordingly, we present a pooled time-series cross-sectional
   analysis of military spending and electoral institutions and we find
   that party-based electoral systems, rather than majoritarian ones,
   foment higher military spending levelswhich we attribute to these
   systems' predilection for public goods spending. These results are
   robust even when a host of control measures and four different military
   spending metrics are employed.},

Abstract = {Does social-media usage (e.g. Twitter) influence candidates' number of
   votes? Recent studies have shown that a modest impact might exist.
   However, these studies used data on elections in which only a limited
   group of politicians used Twitter. In such a context it was easy for a
   candidate to stand out. It remains to be seen whether the effect holds
   in times of widespread usage. This study compares a low-usage with a
   widespread-usage election, the Dutch 2010 and 2012 national elections
   respectively. It utilizes unique data on all 1024 candidates of the
   `large' parties. Interestingly, even in the context of widespread
   Twitter usage we still find a positive association between Twitter use

Abstract = {Examination of the so called political business cycle, that is, the
   possibility of a macroeconomic cycle induced by the political cycle
   (i.e. macroeconomic cycle induced by the political cycle) provides
   little evidence in empirical studies. The empirical evidence of
   statistically significant increase in the economic activity before
   election is especially a matter of less developed countries. There is a
   shift in focus to the examination of the political budget cycle in case
   of the developed economies. This paper examines the presence of
   conditional political budget cycle (PBC) in the OECD countries using
   data from all 34 member states over the period 1995-2012. We suppose
   that the conditionality of the PBC depends on the credibility and
   transparency of the fiscal policy. The dynamic panel linear regression
   model is used in this article. Generalized method of moments (GMM) with
   instrumental variables (IV) is used for estimating parameters in this
   model. Three important results emerge: First, there is a PBC in the OECD
   countries. Second, the PBC in OECD countries strongly depends on
   credibility and transparency of fiscal policy. Third, the shape of the
   PBC in the OECD countries indicates that there is an immediate fiscal
   restriction after the elections.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article is to describe effects of selected institutional
   factors on structural and cyclical unemployment. The theoretical and
   methodological basis of institutional aspects of the labour market
   functioning draws from a number of previously published studies. Factors
   are modified for national conditions of the Visegrad Group (hereinafter
   V4). The article compares NAIRU estimates of previously fine-tuned
   models with estimates of models extended by selected institutional
   factors. The difference between these groups will then be compared with
   development of relevant variables of the real economy. That will allow
   us to determine whether the institutional factor influenced structural
   or cyclical unemployment. We will also specify the intensity of its
   negative influence on the two types of unemployment. The final results
   of the analysis are compared with results of previous studies and world
   literature data.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this essay is to renew the study of the political
   from a phenomenological point of view through a comparison of the
   thought of John Wild and Emmanuel Levinas. This paper emphasizes
   similarities between the two thinkers as well as differences. It
   concludes with a case study of the practical application of
   phenomenology to politics. It does so by exploring some of the political
   dimensions of the life-world responsible for the election of Senator
   Bernard Sanders (I-VT) to his previous position as Mayor of Burlington,
   Vermont. Sanders appointed Sugarman as ``Commissioner of Reality{''}
   upon his election in 1981. The author wishes to point out that this was
   a non-paying position.},

Title = {China, India and the US Rebalance to the Asia Pacific: The Geopolitics

Abstract = {The US rebalance to the Asia Pacific is consistently interpreted as a
   response to China's material rise. While not entirely incorrect, this
   assumption - derived from an overriding faith in the explanatory
   significance of relative state capabilities - fails to explain why
   rapidly rising others, most notably India, remain absent from regional
   US security discourse, and why a heavy US presence in Asia predates
   China's ascent of the 1970s onwards. To address these problems and offer
   an improved explanation of what the rebalance is, how and why it has
   come about, and what it is designed to achieve within the context of
   China's rise, this analysis draws from critical geopolitics and
   postcolonial theory. It argues that the rebalance is best conceived as
   the (re)articulation of historical discourses which construct certain
   foreign Others like China as challenges to the ontological American
   self, making the rebalance an attempt to pacify a particular rising
   identity as much as a rising state actor. The analysis is motivated in
   part by the question of how the rebalance is enabled in its current
   form. From here, the article addresses an increasing yet regressive
   tendency of International Relations theory to deny studies of the how
   possible' explanatory value, encouraging their marginalisation in favour
   of examinations into why' political decisions are made.},

Abstract = {Previous research has shown that ethnic exclusion and restricted
   political access can motivate ethnic groups to resort to violence.
   Although these links are better established for civil wars or
   conventional conflict, we believe that the same logic should be
   applicable to ethnic terrorism as well. If so, can reforms towards
   greater ethnic inclusion also reduce terrorist risks? We argue that
   reform and changes towards greater ethnic inclusion and democratization
   should induce substitution and reduce the volume of terrorist violence,
   even if attacks by splinter groups may persist. We develop propositions
   on terrorist attack frequency, given group characteristics and
   accommodation. We take advantage of the large changes towards
   democratization, decreased discrimination, and increased ethnic
   accommodation since the third wave of democratization and the end of the
   Cold War, as well as new data linking domestic terrorist organization in
   the Global Terrorism Data to specific ethnic groups in the Ethnic Power
   Relations data. Our group-level analyses suggest considerable support
   for a decline in terrorism following accommodation.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we consider inflation rate differentials between seven
   Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) and the Eurozone. We test
   for convergence in the inflation rate differentials, incorporating
   non-linearities in the autoregressive parameters, fractional integration
   with endogenous structural changes, and also consider club convergence
   analysis for the CEECs over the period 1997 to 2015 based on monthly
   data. Our empirical findings suggest that the majority of countries
   experience non-linearities in the inflation rate differential; however,
   there is only evidence of a persistent difference in some countries.
   Complementary to this analysis we apply the Phillips and Sul (2007) test
   for club convergence and find that there is evidence that most of the
   CEECs converge to a common steady state.},

Abstract = {Research on televised election debates has been dominated by studies of
   the United States. As a result, we know far less about other national
   contexts, including many parliamentary democracies that now hold
   televised election debates. This article makes two contributions to
   address this. Theoretically, the study argues that traditional
   approaches for understanding the development of campaign communication
   practices (particularly, Americanization and hybridization) are limiting
   when applied to television debates and instead offers an alternative
   theoretical approach, the concept of speciation drawn from biological
   science. This is then applied in the empirical section of the article in
   a comparative analysis of the evolution of televised election debates in
   four parliamentary democracies: Australia, Canada, West Germany/Germany,
   and the United Kingdom. Based on this analysis, the article argues that
   the logic of parliamentary democracy coupled with more diffuse party
   systems has created a distinctive type of televised debate, generally
   more open to smaller parties based on their success at winning seats in
   the legislature.},

Abstract = {Cross-cultural competence not only emphasizes building specific skill
   sets such as language proficiency or negotiation skills, but also on
   changing the military's attitudes to other cultures by emphasizing the
   value and importance of cultural skills for successful military
   operations. In contrast to developing cultural skills, the task of
   shifting cultural attitudes is a far more complex process. Using
   empirical data from a survey of 2,406 Marines, this paper seeks to
   identify some of the social, demographic and experiential factors that
   influence military service members' attitudes to the value of culture in
   military operations. The authors found that of the demographic factors
   tested, only education and commissioning were positively related to
   attitudes. The greatest predictors were experiential factors: language
   skills, a multicultural background, travel experience and frequency of
   interaction with the local population during a previous deployment.
   Deployment alone was not a predictor. Cultural training was not related
   to attitudes, although satisfaction with the cultural training was a
   predictor of positive attitudes.},

Abstract = {Military establishments view religious soldiers with mixed feelings and
   must contend with the specific dilemmas these soldiers present. This
   article suggests what might influence the managing of religious
   diversity in the ranks, using the idea of dimensions of isolation. The
   more removed a military is from society, the more likely it is to
   utilize internal mechanisms when dealing with religious soldiers. The
   less removed it is from society, the more likely it will be to turn to
   external mediating mechanisms in this regard. Using three dimensions of
   isolation (physical, temporal, and psychological), this article
   discusses the treatment of religious troops in the Israeli and Turkish
   cases. After exploring what can be learned from these cases regarding
   the accommodation of religious soldiers, the article concludes with some
   suggestions for future research.},

Title = {Is nationalism just for nationals? Civic nationalism for noncitizens and

Abstract = {Is nationalism just for nationals? The scholarly consensus seems to be
   yes, but two small monarchies on the Arabian Peninsula suggest the need
   to reconsider this assumption. In Qatar, citizens account for about 12
   percent of the country's 2 million inhabitants. Of the UAE's 8.2 million
   residents, 13 percent are citizens. Citizen-nationals enjoy significant
   legal privilege in these states, preserved by their jus sanguinis
   citizenship regimes, which preclude noncitizens and their children from
   naturalizing. Although they are frequently dismissed as
   ``ethnocracies,{''} Gulf states are not exclusively dominated by ethnic
   nationalism. Rather, as this study of ``National Day{''} holidays in
   Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) illustrates, an incipient form
   of civic nationalism is increasingly being used to narrate state-based
   belonging on the part of noncitizen ``expats.{''} Through textual
   analysis of celebration discourses in the lead-up to the 2013 and 2014
   holidays in the UAE and Qatar, supplemented by participant observation,
   I analyze the political geographical imaginaries at work in these
   ostensibly inclusivist narratives. Extending the citizenship studies
   literature on noncitizen inclusion, this case study shows how the Gulf
   countries challenge traditional assumptions about nationalism being the
   exclusive domain of citizens, and points to the need for more research
   about how noncitizens elsewhere in the world participate in nationalist
   rituals and to what end. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the effects of different types of perceived
   media diversity and media reliance on individuals' public opinion
   expressions in China. Using data from a survey of 327 undergraduates in
   Shanghai, it was found that: (1) respondents perceived more diverse
   media contents on the Internet than on the traditional media; (2)
   people's perceived Internet diversity directly predicted their opinion
   expression in public; (3) people's perceived traditional media diversity
   moderated the relationship between opinion congruency with the majority
   position and opinion expression in public; and (4) people's reliance on
   newspapers, rather than their reliance on TV or the Internet, predicted
   their opinion expression in public. These findings suggest that people's
   perceptions (but not use) of the Internet may promote public
   deliberation in an authoritative country.},

Journal = {POLITICS PHILOSOPHY \& ECONOMICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {261-279},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Various authors hold that what is wrong with risk imposition is that
   being at risk diminishes the opportunities available to an agent.
   Arguably, even when risk does not result in material or psychological
   damages, it still represents a setback in terms of some legitimate
   interests. However, it remains to be specified what those interests are.
   This article argues that risk imposition represents a diminishment of
   overall freedom. Freedom will be characterized in empirical terms, as
   the range of unimpeded actions available to an agent. After briefly
   outlining the main characteristics of overall freedom as defended by
   Hillel Steiner and Ian Carter, the article shows that this notion is
   able to capture many of our intuitions about when and how risk
   imposition disadvantages an agent, without reference to welfare
   indicators. The article argues that if this non-welfarist perspective
   can be defended, then it would be easier to approach a number of applied
   questions about risk, including the questions of when risk imposition is
   permissible or legitimate, in which ways risk can be an object of
   distributive justice and how one can be compensated for being subject to
   a risk.},

Abstract = {In Spain, the 2014 European Elections saw the unexpected rise of a new
   party Podemos, which obtained five European Parliament seats only three
   months after its formation. In the Spanish National Elections in
   December 2015, this party obtained 20.66 percent of the votes, which
   made it the third biggest party. Our objective was to analyze the old
   and new elements of Podemos' communication and campaign strategies. The
   methodology followed here used this new party as a strategic case study
   by a qualitative approach. The analysis focused on three key fronts: (1)
   the role of communication, (2) mediatization of politics, and (3) use of
   digital media. The results suggested that Podemos' 2014 electoral
   campaign combined presence on broadcast television and use of intense
   digital media to boost citizens' engagement and self-mediation.
   Accordingly, it was established as a new transmedia party. This case
   also demonstrates that mediatization can also occur in two-way street
   dynamics, that is, from politics to the media, where the former
   generates an influence on the latter. This finding opens the door to
   help overcome the media-centric vision. Finally, we discussed future
   questions about the influence on other political actors' communication
   strategies in different parts of the world from an international
   perspective.},

Abstract = {We consider the regulatory problem to approve or to ban a new
   product/technology in the context of scientific controversy about its
   detrimental environmental and/or health effects. We formalize the
   regulator's decision-making process as a Tullock contest (Towards a
   Theory of the Rent-Seeking Society, Texas A\&M University Press, Texas,
   1980), the contestants being an industrial lobby, representing the
   economic agents who have developed the new product/technology, and an
   environmental lobby, representing the economic agents who will be harmed
   by the product or technology. Assuming that the industrial lobby has
   private information about the unfavorable environmental and/or health
   effects, but can be held liable for damage ex post, we derive the
   equilibrium properties of the contest. In particular, we derive
   conditions under which it is socially preferable for the regulator to
   decide according to the contest's outcome, rather than according to an
   ex ante cost-benefit analysis, using his prior beliefs. We find that the
   contest outperforms the ex ante cost-benefit analysis only if the risk
   of judgment-proofness is not too high.},

Abstract = {Ongoinvolonial violence, I argue in this paper, operates through
   geographies of Indigenous homes, families, and bodies that are too often
   overlooked in standard geographical accounts of colonialism. Contiguous
   with residential school violence and other micro-scale efforts to
   eliminate Indigenous peoples, colonial power continues to assert itself
   profoundly through intervention into and disruption of intimate,
   `tender' (Stoler, 2006), embodied, `visceral' (Hayes-Conroy \&
   Hayes-Conroy 2008; Hayes-Conroy and Hayes Conroy 2010), and biopolitical
   (Morgensen, 2011a) geographies of Indigenous women and children. Drawing
   on feminist and decolonizing theories, along with the concept of `slow
   violence' (Nixon, 2011), I offer in this paper a grounded account of
   spatial forms of governmentality in ongoing colonial relations in
   British Columbia, Canada. I critique dominant geographic inquires into
   colonialism as being primarily about land, natural resources, and
   territory. These inquiries, I suggest, risk perpetuating colonial
   violence in their erasure of Indigenous women and children's ontologies,
   positing this violence as something `out there' as opposed to an
   ever-present presence that all settler colonists are implicated in. (C)

Abstract = {As with other non-democratic regimes, the study of social attitudes has
   become one of the main themes used to explain the birth, consolidation
   and durability of the Franco dictatorship. The aim of this article is to
   demonstrate how the outlook adopted by ordinary Spaniards favoured the
   consolidation of the Franco regime during the post-war period. It does
   this by highlighting the importance of examining popular opinion at the
   local level, where state agents and members of society came into daily
   contact. By analysing social attitudes towards hunger and poverty,
   guerrilla activities and Spain's diplomatic isolation, the article
   reveals a measure of tepid support for the regime. Together with the
   punishment of the defeated and the collaboration of regime supporters,
   the unenthusiastic but accepting opinions held by the majority of
   Spanish people were crucial to underpinning the regime from below'. To
   these groups, the survival of dictatorship seemed to be the only
   solution that would avoid political confrontation and would allow people
   to live a peaceful' existence.},

Abstract = {Media freedom is typically viewed as crucial to democracy and
   development. The idea is that independent news media will facilitate
   free and fair elections and shine a spotlight on corruptionthereby
   serving as a fourth estate. Yet political leaders often justify
   restricting media freedom on the grounds that irresponsible news
   coverage will incite political violencepotentially undermining
   government and in effect acting as a fifth column. So is media freedom a
   force for democracy or a source of civil conflict? We hypothesize that
   the effect of media freedom on civil conflict is conditioned by a
   country's level of intolerance. Specifically, we predict when social
   intolerance is low, media freedom will discourage domestic conflict
   because the tone of the news coverage will reflect the level of
   tolerance and ameliorate any inflammatory coverage. In contrast, we
   predict that high levels of social intolerance will fuel and be fueled
   by inflammatory news coverage if the media are free, thereby promoting
   civil conflict. We test our hypotheses across countries and over time
   drawing from World Values and European Values Surveys and the Global
   Media Freedom Dataset and find that the combination of media freedom and
   high social intolerance is associated with increased civil conflict.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a game-theoretic setting to explain the
   fragmentation of majority and opposition coalitions in governments. The
   model is two-stage: (1) the leaders of each coalition control the size
   of the parties in their group so as to maximize the political power of
   their coalition, and (2) the political party leaders in each coalition
   decide their degree of participation in their coalition's collective
   action. The main conclusion is that the concentration in the two
   opposing coalitions will be related when the competition between them is
   fierce. This is shown to hold for the Left-wing and Right-wing
   coalitions in French local governments, revealing competition in
   fragmentation in these coalitions.},

Title = {Protesting the Paradigm: A Comparative Study of News Coverage of
   Protests in Brazil, China, and India},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESS-POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This study assesses the scope and applicability of the protest paradigm
   in non-Western contexts by examining the news coverage of Brazilian,
   Chinese, and Indian protests in their domestic media. Two publications
   from each nation, one conservative and one progressive, are content
   analyzed for adherence to a series of marginalization devices that have
   often been used by the U.S. media to ridicule protest movements and
   portray them as violent. The Indian media emerge as the least likely to
   follow the protest paradigm, while Brazilian and Chinese media conform
   to it in moderate levels. Comparative analysis suggests the historical
   legitimacy of informal power negotiations in a political culture makes
   news media more willing to take protesters seriously and limits
   adherence to the protest paradigm. In contrast, a news organization's
   ideological affiliation with the government of the day, rather than any
   ideology per se, makes it relatively more likely to conform to the
   protest paradigm. Marginalization devices such as circus, appearance,
   and eyewitness accounts are rarely used in any of these nations. But
   disparity of sources, (non)reference to protesters' causes and violence,
   and violence blame appear to be abiding features of news coverage of
   protests everywhere.},

Abstract = {Although the importance of space is increasingly recognized, its
   conceptualization with reference to social movements varies. For a long
   time, critical geographers have considered space as socially
   constructed. Following Lefebvre's influential distinction, the relevance
   of three types of socially produced space for social movements have been
   pointed out: (a) perceived space (or spatial practices), as a material
   space where everyday life is produced; (b) conceived space, as the
   representation of space as socially constructed through (dominant and
   alternative) discourses, meanings and signs; (c) lived space, or
   representational space, where (a) and (b) interact. This essay maps the
   various ways through which space structures protest while at the same
   time being structured by it. We shall address this task by revisiting
   the contributions of geographers and ethnographers, with the help of
   empirical research we developed on a case of local opposition to a
   large-scale infrastructure project: the Dal Molin military base in
   Italy.},

Abstract = {This study aims to contribute to the discussion on how the growing
   opportunities for media choice influence gaps in political knowledge
   among those motivated to consume news versus those who are not. With
   more television channels available, it becomes easier to choose content
   matching personal interests. While several studies have analyzed trends
   in news consumption and motivations among different citizen groups,
   there are still very few studies that actually link these developments
   longitudinally to patterns of knowledge gaps. Using survey data from
   Swiss referendums held 1993-1999, we find that (1) gaps in political
   knowledge because of political interest have increased over time, and
   (2) political interest has become a stronger predictor of informational
   TV use.},

   between (a) the use of e-commerce, information, literacy, and utility
   apps and (b) political information seeking and political discussion. By
   contrast, this study found that the use of relational apps was
   negatively related to political information seeking and not related to
   political discussion. The use of entertainment apps was not associated
   with either behavior. This study provides a starting point for
   examination of mobile apps as they continuously grow and develop toward
   user engagement, and furthermore shed light on their effect on political
   participation.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between Sicilian mafia and
   politics by focusing on municipality-level results of national political
   elections. It exploits the fact that in the early 1990s the Italian
   party system collapsed, new parties emerged and mafia families had to
   look for new political allies. It presents evidence, based on
   disaggregated data from the Italian region of Sicily, that between 1994
   and 2013 Silvio Berlusconi's party, Forza Italia, obtained higher vote
   shares at national elections in municipalities plagued by mafia. The
   result is robust to the use of different measures of mafia presence,
   both contemporary and historical, to the inclusion of different sets of
   controls and to spatial analysis. Instrumenting mafia presence by
   determinants of its early diffusion in the late XIX century suggests
   that the correlation reflects a causal link. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Previous studies of the impact of social media on youth's participation
   in politics are largely inconclusive. It is partly attributable to a
   diverse conceptualization of political participation and media use.
   Using a holistic definition of political participation and an analytical
   approach of building a typology of political participation, this study
   constructed a four-group typology for young people's political
   participation in a randomized mobile phone interview with 672 Hong Kong
   respondents aged 20-29 years. Four groups were identified: critical
   citizens (14\%); modestly politically active nonvoters (15\%); voters
   (29\%); and disengaged individuals (42\%). The respondents' media use
   and political characteristics were also examined. The study suggests
   that the theoretical relationship between political participation and
   new media use should be contextualized into a specific dimension of
   political activities and a definite group of individuals.},

Abstract = {In a society transitioning to democracy from an authoritarian regime,
   drafting a new constitution is an important step in the establishment of
   a civil and democratic state. Indeed, the demand of Tunisians to write a
   new constitution reflects their ambitions, aspirations and hopes; but
   reality shows a huge gap between the expectations of the majority of
   Tunisians and the result of the drafting process. The Tunisian
   transition is characterized by a fierce debate between the secular and
   the religious forces. This unfolding confrontation forms the backdrop to
   the process of drafting a new constitution, amid anxiety surrounding the
   place of Islam in the new political system. However, fears of the
   resurrection of a new theocratic dictatorship are mitigated by a dynamic
   civil society in which the voiceless or those who were abused by the
   former regime of Zine Al-Abidine Ben Ali are becoming distinctly vocal.
   Their action has become increasingly visible, evolving around the place
   of religion, law and gender in the new constitutional framework and
   context. This article focuses on the debate on religion, law and gender
   in post-revolution Tunisia.},

Abstract = {This article aims to improve our understanding of post-politicization by
   examining the role of ` ordinary' urban protest movements, using the
   example of a protest in Alexandra Park, an inner city park in
   Manchester, UK. The critical literature on postpolitics has improved our
   understanding of exceptional, large-scale protests, but we know much
   less about how smaller scale protests emerge and in time wind down. Our
   research is revealing of the post-politicizing tactics of the city
   authorities in containing protest and of how the protesters lost
   momentum, focusing on contesting techno-managerial processes for
   consultation and undertaking scientific surveys. Whilst universalizing
   claims were made about democratic enfranchisement, the authorities were
   able to counter and diffuse these.},

Abstract = {This chapter examines the possibility for meaningful ethical and
   political action in light of the strange indifference of the world. It
   argues that what makes ethics and politics meaningful for Camus is tied
   to the question of revolt or rebellion, which challenges the perception
   of the futility of both existence and political life. Hayden
   interrogates how Camus's notion of rebellion developed, how it
   influenced his critical views on revolutionary ideology, and how those
   views challenged received wisdom. In doing so, the chapter also
   illuminates the important parallel Camus draws between rebellion and
   measure (or balance and equilibrium). As the condition sine qua non for
   rebellion, an ethics of measure aims to maintain a creative tension
   between rebellion and the limitations of human understanding and
   political possibility.},

Abstract = {This chapter brings together two areas of Camus thought regarding the
   renewal of human freedom and dignity from the perspective of a politics
   of rebellion and measure. It first outlines the broader principles of
   reciprocal human rights and egalitarian socio-economic participation
   endorsed by Camus as the basis for a politics that strives for balance
   between the values of liberty, justice and equality. It then explores
   how Camus's argument that political freedom. and social equality
   complement each other is linked to his ideas that ethical and political
   attachments entail more than formal structures of government. Focusing
   on the powerful relations of love, friendship and solidarity, Hayden
   examines how these affective dispositions and felt social commitments
   embody an ethical-political opposition to injustice that implies a love
   of existence and the world itself},

Abstract = {In this article, I locate the efforts of the Hungarian government to
   close its borders to migrants in the broader context of externalization
   of European Union asylum policy. I draw on Martina Tazzioli's
   conceptualization of the production of temporary, divisive migrant
   multiplicities in border zones in ethnographically presenting the
   conditions of two protest marches of migrants. I suggest that the
   relative successes and failures of these marches, one of which resulted
   in a temporary rupture in Hungary's adherence to EU border policy,
   relate to the presence or absence of biopolitical border controls and
   techniques of externalization that stand in parallel with long-term
   developments of EU border control. In this context, I also question the
   extent to which an emergence of a collective subject is contingent upon
   local support, on one hand, and imaginations of the border, on the
   other. I argue that the analysis of Hungarian state's border control, as
   well as efforts to counter it, must be situated in the historical
   development of the EU border policy.},

Abstract = {This study examines the interrelations between journalists and
   communication practitioners from environmental nongovernmental
   organizations (NGOs). Taking the annual United Nations climate change
   conferences as a case in point, we show that the exceptional
   circumstances of these events foster a temporary blurring of the
   professional boundaries between both actor groups that partly results in
   a joint production of interpretations. Based on seventy-eight
   semi-standardized interviews with journalists and NGO representatives,
   we identify four distinct coproduction networks that pair particular
   types of journalists and NGO communicators. Our analysis shows that (1)
   the journalistic beat, (2) the type of media journalists work for, (3)
   journalists' and NGOs' perceived target audiences, and also (4) the
   NGOs' strategic orientation toward either lobbying or popular
   mobilization are decisive for the formation of these networks. Our study
   helps to systematically explain message production in a transnational
   context and provides a deeper understanding of the relationship between
   journalism and public relations.},

   boundary reforms},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {41},
Pages = {31-45},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We analyze whether voters value local political representation by
   exploiting municipal mergers, which increase the number of candidates
   available to voters and intensify political competition. In the Finnish
   open-list proportional representation system, voters rank the candidates
   within parties, and thus, concentrating votes to local candidates
   increases the extent of local representation. Using a
   difference-in-differences strategy, we find that the vote distributions
   become more concentrated in municipalities less likely to gain local
   representation after the mergers. Moreover, the effect is much larger in
   municipalities where the benefits of local representation to voters are
   large. The latter result disentangles voters' responses from the
   responses of other political actors. The results are important also for
   designing local government mergers, which are an important policy tool
   in many countries. They highlight that concerns over deteriorating local
   democracy due to mergers have merit, because voters have preferences for
   local representation. At the same time, the vote concentration patterns
   we find alleviate these concerns. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Pages = {159-182},
Abstract = {The past decades have been characterised by a puzzling dilemma of the
   politics of the `Roma issue' in European societies and also on the
   international level. On the one hand, due to the intense work of a range
   of influential international organisations of Roma representation and
   the enduring efforts of a group of dedicated politicians acting on the
   European level, the case of Roma has become thematised in political
   terms and as such, it has been drawn into the arena of governmental and
   inter-governmental politics and policy-making. As a peak of such
   efforts, the formulation of a national strategy on Roma inclusion has
   been made a task for all member states of the European Union and this
   way it has been successfully elevated to the existing mechanisms of
   monitoring and reviewing as parts of the Europe-wide applied open method
   of coordination in outlining developmental plans and policies. On the
   other hand, domestic statistics and research signal the lack of any
   improvement in the situation of Roma: occurrences of discrimination and
   segregation have not diminished, poverty and the extreme inequalities
   hitting Roma in education, work and the daily conditions of living have
   not been decreased, and the tendencies of exclusion have become stronger
   in a wide range of local communities all across. In an indirect way,
   these latter developments indicate the weakness and marginal state of
   Roma politics in attaining any breakthrough in the structures of power.
   A closer look at the conditions in a broader scope of political
   participation reveals how informality in articulating needs and claims
   weakens the potency of the minority in influencing decision-making about
   their cause, while the very same relations properly fit into their
   experiences of daily living. An overview of the conditions and
   prevailing relations in education and work in marginalised Roma
   communities will serve to demonstrate the congruence of informalisation
   between the daily realities and their political representation.},

Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},

Abstract = {Electoral competition in weak institutional settings has been shown to
   increase criminal violence, in particular homicides. Electoral
   competitiveness, by virtue of threatening the ability of incumbents to
   maintain informal corruption agreements with criminal networks, is
   argued to increase crime because of violent competition among criminal
   groups over future influence. We link elections to maritime piracy, a
   form of criminal behavior that has increased substantially since the end
   of the Cold War and for which cross-national, temporally and spatially
   disaggregated data are available. We argue that electoral competition
   reinforces piracy because political changes threaten to disrupt
   collusive agreements between pirates and government authorities.
   Anticipating a disruption of criminal activity, pirates elevate their
   attack rates before political changes undermine these agreements. This
   disruption effect suggests that jurisdictions holding competitive
   electoral contests should experience more maritime piracy. We test our
   hypothesis on electoral competitiveness and piracy with subnational data
   for the 1999 and 2004 elections in Indonesia. Our results show that
   piracy escalates in proximity to highly competitive electoral districts.},

Abstract = {In recent years, measures have been taken to ban the use of
   international legal principles in state courts. While these
   international laws vary in terms of the specific restrictions they place
   on state legal practices, many of these laws have been aimed implicitly
   or explicitly at banning Sharia law practices. While dozens of states
   have attempted to pass anti-Sharia policies, thus far, only eight have
   been successful. In this article, we apply a policy diffusion framework
   to help explain the agenda placement and adoption of these measures. We
   find that both internal state determinants and external regional
   diffusion factors influence the interstate agenda placement and adoption
   of anti-Sharia practices. However, the regional effect is negative,
   meaning that these policies follow an atypical diffusion pattern. This
   study adds to the growing body of literature that examines the diffusion
   of controversial morality policies.},

   Produce Different Outcomes?},
Journal = {POLICY AND INTERNET},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {431-456},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) represent popular election campaign
   tools in many countries, enabling voters to discover which party or
   candidate provides the best match with their political preferences. This
   article examines the effects of design choices on these tools by
   focusing on the response scale that is used to measure the policy
   positions of parties and voters. We analyze the impact of scale length
   on the advice generated by these tools using user data from a VAA
   developed for the 2014 Dutch local elections. We transform the original
   101-point scale into several alternative scale formats and determine if
   this leads to a different voting recommendation. We also examine the
   suitability of alternative scales for creating spatial models, which are
   often employed by VAAs. We show that the response scale has a
   potentially profound impact on the resulting advice (with voters
   receiving different VAA outcomes depending on the scale length), except
   for voters with an extremist response style. The findings have practical
   implications for the design of these tools: outcomes should be presented
   as a preference list, rather than focusing on the ``best match.{''}},

Abstract = {This paper examines the central role of the camp in the early Israeli
   state period and its spatial and geopolitical evolution. Unlike official
   Israeli history, which presents the immigrant camps as an inevitable
   improvised response to the unexpected problem of mass immigration, I
   examine the camp as a strategic modern biopolitical instrument that
   allowed for the state's profound geopolitical changes and was itself
   altered according to them. The paper analyses the ways in which the camp
   facilitated the creation of Israel as a state formed by two seemingly
   contradictory, but in fact complementary, conditions: on one hand, a
   product of a chaotic `state of emergency' and a form of `ordered
   disorder' created by mass immigration, and on the other hand, a product
   of a comprehensive, tightly controlled modernist project combining
   physical planning and social engineering. This duality reveals the role
   of these immigrant camps, which were created both in Israel and abroad,
   as spatial `black holes' which swallowed the contradiction between the
   radical geopolitical transformation and the rational self-image of the
   Israeli state-building project. The evolving and hybrid typologies of
   the camp in Israel's pre-state and early state periods expose it as a
   versatile instrument, highlighting the need for informed spatial and
   geographical genealogies of the camp in order to illuminate its various
   transformations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The characteristic challenges of combat lead military personnel to
   develop adaptive coping styles that are different from coping styles
   used in routine life. This contention is explored using data collected
   from Israel Defense Forces conscript and reserve soldiers during intense
   military operations. The results of this study support this claim, in
   particular concerning faith. Coping styles were also correlated with
   combat motivations and measures of positive and negative emotions. It
   seems that a well-adapted soldier may use unique coping styles that,
   although perhaps not understood by outsiders, can contribute to his
   capacity to carry out his undertakings. A better understanding of such a
   state of mind should prove valuable for military leaders and religious
   experts.},

Abstract = {We model participation to the labor market of women who live in couple
   in France. We estimate for two periods of time going from 1994 to 2001
   and from 2004 to 2013 a dynamic model with random effects using the ECHP
   (European community Household Panel) and the EU-SILC (European Union
   Statistics on Income and Living Conditions). We propose then an
   estimator in order to estimate the parameters of such a non linear model
   and in presence of endogenous explanatory variables such as fertility.
   The IV estimator is used to estimate the labour market participation of
   women. The results we obtain show a high persistence of the labor market
   behavior of women. The presence of a young children has a large and
   significant impact on the participation status. These results are
   indicating that it is difficult or costly for women to conciliate
   maternity and an active working life.},

Abstract = {Cognitive liberation is often treated in the social movements literature
   as a mediating factor through which political opportunities and
   mobilizing structures generate protest. This paper unpacks multiple
   dimensions of cognitive liberation and finds that they may operate in
   tension with one another. Building on scholarship that focuses on
   subjective factors in social movements, the paper examines the case of
   the Korku, an oppressed indigenous community in central India, who
   choose not to protest despite the presence of several dimensions of
   cognitive liberation. Rather than engage in collective political action,
   the Korku's grievances are deflected toward depoliticized religious
   goals. The Korku seek communal improvement through Hindu piety in a
   context of the Hindutva cultural-nationalist ideology, rather than
   protest against the encroachment of this ideology on their community.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis article evaluates the voting experience in the first
   election using cumulative voting for the Board of Trustees in Port
   Chester, New York. A growing number of local jurisdictions in the United
   States are using cumulative voting for multimember elections. While the
   Port Chester election included some other new features in addition to
   cumulative voting, the village implemented an extensive voter education
   program to prepare voters and candidates for the election.
   MethodsWe conducted an exit poll of 1,946 Port Chester voters in June
   2010, more than half of the voters in the local election. We used a
   variety of survey questions to measure voting experience and voting
   behavior. We also examined election returns for Port Chester, including
   the 2010 and 2013 elections using cumulative voting.
   ResultsWe find that the voter education program helped inform residents
   about casting a ballot with cumulative voting. Port Chester voters, and
   Hispanic voters in particular, reported a positive experience in the
   2010 election. A large majority of voters also indicated that they
   understood cumulative voting and cast all of the votes allotted to them.
   Finally, we find evidence of strategic use of cumulative voting in order
   to help elect a candidate of one's choice.
   ConclusionsOur results indicate that voters are capable of effectively
   participating in elections with cumulative voting. Communities that are
   weighing the adoption of cumulative voting for local elections should
   also be prepared to implement a parallel voter education effort.},

Abstract = {While the distinction between public and private goods is essential in
   developing a normative theory of non-predatory states, the focus of this
   article is on a positive theory of predatory states. Since the predatory
   relationship between the state and its subjects depends on the power of
   the state to grab or to appropriate coercively and the subject's ability
   to escape or hide, the boundaries of the state are decided by the nature
   of the assets that can be taken more or less easily. Accordingly, I will
   introduce a new distinction between captive and fugitive assets that
   positively captures the frontiers of a state space. The US railroading
   in the nineteenth century provides an illustration regarding the
   explanatory power of an asset-appropriating perspective of the state
   compared to a public goods approach.},

Abstract = {This paper uses Swedish and Finnish municipal data to investigate the
   effect of changes in voter turnout on the tax rate, public spending and
   vote-shares. A reform in Sweden in 1970, which overall lowered the cost
   of voting, is applied as an instrument for voter turnout in local
   elections. The reform increased voter turnout in Sweden. The higher
   voter turnout resulted in higher municipal taxes and greater per capita
   local public spending. There are also indications that higher turnout
   decreased the vote share for right-wing parties. I use an individual
   survey data set to conclude that it was in particular low income earners
   that began to vote to a greater extent after the reform. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Objective. The relationship between academic achievement, especially
   grade point average (GPA), and college athletics is often focused on
   ``big-time{''} (National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I
   (NCAA DI)) colleges. This study examines athletic and academic identity
   correlates with student-athlete (SA) GPA for not only DI but also DII
   and DIII SAs, separately by sex. Methods. The GPAs of over 19,000 SAs
   across divisions are analyzed using OLS with covariates including
   athletic and academic indicators. The analysis pools SAs, separates by
   division, and separates by division and sex. Additional analyses were
   conducted for the revenue-producing sports. Results. SAs' GPA is
   directly influenced by their athletic versus academic identity, the
   athletic context including the coach's influence, and the seriousness
   with which they view academics. Cross-equation joint testing found no
   statistical differences in athletic or academic identity across division
   and sex. Conclusions. Two beliefs are widely presumed: that DI SAs'
   focus on athletics more than SAs in the ``less competitive{''} divisions
   leads them to worse academic outcomes, and that the athletic identity of
   male SAs has a greater impact on academic performance than female SAs.
   Our results provide no evidence for either presumption.},

Title = {Bribery environments and firm performance: Evidence from CEE countries},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {43},
Pages = {14-28},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We examine the relation between bureaucratic corruption and firm
   performance in CEE countries. We show that divergent consequences of
   corruption found in previous studies can be explained by the specifics
   of the local bribery environment in which firms operate. A higher mean
   bribery is associated with lower firm performance, while higher
   dispersion of individual firm bribes appears to facilitate it. We also
   conduct a detailed analysis by firm sector and size, and countries'
   institutional environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Public health policies typically assume that there are characteristics
   and constraints over health that an individual cannot control and that
   there are choices that an individual could change if he is nudged or
   provided with incentives. We consider that health is determined by a
   range of personal, social, economic and environmental factors and we
   discuss to what extent an individual can control these factors. In
   particular, we assume that the observed health status of an individual
   is a result of factors within the individual's control and constraints
   the individual faces. We suggest three different constraints: budget,
   time and psychological constraints and position various determinants of
   health according to increasing levels of constraint and increasing
   degrees of individual control. We finally discuss public health policies
   such as nudging, intervening and rewarding within this new framework and
   show that the level of constraints and the degree of individual control
   on health status are essential dimensions to consider when designing and
   implementing public health policies.},

Abstract = {Armed forces form the lifeblood of any nation, and morale of its
   officers is the key to effective defense of the country's borders. Yet,
   most militaries, and so does Indian, suffer from a relatively high rate
   of churn of officers that has adverse effects. Turnover is detrimental
   to any organization, and it is particularly undesirable for armed
   forces, as it affects unit cohesion and operational preparedness, thus
   proving to be chronic problem that demands attention. With this aim, we
   investigate the factors that are instrumental in influencing the
   propensity of military officers to leave. A survey of 476 Indian
   military officers, followed by a rigorous empirical analysis, revealed
   the pay, promotion, and job satisfaction to be the prime perpetrators
   for the intention of military officers to leave. Our work is a step in
   the direction of stemming the attrition and improving the retention of
   officers in the Indian military.},

Abstract = {According to theoretical approaches, such as the influence of presumed
   media influence approach, individuals' attitudes and behaviors are
   affected by the influences they believe the media has on others.
   Politicians, for example, are thought to perform media relations
   activities because they ascribe great importance to the media. This has
   been tested regarding politicians' online activities using data from two
   surveys of members of Germany's national parliament, the Bundestag (
   n(t1/t2) = 194/149). It was hypothesized that parliamentarians use
   Facebook and Twitter more extensively when they believe that these
   social media tools have a strong political influence on the public,
   journalists, and other politicians. However, the results indicate that
   parliamentarians use Facebook and Twitter regardless of whether they
   expect it to have an impact on other people. Therefore, politicians'
   online activities are determined by other reasons and not such strategic
   motives. Thus, although ( or precisely because) the hypotheses are
   rejected, the findings are an important contribution to the research on
   politicians' motives for online communication.},

Abstract = {We investigate experimentally the impact of unflattering social
   comparisons on individuals' satisfaction and behaviour. More precisely,
   we focus on negative interdependent preferences and explore whether they
   are responsible for leading participants to reduce others' income. In
   our experiment, participants are randomly paired and receive an
   endowment. Then participants have to report their satisfaction level
   after being informed of their own endowment and of their opponent's
   endowment. Finally participants can choose, or not, to reduce their
   opponent's endowment incurring a personal cost. We observe: (1) most
   people report to experience negative interdependent preferences by
   learning others' higher endowments; (2) although destructive decisions
   are predominantly undertaken by participants expressing negative
   interdependent preferences, such preferences fail at predicting
   decisions to reduce income; (3) absolute difference between
   participants' endowments affects individuals' satisfaction whereas
   relative difference modulates participants' decisions to reduce others'
   income.},

Abstract = {Measuring party support in Australia by constructing a ``two-party
   preferred{''} vote has had a profound effect, not only on the way
   political scientists, journalists, and politicians understand electoral
   ``swing{''} and predict electoral outcomes, but also on their
   understanding of the party system, their thinking about electoral
   fairness, and their views about which party or parties can legitimately
   claim government. This article traces the origins - the maternity as
   well as the paternity - of the ``two-party preferred{''}. It documents
   its spread from federal to state elections, even as voting systems in
   some states have switched from exhaustive preferential to optional
   preferential. It discusses its wide-ranging impact, and its implications
   for notions of electoral fairness and the legitimacy of election
   outcomes. It evaluates various criticisms of the concept - technical,
   pragmatic, and conceptual. And it notes the implications for marginal
   seat campaigning of the commonly observed ``uniform
   swing{''}-implications completely at odds with the idea that marginal
   seats matter.},

Abstract = {The 2011 Arab Spring uprising with the highest levels of popular support
   took place in Bahrain. This level of mobilization was due in part to the
   organizational capacity of trade unions and professional associations,
   and yet their role in the `near-revolution' has received very little
   scholarly attention. In contrast to Egypt and Tunisia, where the
   official trade union federations played an ambiguous or even hostile
   role as workers began to organize strikes during the protests against
   Ben Ali and Mubarak, the official General Federation of Bahrain Trade
   Unions not only supported the protests against the Al Khalifa regime,
   but called for two general strikes. As significant as the strikes were,
   the work of unpaid volunteers constituted another less recognized, but
   equally important form of labor activism. Understanding the mass
   mobilization in Bahrain, and elsewhere, requires an encompassing
   approach to labor: one that can conceptualize equally the ability of
   collectivities to stop working, but also the ability to collectively
   continue to work, even on an unpaid basis. I will illustrate the
   contradictory role of the labor movement with examples from the Bahrain
   Teachers' Association and the Bahrain Nursing Society. The majority of
   members of both associations were women. Finally, the Bahraini regime
   punished both forms of labor activism - both the teachers who went on
   strike, and the nurses who declared they would not strike but continue
   to work and care for the injured protesters.},

Abstract = {This article aims to explain why the idea of the West is, for historical
   and philosophical reasons, an obstacle to dealing with the dangers posed
   by radical Islamists. Every proposed theory of the West has to account
   for the great internal cultural diversity both of European cultures and
   of those influenced by them around the world; and every serious
   historical account both of Europe and of Islam has to recognize the
   long-standing, substantial and ongoing interdependence of their
   intellectual and religious traditions. As a result, what is needed to
   face extremists, whether inside or outside Europe (and whether
   Christian, Muslim or neither), is not an opposition between Islam and
   the West, but an alliance of those of all faiths and none who can live
   with and tolerate cultural difference against those, wherever they live
   and whatever their religion, who cannot.},

Title = {Contesting the Dublin Regulation: Refugees' and Migrants' Claims to
   Personhood and Rights in Germany},
Journal = {INTERSECTIONS-EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2},
Number = {4},
Pages = {51-68},
Abstract = {This study demonstrates how an EU law, Dublin 111, affects a
   heterogeneous group of refugees and migrants in Germany who first enter
   the EU through States such as Italy, Spain, or Hungary. The Dublin
   regulation allows refugees (with the exception of refugees from Syria)
   solely to make asylum-claims in the EU country through which they first
   enter and where they are initially fingerprinted. Therefore, if
   authorities find asylum-seekers' fingerprints in the database and can
   thus confirm that they have been in another EU Member State, then
   according to the Dublin regulation, they can be deported to the first
   country. The study illustrates the ways in which many refugees and
   migrants in Germany negotiate the Dublin law in differentiated ways,
   which subsequently enables them to claim their rights to personhood and
   dignity. More specifically, this study interrogates how some refugees
   are affected by the Dublin legislation and how they negotiate this law.
   This group of refugees have varied status in Germany some have claimed
   asylum, some fear imminent deportations, others have not claimed asylum
   within Germany, while there are others who are in the process of
   `getting out of Dublin'. The study explores how these refugees with
   differing positions, status, and background negotiate their stay and
   personhood in Germany.},

Abstract = {Opposed to the ``formalism{''} of classical rationality, here
   exemplified by Kant's ethics, both thinkers ground their philosophies in
   phenomenology: Lukacs from Hegel via Marx, Levinas from Husserl.
   Criticizing Kantian ethics for its abstractness, self-division,
   ineffectuality, and ideological ``eternalizing{''} of the bourgeois
   status quo, Lukacs defends an alternative philosophy of totality as
   dialectical-historical class struggle. Rejecting Lukacs's alternative as
   ``totalitarian,{''} Levinas defends a post-Kantian ethical alternative:
   the primacy of an asymmetrical-ahistorical intersubjective moral
   responsibility, and the just politics-social democracy-built upon it.
   Levinas begins with detailed phenomenological studies of the
   constitution of embodied and vulnerable subjectivity, and then, driven
   by ``the things themselves{''} beyond the epistemological boundaries of
   Husserlian phenomenology, he elaborates the source of these
   significations in the ``infinity,{''} ``saying,{''} ``proximity{''} or
   transcendence which gives rise to responsibility for others.},

Title = {The Small Border Traffic Zone between Poland and Kaliningrad Region
   (Russia): The Impact of a Local Visa-Free Border Regime},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {538-555},
Abstract = {After Poland's accession to the EU, the Polish-Russian border became the
   EU external border. This significantly changed its nature and started
   the new type of cross border relation. Since 2012, when the Small Border
   Traffic (SBT) zone came into force, the border has changed its blockade
   function and started instead to be treated as a resource. The
   fundamental loosening of the border crossing regime reduced the social
   and functional distance between Poland and Kaliningrad, and in a broader
   sense between EU and Kaliningrad. This paper will try to show how small
   but meaningful initiative, the SBT, has had an impact on cross-border
   region. The present paper will describe the relationship between larger
   geopolitical actors and how they affect local border relations. The aim
   of this paper is to present phenomenon of new visa regime at the
   Polish-Russian border. The paper likewise describes the impact of the
   SBT on local communities and their economies, as well as national
   relations between adjacent countries. The analysis is based on the
   interviews and surveys conducted in the Polish-Russian border region in
   late 2014.},

Title = {Instrumentalizing Fukushima: Comparing Media Coverage of Fukushima in
   Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3},
Pages = {351-373},
Abstract = {According to the theory of instrumental actualization in mediated
   conflicts, the mass media tend to exaggerate events consistent with the
   editorial line. This theory was tested using press coverage in Germany,
   Switzerland, France, and the United Kingdom on the Japanese seaquake,
   the tsunami it caused, and the nuclear disaster of Fukushima. Within a
   period of seven weeks after the seaquake, the coverage in the four
   countries in 27 national newspapers and magazines on the three events
   was analyzed. As hypothesized from theory, German and Swiss media
   concentrated on Fukushima and stressed its relevance to domestic nuclear
   plants, whereas French and British media placed a greater emphasis on
   the tsunami and rarely related the nuclear catastrophe in Japan to
   domestic nuclear programs. In addition, there were remarkable
   correlations between the views of journalists and the bias of statements
   on nuclear energy presented in their news sections. Findings are
   discussed and related to the theory of public opinion and political
   decisions in liberal democracies.},
