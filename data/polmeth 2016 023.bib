Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to explore the relationships between emotional
   intelligence (EI), conflict management styles and job performance in a
   Chinese cultural context.
   Design/methodology/approach - The present paper uses a cross-sectional
   research design. Paper-based questionnaires were distributed to
   employees working in the R\&D department of a science and technology
   institute in Taiwan. In total, 300 questionnaires were distributed and
   248 valid questionnaires were analyzed, with a return rate of 81.4 per
   cent.
   Findings - The results show that EI has a positive impact on job
   performance. Furthermore, agreeable conflict style positively moderated
   between EI and job performance, whereas active conflict style has
   negative moderating effect.
   Research limitations/implications - Due to the research design, sample
   and data collection method, the research results may lack
   representativeness. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to use a
   different approach in the future.
   Practical implications - Organizations should strengthen employees' EI
   and conflict management abilities to improve job performance.
   Organizations can apply the results of this study in accordance with
   their policy on recruitment, selection and training.
   Originality/value - Organizations should strengthen employees' EI and
   conflict management abilities to improve job performance. Organizations
   can apply the results of this study in accordance with their policies on

Title = {Time and the management of policy conflict: issues, actors and
   institutions in the Boston biolaboratory controversy},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-20},
Abstract = {Public policy theoreticians and practitioners have increasingly
   considered the implications of time on interest group conflict. A number
   of scholars have explored the evolution of interest group conflict and
   policy frames across time, noting that, as conflicts mature, groups
   often adopt a more dynamical `conflict management' approach. Instead of
   solely expanding or containing the scope of debate, conflict management
   sees the two sides strategically engage one another's narratives, appeal
   to the same types of allies and compete within the same venues. Others
   argue time itself is an explanatory variable that can alter interest
   group strategy and undermine the possibility of compromise. This
   literature straddles policy theory as well as the interdisciplinary
   study of the social psychological dynamics of conflict escalation, which
   has long construed time constraints as a roadblock to negotiation. Using
   the debate over the siting of a high-level security biolaboratory in
   downtown Boston as a case study, this article considers the dynamics of
   interest group conflict in the face of acute temporal constraints. The
   biolab case offers a useful context for exploring the implications of
   time on the trajectory of interest group strategies and as a potential
   `stressor' that can cause groups to adopt intractable - uncompromising
   and polarized - positions.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to analyze the systemic risk of the Chinese
   financial institutions following the financial crisis of 2007. We
   estimate the systemic risk of a sample composed by 70 Chinese financial
   institutions through the period beginning on 02 January 2008 to 30 June
   2015. We utilize the SRISK as a measure of systemic risk. This measure
   aims to capture financial institutions activity stress and its potential
   to become systemic. The proposed measures capture not only individual
   financial institutions vulnerability, but also the stress dependency
   structure between them and the Chinese financial system. In addition,
   these measures can be quite useful for identifying systematically
   important banks. Furthermore, the empirical results show that the level
   of systemic risk supported by the Chinese financial institutions is very
   elevated. The contribution of each institution in the risk of the
   financial system in the China is very important. The decomposition of
   systemic risk indicates that the institution has the higher level of
   debt, contributes positively and extremely to systemic risk.},

Abstract = {Innovative public management practices can greatly benefit citizens, but
   often fail due to a mismatch with the societal context. Public Value
   Management was developed in North America and Western Europe,
   emphasising public leadership, stakeholder involvement, and information
   sharing. This article examines whether these practices advocated in
   resilient societies which are large, egalitarian, and high trust also
   work in vulnerable societies which are small, hierarchical, and low
   trust. The article compares management practices at 16 public utilities
   in 3 Caribbean societies, concluding that Public Value Management can
   improve outcomes when applied comprehensively. Partial implementation,
   however, leads to worse outcomes instead.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},

Abstract = {This paper examines the actions of the European Council during the
   Eurozone crisis through the lens of political constitutionalism. This
   analysis examines the role of political inputs in shaping the EU
   constitutional developments, whether supranational or intergovernmental,
   to demonstrate the `legitimacy paradox' of new intergovernmentalism.
   That is, the European Council claimed the electoral legitimacy to rescue
   the euro, but in doing so opened up new avenues for contesting EU
   legitimacy, notably in relation to national budgetary decision-making.
   For unlike with supranational constitutional agency, the European
   Council has the means to politicise its actions. However, the strategy
   taken during the sovereign debt crisis is shown to be one of
   depoliticisation to prevent the domestic contestation of EMU reform. At
   the same time, paradoxically, the politics of macroeconomic policy has
   become Europeanised with the active participation of EU supranational
   actors. Since EMU reform is dependent on supranational enforcement of
   EMU rules, the new intergovernmentalism faces political contestation
   that previous, supranational EU constitutional development did not.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) literature sees increasing market liberalization
   as a challenge for models of national capitalism. EU liberalization, it
   is argued, erodes national employment regimes and social protection.
   However, other scholars highlight the ability of national institutions
   to reinvent themselves. This contribution assesses these claims by
   exploring an extreme case of labour market pressure driven by EU
   liberalization. Focusing on the meat production sector, it shows that
   low-wage labour migration has affected employment conditions in the meat
   production sector in Germany and Denmark in different ways: dualization
   has made Germany a destination country for low-wage work; in contrast,
   union solidarity in Denmark has kept wages high and Danish meat
   producers have outsourced work to Germany. The underlying industrial
   relations systems have shaped actors' responses to the use of migrant
   labour.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE GOVERNANCE},

Volume = {1},

Pages = {99-118},
Abstract = {Since 1999, there has been continuous discussion and exploration among
   academic circles in China on the concepts of governance, good
   governance, and social governance advocating cooperative management of
   public affairs by multiple entities, such as state and society,
   government and citizen. Since 2004, the ruling party and government has
   gradually accepted concepts in social governance, provided policy space
   and opportunity for social cooperation and public participation in
   social management mechanism, and accepted the concept of `social
   governance' in the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Party Congress of
   the Communist Party of China (hereafter called CPC) Central Committee
   (hereafter called Party Congress) in 2013. In the same time frame in
   accepting the concept of social governance, the CPC has been
   continuously adjusting its policy in social management. Since the Fourth
   Plenary session of the 16th Party Congress, government policies on
   social construction and management have been increasingly broadened and
   enriched; development of social organizations, community construction,
   professional development for social workers and volunteer service system
   have gained more policy encouragement and resources support. All of
   these reveal that the Chinese Communist Party has strong learning
   capability and good adaptability, being good at adapting its ideology
   and policy according to situational changes. On the other hand, the CPC
   has a strong level of autonomy and conservatism; while absorbing the
   external successful experiences and lessons, it insists on its
   leadership position and the leading role of government as well as its
   bottom line in reformation.},

Abstract = {Social media has become an important stage for environmental politics
   where different actors seek to shape and contest meanings. Meaning
   making on social media is studied through an empirical study of a
   controversial coal seam gas project in Australia. Key Facebook pages
   associated with opposing viewpoints on this controversy are analyzed
   using the dramaturgical concepts of scripting and staging. The analysis
   reveals that the Facebook performances are multisensory, staged to
   appear personal, and tightly scripted. It is argued that although these
   characteristics serve an important solidarity function among like-minded
   individuals and groups, they leave limited space or tolerance for
   counter-scripts. This in-depth empirical analysis suggests that social
   media platforms are transforming the way publics form and meet, but
   their capacity to bridge opposing viewpoints on divisive issues remains
   limited.},

Abstract = {Recent studies in international relations (IR) have devoted little
   systematic attention to the personnel of international organizations.
   This article argues that the works of Max Weber could provide an
   orientation for future research on the cohesion and autonomy of the
   staff in international bureaucracies. In his writings, Weber highlights
   the role of bureaucratic officials as an occupational status group or
   Berufsstand distinguished by their professional ethics, privileged
   positions, practices of social closure and a particular style of life,
   which is expressed in a claim to social prestige. Weber suggests a
   sociological analysis of bureaucratic staff, whose group character is
   determined by their occupation and profession. The article outlines
   Weber's understanding of the administrative official by revisiting his
   seminal sociological and political writings. The added value of Weber's
   conception for IR is demonstrated with an empirical sketch of the EU
   civil service, which can be analysed as a transnational status group in
   the making.},

Abstract = {Governance is the way in which a society organizes decision-making.
   Advanced societies turn into knowledge democracies where the
   relationships between politics, media and science intensify and change
   continuously. The concept of knowledge democracy embraces participatory
   democracy besides representative democracy, the rise of social media
   besides corporate media, the emergence of transdisciplinary trajectories
   besides classical disciplinary science with complex interactions that
   also change. The quest for sustainable development takes place within
   knowledge democracies, where sustainability covers economic, social and
   ecological issues, whose governance is complex. The future direction and
   content of sustainable development depend on uncertain future
   determinants such as technological innovation and the evolution of
   social values. The precautionary principle as a powerful moral
   imperative has its limitations. The multidimensional nature of
   sustainability requires integration and a recognition of a multilevel,
   multiscale, multidisciplinary character. Development refers to change,
   transitions and transformations. Governance of sustainable development
   has to cope with complex dynamics. Governance that furthers transitions
   focuses on the interaction between representative and participatory
   democracy, and the optimalization of the contribution of science. This
   chapter addresses the specific consequences for science, in particular
   the organization of science, relating both to disciplinary research and
   transdisciplinarity.},

Abstract = {Corporatism is an important concept in comparative research. However,
   crucial questions about trends of corporatism and its impact cannot be
   tested because time-variant indexes are out of date or cover only a
   small sample of countries. In this study, a corporatism index is
   developed and applied to 42 countries on an annual basis from 1960 to
   2010. The application of this index demonstrates that there is no
   decline of corporatism over the past five decades. However, the model
   states - above all Sweden - reduced corporatist arrangements. In
   contrast, other countries, such as in the Benelux region, increased
   their degree of corporatism and new corporatist states like Slovenia and
   South Africa emerged. The index developed in this article may be a
   helpful tool for many scholars in the fields of political economy and
   macro-comparative politics. It makes a dynamic analysis concerning the
   status of corporatism as dependent and independent variable possible.},

Abstract = {While there is little doubt that international public administrations
   (IPAs) exert autonomous influence on international policy outputs,
   scholars struggle with the problem of how to measure this influence.
   Established methods for assessing political influence are of limited use
   when focusing on international bureaucracies. The main reason is that
   IPAs do not explicitly state their policy preferences. Instead, they
   tend to present themselves as neutral administrators, aiming to
   facilitate intergovernmental agreement. They normally act `behind the
   scenes'. We propose social network analysis (SNA) as an alternative
   method for assessing the hidden influence of international treaty
   secretariats. SNA infers influence from an actor's relative position in
   issue-specific communication networks. We illustrate the application and
   usefulness of this method in a case study on the role of the United
   Nations climate secretariat in a policy-oriented Twitter debate on
   incorporating gender issues into the global climate policy regime.},

Abstract = {The Sino-Finnish relations are primarily driven by commercial interests
   from the side of Finland. For China, Finland is probably also seen as a
   relatively harmless partner by China. Nonetheless, China's core
   interests are reflected even in the Sino-Finnish bilateral relations.
   China remains sensitive to indications which disdain its position as
   equal to other major powers. Taking the current financial crisis and
   economic stagnation in Europe into account, China's continuous economic
   growth is vital for the European economy. Because the Chinese government
   sees stability as a crucial condition for economic growth, China's
   stability is more than just indirectly in the interests of Europe, the
   Nordic countries included. The question then becomes: how far will any
   individual countries - taken that they may have competing commercial
   interests - be ready to go in giving at least implicit support to
   China's measures in upholding its internal stability?},

   governing rationalities of counterinsurgency in Somalia},
Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},

Volume = {4},

Pages = {99-117},
Abstract = {This article examines the contemporary interconnections between the
   politics of peacebuilding and the politics of counterinsurgent warfare
   in Somalia. Differing from much of the existing critical literature on
   Somalia that emphasises problems associated with top-down orthodox
   stabilisation approaches, this article explores the trajectories of
   counterinsurgent warfare that places `the local' at the centre of
   intervention and work on logics of `small footprints', hybridity and
   complexity. Here, it is no longer primarily the state and its
   institutions but the population and the everyday of `the local', in and
   of itself, which constitutes the key object for counterinsurgency
   interventions, and as such the new main battle space in which
   insurgencies are to be defeated. In the context of these human-centred
   approaches to overcoming `subversion', the means and ends of
   peacebuilding and those of `everyday warfare' are becoming increasingly

Pages = {598-619},
Abstract = {With the advent of the new violent dissident merger, The IRA/New IRA,
   the group and its affiliates have had to legitimise their new existence.
   They have utilised the maintenance of paramilitary activity to achieve
   this. However, they have also produced a number of organisational
   statements, justifying their position, tactics, and strategies. This
   article analyses the evolution of these statements, both pre and
   post-merger from 2007 to 2015. 126 individual statements and four
   magazines are analysed using grounded theory. This analysis found that
   the statements have a dual strategy, aiming to foster trust in the
   movement and distrust in their perceived enemies. One of the dominant
   ways in which the group aims to foster trust is by proposing their
   possession of an historical mandate from the republican forefathers of
   1916, as well as the internally lauded paramilitaries from The
   Troubles-era Provisional Irish Republican Army. The focus of the
   distrust narrative has been on the constitutional nationalism of Sinn
   Fein. However, it also pours scorn on the Police Service of Northern
   Ireland, and capitalism, across the island of Ireland. The analysis of
   these statements can provide us with an understanding of the future
   direction of the group, as well as giving us insight, which can inform
   the development of any counter-narrative.},

Abstract = {The surge of American states' adoption of policies to mitigate climate
   change in the late 1990s and 2000s appeared to constitute a first wave
   of expanding use of market-based policy tools such as carbon
   cap-and-trade in the absence of binding federal constraints. Instead, a
   substantial number of states have rescinded earlier policy commitments,
   as have Canadian provincial partners, while others have remained engaged
   or even expanded their policies. This article examines the durability of
   the three regional cap-and-trade zones that were established with
   comparable structure and intent but met very different fates. The
   analysis of these regional entities places particular emphasis on their
   political resilience across election cycles, their ability to be
   flexible and adapt administratively through mid-course adjustments, and
   their capacity to build constituency support through benefit-allocation
   to offset opposition linked to cost imposition.},

Booktitle = {RIGHTS: CONCEPTS AND CONTEXTS},
Series = {International Library of Essays on Rights},
Year = {2016},
Pages = {51-67},
Abstract = {Pursuing the so-called political account of human rights, this talk
   first explains some aspects of the relations between legal and moral
   rights, and between rights and interests, and then applies the analysis
   to provide an explanation of human rights. Using the rights to health
   and to education as examples, it rejects the traditional theory that
   takes human rights to be rights that people have in virtue of their
   humanity alone. But human rights are synchronically universal. They are
   rights which all people living today have, a feature that is a
   precondition of, and a result of, the fact that they set limits to state
   sovereignty and justify accountability across borders. Human rights
   function in the international arena to underline the worth of all human
   life. They give individual interests a central place in international
   relations, and have become a distinctive ingredient in the emerging
   world order where they generate new channels for political action in the
   international arena. They are by their nature moral rights that call for
   legal-political protection. Needless to say mechanisms for their
   protection should be efficient, reliable and fair, or they may cause
   more harm than good. Moral rights that cannot be fairly and effectively
   protected though legal processes are not human rights. The discussion of
   these points highlights the fact that the political account of human
   rights takes their existence to be contingent on social, economic and
   cultural factors, and the rights to health and to education are used to
   illustrate this dependence on factual contingencies. The fast-changing
   structures of the international scene include changes and challenges in
   the content and protection of human rights. The paper concludes with a
   discussion of the difficulties that cultural diversity creates for
   identifying the content of such rights, and for devising mechanisms for
   their protection.},

   party state ownership steering of SOEs},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {74},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {There are to main views on the relationship between Chinese state-owned
   enterprises (SOEs) and the party-state. One perception is that the SOEs
   are foot soldiers, i.e. tools of the government. A different perspective
   is that SOEs are powerful and autonomous agents of their own. According
   to this view the SOEs behave in much of the same way as private
   enterprises. In this paper the foundation for each of these positions is
   outlined. Thereafter, a third perspective, which includes elements from
   the two main positions, is proposed. The conclusion is that the SOEs
   operate as profit-seeking actors in their day to day activities, but
   Beijing disposes control mechanisms that ensure that the enterprises
   carry out state policies. The main sources of control are to be found in
   the CCP. Under Xi Jinping the party-state is increasingly getting the
   upper hand in its relationship with the SOEs.},

Abstract = {The second chapter provides a new historical account of the formation of
   EU polity, one that identifies ``independent institutions{''} as the
   bedrock for Europe's government. Drawing on recent socio-historical
   research, it exemplifies how, from the.196os onwards, the ambitious
   jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice, the increasingly
   numerous regulations of the European Commission and later on the
   monetary decisions of European Central Bank have jointly set the stage
   for a transnational polity relatively autonomous from Member States.
   Relatedly, the chapter identifies ``independence{''} and ``expertise{''}
   as the very terrain on which Europe's special political legitimacy and
   specialized public sphere has been invented and consolidated.},

Abstract = {Many contemporary academics and policy analysts have revisited the
   Anglo-German rivalry before 1914 to predict what may await China and the
   United States in the twenty-first century. However, few, if indeed any,
   have specified in what sense this comparison can be made. This paper
   attempts to fill this gap with a detailed analysis of the strategic
   parallels between the Anglo-German rivalry then and the China-US
   competition now through the lens of the Crowe Memorandum. The author
   argues that the basic parallel between the rise of Germany and the rise
   of China lies in the challenges they posed or pose to the dominant
   maritime power and system leader - Great Britain then and the United
   States today. This parallel also explains the similarity between the
   Triple Entente initiated by Great Britain prior to 1914 and the
   Rebalance to Asia launched by the United States in 2011. Furthermore, as
   in the case of the Anglo-German rivalry before 1914, the most crucial
   problem underlying the mounting China-US competition in recent years has
   been America's deepening apprehension about the development of China's
   anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) and naval capabilities. This
   development, from the US perspective, is threatening to deprive the US
   of its most crucial instrument to influence the strategic equilibrium on
   the East Asian littorals. Based on the lessons of the Anglo-German
   rivalry prior to 1914, the essay also examines the potential for
   mitigating, if not eliminating, the mounting competition and misgivings
   between China and the United States.},

Title = {Watching Chinese politics under the mirror of the end of
   history-dialogue with Francis Fukuyama on his reflections on
   Chinese governance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {1},
Number = {3},
Pages = {520-533},
Abstract = {Francis Fukuyama wrote Reflections of Chinese Governance technically for
   Chinese readers to understand his ideas in an accurate way. I think it
   is not true to say that the existence of rule of law depends on religion
   according to the development of knowledge and the history of law.
   Meanwhile, the hypothesis still needs to be discussed that the
   government accountability only appears through the vote, because the
   government by vote only leads to stability in some degree but
   ineffective governance in almost all of the underdeveloped countries. A
   government without governance cannot be called accountable; it even has
   no morality if we consider Huntington's idea. It seems that Fukuyama's
   Three Institutional Pillars should be seen as a revisited version of the
   End of History. For instance, it is not objectionable to conclude that
   China lacks the facts of rule of law since it has no judicial
   independence since these developing countries that have a constitutional
   court even perform worse than China. It is obvious that we should not
   simply judge the facts of rule of law by this single standard.
   Meanwhile, China is always criticized that it lacks accountability;
   however, the responsiveness of Chinese government to people's appeals
   might be the most prompt and comprehensive in all of the developing
   countries. Fukuyama's knowledge about China remains locked into the old
   impression of China as viewed by the western world. In fact, the
   accurate way of understanding China should be `finding history in
   China'. I agree that whatever regime it is, it needs to be reformed and
   changed with time. As for Chinese government, the reform does not happen
   in a single field of the rule of law as Fukuyama mentioned, but in the
   whole government to establish a limited government with capacity as a
   goal in the future.},

Abstract = {What drives regulatees' behaviors when the institution of law is weak?
   This study seeks to answer the question by examining environmental
   regulation enforcement in China. Based on survey and interview data on
   Hong Kong-owned manufacturing enterprises in the Pearl River Delta
   Region, Guangdong Province, we found that their decisions to adopt basic
   and proactive environmental management practices were less driven by
   concerns for legality than by their perceptions of the regulators'
   actions and gestures. Enterprises adopted basic environmental practices
   to avoid potential punishment and more proactive practices to avoid
   potentially arbitrary impositions from regulatory officials. Regulated
   enterprises were more likely to adopt both basic and proactive
   environmental practices if they had less difficulties in understanding
   the enforced regulations. These findings suggest important ways in which
   regulatory compliance behaviors in a developmental context may differ
   from those in Western countries.},

Abstract = {Although basic income has surged in policy interest in recent years,
   political research has not kept up with the debate in the trenches. In
   this article, we tackle a political problem any enacting coalition must
   face: how to ensure the political stability of a basic income over time.
   We first demonstrate how basic income schemes are particularly
   vulnerable to processes of policy change discussed in the recent policy
   feedback literature. We then analyse whether constitutionalising basic
   income in a Bill of Rights protected by strong judicial review would
   offer a valuable route for boosting basic income's stability. A careful
   examination of the decision-making process within judicial review
   suggests that, caught up in a dilemma between judicial restraint and
   judicial activism, an enacting coalition would do well not to rely on
   constitutional mechanisms as the sole avenue for ensuring the political
   stability of basic income.},

Title = {The rise of European right radicalism: The case of Jobbik},

Volume = {49},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {345-357},

Abstract = {Based on the qualitative research of elite interviews and narrative
   analysis of Hungarian documents, the main aim of this article is
   twofold: (1) to elucidate the transformation of Jobbik from a marginal
   extra-parliamentary youth focused movement to an influential
   parliamentary party; (2) to discuss the impact of Jobbik's ascension on
   the main centre right Fidesz only as a pre-conclusion. It argues that
   the rise of Jobbik is not a protest phenomenon that simply demonstrates
   a social disenchantment with the transitional economy. Jobbik's
   transformation is a unique post-Communist political development that is
   rooted in elements of Hungarian nationalism. These national elements
   include underlying social prejudice against Roma and Jews, a preference
   for paternalistic economic systems, and even attraction to the
   historical narrative of mythic Turanism in the debate over the origins
   of Hungarian national identity. Jobbik manipulates all of these national
   elements for the transformation of its own party identity, emerging as a
   main challenger to the Fidesz. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Abstract = {Does descriptive representation matter? We analyze the impact of
   descriptive representation on regime support among women and the
   self-identified indigenous population in Latin America. We find that
   having a female president does not have a consistent impact on regime
   support among Latin American women, but that the election of an
   indigenous president has significantly boosted regime support among
   indigenous people in Bolivia. We suggest that ethnic representation has
   had a greater impact than gender representation on regime support in the
   region for a couple of reasons. First, in Latin America, ethnicity is
   much more highly correlated than gender with other variables that are
   known to shape political attitudes, such as class, education, region,
   and area of residence. Second, ethnicity has been a more salient factor
   in elections and governing than has gender in those countries that have
   elected indigenous or female presidents.},

Abstract = {Civil wars often feature insurgent groups with external sponsors. Yet,
   we know little about the impact of such sponsorship on insurgent
   cohesion. Indeed, researchers disagree about the conditions under which
   state sponsorship encourages or discourages organizational splits. This
   article presents a theory that reconciles these disagreements. I focus
   on how the allocation of external resources affects the intra-group
   distribution of power between rebel leaders and their internal rivals.
   Sponsors that help maintain an imbalance of power in favor of the leader
   foster cohesion; those that help flip the imbalance in favor of a rival
   increase the likelihood of an internal coup within the group. Only when
   sponsors contribute to a shift from an imbalance of power to balanced
   power is the rebel group more likely to split into competing
   organizations. I further argue that sponsors reallocate their resources
   in favor of a rebel leader's internal rival in order to punish the
   leader for undesired behavior. Case studies of two major insurgent
   groups-the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/ Army and the Lebanese
   Hezbollah-illustrate the explanatory power of my argument.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the role of non-state actors (NSAs) in
   European Union (EU) foreign policy, focusing on how they contribute to
   the emergence and codification of new frames that underpin EU external
   policies. It argues that changes in EU foreign policy are the result of
   interactions among a frame entrepreneur, often played by an NSA, and
   policy-makers in situations of cognitive uncertainty and when a policy
   window opens. The empirical evidence is based on the case of EU-Israel
   relations: a non-governmental orgaization (NGO) called MATTIN Group
   acted as frame entrepreneur and contributed to the emergence and
   codification of a new frame of understanding of EU-Israel relations,
   redefining them on the basis of a legal paradigm. This clarifies the
   territorial scope of bilateral agreements and ensures that the bilateral
   relations are constructed and implemented in accordance with EU legal
   framework and its commitments under international law.},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {The `rise of China' means that - once again - China plays a pivotal role
   in international affairs. China's economic weight and growing political
   influence means that its foreign policies and the ideas that shape them
   have major consequences for established ideas about `global governance'.
   Rather than accepting the institutional and ideational status quo,
   however, Chinese policy makers are actively trying to develop a new
   international order through the creation of new institutions such as the
   Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the `One Belt, One Road'

Abstract = {As a social movement strategy, intersectionality is used to foster the
   inclusion and representation of minority groups. In this article, we
   examine how Quebecois women's organizations use intersectionality as a
   tool to include immigrant and Native women. We argue that
   intersectionality can entail different practices with potentially
   conflicting goals. We conclude that social movement scholars would
   benefit from paying attention to intersectionality and to how it is
   practised by activists and organizations. Indeed, a focus on
   intersectionality sheds light on the tensions inherent in the processes
   by which organizations construct collective identities, formulate
   political demands, manage internal conflicts and build alliances.},

Abstract = {This article draws on the author's experience of teaching African
   Studies to undergraduate South African students in order to reFLect on
   some of the key challenges facing teachers of African Studies, both in
   South Africa and beyond. In particular, it discusses challenges relating
   to teaching a field as contested as African Studies, looking at whether
   teaching African alternatives to mainstream African politics is helpful
   and at whether and how one can teach Africa in a way that encourages and
   develops critical thinking. The article also explores how the racial
   politics of the context in which one teaches African Studies inevitably
   affects the way in which students engage with the content of the course.
   While the article discusses these issues in relation to the South
   African higher education context in particular, implications for other
   contexts are also highlighted.},

Abstract = {This paper reviews the existing comparative literature with regard to
   differences and similarities of policy diffusion between democratic and
   authoritarian regimes. There has been an extensive discussion of causes
   and effects of policy diffusion for democracies, but the literature on
   autocracies lacks similar focus and scope. Similarly, research on the
   patterns and causes of policies' diffusion across regime types is
   virtually non-existent. After some theoretical considerations about
   regime effects on diffusion in the first part of this paper, we analyse
   data on foreign trade regulations and nuclear power plants and compare
   results across regime types. Based on cross-time cross-section
   regression models, we can show that, depending on the specific policy
   field, regime type is of less importance for diffusion processes than
   theoretically expected. This highlights a need for further detailed
   research on the general role of regime type regarding policy diffusion.},

Abstract = {This article critically examines the interrelationship of values and
   emotions in international relations. It focuses on the different meaning
   of affects and emotions, and theorizes about the affective qualities of
   values in world politics. It defines affective values as values that
   arise from the ceaseless, unconscious striving(s) to contest the outside
   control over one's life. In doing so, it distinguishes between negative
   affective values, which represent the evocation of fear, shame, and
   distrust to shape and project the creative energies of resistance, and
   positive affective values that signify the material and practical
   strategies that convert these energies into an awareness of one's
   insecurity in the world. The article argues that the tension between
   positive and negative affective values allows us to understand the
   transformative link between emotions and values. By focusing on the norm
   of humanitarian intervention, it contextualizes positive affective
   values in terms of the new resilience initiative of the Responsibility
   to Protect (R2P).},

Abstract = {The study evaluates the processes of regional income convergence in
   Poland. This problem is considered from the angle of the key development
   gaps separating the regions of Eastern Poland from other more
   economically developed regions of the country. The EU Structural Funds
   allocated significant resources in 2004-2014 to re-duce these gaps,
   including under the Operational Programme Development of Eastern Poland
   (OP DEP 2007-2013), specially designed for this purpose. It was shown
   that there has been significant progress in reducing de-velopment gaps
   during the period in question, including in relation to: expenditure on
   R\&D in relation to GDP, economic activity of the population and the
   development of road infrastructure. Progress in this area would not be
   possible without the support of EU funds. Even though the scope and
   scale of positive changes prevented regional convergence, they
   contributed to inhibiting the processes of further income polarization
   between regions.},

Abstract = {The document proposes a focus to analyze the conformity of policy making

   to the analysis are the categories structure y operating, furthermore
   the federal theory. The first is the formal structure of a federal
   system, and the second is its expected operating as federalism. This
   understanding allows identifying the features of policy making of
   national concurrent policies in a federal system, and building a policy
   design analysis model, called federalist perspective.
   The argued thesis is that in a federal system, the federated entities,
   as recognized partners, by own right can participate in the making of
   national concurrent policies. This participation is crucial to call its

Abstract = {The British government has restructured Britain's electricity markets
   through a programme of electricity market reform (EMR). Energy security
   and climate change mitigation are public goods that are prioritised.
   Cultural theory (CT) is used to explain changes in the regulatory regime
   under EMR. EMR involves an incomplete shift from `individualist' to
   `hierarchical' frames of regulation. Conflicts between these frames
   hamper the institutional design of EMR. This has obstructed deployment
   of nuclear power. Policymakers must fit the cultural framing to suit
   their preferred public good and not expect a defined public good to
   emerge from a preferred mix of cultural bias.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes what the Westminster system actually means for
   civil services in historical context and contemporary practice. It
   explores the way in which practitioners, both politicians and civil
   servants, interpreted Westminster's implications and used them as
   justification, defense, and sometimes camouflage for their
   administrative choices in a range of jurisdictions. The article then
   uses the example of senior appointments to show why these nuanced
   interpretations are significant. Its principal finding is that the
   continued value of Westminster lies in its ability to provide a
   framework and discourse without being prescriptive or precise for
   particular circumstances. It is sufficiently flexible to be able to
   evolve with the needs of each generation yet continues to frame a sense
   of identity and purpose in how it is applied in abstract and practice.},

Abstract = {A prominent international-relations theory posits that mutual optimism,
   due to two sides holding divergent estimates of their relative
   bargaining power, causes interstate conflict. We develop a theory of
   mutual optimism in which conflicting bargaining power estimates arise
   from asymmetric information about which, if any, third parties will join
   either side in a military dispute. We contend that secret alliances can
   generate mutual optimism, which increases the probability of conflict.
   By exploiting secret alliances as a measurable source of private
   information, we provide the first systematic test of mutual optimism
   that directly assesses a state's secret capabilities. Optimism exists
   when a state's secret allies are more numerous or powerful than
   anticipated by opponents. Our empirical tests-as well as robustness
   checks-strongly support our theoretical expectation. We conclude that
   mutual optimism is an empirically, as well as theoretically, important
   cause of interstate conflict.},

Abstract = {Electoral institutions shape the incentives of governments to rely on
   distributive measures and to comply with international obligations
   because of the misalignment they may engender between the collective
   objectives of a government party and the individual objectives of its
   members in the legislature. We use this argument to explain the puzzle
   of unlawful state aid measures in the European Union (EU). Existing
   theories of EU compliance and implementation offer no convincing
   explanation to their persistence and patterns. Using data from 2000 to
   2012, we find that an increase of district magnitude improves
   compliance. However, compliance decreases with higher magnitude where
   either party leaders have no control over the ballot rank or other
   electoral rules strengthen the incentives to search for a personal vote.
   We also provide evidence for the effects of electoral reforms on
   compliance. These results have implications for the broader literature
   on compliance with international regimes.},

Abstract = {Proposed large-scale intentional interventions in natural systems in
   order to counter climate change, typically called ``climate
   engineering{''} or ``geoengineering,{''} stand to dramatically alter the
   international politics of climate change and potentially much more.
   There is currently a significant and growing literature on the
   international politics of climate engineering. However, it has been
   produced primarily by scholars from outside the discipline of
   International Relations (IR). We are concerned that IR scholars are
   missing a critical opportunity to offer insights into, and perhaps help
   shape, the emerging international politics of climate engineering. To
   that end, the primary goal of this paper is to call the attention of the
   IR community to these developments. Thus, we offer here an overview of
   the existing literature on the international politics of climate
   engineering and a preliminary assessment of its strengths and lacunae.
   We trace several key themes in this corpus, including problem structure,
   the concern that climate engineering could undermine emissions cuts, the
   potentially ``slippery slope{''} of research and development, unilateral
   implementation, interstate conflict, militarization, rising tensions
   between industrialized and developing countries, and governance
   challenges and opportunities. The international politics of climate
   engineering is then considered through the lenses of the leading IR
   theories (Realism, Institutionalism, Liberalism, and Constructivism),
   exploring both what they have contributed and possible lines of future
   inquiry. Disciplinary IR scholars should have much to say on a number of
   topics related to climate engineering, including its power and
   transformational potentials, the possibility of counter-climate
   engineering, issues of institutional design, international law, and
   emergent practices. We believe that it is incumbent on the IR community,
   whose defining focus is international relations, to turn its attention
   to these unprecedented technologies and to the full scope of possible
   ramifications they might have for the international system.},

Abstract = {Investigations into Central Europe's emerging party-state
   relationshipsin contrast to those of the former Soviet Unionhave focused
   less on the abuse of public office for private gain and more on
   patronage and clientelism as political resources. That debate in turn
   has been bounded by the conventional political science preoccupation
   with civil society, party, and state relations. This article contends
   that these conventions have tended to deflect our attention from the
   contemporary dynamics of political corruption in Central Europe, in
   which the commercial sector is a major player and the gains of political
   players primarily private. Building on the assumption that party
   systemic adaptations are contingent on changing power relations within
   the political economy, this article offers an ideal typical party model
   to characterise the behaviour of political parties that preside over the
   continuous marketization of the state. A corporate brokerage party
   directs its strategic focus to the private sector and acts primarily as
   a broker of the state's power in the marketplace, whether expressed
   through privatisation, regulation, or public procurement. Using the
   Czech Republic as a critical case study for Central Europe, the evidence
   suggests that politicians able to direct allocation to the private
   sector with low regulatory constraints act less evidently as
   technocratic brokers of the public interest, partisan constituency, or
   organisation builders and more as private agents.},

Abstract = {Political science and international relations scholarship increasingly
   places substantive emphasis on, to put it broadly, the power of
   discourse in shaping world politics. This Special Issue develops a
   research agenda that seeks to consolidate a set of data collection and
   analysis strategies that can be used in studying the way in which
   elite-driven discourses are legitimated and challenged - in other words,
   an agenda for studying everyday narratives in world politics. In doing
   so, the Special Issue makes a threefold contribution: it analyses how
   key themes with world politics are reproduced and narrated; it
   demonstrates the need to go beyond methodological elitism' in
   understanding narratives, legitimacy, and world politics; and it
   highlights some of the methodological and practical issues in
   researching everyday narratives. In this introductory article, we
   situate the Special Issue within a critique of constructivist
   methodology broadly conceived, conceptualise everyday sites of politics,
   and finally, provide an overview of the articles in the issue.},

Abstract = {Two central governance challenges are directing leadership attention to
   performance data and the management of diversity. This article examines
   connections between the two, asking if the introduction of diversity, as
   a form of organizational change, is associated with greater leadership
   use of performance data. Diversity is theorized as a double-edged sword
   for organizations, generating greater innovation, creativity, and
   performance, but also conflict. We propose that leaders will be
   motivated to use performance data to understand, manage, and explain the
   effects of diversity. To study this question, we employ a randomized
   controlled field experiment where organizations are assigned new
   employees that bring role and educational diversity. We find that
   leaders are more responsive to these two types of functional diversity
   when they view their organization as lacking an innovative
   organizational culture.},

Abstract = {National and local governments are harmonizing the regional policies to
   enable balanced development of regions. Related research is questioning
   whether priority should be given to information and communication
   technologies in the implementation of the Smart Specialization Strategy
   in a regional level. The objective of this article is to find out
   whether ICTs have any impact on key tourism statistical performance
   indicators. Such an impact would justify the priority of ICT in regional
   policies. 2.181 tourism industry entities were checked for web presence;
   the region of the entity's activity was recorded. The correlation
   between the on-line presence and the key statistical indicators was
   analyzed. Only 655 (30 \%) are present on the Internet by a means of a
   web page. There is a strong positive correlation (tau b=0,656, p<0,05)
   between the online presence and the number of tourist arrivals in a
   region. The analysis has exposed a stunning fact that less than one
   third of entities active in tourism sector are present on the Internet.
   There is a clear need for priority to be given to ICTs in the
   implementation stage of the smart specialization strategy on the
   regional levels.},

Abstract = {How to evaluate local government or what really matters concerning local
   government evaluation and who cares about it are questions which are on
   the table currently across the world. This paper carry out a survey on
   the wide range of indicators and evaluation models of local government
   used worldwide and shows that they are based mainly on performance
   evaluation and financial sustainability ratios. We conclude that they
   address only part of the problem of strategic management, financing, and
   sustainable development issues of local government. In particular, the
   governance dimension is absent. Therefore, a broader vision is proposed
   that integrates our usual local government evaluation into the important
   issues of governance and sustainability. This article focus on
   ``measuring what matters{''} in local government and presents the need
   of a new evaluation model, a Councils' Sustainability Index, based on
   the integration of council's financial performance with communities'
   sustainability and governance dimensions. Thus, it might be an important
   contribution for the creation of a new paradigm on local government
   evaluation and councils' strategic management. The Portuguese case is
   used to illustrate this purpose.},

Abstract = {The idea that political action takes place in a volatile context, which
   constrains decisions and affects outcomes, is an essential aspect of
   Niccolo Machiavelli's political thought. In fact, historical forces such
   as fortune and irony play a central role in many of his works. He sees
   fortuna as the force that conditions political action and tends to
   thwart it. Machiavelli's attempt to describe the limits of freedom and
   the dilemmas imposed by these limits on political action has been echoed
   by Martin Wight in his essay `Fortune's Banter'. By presenting a
   critical appraisal of political realism and a rejection of political
   determinism, this article tries to assess Machiavelli's legacy in
   Wight's thought. I aim to show how Machiavelli's ideas represent a
   cornerstone of Wight's analysis, which is based on classical notions
   such as irony, tragedy, necessity and, of course, fortune. Drawing on an
   in-depth analysis of Wight's so-far unpublished work, this article also
   examines some crucial aspects of the causal and moral complexity that
   surrounds political action and its analysis.},

Abstract = {The article advances three options to create new ways for thinking about
   humanity. First, reject humanity and view interconnectedness as state
   centric rather than human centric, with international law upheld as the
   bedrock institution of international society. Second, thin humanity puts
   forward a reductionist view that the value of humankind lies in the
   human worth of its members - human beings. In short, humanity is the sum
   of its parts. Third, thick humanity, which views humankind as an
   independent value in its own right. From this perspective, the value of
   humanity lies in its ubiquity, which reveals that it is not just more,
   it is different, to the sum of its parts. It is important to note that
   this is not a purely theoretical issue. One's view of humanity shapes
   one's view of whether citizens of one state should care for the citizens
   of another, which lies at the heart of contemporary debates over issues
   such as the responsibility to protect, human security, and
   redistributive justice. In so doing, the article speaks to broader
   debates on humanity that reflects the need for greater interdisciplinary
   research in the future.},

Abstract = {Resigning from office can have a deeply moral dimension, whether to make
   amends for an unethical deed or to avoid having to carry one out. It is
   therefore no surprise that those calling for a restoration of morality
   in public affairs should stress the virtues of resigning. Is it always
   morally responsible to resign on ethical grounds, however? This paper
   argues against this Manichean stance. Instead, loosely borrowing from
   Aristotle's theory of the mean, it asserts the proximity of vice and
   virtue in many instances, rendering the decision-making process more
   complex than following some simple ethical rules.},

Abstract = {To reach agreement, international negotiators often compromise by using
   flexible language: they make controversial provisions vague, or add
   options and caveats. Does flexibility in agreement language influence
   subsequent state behavior? If so, do states follow both firm and
   flexible language somewhat, as negotiators hope? Or do governments
   respond strategically, increasing their energies on firmly specified
   tasks, and reducing their efforts on flexibly specified ones? Testing
   theories about agreement language is difficult because states often
   reserve flexible language for controversial provisions. To make causal
   claims, we study an unusually drafted agreement in which states had
   almost no opportunity to dilute agreement language. We examine the
   influence of the 1991 Paris Principles on the Design of National Human
   Rights Institutions (NHRIs), using an original data set of twenty-two
   institutional safeguards of NHRIs in 107 countries, and case studies. We
   find that variations in agreement language can have large effects on
   state behavior, even when the entire agreement is nonbinding. Both
   democracies and authoritarian states followed the principles' firm terms
   closely. However, authoritarian states either ignored or reduced their
   efforts on flexibly specified tasks. If flexibly specifying a task is no
   different from omitting it altogether, as our data suggest, the costs of
   compromise are much greater than previously believed.},

Abstract = {Political decentralization is often argued to strengthen political
   accountability by bringing government closer to the people. Social and
   civic institutions at the local level, such as lineage associations,
   temples, churches, or social clubs, can make it easier for citizens to
   monitor officials and hold them accountable. This article argues that
   strong social institutions also empower local elites who may use their
   informal influence to control their group and capture rents. Drawing on
   evidence from case studies of Chinese villages, the article shows that
   lineage group leaders who become village officials use their combination
   of social and political authority to confiscate villagers' land.
   Evidence from a survey experiment suggests that endorsement of a land
   confiscation plan by lineage elites elicits greater compliance with
   property seizures. A national survey indicates that when a lineage
   leader becomes a village cadre, it is associated with a 14 to 20 percent
   increase in the likelihood of a land expropriation. The findings
   demonstrate how informal institutions and local civil society can be
   tools of top-down political control.},

Abstract = {Many anticorruption campaigns aim to encourage citizens to demand better
   control over corruption. Recent literature suggests that perceived high
   levels of corruption and government effectiveness in controlling
   corruption will limit citizens' willingness to actively oppose
   corruption. Using Transparency International's 2013 Global Corruption
   Barometer, we test these ideas across a 71-country sample. We find that
   perceived government effectiveness tends to encourage anticorruption
   civic action, while perceptions of corruption being widespread tend to
   have the opposite impact in non-OECD countries. Our analyses also
   suggest that the interaction between these perceptions is important; we
   find that, especially among those who perceive that the level of
   corruption is high, when confidence in the government's efforts grows,
   so does their willingness fight corruption.},

Title = {Ratification as accommodation? Domestic dissent and human rights
   treaties},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {53},

Pages = {582-596},

Abstract = {Repression is the expected response to anti-government protest; however,
   leaders can also accommodate demonstrators. Committing to human rights
   treaties is considered in this environment, where treaty commitments are
   conceptualized as a policy concession that leaders can grant dissenters.
   Past research has shown that top-down domestic pressures, such as new
   democratic regimes, can influence treaty commitments. This article
   extends this line of research by considering the influence of bottom-up
   domestic pressure, arguing that nonviolent, pro-democracy movements can
   pressure leaders into concessions, as these movements are risky to
   repress but threatening to ignore. Leaders are expected to seek cheap'
   accommodations, and commitments to human rights treaties provide a
   relatively low-cost concession that also addresses demonstrators'
   pro-democracy demands. Using commitments to the nine core UN human
   rights treaties, results are generally supportive. Governments
   experiencing a nonviolent, pro-democracy movement are consistently
   likely to sign human rights treaties. Ratification is also likely but in
   more limited contexts, and is more closely related to movement success.
   This suggests that bottom-up pressures can influence commitment to human
   rights treaties, but there may be little substance behind those
   concessions. The status quo and cost-averse preferences of leaders lead
   them to grant accommodations that result in minimal change and cost.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, African agriculture sectors have been the object
   of numerous initiatives advancing a `new' Green Revolution for the
   continent. The low productivity of African smallholders is attributed to
   the low use of modern, improved agricultural inputs. In short, African
   countries are expected to catch up with the Green Revolution in other
   parts of the world. This paper is a contribution to the debate on the
   new African Green Revolution. We analyse the Rwandan Crop
   Intensification Programme (CIP) as a case study of the application of
   the African Green Revolution model. The paper is based on research at
   the macro, meso and micro levels. We argue that the CIP fails to draw
   lessons from previous Green Revolution experiences in terms of its
   effects on social differentiation, on ecological sustainability, and on
   knowledge exchange and creation.},

Abstract = {In light of the post-intervention crisis in Libya, this article revisits
   critically the vision of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) offered in
   the 2001 report of the International Commission on Intervention and
   State Sovereignty (ICISS) - frequently taken as the conceptual bedrock
   for R2P doctrine. It is argued that the perverse effect of ICISS
   doctrine is to replace political responsibility with paternalism. The
   demand that states be made accountable to the international community
   ends by making states accountable for their people rather than to their
   people. The argument is developed across five critical theses. These
   include claims that R2P changes the burden of justification for
   intervention, that it usurps popular sovereignty in favour of state
   power, and that it diffuses post-conflict responsibilities. The article
   concludes that pre-emptive human protection' efforts risk crowding out
   questions of systemic transformation, i.e. what kind of an international
   order we want to live in.},

Abstract = {Drawing on uncertainty-identity theory (Hogg, 2012), we explore the
   effects of uncertainty concerning a specific social identity on group
   identification and attitudes toward subgroup integration and separation
   in South Koreans' nested identity context (N5148). All variables were
   measured. Path analysis revealed, as predicted, that superordinate
   identity uncertainty weakened superordinate identification and subgroup
   identity uncertainty weakened subgroup identification. We also found
   that subgroup identity uncertainty strengthened superordinate
   identification. This effect was stronger for those who perceived their
   superordinate group prototype and subgroup prototype to be distinct and
   nonoverlapping. Furthermore, superordinate identity uncertainty
   decreased reunification intentions by weakening superordinate
   identification. Subgroup identity uncertainty increased reunification
   intentions by strengthening superordinate identification only for those
   who perceived their superordinate group prototype and subgroup prototype
   to be distinct and nonoverlapping. Implications for uncertainty identity
   theory and intergroup relations are discussed.},

Abstract = {A key issue for political psychology concerns the processes whereby
   people come to invest psychologically in socially and politically
   significant group identities. Since Durkheim, it has been assumed that
   participation in group-relevant collective events increases one's
   investment in such group identities. However, little empirical research
   explicitly addresses this or the processes involved. We investigated
   these issues in a longitudinal questionnaire study conducted at one of
   the world's largest collective events-a month-long Hindu festival in
   north India (the Magh Mela). Data gathered from pilgrims and comparable
   others who did not attend the event show that one month after the event,
   those who had participated (but not the controls) exhibited heightened
   social identification as a Hindu and increased frequency of prayer
   rituals. Data gathered from pilgrims during the festival predicted these
   outcomes. Specifically, perceptions of sharing a common identity with
   other pilgrims and of being able to enact one's social identity in this
   event helped predict changes in participants' identification and
   behavior. The wider significance of these data for political psychology
   is discussed.},

Abstract = {Several years after the transition to democracy, positive attitudes
   towards the authoritarian past are still observable in Portugal: the
   belief that the previous regime had more good things than bad things is
   expressed by about one-fifthof the Portuguese. What explains this
   nostalgic sentiment? Are factors such as socialisation under the regime,
   party identification or religiosity more important than satisfaction
   with democracy and the state of the economy? The empirical analysis
   suggests that the relevance of these factors varies considerably, but
   socialisation phases lead to different stances on the past both in
   routine times and in times of economic crisis.},

Abstract = {The combined challenges of growing inequality, crisis of the political
   parties system and globalization are generating problems of legitimacy
   for our democracies. The answer cannot be less democracy but better
   democracy. What could be the role of Public Administration (PA) in
   improving the quality of our democracies? This is the question we are
   trying to answer in this article. To do that, we have to begin defining
   and operationalizing the concept of democratic quality. Here too, it
   will be necessary to justify the legitimacy of PA to pursue the
   constitutional and legal values defined for it. Finally, once defined
   the values that PA must pursue and implement in a democracy (fairness,
   transparency, accountability, effectiveness, participation and equity),
   we will proceed to specify the instruments to work with. We will
   conclude linking such tools and values with the key variables of
   democratic quality, verifying their coherence and compatibility.},

Abstract = {Previous findings on punishment have focused on deterministic
   environments in which the outcomes are known with certainty. In this
   article, we conduct experiments to investigate how punishment affects
   cooperation in stochastic social dilemmas where each person can decide
   whether to cooperate, when the outcomes of alternative strategies are
   specified probabilistically. Two types of punishment mechanisms are
   studied: (1) an unrestricted punishment mechanism-both persons can
   punish-and (2) a restricted punishment mechanism-only cooperators can
   punish noncooperators. We compare behavior in a two-person deterministic
   prisoner's dilemma game (DPD) with a two-person stochastic prisoner's
   dilemma (SPD). In all treatments, participants are given information on
   the other person's actions. We find that in both games, the restricted
   punishment mechanism promotes more cooperative behavior than
   unrestricted punishment. However, the difference in the degree of
   effectiveness between the two mechanisms is smaller in the SPD game than
   in the DPD game because noncooperative behavior is less likely to be
   punished when there is outcome uncertainty. Our findings provide useful
   information for designing efficient incentive mechanisms to induce
   cooperation in a stochastic social dilemma environment.},

Abstract = {Scholars of environmental injustice have pushed to see beyond the
   spatial distribution of environmental harms in studies of unwanted land
   uses. Building upon this work, this article examines how the complex
   geographies of environmental injustice play out in a coalition to
   prevent the construction of a coal-fired power plant in Surry County,
   Virginia. While spatially dispersed coalitions of negatively affected
   actors can strengthen efforts to prevent the construction of an unwanted
   land use, they can also perpetuate the environmental injustices
   surrounding it. To make this argument, particular attention is paid to
   the diverse reasons and ways differentially situated actors oppose an
   unwanted land use. It is demonstrated how the disparate concerns and
   differential tactics deployed by actors in coalitions against unwanted
   land uses are often embedded in and potentially contribute to longer
   histories of social injustice.},

Title = {Building Resilient Finance? Uncertainty, complexity, and resistance},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICS \& INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Pages = {370-388},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The article develops a critical analysis of the politics of financial
   resilience as an increasingly prevalent discourse of economic policy and
   practice. Against existing critiques of resilience which focus on the
   neoliberal rationalities and subjectivities that it (apparently)
   perpetuates, we argue that resilience per se does not-of necessity-infer
   any particular form of governance or subjectivity. Instead, resilience
   can be thought of as a sphere of political engagement. An emphasis on
   system, structure, and the relations between actors over time gives
   financial resilience a productive ambiguity: neither structure nor
   subject is ever fully defined and thus remains open. To this end, we
   engage the Bank of England's recent turn to complexity modeling and its
   correlative, somewhat metaphorical, ethos of `clear thinking' in
   `complex times'. This idea of complexity foregrounds the `unknown'
   through positing the unpredictability of system-wide events; however,
   ensuing attempts to `model complexity' entail a closure, rendering
   uncertainty `known' in particular (and limited) ways. Indeed, we
   identify a general disconnect between the radical rhetoric of resilience
   agendas that emphasize complexity and the relative banality of resulting
   policy advice: self-regulation, capital ratios, and so on. We then
   explore how a focus on the `unknown' can also give financial resilience
   an open quality, emphasizing the role of imagination and the diversity
   of agency. Put simply, if financial governance must be imagined, then it
   can be imagined differently. We therefore examine a set of everyday
   attempts to use the openness of resilience/complexity, in order to
   imagine finance in more democratic or communitarian terms. In
   particular, market formations such as local banking, peer lending, and
   wider attempts to politicize financial regulation through documentaries
   like Bank of Dave play on the productive ambiguities of financial
   resilience in critical ways. Such agendas do not exhaust or solve the
   dilemmas identified, but do represent a creative set of attempts to
   engage the politics of finance in inclusive, participatory, and
   reciprocal terms.},

Abstract = {Various explanations have been offered for the commanding electoral
   support that has been enjoyed by the Belarusian president Alyaksandr
   Lukashenka since his original election in 1994. On the evidence of the
   authors' surveys, in particular post-election opinion surveys conducted
   in 2006 and 2011, there is an association between social structural
   variables and electoral support, and between perceptions of government
   economic performance and electoral support, but both largely disappear
   when appropriate controls are introduced. It is personal approval of
   Lukashenka on the part of voters, over and above these other
   circumstances, that makes by far the largest contribution.},

Abstract = {Advances in estimating the costs and benefits of climate change policies
   are a welcome development, but a full-scale cost/benefit analysis that
   seeks to reduce complex value trade-offs to a single metric of net
   benefit maximization hides many important public policy issues,
   especially for disasters and catastrophes that are large, discontinuous,
   irreversible and uncertain. States should obtain public input on such
   policies. These policies involve value trade-offs that can be informed
   by technocratic estimates of costs, benefits and risk. However, such
   analyses cannot, in principle, be reduced to a single recommendation
   that maximizes net benefits'. Politicians must make value trade-offs
   informed both by technocrats and by public input.},

Abstract = {How has EU trade policy responded to the protracted economic crisis
   starting in 2008? Unlike during the Great Depression of the 1930s,
   politicians have not resorted to protectionist measures to try to
   contain the downturn. The response has been just the opposite, with the
   dominant discourse arguing that in times of austerity and private
   deleveraging, trade liberalisation is indispensable for restoring
   growth. Adopting a historical-institutionalist perspective, we argue
   that the crisis has had an asymmetric effect on the two most important
   subsystems of EU trade policy. On the one hand, the EU took a leap
   forward on the path of bilateral free trade liberalisation by starting
   negotiations with the US, Canada and Japan. On the other hand, proposals
   to continue with permissive reforms for the adoption of trade defence
   measures and to give the EU more leverage vis-a-vis emerging economies
   have been blocked. We thus conclude that EU trade policy after the
   crisis has shown asymmetric continuity, where the liberalisation trend
   has been resumed more radically while accompanying defensive reforms to
   ease the potential pain of liberalisation have run into a stalemate.},

Abstract = {The study of policy reform has tended to focus on single-stage reforms
   taking place over a relatively short period. Recent research has drawn
   attention to gradual policy changes unfolding over extended periods. One
   strategy of gradual change is layering, in which new policy dimensions
   are introduced by adding new policy instruments or by redesigning
   existing ones to address new concerns. The limited research on
   single-stage policy reforms highlights that these may not endure in the
   postenactment phase when circumstances change. We argue that gradual
   policy layering may create sustainability dynamics that can result in
   lasting reform trajectories. The European Union's Common Agricultural
   Policy (CAP) has changed substantially over the last three decades in
   response to emerging policy concerns by adding new layers. This
   succession of reforms proved durable and resilient to reversal in the
   lead-up to the 2013 CAP reform when institutional and political
   circumstances changed.},

Abstract = {We know less about growth and poverty based on numbers in African
   economies than we would like to think. Numbers are soft, and data
   availability is sparse, sporadic, and uneven. For researchers and data
   users, whether engaged in inferential or descriptive statistics, the
   message is that studying Africa by numbers can be misleading. This
   research note surveys the knowledge gap and provides guidance on how to
   and how not to study Africa by numbers.},

Abstract = {In the last decades, the legal industry has experienced a global
   paradigm shift in the delivery model for legal services. This new model,
   known as legal process outsourcing (LPO), transfers the work of
   attorneys, paralegals and other legal professionals to external vendors
   located domestically and overseas. Legal outsourcing (both onshore and
   offshore) is transforming law practice as law firms and corporate legal
   departments seek to minimize costs, increase flexibility and expand
   their in-house capabilities. In this new decade, we have to prepare,
   with the legal services outsourcing, that we will become more
   sophisticated, with higher value of legal work, at higher level of
   quality and speed, and dramatically lower cost. In the Article authors
   deal with the process of the transformation of legal service into a
   legal good and point on some dilemmas during that process. This paper
   argues that outsourcing ultimately will have a positive effect on the
   legal profession and development of the quality of legal services. In
   the second part of the paper authors also stress out some information
   about different possibilities, how to organize virtual law firms for low
   budget legal services in the Slovenian case and also include some
   information about the possibility how to organize corporate governance
   in companies through the corporate secretary as outsourcing, because the
   corporate secretary is the chief governance officer and provides
   leadership for the corporation to implement a high level of corporate
   governance.},

Pages = {203-224},

Abstract = {Since the late 1990s Zimbabwean politics has been shaped by the
   political succession war raging within the ruling ZANU PF party. The
   internal fight to succeed President Robert Mugabe pitted a faction
   controlled by retired General Solomon Mujuru, who was fronting his wife
   Joice Mujuru, against another faction led by Emmerson Mnangagwa, a
   government minister. The competition between these factions reached a
   crucial stage in 2014, when Mugabe dismissed Joice Mujuru as
   Vice-President and purged her key allies in ZANU PF and the government.
   This article examines the role of state intelligence in this struggle,
   arguing that the Military Intelligence (MI) leadership, which supported
   Mnangagwa in the succession conflict, placed Joice Mujuru under
   surveillance and constructed a controversial gendered case to destroy
   her bid to succeed Mugabe. In contrast, some elements in the principal
   civilian intelligence institution, the Central Intelligence
   Organization, conducted a surveillance operation against the Mnangagwa
   faction in order to support Joice Mujuru's power bid. The article widens
   scholarship on the security sector's political interventions in
   Zimbabwean politics, while emphasizing how the gendered dimensions of
   surveillance can reinforce patriarchal national politics.},

Abstract = {The idea of the active welfare subject has become irresistible to both
   policy makers and academics and has taken a lead role in the
   transformation of twenty-first century social security systems. Two
   distinguishable approaches have emerged - the dominant model and a
   counter model. The dominant model emphasises moralised individual
   responsibility for `wrong choices' and mandates behavioural change to
   become active. The counter model situates benefit recipients in the
   present as disempowered creative, reflexive and resourceful beings. This
   article develops conceptualisations by comparing benefit recipients'
   accounts (from an exploratory qualitative study) of lived experience
   with both models.},

Abstract = {There is a strong political divide on climate change in the US general
   public, with Liberals and Democrats expressing greater belief in and
   concern about climate change than Conservatives and Republicans. Recent
   studies find a similar though less pronounced divide in other countries.
   Its leadership in international climate policy making warrants extending
   this line of research to the European Union (EU). The extent of a
   left-right ideological divide on climate change views is examined via
   Eurobarometer survey data on the publics of 25 EU countries before the
   2008 global financial crisis, the 2009 climategate' controversy and
   COP-15 in Copenhagen, and an increase in organized climate change denial
   campaigns. Citizens on the left consistently reported stronger belief in
   climate change and support for action to mitigate it than did citizens
   on the right in 14 Western European countries. There was no such
   ideological divide in 11 former Communist countries, likely due to the
   low political salience of climate change and the differing meaning of
   left-right identification in these countries.},

Title = {African Agency in R2P: Interventions by African Union and ECOWAS in

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1, SI},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Both the African Union (AU) and the Economic Community of West African
   States (ECOWAS) have been global leaders in embracing and
   operationalizing responsibility to protect (R2P). The adoption of the
   AU's Constitutive Act, Article 4 (h) in 2000, has transformed its
   old-fashioned principle of noninterference to one of nonindifference.
   This authorizes the AU to intervene in Member States with respect to war
   crimes, genocide, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. ECOWAS
   has through its conflict prevention, management, and resolution protocol
   and its conflict prevention framework deepened and practicalized the
   notion of sovereignty as responsibility. These frameworks from both the
   AU and the ECOWAS have close similarities to the R2P norms. However,
   although these notions are captured in official documents, their actual
   operationalization faces challenges relating to sovereignty, limited
   institutional capacity, a restricted appetite for enforcement action,
   and a lack of explicit instruments to activate their intervention
   clauses in R2P-like situations. In spite of these challenges, the
   article argues that the initiatives of both the AU and the ECOWAS in
   Mali, Cote d'Ivoire, and Libya demonstrated a positively active African
   agency in contributing to global peace processes. This article,
   therefore, assesses the successes and limitations of African regional
   agency in enforcing R2P-like norms among its member states and its
   implications for and contributions to global international relations
   discourses.},

Abstract = {Throughout its history Cuba has had an intimate relationship with
   outside powers and since January 1959 Cuban foreign policy has attracted
   much academic attention. Subsequently, a number of different theories
   regarding Cuban foreign policy have evolved. These are undoubtedly
   important, but this article will posit that it is only by examining
   legacies from the past that a fuller understanding of the island's
   bilateral relationships is achieved. In order to do this, the article
   will examine Cuba's relationship with the United States, European Union
   and Russian Federation. Significant change is taking place, but legacies
   from the past remain important in all three, which have had very
   different results for Havana's contemporary relationships with
   Washington, Brussels and Moscow. Areas of contestation from the past
   remain unresolved and will continue to be important for the foreseeable
   future.},

Title = {Sanitaristas, Petistas, and the Post-Neoliberal Public Health
   State in Porto Alegre},

Abstract = {Scholars of the post-neoliberal state in Latin America commonly trace
   universal social policies to ruling left parties and deepened democracy.
   Yet, such accounts often overlook how subnational politics in highly
   decentralized democracies like Brazil's can mediate this relationship.
   Examining such politics in the Brazilian municipio of Porto Alegre since
   1988 suggests that structural constraints and competing programmatic
   agendas of Partido dos Trabalhadores (Workers' PartyPT) governments
   complicated expansion of the public health sector. The municipio's
   surprisingly modest delivery of such services is traceable to enduring
   deemphasis on critical dimensions of state building in this sector by
   several PT administrations and the integration of civil society actors
   into multiple participatory governance institutions with little power
   over this process. Even in such contexts, far-reaching participatory
   democratic institutions are no panacea for fulfilling the universal
   social policy ambitions of local post-neoliberal states that depend
   heavily upon high-level political appointees for their effectiveness.
   Estudiosos do Estado pos-neoliberal na America Latina frequentemente
   associam politicas sociais universais aos partidos governantes de
   esquerda e a solidificacAo da democracia. Contudo, tais narrativas
   ignoram como a politica subnacional em democracias muito
   descentralizadas, como a brasileira, mediam esse relacionamento. Um
   exame dessa dinamica politica no municipio de Porto Alegre desde 1988
   sugere que restricoes estruturais e agendas programaticas competitivas
   de governos do Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT) ampliou a complexidade de
   expansAo do setor de saude publica. A modesta oferta de servicos de
   saude naquele municipio pode ser atribuida a um esvaziamento continuo
   das dimensoes criticas da ingerencia do Estado nesse setor por parte de
   varias administracoes petistas e a integracAo de atores da sociedade
   civil em multiplas instituicoes de governanca participatoria com pouco
   poder de decisAo sobre tal processo. Mesmo nesses contextos,
   instituicoes democraticas com alcance amplo nAo constituem uma panaceia
   que realize as ambicoes sociais universais de Estados locais
   pos-neoliberais, os quais dependem muito de politicos do alto escalAo em
   cargos comissionados para serem eficientes.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the political effects of the new discourse on
   Chinese migrant workers that emerged in the 2000s, and how this
   discourse is contested by an alternative discourse. The article
   demonstrates how the new discourse has facilitated socialist-liberal
   governance by transforming migrant workers into self-governing
   individuals. Moreover, the article argues that socialist-liberal
   governmentality is based on a post-political understanding that promotes
   a society without structural differences and reformulates social
   problems as individual deficiencies. Based on a discourse analysis of
   Chinese newspaper coverage, the article analyzes how this post-political
   myth is contested by an alternative understanding of society that
   repoliticizes migrant workers and their problems. In conclusion, the
   analysis points to how media discourses can contest governmental
   projects.},

Abstract = {The Bolsa Familia Program is the flagship of Brazil's targeted public
   policies. It exemplifies a particular approach to the public management
   of alterity, an approach that reveals a state more preoccupied with
   rationalizing public expenditures and building social peace than with
   policies oriented toward income distribution, democratization, and the
   expansion of social rights. The program is a form of biopolitics,
   inscribed in a framework aimed at the normalization, regimentation, and
   control of the population that receives the benefit. Lifelong social
   assistance and education are important instruments of subjectivation and
   the production of subjectivities with an eye to influencing the conduct
   of indigent and marginalized populations. The goal is to influence the
   conduct of indigent and marginalized populations and, in a movement
   quite the reverse of the touted inclusion, to separate them more and
   more from the citizenship that the program advertises and promises.
   Lider das politicas publicas focalizadas no Brasil, o Programa Bolsa
   Familia exemplifica uma forma de gestAo publica da alteridade que revela
   um Estado mais preocupado com as questoes de racionalizacAo dos gastos
   publicos e construcAo da paz social do que com uma politica de
   distribuicAo de renda, democratizacAo e expansAo dos direitos sociais.
   Esse programa remete a uma forma de biopolitica e inscreve-se numa
   perspectiva de normalizacAo, regulamentacAo e controle das populacoes
   beneficiarias. A assistencia social e a educacAo por toda a vida
   constituem importantes instrumentos na producAo de subjetividades com
   vistas a influenciar a conduta das populacoes indigentes e
   marginalizadase, ao contrario da propagada inclusAo, distancia-las cada
   vez mais da cidadania que o proprio programa anuncia.},

Abstract = {Patrimonialism is ubiquitous in the analysis of the state in Brazil, a
   country in which the concept has its own distinctive genealogy. However,
   patrimonialism has been subject to severe conceptual stretching,
   limiting its usefulness in comparative analysis. Furthermore, the
   commanding heights of the federal bureaucracy have become more
   universalistic and merit-based and less patrimonial over the past few
   years. Patrimonialism is therefore best viewed as one logic among many
   operating in the Brazilian state. O patrimonialismo permeia a analise do
   Estado no Brazil, pais onde o conceito possui uma genealogia propria.
   Contudo, o patrimonialismo tem sido objeto de certa ampliacAo
   conceitual, o que limita sua utilidade numa analise comparativa.
   Ademais, nos ultimos anos, os altos comandos da burocracia federal se
   tem tornado mais universalistas e meritocraticos, alem de menos
   patrimonialistas. Nesse contexto, o conceito pode ser visto como mais
   uma logica entre varias que atuam no Estado brasileiro.},

Abstract = {In this article we analyse to what degree the three functions of
   doctrine proposed by Harald Hoiback - doctrine as a tool of operations,
   a tool of education, and a tool of change - have driven defence
   transformation in two Scandinavian states, Norway and Sweden. We
   conclude that doctrine, both allied and national, has had some impact on
   defence transformation in both countries: through the operations in
   Afghanistan, through education both at the branch level and joint level,
   and through organizational adaption to (first) the US `RMA paradigm' and
   (later) to the subsequent `COIN paradigm'. However, other factors, such
   as threat perception and defence spending, have also played an important
   role. It also remains to be seen whether the changes are ephemeral or of
   a more permanent nature.},

Abstract = {This article examines the effect terrorism has on civil liberties and
   political rights across a wide range of democracies and regions. This
   study includes an analysis of the influence domestic and international
   terrorist attacks have on civil liberties and political rights in 48
   democratic states from 1971-2007. The results from a time series
   cross-national analysis reveal that terrorism weakens civil liberties
   and political rights. However, certain types of democracies are more
   affected by terrorism than others. These findings have important
   implications for democracy and counterterrorism strategies in democratic
   states.},

Title = {From Parliament to Courtroom: Judicial Review of Legislation as a
   Political Tool in the Czech Republic},

Abstract = {The Czech Constitutional Court has gained a strong position within the
   political system. This article examines the judicial review of
   legislation from the point of view of the relation between the court and
   the parliament. The authors analyze trends in the use of petitions
   proposing the annulment of statutes, who makes use of the petitions, how
   successful the petitioners are, and what issues the petitions concern.
   The article pairs a quantitative view with a qualitative analysis of key
   selected decisions by the court, especially in the sphere of
   mega-politics. The authors test whether judicial review of legislation
   serves as a tool for parliamentary opposition. The results show the
   decisive effects of a legislative majority in the lower house of the
   parliament. If the government lacks a majority, the use of judicial
   review of legislation as an oppositional tool fades. Also important is
   the weakness of the upper house, which makes senators more likely to
   resort to using judicial review of legislation. An especially crucial
   factor is the presence of independent and semi-independent senators who,
   without broader political backing, see judicial review of legislation as
   a welcome tool. The most frequent topics of the petitions were
   transitional justice, social policy, and the legislative process.},

Abstract = {This article argues that there is a strong role for empirical analysis
   to be used to address fundamental normative questions. Using human
   rights as an example, the article shows that the evolution of the
   international regime of human rights provides a standard against which
   country level performance can be both judged and explained through the
   application of empirical approaches in comparative politics. It argues
   further that different kinds of human rights measures (events,
   standards, surveys, and official statistics) and comparative methods
   (large-N, small-N, and single-country studies) offer systematic ways in
   which to map, to explain, and to understand the variation in human
   rights abuse around the world. The comparative politics of human rights
   is a prime example of how the ``is{''} of the world can be used to
   address the ``ought{''} of international human rights theory,
   philosophy, and law. The example of human rights analysis in comparative
   politics shows a strong role for value-based and problem-based research
   that remains systematic in its approach while at the same time producing
   outputs that are of public value.},

Abstract = {The Dark Duo Model of Post-Colonial Ideology states that post-colonial
   nations possess a specific set of sociostructural conditions that foster
   a unique pair of complementary ideologies responsible for maintaining
   the status quo. These are the ideologies of Historical Negation and
   Symbolic Exclusion. Together, these ideologies articulate a pair of
   discourses that draw upon culturally sanctioned repertoires to
   effectively resolve the collective dissonance created by pastand
   presentinjustices experienced by Indigenous peoples. Historical Negation
   and Symbolic Exclusion form a joint ideological system that legitimizes
   inequality in two critical social domains common to all post-colonial
   societies: one domain relating to resource allocations for Indigenous
   peoples and the other domain relating to representation and membership
   in the nation's identity. In the current article, we review and
   integrate over 10 years of research on post-colonial intergroup
   relations in New Zealand, leading up to a formal presentation of the
   Dark Duo Model. Our work in this area indicates that Historical Negation
   and Symbolic Exclusion are psychometrically distinct constructs that are
   stable over time. A meta-analytic review of 13 independent samples
   (N=18,903) shows that both ideologies are independently associated with
   Social Dominance Orientation and Right-Wing Authoritarianism among
   members of the dominant (European) group in New Zealand. We review and
   explain why there are systematic ethnic group differences in support for
   these dual ideologies and why positive intergroup contact with the
   dominant group attenuates resistance to Symbolic Exclusion amongst Maori
   (the Indigenous peoples). We also show that Historical Negation and
   Symbolic Exclusion exert powerful unique effects on voter sentiment and
   support for different social policies relating to biculturalism and that
   these ideologies mediate the effects of Social Dominance Orientation and
   Right-Wing Authoritarianism on various sociopolitical attitudes. Our
   Dark Duo Model is a context-specific extension of the Dual-Process Model
   of Ideology and Prejudice that explains how specific post-colonial
   ideologies are generated and used to maintain social inequalities that
   systematically disadvantage Indigenous peoples.},

Abstract = {Shaping an international consensus for the digital age is the current
   challenge. The nature of cyberspace complicates efforts to govern it,
   notably due to its asymmetrical, anonymous and dual-use characteristics.
   Such intricacies are compounded by the fact that the global cyber
   landscape varies significantly in terms of technologies, capabilities
   and strategies. Despite the complex nature of cyberspace, existing
   international legal regimes are adequate. International law is
   applicable to cyberspace; it is rather a question of sorting out the
   specificities of how it is to be applied. Based on a normative approach,
   the focus should be placed on further constructing and connecting those
   existing political and strategic frameworks for the effective governance
   of international cyber' relations.},

   State. President Barack Obama's strategy to `degrade, and ultimately
   destroy the terrorist group' faces serious problems due to political

   crucial role of private contractors. Although the narrative has changed,
   and there is no public mention of contractors, they remain central to
   all that the Department of Defense does in the US and abroad.
   Suggestions are offered on how their performance can be improved to

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Contemporary developments in international criminal justice have led to
   new systems of victims' rights and redress. A number of studies have
   identified the processes of victim protection, participation, and
   reparations at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former
   Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Court (ICC). However,
   little attention has been paid to how these changing practices have
   served to constitute victim identities. This article seeks to address
   this gap in scholarship through an analysis of the changing definitions,
   status, and integration of victims into these institutions. It explores
   how institutional practices serve to construct victims as either
   ``passive objects{''} or ``active agents{''} of the law. It then
   considers whether this ``active agent{''} translates to ideas of the
   person in all social contexts. The article argues that the ICC needs to
   consider whether victims hold the necessary personal, material, and
   social ``resources{''} required to action their rights in this
   institutional context.},

Abstract = {Globalization entails increased interdependence and interconnectivities
   among distal regions and social-ecological systems. This global
   interregional connectedness - telecoupling - gives rise to specific
   sustainability challenges, which require new governance solutions.
   Moving beyond scaling-up' governance to address global environmental
   problems, and exploring the implications of telecoupling for state-led
   environmental governance, ways the state can effectively address
   telecoupled environmental issues both within and beyond national borders
   are addressed, drawing on the example of soy trade between Brazil and
   Germany. This builds on recent contributions to the literature on
   governance of interregional ecological challenges to elaborate potential
   policy and governance options, ranging from classical bilateral,
   multilateral, and international agreements, to information-based,
   economic, and hybrid governance modes. While telecoupled environmental
   problems create governance challenges related to scale, knowledge gaps,
   coordination, and state capacity, the state has an important role to
   play. To explore this further, interdisciplinary inquiry is required
   that includes but moves beyond the state.},

Abstract = {The environmental nation state is not a formal category but a
   substantive one. The current set of national environmental state
   institutions originated in the late 1960s/1970s but has since changed in
   character. Many scholars note that since the new millennium, the
   environmental nation state in OECD countries is losing power and
   authority and is thus in decline, in line with wider concerns about the
   positions of states versus markets under conditions of (neo-liberal)
   globalisation. Assessing the decline of environmental nation state
   authority, three conclusions are drawn. States do not lose power in all
   sectors vis-a-vis markets. Hence, environmental nation state decline
   does not follow a general tendency. Second, the decline of environmental
   nation state powers cannot be equated with less effective or lower
   levels of environmental protection, as other environmental authorities
   have stepped in, and the jury is still out on their environmental
   effectiveness. Third, declining powers of environmental nation state
   institutions increasingly become a self-fulfilling prophecy of
   environmental policymakers, but non-state environmental authorities
   cannot take over all environmental state functions.},

Abstract = {As often pointed out in the literature on the European debt crisis, the
   policy programme of austerity and internal devaluation imposed on
   countries in the Eurozone's periphery exhibits a lack of democratic
   legitimacy. This article analyses the consequences these developments
   have for democratic support at both the European and national levels. We
   show that through the policies of economic adjustment, a majority of
   citizens in crisis countries has become `detached' from their democratic
   political system. By cutting loose the Eurozone's periphery from the
   rest of Europe in terms of democratic legitimacy, the Euro has divided
   the union, instead of uniting it as foreseen by its architects. Our
   results are based on aggregated Eurobarometer surveys conducted in 28
   European Union (EU) member states between 2002 and 2014. We employ
   quantitative time-series cross-sectional regression analyses. Moreover,
   we estimate the causal effect of economic adjustment in a comparative
   case study of four cases using the synthetic control method.},

Volume = {28},

Pages = {692-712},
Abstract = {Many scholars working within the tradition of critical studies are
   sceptical of the presence of visible security measures in urban spaces,
   arguing that they cause fear and facilitate the political control of
   citizens. A study carried out in Denmark in 2011 sought to capture,
   describe, and rank factors impacting positively or negatively on the
   feelings of safety of Danish citizens, when being in a crowded place.
   Surprisingly, the response to security measures like fences, cameras,
   and uniformed guards was positive. More visible security apparently
   reinforced feelings of safety. This article discusses the findings and
   points to, amongst others, a high level of societal trust as one
   possible explanation.},

Title = {Partners for peace, peaceful partners? On the relations between UN,
   regional and non-state peacebuilders in Somalia},
Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {11-27},
Abstract = {Somalia is one of the most telling examples of the changes that have
   affected peacebuilding in recent decades. Building peace in Somalia is a
   multidimensional endeavour involving a large number of global, regional
   and non-state actors which raises significant issues around
   coordination. Based on extensive field research in Kenya, this paper
   addresses three interrelated issues. First, it fills a gap in the
   existing literature in peacebuilding in Somalia, concretely examining
   the various types of relation that exist between global, regional and
   non-state peacebuilders in Somalia. Second, it draws upon sociological
   approaches to address the impact of coordination mechanisms on the
   actors under consideration: what strategies are deployed to resist
   coordination of dissenting actors' activities? Finally, the paper
   examines the impact had by such interactions on the nature of the
   peacebuilding effort itself. The article highlights the side effects of
   coercive coordination mechanisms leading to an increased fragmentation
   of peacebuilding efforts and to a double mechanism of mutual exclusion
   between state and non-state actors as well as between Western and
   non-Western actors.},

Abstract = {From 2007 to 2012 Mexico experienced a wave of violence and an unusual
   spike in homicides, much of it associated with organised crime and the
   state's response. While state actions were a significant trigger,
   violence in Mexico became participatory as many other actors came into
   play. Likewise, violence became multipolar as groups involved in the
   conflict became simultaneously victims and perpetrators. This paper
   examines the participatory and multipolar nature of the violence in
   Mexico using the ``extremely violent societies{''} approach, considering
   not only the features and intensity of the conflict, but also changes in
   the type of violence and the participation of different actors and
   groups over time. With no single narrative about the violence in Mexico,
   this paper understands a series of ``violences{''} converging
   simultaneously, and finds government policies both unsuccessful in
   tackling the violence and ineffective in addressing its social
   dimensions.},

Pages = {69-97},
Abstract = {This essay explores the relation between two perspectives on the nature
   of human rights. According to the ``political{''} or ``practical{''}
   perspective, human rights are claims that individuals have against
   certain institutional structures, in particular modern states, in virtue
   of interests they have in contexts that include them. According to the
   more traditional ``humanist{''} or ``naturalistic{''} perspective, human
   rights are pre-institutional claims that individuals have against all
   other individuals in virtue of interests characteristic of their common
   humanity. This essay argues that once we identify the two perspectives
   in their best light, we can see that they are complementary and that in
   fact we need both to make good normative sense of the contemporary
   practice of human rights. It explains how humanist and political
   considerations can and should work in tandem to account for the concept,
   content, and justification of human rights.},

   1. A sociotechnical approach, with the multilevel perspective as its
   main concept, and strategic niche management as its governance concept;
   2. A complex (adaptive) system-based approach, using the concept of
   transition patterns, with transition management as its governance
   concept;
   3. A governance approach, where the politics of transition dynamics are
   examined, with reflexive design as the core of its approach to shaping
   transition.
   In addition, work based on the social theory of practice has helped to
   bring consumption practices into transition theory, and an approach
   focusing on innovation system has helped to explain how different
   arrangements may become interconnected so as to produce a transition.},

Abstract = {In 1995 the German public was confronted with an exhibition of crimes
   committed by the German Armed Forces when they participated in the
   Holocaust in East Europe during the Second World War. The displayed
   photographs showed in graphic detail the killings committed by German
   soldiers, and documented the direct involvement in mass murder by many
   men (and some women). In 2015, an exhibition of photos of torture and
   murder by security forces in Syria was shown in the United Nation's
   headquarters in New York and later in the European Parliament in
   Brussels; these photos had been allegedly taken by one or more
   photographers working for the Syrian security forces and later been
   brought out of the country. Stephen Ferry's Violentology - A Manual of
   the Colombian Conflict (2012) is a collection of images of massive and
   persistent violence during the Colombian conflict. These exemplary photo
   documentations present images of mass violence in the twentieth and
   twenty-first century and they reveal the major changes in atrocity
   crimes and mass violence since the Holocaust, as shown in the first,
   1995 exhibition.},

Pages = {949-970},
Abstract = {Grassroots environmental movements have recently started to question the
   focus on sustainable consumption as a main strategy to tackle climate
   change. They prefer to address individuals as citizens rather than as
   consumers, and focus on collective rather than individual change. Two
   prominent movements in this regard are Transition Towns and Climate
   Justice Action. While both movements criticise conventional approaches,
   they put forward entirely different strategies for what has to happen
   instead. Based on extensive qualitative research, this article analyses
   how these movements manifest themselves in Flanders (Belgium). The focus
   is on their different accounts of how and why collective practices have
   to be built, and the place they attribute to the political' in this. The
   analysis reveals the existence of two different forms of ecological
   citizenship: one communitarian, the other agonistic.},

   reindeer husbandry in Sweden},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {10},

Pages = {426-447},
Abstract = {Drawing on an interactive governance framework, this article provides a
   critical analysis of the governing system (GS) of Sami reindeer
   husbandry in Sweden, an indigenous natural resource-based livelihood.
   Situated against a historical contextualization, and focusing on the
   relationship between governing images, instruments and action, the study
   explores how reindeer husbandry is currently governed and how governing
   has changed over time. In contrast to well-established narratives of
   increased participation and indigenous peoples' right to
   self-determination, this study demonstrates that the governing of Sami
   reindeer husbandry remains mainly hierarchical and is characterized by
   inconsistencies. The GS's elements are poorly fitted internally, there
   are large differences in understanding between key actors and, over
   time, only marginal change - in governing structures and meta-images -
   has occurred. Thus, reindeer husbandry actors appear to be locked out of
   essential governing functions and locked into a system that is proving
   hard to change.},

Abstract = {All peace agreements are flawed, to varying degrees, because mistrustful
   parties sign under pressure to end humanitarian suffering. They
   generally include what they can, leave out what cannot be settled, and
   gloss over differences in an effort to stop the killing. The peace
   implementation process, however, sometimes provides opportunities to
   strengthen weak agreements so that the peace process is strengthened
   from its initial, imperfect state. This article argues that peace
   implementation is more likely to lead to sustained peace if the process
   is flexible and prioritises the demilitarisation of politics.
   Implementation that follows a strict blueprint and prioritises making
   deadlines and milestones articulated in the agreement are likely to
   freeze in place the mal-distribution of power at the time the fighting
   stopped and consequently make sustainable peace more difficult.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Pages = {375-391},
Abstract = {Ideas are at their most powerful as an explanatory variable when they
   lead agents to go against any broadly reasonable interpretation of their
   material self-interests. They become even more intriguing when they are
   instrumental in actually causing a crisis, in which actors undercut
   their own stated goals and then continue to make matters worse by
   sticking to those same ideas, even in the light of clear evidence that
   the policies they inspire are not working. This contribution shows two
   dynamics between power and ideas to explain Germany's behavior during
   the euro crisis. The first dynamic examines the changing macroeconomic
   consensus on how to conduct monetary and fiscal policy that governed the
   euro from 1999 to 2012. The second dynamic shows how a strict adherence
   to Germany's ordoliberal ideas of budgetary rules and structural reform
   turned a containable Greek fiscal problem into a full-blown systemic
   sovereign debt crisis.},

Title = {Individualism and empowerment in pentecostal sermons: New evidence from
   Nairobi, Kenya},

Abstract = {Pentecostal and Charismatic churches are growing rapidly in many parts
   of sub-Saharan Africa and the developing world. This article presents
   new evidence on the theologies and activities of these popular churches,
   based on sermon texts and interview data gathered from a random sample
   of churches in Nairobi, Kenya. It finds that Pentecostal churches in
   Nairobi are remarkably consistent in the messages they disseminate,
   despite great variation in church and membership characteristics across
   congregations. The dominant theme in sermons was a focus on cultivating
   believers' sense of their own potential and autonomy as individuals.
   Other topics commonly associated with Pentecostal churches such as
   getting rich quickly and social conservatism were not as central. The
   focus on individual autonomy also stands in stark contrast to more
   collectivist agendas of social change. Indeed, the individualist theme
   was accompanied by a relative lack of social service provision,
   reflecting an approach to economic development that focuses on
   individual mental transformation rather than material handouts or
   systemic reform. In contrast to literature on civil society and
   ethnicity, which sees religious groups as potential collective agents or
   as cohesive interest groups, this article suggests that Pentecostal and
   Charismatic churches are leading their members to prioritize the
   individual.},

Abstract = {This chapter examines the aid industry in its contemporary form and the
   basis of the claim that this industry is in crisis. Beginning with an
   examination of the structure, form, and objectives of this industry, it
   then moves on to assess the claims that the practices performed are
   experiencing problems. It examines the nature of these problems - both
   practical and philosophical. There is a surprising amount of consistency
   across the empirical literature on key periods and types of events that
   explain the current sense of crisis. These are examined and used to
   inform what are termed here as the `contemporary circumstances of
   assistance'. These are the philosophical dimensions which require
   consideration in ethical deliberations concerning what ought to be done
   in response to situations of extreme need and suffering. Finally, an
   outline is provided of the philosophical problems underlying the
   practical problems that require further attention in later chapters.},

Abstract = {The current transition of power in Asia has only intensified the
   protracted rivalry between New Delhi and Beijing. Buoyed by its recent

   deeply fractured on a viable strategy to manage China's rise.
   Normalizing relations with Beijing has been prioritized by New Delhi and
   constitutes the second pillar of its hedging strategy However, given New
   Delhi's modest internal capabilities, the threat posed by China can only
   be managed through an external balancing strategy.},

   response},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {53},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {83-100},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article examines the Responsibility to Protect (RtoP) and its
   invocation of common humanity. It argues that the RtoP needs the
   normative weight and work of the notion of common humanity in order to
   be framed as a common response to atrocity crimes. It further suggests
   that such a framing process points to a shift in the doctrine's possible
   remit and accessibility which offers the potential for improvement, even
   in the face of legitimate critique and practical failure. The act of
   framing the doctrine as common opens up a shared discursive space, in
   which a communal language, platform and mandate allows for the enduring
   dilemmas of intervention and the enduring problem of conscience-shocking
   crimes against humanity to be more collectively engaged with. Thus,
   despite its failings, this framing of the RtoP offers avenues for
   enhanced empathy, legitimacy and efficacy.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1-26},
Abstract = {Political leaders not only assess the costs and benefits of repression
   but also act strategically in their use of particular repression types.
   Choices amongst repression types depend partly upon leaders being held
   responsible for their particular actions. The codification of the
   international human rights regime indicated by broad ratification of the
   core International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights increases the
   likelihood of criminal responsibility, and political leaders who repress
   but want to avoid accountability for their actions respond
   strategically. These governments refrain from extrajudicial killing,
   which is easier to link to the government, relying instead on forced
   disappearances, a violation that is more difficult to tie to the
   incumbent regime. Using a sample of 194 countries from 1981 to 2009, we
   find that decreases in the use of extrajudicial killing in International
   Covenant on Civil and Political Rights member states are associated with
   increases in the use of forced disappearance. This indicates a
   substitution effect as governments attempt to maintain the benefits of
   repression while avoiding the costs of accountability. Our findings are
   robust to changes in measurement, sample size, and model specification.},

Abstract = {How does the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) leverage Islamic Law
   to support their strategic objectives? Islam, as most religions, is a
   defining catalyst of group identity. ISIS has capitalized on this, using
   it as a vehicle to legitimize its interpretation of Islamic Law. This
   study builds on Social Movement Theory to develop and test a conceptual
   framework of ISIS messaging strategies. This framework highlights the
   progression of the organization's message from mainstream Islamic Law to
   radical unified reinterpretation. ISIS leaders' speeches are used to
   test the model. Ultimately, study findings inform countermessaging
   strategies and identify mobilization mechanisms.},

Abstract = {The implications of technology have been widely acknowledged in
   international relations. Studies ranging from the causes of war and
   military effectiveness to terrorism and nuclear proliferation have
   explored how technology shapes international politics. However, the
   implications of technology in domestic politics have not been
   scrutinised much. This paper helps fill this vacuum through an analysis
   of Turkey's civil-military relations. Although civilian control over the
   Turkish military has improved in the past decade, this process has not
   been smooth. With a focus on the recent court cases involving the
   military, the 2007 e-memorandum and the transfer of electronic military
   intelligence apparatus to the civilian authority, this paper
   demonstrates how technology has become an important domain for
   civil-military relations in Turkey.},

Abstract = {This article builds on the analysis of institutional change in the
   European Union as projected by two closely related approaches:
   deliberative and new intergovernmentalism. Consensus and deliberation
   play a pivotal role within these perspectives. The two concepts are seen
   as key for understanding institutional change within the European
   Council and Council environment. Euro crisis decision-making, which by
   several authors is seen as evidence of either hard intergovernmental
   bargaining or as a transformation of consensus politics into domination,
   thus may undermine a core assumption of the new intergovernmentalism.
   Even though persisting asymmetries between creditor and debtor countries
   and dominance on part of one or a small number of powerful member states
   are understood as a threat to consensus politics, the euro crisis is not
   seen to have fundamentally changed the overall role of consensus and
   deliberation as a defining feature of the post-Maastricht era.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {25},
Number = {5},
Pages = {899-920},
Abstract = {The concept of environmental innovation strategies (EIS) is introduced
   and discussed. The notion refers to the conduct by which
   non-governmental organisations (NGOs) act as policy entrepreneurs
   seeking to address environmental issues by going beyond the provisions
   of public regulations. Environmental innovation is understood as the
   product of a process of social interactions between heterogeneous types
   of actors, including NGOs. Three social mechanisms are introduced in
   order to capture the conditions enabling and motivating NGOs to pursue
   EIS, as well as the politics through which EIS are produced. These
   mechanisms are then discussed in the light of two in-depth case studies
   in Indonesia and Switzerland. The findings highlight the institutional
   frustration and mix of concerns that push NGOs to engage in EIS, as well
   as the non-spontaneous nature of environmental innovations. Innovation
   represents, in the end, a game of power that should be analysed as such.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},

Number = {3},
Pages = {446-460},
Abstract = {The EU Global Strategy (EUGS) is a broad and ambitious document in terms
   of its geographic scope and thematic priorities. However, the EU cannot
   devote equal attention to all aspects of the EUGS; so there is still
   scope for more clarity regarding the EU's core strategic aims. This
   article argues that in addition to fostering internal cohesion, the EU's
   strategic priority must involve stabilizing its own neighbourhood. This
   task has challenged the EU for decades because of an inherent
   credibility deficit regarding the EU's own capabilities, yet the EUGS
   does not diagnose and remedy this problem as effectively as it could
   have. Therefore much more work will need to be done in terms of
   reforming EU institutions and developing common capabilities if the EU
   hopes to achieve its central internal and external security goals as
   outlined in the EUGS and related policy statements.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},

Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {550-570},
Abstract = {This article examines the dynamics of domestic legislatures' application
   of international human rights law. Specifically, this article asks the
   following: What factors shape how domestic legislatures apply
   international human rights law while they enact national law and policy?
   Lawmakers have a variety of motives for invoking and deliberating
   international law. Given these motives, the article identifies two
   factors civil society actors and legal experts and the flexibility of
   international law that are likely to contribute to if and how national
   legislatures interpret and apply international human rights law while
   legislating. These factors are examined through case studies on religion
   in schools in the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. This article
   argues civil society actors and legal experts and the flexibility of
   international law inform lawmakers' estimation of political costs
   related to compliance and thus how they apply international human rights
   law to domestic legislation.},

Abstract = {This study examines the relation between executive succession and
   corporate capacity. Drawing on theory on executive succession, it is
   argued that corporate capacity is likely to increase following
   succession as new executives need early support to succeed in the job.
   The effect of succession is expected to decrease over time as the new
   executive settles in. These effects are expected to be most pronounced
   following outside successions. My expectations are tested in a
   longitudinal study of executive succession and corporate capacity in
   Danish municipalities 1993-2000. The findings largely support the theory
   put forward and suggest that corporate capacity is unaffected by inside
   succession and increased following outside succession. The study's
   contributions to research on executive succession and corporate capacity
   in public organizations are discussed.},

Title = {Shared perceptions of supervisor conflict management style A cross-level
   moderator of relationship conflict and employee outcomes},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-49},
Abstract = {Purpose - This study aims to investigate the extent to which employee
   outcomes (anxiety/depression, bullying and workers' compensation claims
   thoughts) are affected by shared perceptions of supervisor conflict
   management style (CMS). Further, this study aims to assess cross-level
   moderating effects of supervisor CMS climate on the positive association
   between relationship conflict and these outcomes.
   Design/methodology/approach - Multilevel modeling was conducted using a
   sample of 401 employees nested in 69 workgroups.
   Findings - High collaborating, low yielding and low forcing climates
   (positive supervisor climates) were associated with lower
   anxiety/depression, bullying and claim thoughts. Unexpectedly, the
   direction of moderation showed that the positive association between
   relationship conflict and anxiety/depression and bullying was stronger
   for positive supervisor CMS climates than for negative supervisor CMS
   climates (low collaborating, high yielding and high forcing).
   Nevertheless, these interactions revealed that positive supervisor
   climates were the most effective at reducing anxiety/depression and
   bullying when relationship conflict was low. For claim thoughts,
   positive supervisor CMS climates had the predicted stress-buffering
   effects.
   Research limitations/implications - Employees benefit from supervisors
   creating positive CMS climates when dealing with conflict as a third
   party, and intervening when conflict is low, when their intervention is
   more likely to minimize anxiety/depression and bullying.
   Originality/value - By considering the unique perspective of employees'
   shared perceptions of supervisor CMS, important implications for the
   span of influence of supervisor behavior on employee well-being have
   been indicated.},

Abstract = {In the last few decades, terrorism has become a global threat and
   challenge, which many countries have had to face and fight. Conflicts
   involving terror organizations are, to a large extent, battles of ideas,
   and are not focused only on physical violence or military confrontation.
   This reality creates a need to better understand the tools through which
   terror organizations promote their messages, and to distinguish between
   different types of terror organizations. The current study examines
   different types of terror organizations' messages targeting foreign
   audiences. The analysis focuses on the organizations' usage of public
   diplomacy in promoting their messages and distinguishes between the
   different types of organizations (limited- versus total-conflict).
   Messages promoted by four terror organizationsHamas and Hezbollah
   (limited-conflict organizations) and Al Qaeda and the Islamic State
   (total-conflict organizations)are analyzed. The findings reveal that
   while limited-conflict organizations communicate with the international
   community, and use public diplomacy to try to change the international
   environment in which they operate, total-conflict organizations do not
   use public diplomacy; they talk about the international community rather
   than communicating with it.},

Abstract = {This article conceptualises the institutional narrative of the
   reconstruction of Stari Most (Old Bridge), regarded as an international
   symbol of reconciliation in Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina, as a staged
   reconciliation of the city. Constructed during Ottoman occupation Stari
   Most became a signifier of Mostar and was central to the growth of the
   city. Stari Most was destroyed in 1993 during the Bosnian war;
   restoration began five years following, and the bridge alongside Stari
   Grad (Old Town) was reopened as a United Nations Educational, Scientific
   and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) heritage site in 2004. UNESCO began
   operating in 1945 on the grounds that peace must be established on the
   basis of humanity's moral and intellectual solidarity', based on a
   collaborative effort to celebrate diversity and innovation. In this
   article I conceptualise Stari Most as a stage of memory through
   identifying, firstly, the institutional staging of the reconstruction as
   a structure which bridges' divides, and secondly, the institutional
   narrative of the bridge as a symbolically reconciling structure, in a
   city which remains divided.},

Abstract = {By comparing the Baltic States with Greece, Portugal and Spain, we seek
   to discover whether the type of authoritarian legacy and regime
   transition has any effect on the way citizens think about the left-right
   (L-R) divide in new democracies. We argue that while the authoritarian
   legacy is important, the type of transition and, particularly, the kind
   of political alliances and party-politicization of issues during the new
   regime's formative years is more important. Evidence confirms our
   expectations, even after several cross validating tests. (C) 2016

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {A business enterprise interested in influencing the design, adoption or
   enforcement of a particular law, rule or regulation often confronts a
   choice. Does it lobby officials directly? Or does it do so indirectly,
   using a collective action group as an intermediary? We draw on data from
   a large, 2010 survey of enterprises across the Russian Federation to
   demonstrate that the propensity to engage in intermediated lobbying
   increases with region-level political competition. Our explanation
   builds on recent evidence confirming Mancur Olson's claim (1982) that
   less encompassing actors tend to lobby for more distortionary policies.
   We hypothesize that with greater political competition government
   officials become more responsive to encompassing voices (i.e.
   associations of businesses as opposed to single firms), since the
   electoral costs of being captured by narrower interests becomes greater.
   Evidence from a complementary survey of regional business association
   managers points in the same direction; the relative attention paid by
   officials to lobbying efforts by encompassing associations increases
   with political competition.},

Abstract = {This article advances our understanding of the effects of servant
   leadership, an employee- and community-focused leadership style, on
   followers' public service motivation (PSM) and job performance. Based on
   social learning theory, we argue that by emphasizing to their followers
   the importance of serving others both inside and outside the
   organization and by acting as role models by serving others themselves,
   servant leaders enhance job performance by engendering higher PSM in
   their followers. A multilevel analysis of three waves of multi-source
   data from a Chinese government agency reveals that PSM mediates the
   influence that servant leadership has on followers' job performance. The
   results are consistent with theoretical predictions that the altruistic
   behaviour displayed by servant leaders elicits higher levels of the
   altruistic behaviours that characterize PSM, which in turn increases job
   performance. Hence, this study contributes to our understanding of how
   leadership drives institutional change and performance in the public
   sector.},

Abstract = {Facing barriers to change, policy entrepreneurs often shift their
   activities to a more favourable venue. In the new venue they either
   pressure the system from the outside, leading to policy punctuation, or
   make incremental changes within the existing system which over time will
   accumulate to a significant change in the status quo. This article aims
   to expand our understanding of policy entrepreneurs' role in the policy
   process by examining the strategies they use in the incremental path.
   Specifically, it focuses on one gradual change strategy, conversion -
   redirection of existing institutions to new purposes. Based on the case
   of policy entrepreneurs in the Holy Basin of Jerusalem, the findings
   indicate that when the entrepreneurs shift the venue to the bureaucracy
   they can establish cooperative relations with the government that will
   provide them with the needed capacities to exploit the gaps in the
   existing rules and redirect them to serve their aim.},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {While IR's Eurocentric limits are usually acknowledged, what those
   limits mean for theorizing about the international is seldom clarified.
   In The Global Transformation, Buzan and Lawson offer a composite
   approach' that goes some way towards addressing IR's Eurocentrism,
   challenging existing myths about the emergence and evolution of the
   international system and society. This paper seeks to push the
   contribution made by Buzan and Lawson in two further directions: first,
   by underscoring the need to adopt a deeper understanding of
   Eurocentrism; and second, by highlighting how this understanding helps
   us recognize what is missing from IR theorizing - conceptions of the
   international by others' who also constitute the international. I
   illustrate this point by focussing on a landmark text on Ottoman
   history, Ortayl's The Longest Century of the Empire.},

   abuses by state actors. However, nonstate actors also represent a grave
   threat to personal security. This article introduces the Societal

   reports as a basis for developing a new scale of physical integrity
   rights abuses by nonstate actors to gain a more comprehensive, but at
   the same time disaggregated, picture of human security threats across

Abstract = {Internet based technology constitutes one of the most important policy
   innovations in the last decades. Its diffusion has been rapid,
   widespread and sustained. The increase has raised questions about its
   drivers. The article focuses on an aspect of this dynamic that has been
   neglected so far: the variance between and among democracies and
   autocracies and their respective subtypes. Moreover, the majority of
   studies tackles the diffusion of e-government techniques, excluding the
   important array of e-participation. Our analysis thus offers a broader
   and more differentiated account of the adoption of online tools by
   governments. The findings indicate that the adoption of e-government and
   e-participation techniques varies substantially between and among
   democratic and autocratic regime types as well as over time and in kind.},

Abstract = {Since the early 2000s, asylum policy in Western states has become
   increasingly dominated by the concept of the `pull factor'-the idea that
   the economic rights afforded to asylum seekers can act as a migratory
   pull, and will have a bearing on the numbers of asylum applications
   received. The pull factor thesis has been widely discredited by
   researchers but remains powerful among policymakers. Through an analysis
   of the pull factor in the UK context, and drawing on insights from
   Cultural Political Economy, this article argues that the hegemony of the
   pull factor thesis is best understood as a `policy imaginary' which has
   become sedimented through both discursive and extra-discursive practices
   and processes. The article offers a means of understanding how a common
   sense assumption-which is challenged by a large body of evidence-has
   come to dominate policymaking in a key area of concern for politicians
   and policymakers.},

Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {In this article the authors discuss the role of Jasenovac Concentration
   Camp in Croatian and Serbian political and social spheres. Connecting
   the historical data with the analysis of the recent mutual accusations
   of genocide between the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Serbia
   before the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the authors
   demonstrate the pervasive presence of Jasenovac in Serbian and Croatian
   political discourse. Presenting different modes of social construction
   around Jasenovac, from the end of the Second World War to the present,
   the article proposes a specific reading of Jasenovac as a form of the
   past that does not pass. In this respect, Jasenovac is seen as a
   continuous reference point for understanding collective losses and group
   suffering, both past and present, in Serbian and Croatian society.
   Although historically distanced by seventy years, the events surrounding
   Jasenovac are still constantly recurring in both political and private,
   official and unofficial, spheres of life, functioning as a specific
   symbol around which narratives of ethnic, national, and religious
   understanding as well as inter-group conflicts are thought and
   constructed. The role of political and social factors in the
   construction of frequently incompatible narratives is further underlined
   by the analysis of selected oral testimonies related to the war in
   Yugoslavia in 1990s.},

Abstract = {This essay examines why the diffusion of autocratic rule tends to unfold
   more slowly, yet with greater effectiveness ('success') than
   pro-democratic waves often do. A precedent of progressive regime change
   often inspires fairly unorganized crowds in many other countries to
   initiative spontaneous emulation efforts, as it happened in the
   revolutions of 1848 and the Arab Spring of 2011. Yet this lack of
   organization creates a high risk of failure. By contrast, the overthrow
   of democracy, which can also stimulate imitation attempts, is usually
   spearheaded by well-established organizations, such as the military,
   which jump on the bandwagon less rashly, but pursue their goals more
   effectively. Therefore, autocratic waves advance with lower speed, yet
   greater `success' than pro-democratic riptides often do, as was evident
   in the diffusion of authoritarianism and fascism during the interwar
   years and the spread of military dictatorships in Latin America during
   the 1960s and 1970s.},

Abstract = {By 2015 concern had emerged about the trajectory of Canada's Westminster
   model and the state of democratic governance under successive Harper
   governments, particularly with respect to transparency and relationships
   with public servants, which among other things led to the election of
   the Trudeau government in October 2015. This article compares these
   developments with the wholesale reform experiences in Australia, New
   Zealand, and the United Kingdom. We consider not only the evolving
   bargains between prime ministers and their ministers, political
   advisors, top officials, and legislatures, but also between party
   leaders and political parties, and between governments and civil
   society. Second, we characterize far-reaching reforms as ``dares,{''}
   intended to change the trajectory of Westminster systems, which carry
   political risks. Third, we consider the resilience of Westminster
   systems in the face of significant change and inaction. The Harper
   reforms were not nearly as dramatic as those of the United Kingdom, New
   Zealand, and Australia during the late 1980s but did change the bargain
   with civil society, foundational to Westminster systems.},

Abstract = {In this study, we evaluate the ``success{''} of adopted innovations in
   public organizations as a function of the relative source of innovation
   vis-a-vis the organizational environment. We argue that the source of
   innovation will be varyingly associated with subsequent perceptions of
   implementation success depending on locational characteristics of the
   source and the innovation's outcome locus. Neither ``top-down{''} nor
   ``bottom-up{''} arguments of implementation offer a complete picture of
   perceived implementation success of public sector innovations. Rather,
   in addition to the vertical perspective ({''}top-down versus
   bottom-up{''}) of implementation success, it is the relative proximity
   the source has to the related process or result that matters, which is
   represented by a horizontal perspective (organization's core versus
   organizational boundary or external environment). Our empirical results
   offer evidence that this expected configuration of relationships,
   consisting of both vertical and horizontal perspectives simultaneously,
   indeed exists in the public sector.},

Abstract = {Scholars have suggested that the benefits of representative bureaucracy
   arise from bureaucrats acting in the interests of clients who share
   their characteristics, increased diversity encouraging even nonminority
   bureaucrats work to further the interests of minority clients, and/or
   the actions of clients that are more responsive to bureaucrats that
   share their characteristics. Despite decades of research, the literature
   has been unable to empirically disentangle these mechanisms, primarily
   because the vast majority of studies examine only organization-level
   data, and, at the aggregate level, they all produce identical findings.
   In contrast, this study makes use of data that allows us to observe the
   behavior of individual clients and bureaucrats, as well as the aggregate
   characteristics of the organizations in which they interact.
   Specifically, we make use of student-level data to predict differences
   in the probability that an elementary student is referred to gifted
   services by race. Our results suggest that black students are more
   likely to be referred to gifted services when taught by a black teacher
   but that increased presence of black teachers in the school other than
   the classroom teacher has little effect. We find some evidence that the
   classroom teacher effect is partially driven by teachers' more positive
   views of own-race students. Our results do not suggest, however, that
   the positive impact of teacher-student race congruence on gifted
   assignment can be explained by differences in student test score
   performance or increased parental interaction with the teacher.},

Abstract = {The emergence of personalised, interactive forms of social media has led
   to questions about the use of these platforms for engagement in
   politics. Existing research focuses on whether political actors
   successfully engage citizens, and how social media platforms mobilise
   young people into offline participation. In this article, we present
   original survey data on how many young people use social media to do
   politics: share information, express themselves, and take action.
   Everyday Facebook use is underpinned by young people's engaged
   citizenship norms, and it has the potential to mobilise a broader range
   of young people. We contextualise the survey findings with qualitative
   analysis of how young people describe their willingness to engage in
   politics on social media. There is a general reluctance to take
   political action due to the possibility of conflict and disagreement
   within their networks; however, some acknowledge it is a way to bring
   the disengaged into political debate.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how and to what extent member states comply
   with EU obligations in terms of process and outcome. The aim is to
   demonstrate how norm-conform behaviour unfolds, or fails to unfold, in
   an interaction between a member state and the European Commission. The
   empirical focus is on recent rule of law crises in France, Hungary and
   Romania. The argument is that member states engage in symbolic and/or
   creative compliance, designed to create the appearance of norm-conform
   behaviour without giving up their original objectives. The cases
   illustrate that creative and symbolic compliance strategies may be
   successfully employed by member states because they enable the
   Commission to disengage from conflicts it judges too costly and yet
   maintain its credibility, and are conditioned by the visibility of
   failure to change facts on the ground. The implication is that, at
   times, not only is compliance symbolic, but also to some extent is
   enforcement.},

Abstract = {This article examines smart power, specifically in relation to US
   counter-terrorism initiatives, focusing on US foreign aid as a soft
   power instrument. Economic aid and military aid are disbursed under the
   auspices of USAID and the military is tasked with soft and hard power
   strategies that have proven problematic to manage as an integrated grand
   strategy'. Identifying variables that accurately indicate the success or
   otherwise of smart power as a counter-terror strategy is problematic.
   Nevertheless a tentative correlation can be drawn between high levels of
   US aid and low levels of trust in the US in frontline Islamic states.
   This has led to slippage between hard and soft power and un-smart
   policy. Consequently a gap has emerged between what the US hopes that
   the international community will respond to in terms of smart power as a
   counter-terror initiative and what actually happens. The US has tended
   to revert to hard power tools in the face of this gap. I argue that
   foreign aid must not only be soft but sticky' in order for smart power
   strategies to succeed.},

Abstract = {The 2004-07 EU enlargement towards the post-communist region showed that
   the long waiting for EU membership could impact on levels of public
   support for the EU. This article examines citizens' trust towards
   national and international institutions after joining the EU in Poland,
   in comparative perspective. In the post-Communist region, levels of
   trust towards national institutions are generally lower compared to the
   European and international ones. Politicians and political parties are
   the most distrusted actors, undermining the social and political fabric
   in the region. An overview of political participation and levels of
   trust with focus on national data sets and the European Social Survey
   shows that levels of trust are quite low and a share of the population
   is concerned with sovereignty vis-a-vis EU integration. This analysis
   addresses how the relationship between citizens and institutions have
   changed and how this may affect not just the EU's policies towards
   candidate countries and third countries, but how it can also affect
   citizen participation during the process of democratization and after
   joining the EU. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {53},
Number = {5},
Pages = {628-646},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This contribution to the forum on Alex Anievas' Capital, the State and
   War takes issue with its reliance on a `lite' version of Trotsky's
   concept of uneven and combined development (UCD) cut out of the theory
   of permanent revolution. It argues that if Trotsky's theory would have
   been taken seriously, a quite different reading of the world wars comes
   into view, in which `permanent counterrevolution' as the overriding
   dynamic suggests an understanding of war as a link in that process.
   Permanent war as under the current War on Terror would fit into this. In
   Anievas' version of UCD, the notion on the other hand functions in a
   quasi-Weberian actor theory of `the international', which, like `the
   market' in neoclassical economics, is assumed to be an ultimately
   unfathomable, regulatory instance. UCD then would serve as a reminder
   that there is social substance to `the international'-without specifying
   what that substance is. As a result, the entire procedure works to block
   the ability to really open up the inner workings of the global political
   economy as a process of class formation and struggle mediated by foreign
   and international relations.},

Abstract = {In recent publications, we inquire whether the pacifying effects that
   are often attributed to democracy are likely to continue to hold as the
   world democratizes. Critics raise questions about the theoretical logic
   and especially the empirical results that we present. After clarifying
   our theoretical arguments, we discuss the central empirical critiques.
   We demonstrate that Crescenzi and Kadera's (2016) finding of a pacifying
   effect of systemic democracy is driven not, as they claim, by the use of
   a better measure of systemic democracy, but by the unjustified decision
   to omit systemic regime difference from their analysis. Once we restore
   this variable, we find no evidence that democratization produces a
   system-level pacifying effect. We agree with our critics that the
   inclusion of dyadic regime difference produced misleading estimates for
   lower-threshold democracy. Because our arguments presume the historical
   existence of a dyadic democratic peace, however, this observation, if
   anything, resolves an apparent anomaly for our claims. Finally, we
   explain that Choi (2016) misunderstands the argument that systemic
   regime-type difference seeks to capture; we show that his proposed
   alternative neither captures our concept of interest nor accomplishes
   what he claims.},

Abstract = {We contend that the boundaries and nature of national attachments are
   shaped by the position of one's group within America's racial order,
   with higher status yielding more racially exclusive forms of identity.
   We test our claims in the realm of xenophobia. Using an original survey
   of African Americans (n = 1,000) and Whites (n = 1,000), we assess
   national pride, nationalism, nativism, and racial identity, plus affect
   toward various immigrant groups. We establish that national attachments
   have racially varied meanings, thereby producing sharp differences in
   each racial group's response to foreigners. Although national pride is
   unrelated to White antipathy toward outsiders, nationalism and nativism
   increase White hostility to immigrants-except when they are White. In
   contrast, national pride diminishes African American hostility to Black
   and non-Black immigrants, while nativism is generally unrelated to Black
   antipathy to outsiders. Finally, while nationalism heightens xenophobia
   among Blacks, this sentiment envelops all foreigners-including African
   immigrants. We discuss our results' implications for theories of
   national attachment in intergroup settings.},

Abstract = {This article examines Sheila Jeffreys' analysis of the UK's Gender
   Recognition Act (GRA) and her critique of trans identities. Situating
   her position within a wider radical feminist perspective, I suggest that
   her arguments against the GRA are grounded in a problematic
   understanding of sex and gender. In so doing, I defend how sex and
   gender are understood in the GRA. Furthermore, I show that radical
   feminist concerns about sex reassignment surgery and the complicity of
   trans individuals with stereotypical gender norms are unwarranted. By
   highlighting the importance of attending to the embodied dimensions of
   sex and gender, I offer a partial defence of the UK's GRA. In
   particular, I note the benefits that it can offer to trans individuals,
   although I suggest ways in which the GRA can be improved. Finally, I
   challenge radical feminists who see trans theory and identities as
   inimical to the goals of feminism.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the extensive coverage in UK newspapers of the
   shooting, recovery and activism of Malala Yousafzai, the prominent
   campaigner for girls' rights from the Swat Valley in Pakistan. The study
   uses discourse analysis and a poststructuralist, feminist and
   postcolonial approach to analyse 223 newspaper articles, identifying the
   dominant discourses about Yousfzai in the context of the United
   Kingdom's colonial history and perceptions of its current role in global
   politics. The article demonstrates that the UK media's representation of
   Yousafzai's story embraces and reproduces seemingly emancipatory
   discourses around girls' education, yet is ultimately limited by
   enduring gendered and orientalist discourses that underlie these new
   initiatives, which are simultaneously produced by, and productive of,
   unequal power relations. Despite Yousafzai's courageous campaigning,
   these discourses still make it easier for UK journalists to label her
   the shot Pakistani girl' than to call her powerful, a survivor or indeed
   a feminist.},

Abstract = {Agency structure can shape agency independence in two ways. First, it
   can insulate agencies from policy demands from political overseers in
   Congress and the executive branch. Second, agency structure can shape
   the range of available options from which agencies can select policy. In
   this article, we present a novel empirical approach that evaluates both
   types of effects by modeling the mean and variance of agencies' policy
   decisions. Analyses of US distributive program spending across 10
   congresses and 68 federal agencies show that agencies structured for
   independence enjoy a broader range of options from which to implement
   policy but are no less responsive to spending demands from members of
   Congress and the president.},

Journal = {AFRICAN AFFAIRS},

Number = {460},

Abstract = {During the early years of the United Nations Human Rights Council,
   formed in 2006, the African Group obstructed efforts to scrutinize and
   improve human rights in specific countries, notably in the cases of
   Darfur and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, in recent
   years the African Group has become willing to address country-specific
   human rights violations, particularly in Cote d'Ivoire, Libya, and
   Eritrea. This article documents the African Group's shift and asks why
   it occurred. Against the backdrop of debates about whether the liberal
   international order can survive a decline in American dominance, the
   study of the African Group's shift grants us insight into the elements
   that underpin liberal internationalism. Three explanations for the
   African Group's shift are considered: an improvement in the domestic
   human rights profile of African Group members, changes to the internal
   dynamics of the African Group, and the influence of the United States.
   The article concludes that American power was decisive, a finding that
   raises doubt about whether the liberal international order will survive
   a decline in American power.},

Abstract = {Communication between stakeholders and the larger public is an
   increasingly important issue in today's policy world. This communication
   often takes the form of policy narratives; however, few studies have
   empirically examined what type of communication style stakeholders
   prefer for communication with the public. This study uses a survey of 87
   river stakeholders to determine the preferred communication choices of
   stakeholders. The study finds that 39\% of the stakeholders chose a
   duty-based narrative, 28\% choose a science statement, 23\% choose an
   engaged citizen narrative, and 10\% choose a do nothing statement. Some
   of these preferences were related to issues of trust, other policy
   preferences, and demographic background. Based on previous research, the
   findings demonstrate that stakeholders can make decisions about how to
   communicate with the public that are not necessarily reflective of the
   own values.},

Abstract = {Looking at how divided states competed against each other in the arena
   of citizenship since 1949, this research observes a number of common
   trends. The German and Chinese case studies manifested a shared trend in
   large part because they faced comparable challenges and responded with
   similar citizenship strategies in their quest for national legitimacy
   and diplomatic recognition. The policy effectiveness depended on the
   intensity of inter-state rivalry, the Cold War diplomacy, and the global
   nationality trends. The tight bipolar system and the strong
   international cooperation on nationality in Europe (among the socialist
   and non-socialist blocs) explain why both German states were in more
   favourable circumstances in asserting their citizenship claim. These two
   aspects are missing in the Asian context, which explain the absence of
   the role of the international community in legitimising or supporting
   the Chinese citizenship rivalry. This paper concludes that citizenship
   policies in the two German states were shaped in response to one
   another. As compared to the German case, the Chinese and Taiwanese
   policies exhibited a more pragmatic and independent character. (C) 2016

Abstract = {In considering issue expertise in policymaking, we unpack differences in
   the supply and types of expertise with attention to the presumed
   privileged role of the bureaucracy. Our empirical investigation is based
   on witness testimonies of congressional hearings for a policy area
   involving various forms of expertise - critical infrastructure
   protection policymaking. Three sets of findings stand out. One set
   substantiates the role of the bureaucracy as an important information
   conduit while also showing it is not a primary source of issue
   expertise. A second set shows how differences in issue maturity and
   salience affect the demand for and supply of expertise. A third set
   illustrates the influence of a small cadre of hyper-expertise in drawing
   attention to problems and solutions across different venues. These
   findings challenge the conventional view of the bureaucracy in
   policymaking while expanding the understanding of different sources of
   information and types of issue expertise in policymaking.},

Abstract = {Bernard Williams was an ethical sceptic, but he was also a proponent of
   liberalism. To what extent can one finally be both? This article
   explores this question through a particular emphasis on Williams, but
   seeks to draw wider lessons regarding what ethical scepticism should and
   should not amount to. It shows how ethical scepticism can be reconciled
   with a commitment to what Williams, following Judith Shklar, called the
   liberalism of fear', which is revealed as an ecumenical outlook for
   different stripes of ethical sceptic. The article concludes by drawing
   some lessons for the recent realist' turn in political theory.},

Abstract = {Why do some state leaders engage in genocide and politicide while others
   do not? Extant theory focuses on how large openings in the domestic
   political structure of a country, such as civil or interstate war,
   increase the likelihood that a government will respond with violence
   against its civilian population. This article builds from this previous
   theory to argue that smaller crises can provide governments with the
   same incentives and opportunities to engage in political mass murder.
   Statistical tests of all cases of genocide and politicide since 1955
   support this argument. In addition to civil wars, assassinations, coups
   and strikes increase the likelihood of political mass murder, especially
   genocide. These findings are important as they caution the international
   community against fixating on large-scale crises as the impetus for
   genocide and politicide.},

Abstract = {Most research on policy agendas is based on the assumption that space on
   the agenda is fixed and, hence, focuses on how problems compete for this
   limited agenda space. This article holds that policy agendas may be
   limited but not fixed, meaning that problems may not always be traded
   off but confronted through a larger policy agenda. Based on an extensive
   collection of local council agendas from 98 Danish municipalities over
   time, this article investigates variations in agenda size across local
   governments and examines the extent to which this reflects the local
   problem environment. The analysis reveals that a large council agenda
   arises in response to an unfriendly problem environment, particularly if
   there are many committees to channel problems onto the agenda and, to a
   lesser extent, if center-left parties hold office.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the influence of the institutions that aim to
   foster democracy in Europe, such as the European Union, European Court
   of Human Rights and Venice Commission on political party closure cases
   in Europe, through a comparative study on the Democratic Society Party
   (DTP) decision in Turkey and the Batasuna decision in Spain. Adopting
   the theory of communicative action, the arguments presented by the
   judges in the related reasoned decisions are analysed according to three
   categories: utility; values; and rights. It is argued that the European
   norms and principles constitute the main strand of justifications;
   hence, the European institutions have a considerable right-based
   influence on national courts.},

Title = {Men of Honor Don't Talk: The Relationship Between Masculine Honor and
   Social Activism Against Criminal Organizations in Italy},

Abstract = {Criminal organizations have a strong influence on social, political, and
   economic life in Italy and other parts of the world. Nonetheless, local
   populations display collective passivity against organized crime, a
   phenomenon known as omerta. Omerta is linked to the concepts of honor
   and masculinity. That is, in order to fit ideological constructions of
   manliness, individuals should display indifference toward illegal
   activities and should not collaborate with legal institutions. In two
   studies, we investigated the link between endorsement of a masculine
   honor ideology and collective action intentions against criminal
   organizations (antimafia). Study 1 (N=121) involved a Northern Italian
   sample, and Study 2 (N=301) involved a Southern Italian sample. Across
   studies, results showed that endorsement of masculine honor ideology was
   associated with lower willingness to engage in social activism against
   criminal organizations. This relationship was mediated by attitudes

Abstract = {Social movements often amalgamate otherwise diffuse public political
   interests. In recent years, social media use has allowed both groups and
   individuals to engage with political issues both online and offline. How
   do organizations use Twitter to mobilize networked publics? To what
   extent do groups promote both connective action' online and traditional
   activism offline? How do their strategies differ according to whether
   they seek to promote or combat the status quo? And how do they balance
   encouraging and reinforcing individualized expression through group
   messaging? The ways pro-Keystone XL pipeline and anti-Keystone XL groups
   differed in their Keystone-related action on Twitter from January 2010
   until October 2014 are analyzed. Boolean searching and Natural Language
   processing are used to analyze more than three million tweets. The
   results demonstrate that the frames within Twitter conversations have
   significant implications for how communities understand, develop, and
   mobilize around environmental issues.},

Abstract = {Many studies have striven to understand which factors affect the
   performance of public networks. However, there are very few studies in
   the field of public management that investigate the joint, interactive
   effects of different determinants on network performance. This article
   uses the relatively new method of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA)
   to investigate the complex causality of determinants and network
   performance. It examines the combination of resource munificence,
   centralization of the network structure, formalization of coordination
   mechanisms, network management and their joint effects on network
   performance. An analysis of 12 Swiss networks providing home and social
   care services shows that there are a range of possible paths. Various
   combinations of the above-mentioned factors can in fact lead to high
   network performance. The paths provide insight into how to make public
   networks really work.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Volume = {60},
Number = {1},
Pages = {38-46},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Why do some parties to intrastate conflict refuse to negotiate? I
   propose a simple theory of civil conflict in which the act of
   negotiation itself carries costs and benefits. Several hypotheses
   follow: parties to civil conflict will avoid negotiation when they (1)
   fear alienating external supporters or internal constituencies, (2) risk
   granting legitimacy to their opponents or signaling weakness to other
   potential claimants, or (3) find it difficult to identify reliable
   negotiating partners. Empirical tests find support for my argument. My
   findings suggest that cases exist in which the parties would reach an
   agreement if only they could overcome the costs of negotiation and
   engage in talks. Diplomats and mediators should consider the costs and
   benefits of talks when planning the timing and form of interventions
   designed to bring parties to the table.},

Abstract = {Across African states, militias have become one of the main agents of
   political violence, accounting for a third of all recent conflict.
   Militia violence is attributed to cultural reactions to disorder,
   failing and predatory states, and local cleavages which emerge during
   civil wars. However, activity largely occurs in democratizing states
   without civil wars. This article presents a typology of militias based
   on their local roles and actions and an explanation for the prevalence
   of competition militias. Changes in macro politics ushered in a new era
   of conflict and fragmentation among political elites; militias operate
   as private armies for these elites. The goal of this violence is to
   alter the political landscape, increase power for patrons, protect
   supportive communities, and hinder opponents. Incentives within African
   democratic institutions reward the use of force by elites. As a result,
   African democracies, and states transitioning into democracy, are not
   likely to be internally peaceful. Futhermore, the dominant type of
   conflict across African states shifts to accommodate the goals of
   violent agents within modern political contexts.},

Abstract = {The present contribution explores the changing relationship between the
   European Union (EU) and the two largest countries in its eastern
   neighbourhood, namely Ukraine and Russia, between 1991 and 2014. Taking
   the differential between the existence of the EU Strategic Partnership
   (SP) with Russia and the absence of such an arrangement in the
   relationship with Ukraine as a point of departure, it investigates how
   the EU has dealt with different aspirations and challenges stemming from
   its two largest eastern neighbours. Adopting the Social Identity Theory
   perspective, the contribution analyses the interrelationship between the
   evolution of the EU's SP approach towards the eastern neighbours and the
   development of (particular dimensions of) the EU's identity. It
   demonstrates how the process of categorization relating to the
   ideational `self', `we' and `other' took place; and how only the EU's
   relationship with Russia and not that with Ukraine has accumulated the
   discursive markers of a strategic partnership. The contribution,
   furthermore, analyses the challenges to the EU changing approach
   stemming from the 2013-2014 Ukraine crisis.},

Abstract = {With the Afghan mission winding down, the German Bundeswehr is in the
   process of implementing a new doctrinal system, resting on the adoption
   of NATO doctrine and a new joint operational doctrine. This is a
   historical first, which this paper argues is explained by two factors:
   functionally, for armed forces deeply integrated into NATO, the
   practical need for a joint operational doctrine did not exist. More
   importantly, culture matters: Germany features a highly
   institutionalized strategic culture that places distinct limits on some
   forms of joint doctrine. Thus, while impressive and logical, current
   doctrinal plans of the Bundeswehr, relying as they do on an `alliance
   shortcut', raise important questions that need to be answered to ensure
   continuously functioning civil-military relations.},

Abstract = {In this article we challenge Kurzer and Cooper's claim that the industry
   was able to get its way in the Food Information to Consumers Regulation
   by successfully lobbying the European Parliament and benefiting from an
   industry-friendly rapporteur. We scrutinize their findings through a
   comprehensive analysis of all amendments tabled in the environmental
   committee at first reading and a process tracing of the 12 most salient
   issues. Our results indicate a rather balanced rapporteur and show that
   both the ENVI committee and the plenary EP changed the regulation in
   favour of consumer interests on a significant number of points, with key
   victories for the industry being the result of pressure from the
   Council, not from the European Parliament. We explain these results on
   the basis of earlier work examining the role-behaviour of rapporteurs
   and the functioning of Parliament committees.},

Abstract = {In contemporary politics, the power and status of a country are
   intimately connected with its economic wealth. In particular, GDP has
   become the benchmark by which the global pecking order is defined.
   Initially designed as a mere survey of a nation's income, GDP has become
   an ordering principle in international governance. Yet the convergence
   of socioeconomic, environmental and energy crises currently questions
   the sustainability of GDP maximization and its political relevance,
   strengthened by a growing consensus among policy makers and experts that
   GDP is an inadequate metric of economic success. As countries move
   beyond GDP and new indicators are introduced, the overall international
   political order may also change. In particular, some non-G7 countries
   may emerge as global leaders in wellbeing, prosperity and sustainable
   development. We may be witnessing a gradual shift to a new Bretton
   Woods, possibly leading to a profound restructuring of globalization
   with the emergence of new forms of supranational regionalism in which
   more equitable and sustainable economies will play a leading role.},

Abstract = {Using evidence from voting in the UN General Assembly (UNGA), this
   article shows that leader turnover, especially in small coalition,
   nondemocratic systems, increases the likelihood of policy realignment.
   Autocrats who are beholden to only a small proportion of the population
   represent the foreign policy interests of their small number of
   supporters. When leader turnover occurs, the interests represented often
   shift too and this results in an increased volatility and regression
   toward a neutral position of a nation's alignment at the United Nations
   vis-a-vis the United States. While such realignments can offer an
   opportunity to reduce enmity between states, they can also signal
   growing differences between friends. The impact of leaders change in
   large coalitions produces more moderate shifts in alignments.},

Abstract = {The primary task for the environmental state is to address problems
   related to the market's externalisation of environmental costs. It has
   four main resources at its disposal: regulation, redistribution,
   organisation, and knowledge generation. The way these four resources are
   deployed make up a state's environmental governance arrangements. Using
   data on environmental regulation, taxes, public administrations, and
   knowledge production from 28 countries, and a hierarchical cluster
   analysis, four different types of environmental states are identified:
   established, emerging, partial, and weak. This is followed by some
   suggestions for further research on the environmental state in a
   comparative perspective.},

Abstract = {This research note presents a dynamic risk assessment model of homegrown
   terrorists. The model was tested in a study of convicted homegrown
   American terrorism offenders inspired by Al Qaeda's ideology. The New
   York Police Department model developed by Silber and Bhatt was chosen as
   the basis for creating a typology of overt and detectable indicators of
   individual behaviors widely thought to be associated with extremism.
   Twenty-four specific cues associated with each stage of radicalization
   were used to code and estimate the sequencing of behaviors and the
   duration of the average radicalization trajectory. Sixty-eight cases
   have been analyzed thus far. A decision was made to publish the initial
   results when it became apparent that the model was an effective tool for
   the evaluation of terrorist offenders.},

Abstract = {The European Union's (EU) political and economic integration project has
   grown dramatically since its inception in 1952. While the ultimate goal
   of the EU is unclear, one of its aspirations has been to attempt to
   create European citizens. The idea is that over time, citizens would
   look towards Europe as their main national identity. While the political
   and economic integration projects are quite far along, the national
   identity project has lagged far behind. The number of people who have
   primarily a European identity is quite small and has not increased much
   in the past 20 years. There is a far larger number of citizens for whom
   their national identity is paramount, but a European identity also
   exists. Since 2005, this group has grown smaller and the number of
   citizens with only a national identity has grown larger. This article
   argues that the EU integration project has pushed citizens to value
   their national identities more and to look to their national governments
   to protect them. We examine the evidence for this in the context of the
   2007-9 financial crisis. We show that in countries most seriously hit by
   the crisis, national identities have increased dramatically and citizens
   with some European identity have decreased.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {43},
Number = {147},
Pages = {73-88},

Abstract = {Rising state expenditure threatens to outstrip the South African
   government's ability to pay. This danger is merely a symptom of and
   challenge to the predatory characteristics of the `party-state' erected
   by the ruling African National Congress (ANC), notably as they are
   exhibited under the presidency of Jacob Zuma. The ANC government is
   increasingly looking to an oil and gas bonanza to avoid a `fiscal
   cliff', while Zuma himself is driving a nuclear power future which
   threatens to bankrupt the economy. The latter strategy conforms to the
   party's greater disposition to corruption and patronage. Key parastatals
   have become headed by Zuma cronies; family and friends have been awarded
   government favour; and Zuma's personal interests intrude upon the
   governance of parastatals, the South African Revenue Service and the
   functioning of constitutionally protected agencies such as the office of
   the Public Protector. The Zuma government's repudiation of
   accountability highlights an official drift to secrecy. However, the
   increasing limitations of ANC economic policy combine with growing
   discontent in society to place the party's political hegemony at risk -
   but Zuma's presidency has compromised the ANC's capacity for internal
   reform.},

Abstract = {Regional disparities within the European Union have always been
   perceived as an impediment to monetary integration. Discussions on a
   joint currency were linked to compensatory payments in the form of
   regional policy. Structural assistance increased sharply at the end of
   the 1980s. Later, however, it had to be shared with the new member
   states in the East. Moreover, the low-interest credit that Southern
   European Monetary Union members enjoyed as a result of interest rate
   convergence is no longer available. We predict that considerable amounts
   of financial aid will have to be provided in the future by rich to poor
   member countries, if only to prevent a further increase in economic
   disparities. We also expect ongoing distributional conflict between
   payer and recipient countries far beyond current rescue packages. We
   illustrate the dimension of the conflict by comparing income gaps and
   relative population size between the centre and periphery in Europe and
   in two nation-states with high regional disparities, Germany and Italy.},

Abstract = {This paper attempts to reconceptualise from an historical perspective
   South Africa's regional political economy. Adopting a broadly
   materialist approach, this paper illustrates how South Africa's
   relationship with the region can be understood as a system of
   accumulation based on what may be called a government-business-media
   (GBM) complex. The analysis follows a critical rewriting of South
   Africa's regional relations until the attainment of democracy, as seen
   through the concept of the GBM complex. By so doing, this paper seeks to
   lay the foundations for an alternative understanding of South Africa's
   political economy, but also aims to contribute to the literature on, and
   theorisation of, `complexes'.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the results of surveys of both expert and public
   opinion regarding the introduction of a local real estate tax in
   Croatia. The methodology encompasses descriptive statistics and two
   models (the PLS-SEM and the binomial probit regression model). Support
   for the introduction of the real estate tax is stronger among the
   experts than the general public. However, the experts differ on
   professional lines, with faculty specialized in economics from
   departments of finance and accounting generally being against the tax.
   Both models reveal positive relationships between support for the tax
   and support for more equitable taxation. Meanwhile, the broader expert
   model is, besides profession and equity, also negatively influenced by
   attitudes in favour of lower taxation costs and positively influenced by
   attitudes in favour of property being an adequate indicator of ability
   to pay and of the need to tax capital income. The public opinion model
   is positively influenced by equity and negatively influenced by negative
   expectations about the abolition of existing real estate user charges
   and taxes. Work status is also relevant.},

Pages = {383-406},
Abstract = {With the elections of 2015-16 in Greece, Spain and Portugal, the
   political fallout from the economic crisis in Southern Europe reached a
   new level. An overview of the new electoral arenas and party systems is
   followed by an investigation of the paths to government formation.
   Unprecedented events during (multiple) processes of government
   formation, uncharted outcomes in government types and governing party
   identities, and the necessity to repeat elections are three features
   defining a new syndrome that first appeared in Greece but has now spread
   to Iberia. In Southern Europe the road to incumbency has become arduous
   and the risk of government instability high.},

Abstract = {Identifying sustainability transition in the health sector involves
   analysis of the dynamic and the forces influencing political,
   sociotechnical and cultural features. The aim of this study is to
   identify transition in health in a Brazil facing globalization,
   demographic, migration, environmental and climate change effects and
   inequities. Brazil has improved its capacity to formulate, implement,
   monitor and evaluate multi-sectoral and universal public policies in the
   last twenty years, with the implementation of universal health care and
   conditional cash transfers. These policies have resulted in the
   improvement of the health indicators of extreme poverty and hunger,
   underfive mortality, maternal health, infectious diseases, and primary
   education coverage. Since the frequency of extreme weather events has
   been increasing globally and in Brazil, and cardiovascular diseases are
   a leading cause of death, the consequences for health systems must be
   considered. Mortality due to traffic accidents has also increased,
   despite policy efforts and restrictive laws, overwhelming health
   services and public financial resources.},

Abstract = {The Arctic, because of its particular exposure to climate change, has
   become a laboratory of the Anthropocene in two interlinked aspects,
   called the `Arctic paradox': on the one hand, the Arctic is particularly
   affected by the anthropocenic effects on the Earth System, in particular
   global warming. These anthropogenic effects have the potential to
   trigger a series of tipping points, which, in turn, will irreversibly
   alter the balance of the Earth System, at least as it prevailed during
   the Holocene, and become security issues. On the other hand, the warming
   Arctic is opening up new, unprecedented opportunities for oil, gas and
   minerals exploration and exploitation, thus offering yet another lease
   on life to industrial civilization, the very origin of the Anthropocene.
   Can this paradoxical dynamics be broken?},

Abstract = {Domestic terrorism, as a form of intrastate violence, has varied widely
   in South Asia along with the post-Cold War period of global economic
   integration and political openness. How are these two phenomenaeconomic
   integration and emergence of democraciesrelated to domestic terrorism in
   South Asia? I argue that resorting to terrorism is a rational choice
   when individuals'/groups' cost of heterogeneitydeprivation from public
   goods due to geographical and ideological distanceincreases; opportunity
   is provided by democratization and integration into the global economy.
   The testable hypotheses derived from the theory are empirically tested
   on a dataset of five South Asian countries for the time period between
   1990 and 2007. The results show that both minority discrimination and
   presence of unconsolidated democratic institutions increase terrorism in
   the highly heterogeneous South Asian countries. International trade in
   the presence of minority discrimination increases homegrown terrorism,
   but foreign direct investment neither increases nor decreases such
   incidents.},

Abstract = {We investigate the life span and risk of termination of 723 arm's length
   agencies in the United Kingdom between 1985 and 2008, an under
   investigated question in parliamentary systems. We hypothesize that
   termination risk depends on three groups of factors: (1) factors
   relating to the rationales for initial delegation of responsibility to
   the arm's length agency; (2) factors relating to the political and
   economic position of the government; and (3) factors relating to the
   institutional form of the agency. We find that agencies intended to
   generate credible commitments in regulation are less likely than others
   to be terminated in any given year. Agencies operating under right-wing
   governments and under heavily indebted governments are more likely to be
   terminated, although left-wing governments are more sensitive to the
   effects of debt. Agencies structured as executive non-departmental
   public bodies and non-ministerial departments are also longer lived than
   others. Contrary to expectations about arm's length agencies in
   parliamentary systems with single-party government, partisan change does
   not affect the risk of termination.},

Abstract = {To an observer, Japan's approach to nuclear weapons can appear confused
   and contradictory. The only country to have been attacked with nuclear
   weapons is variously described as a pacifist and non-nuclear nation and
   as a proliferation threat. These widely varied and conflicting
   conclusions are understandable given that conflicting messages are sent
   by senior figures. However Japan's stance is in fact a coherent, if not
   uncomplicated, response both to its security needs and to domestic
   public opinion. However, the security provided by US extended nuclear
   deterrence underlines and enables this approach. The key policies and
   decisions were taken in both Washington and Tokyo between China's first
   nuclear test (1964) and Japan's ratification of the Nuclear
   Non-Proliferation Treaty (1976). How the United States came to offer
   this additional security guarantee to Japan and how Japan came to rely
   upon it underscore this complex stance and are crucial to understanding
   a longstanding and ongoing security arrangement and source of stability
   and security in northeast Asia.},

Title = {Rethinking subnational government capacity in China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {1},
Number = {4},
Pages = {633-653},
Abstract = {It is clear that some subnational governments are better than others at
   orchestrating major policy programs, yet important questions remain
   about how and why subnational government capacity varies from case to
   case. Scholarship that emphasizes political agency in explaining
   subnational policy outcomes is not always clear as to where such agency
   comes from. Meanwhile, research that defines the power of subnational
   units in terms of their formal administrative authority, fiscal
   capacity, and political status does not fully explain how these
   structural endowments translate into effective agency. This article
   works toward a conception of subnational government capacity better able
   to integrate these approaches and bridge the agency-structure divide. I
   call for greater attention to the connective structures that enable
   subnational governments to take the initiative in policymaking and
   mobilize resources, stressing provinces' internal cohesion and upward
   political ties. To illustrate the need for a broader conception of
   subnational capacity, and to show the importance of connective power in
   action, I analyze the contrasting outcomes of regional development
   strategies in two Chinese provinces.},

Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-77},
Abstract = {This article identifies demoi-cracy as the most robust category for
   understanding the European Union, and three tasks are undertaken to
   contribute towards this conceptualisation. First, it is explained how
   demoi-cracy differs from other popular categories that have been used to
   describe the EU and why it stands out as the most accurate. Second,
   contrary to the view that places demoi-cracy in contrast to political
   systems existing with a singular demos, it is argued that this concept
   is best understood as being capable of capturing cases where a weaker
   demos exists alongside strong sovereign demoi. Finally, the idea of
   demoi-cracy is broken into two further concepts (deep diversity and dual
   compound regime) and elaborated upon at length with a view to further
   specifying the nature of the EU.},

Abstract = {This chapter returns to the central question - to what extent do
   contemporary ethical approaches to the duty of assistance offer ways to
   resolve the tensions faced by those engaged in the current practice of
   assistance? Through an examination of the approaches offered by Onora
   O'Neill and Amartya Sen, it argues that both deontological and
   consequentialist frameworks can provide ways to resolve the tensions
   faced by those engaged in the practice of assistance. Both accounts are
   potentially disruptive in that they prompt questioning, critical
   reflection, and enable dynamic approaches to aid that stretch
   considerably beyond simple and determinate prescriptive actions. They
   clarify the basis of the duty of assistance as an imperfect duty that is
   wide in reach, and is open and unspecified in its requirements. Both
   approaches construct robust accounts of active situated agents engaging
   in a process of practical reasoning that supports agents to figure out
   how to specify the requirements of this duty in particular, concrete
   circumstances. Both accounts also point to additional considerations for
   those supporting such practices, and in particular, how agents might
   navigate issues related to harm and the matter of responsibility for the
   outcomes of action.},

Abstract = {This chapter adjudicates between the broad deontological and
   consequentialist frameworks of O'Neill and Sen to identify the most
   appropriate framework to guide action in the contemporary circumstances
   of assistance. There are a number of areas of overlap between these
   approaches as both seek to retain the imperfect nature of this duty, and
   also to place this duty into a wider moral landscape in which situated
   non-idealised agents are based. Using the idea of `practical' to develop
   appropriate criteria for evaluation, it finds that an application and
   extension of a broad consequentialist approach provides a more practical
   framework to guide the actions of agents in the contemporary context.
   Three reasons are offered in defence of this claim. Firstly, I argue
   that a non-monistic pluralist theoretical framework provides a more
   inclusive moral basis to guide agents in the performance of this duty.
   Secondly, I argue a dualistic method of justification that blends both
   weighing of outcomes and testing of actions may remove and reduce
   conflict and manage uncertainty in a way that narrower methodological
   duty-based approaches cannot. In providing agents with a clear, but open
   framework for practical reasoning and evaluation, this procedural
   framework can avoid the risk of inaction and reduce confusion and
   uncertainty where possible, accepting that this may not always be
   possible. Thirdly, I argue that a pluralistic, non-idealised
   outcome-focused approach provides a stronger foundation for action,
   while seeking to minimise harms and unintended outcomes, and maximise
   responsibility for the outcomes of action. Through action, connection,
   and interconnection this approach explains how incremental moral duties
   can arise in the performance of assistance that can mark the beginning
   of special relationships rather than the complete fulfilment of a moral
   duty.},

Abstract = {The article discusses advances and limitations of Comparative Capitalism
   scholarship on the causes of the Eurozone crisis. It explains the crisis
   by highlighting four basic mechanisms: first, the absence of a system of
   coordinated wage bargaining has been made responsible for the loss of
   cost competitiveness. Second, the specialization in price-sensitive
   medium-quality goods and the corresponding loss of market shares to
   emerging markets has been attributed to the weak innovation systems of
   Southern economies. Third, the loss of competitiveness has been masked
   temporarily by a strong increase of public indebtedness and, fourth,
   private household indebtedness. These four explanations do not put the
   blame for the Eurozone crisis on a single government or a single type of
   actors, but rather highlight the systemic causes for the crisis, brought
   about by the construction of a common currency for institutionally very
   heterogeneous economies.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {675-704},
Abstract = {This chapter examines a transition process in a river basin in the
   central part of Mexico that is highly affected by climate change, social
   deterioration and the drugs war. The Yautepec River Basin is
   particularly prone to climate impacts because of its abrupt slopes,
   numerous affluents, and high population density in its floodplain, which
   is frequently exposed to hurricane impacts. Taking into account
   laissez-faire policies, illegality, government corruption, and public
   insecurity in a region with high levels of dual vulnerability
   (environmental and social), as well as subject to hazard impacts, the
   chapter reviews the constraints of the process of transition towards
   sustainability, especially when the goals of the people and of the
   government are not identical. People organized themselves regionally in
   order to simultaneously increase public security and freedom from hazard
   impacts, which both directly affect life and livelihood. Using original
   survey data, the study examines the risks perceived by the people and
   the ways in which they reduce these risks of extreme events, as well as
   how they cooperate with the authorities to improve environmental
   conditions, to enhance disaster risk reduction activities and to reduce
   the impact of criminal acts. The transition process requires the
   integration of numerous social, economic, political, environmental,
   judicial, cultural and mental factors in order to develop processes and
   resilience from the bottom up to deal with this complex emergency, as
   well as to force the different levels of government to enhance all four
   aspects of the human security of the people: `freedom from fear',
   `freedom from want' `freedom from hazard impacts', and `freedom to live
   in dignity'.},

Pages = {1603-1623},
Abstract = {This paper takes issue with approaches that relate realist political
   theology exclusively back to its Schmittian and neo-orthodox roots.
   While not entirely denying those influences, it argues that realist
   thought is more accurately described as rooted in the tensions
   characterizing Augustine's anti-heretic diatribes rather than taking
   inspiration from Schmittian political theology or the Gnostic'
   tendencies in Protestant neo-orthodox theology. Augustine's refutation
   of both the Manichaean Gnostic and the Pelagian solutions to the problem
   of evil gave rise to a complex understanding of the relationship between
   human free will and original sin based on a combination of ontological
   monism and ethical dualism. Building on this heritage, realists can be
   read as rehearsing Augustine's ambiguous gesture of overcoming
   Gnosticism with equally uncertain success. In responding to the modern
   Gnostic' challenge in terms that recognized the dialectical tension
   between ontological monism and ethical dualism, realists such as
   Morgenthau and Niebuhr should rather be seen as direct heirs of
   Augustine's ambivalent orthodoxy rather than Schmitt's unorthodox,
   semi-Gnostic' Catholicism. This intellectual legacy may, then, explain
   their abhorrence of purist positions in politicsbe they quietism,
   pacifism or, their opposite, political messianismand adherence to an
   anti-Gnostic' pragmatism grounded in the tensions of Augustinian
   theology.},

Abstract = {This article provides a critique of constructivism and
   post-structuralism within IR theory from an embodied, realist
   perspective. Meaning is not made as much as experienced, we will argue,
   and subjectivity is not constructed as much as enacted. The theater
   illustrates the difference between constructivist, post-structuralist
   and embodied perspectives. By analyzing international politics in terms
   of a performance instead of performativity a more credible version of
   the sovereign subject can be identified. The world is a stage and it is
   only by appearing on this world stage that the state becomes real. To
   back up this argument the article draws from recent research in
   cognitive theory and neuroscience.},

Abstract = {In this article I present a comparative consideration of two conceptual
   frameworks that have informed critical research by policy-interested
   scholars: institutional ethnography and governmentality. I argue that
   these two approaches to research are similar in important respects: both
   focus on the analysis of linkages between everyday practices and the
   ruling/governing programs and strategies that aspire to shape these;
   both accord a central place to the operation and effects of
   discourse/discursive practices - particularly texts - in their accounts
   of how these linkages are forged. I also discuss several differences
   that distinguish them, including their diverse assessment of the value
   and effects of mobilizing research for social justice oriented ends. In
   closing, I consider the possibilities for analysis and action that may
   be opened up or, alternatively, narrowed or closed down by research
   conducted using each of these frameworks, and suggest the value of
   ongoing reflexive dialogue between them.},

Abstract = {This article critically reviews the recent debate on social movements
   and protests in African Studies. It problematises prevailing
   conceptualisations, addresses the methodological difficulties of data
   gathering and scrutinises theoretical references in contemporary
   scholarship. As an alternative to established approaches and based on
   fieldwork in Conakry and Kampala, the author suggests capturing the
   dynamic nature of protest movements through the concept of
   crystallisation. Inspired by philosopher Gilbert Simondon, the
   crystallisation concept grasps protests as processes emerging from
   everyday urban politics and reflexively considers the researcher as part
   of the phenomena he or she describes.},

Abstract = {Recently the causal influence of education on political knowledge has
   been questioned. Rather, pre-adult predispositions such as personality
   traits and intelligence are proposed as the real causal agents. This
   article investigates in two studies whether education retains its
   explanatory power regarding political knowledge when personality traits
   and intelligence are taken into account. One study draws on a draftee
   sample and has excellent measures of both personality traits and
   intelligence; the other study draws on a representative sample and has
   excellent measures of personality traits. Openness to experience and
   intelligence are found to be positive predictors of political knowledge
   and neuroticism a negative predictor of political knowledge. In both
   studies, education remains the single strongest predictor of political
   knowledge. Furthermore, education can, to a large extent, even out the
   differences in political knowledge between those with high and low
   cognitive abilities.},

Abstract = {Experts have come to dominate global economic policies under certain
   institutional ideological discourse. But what happens when most of the
   policy players in developing countries do not belong to globalised
   institutions? This article interrogates the role of national officials
   in reinforcing Western institutional hegemony. A review of housing
   policies in Sierra Leone since independence, and interviews with housing
   sector officials, show that the current manifestation of such
   superstructure and its reinforcing nature also mask new economic
   interests. The review shows that local national officials, who are often
   presented as passive objects of power, actually have enormous
   interpretive agency, and the aggressive articulation of their
   exclusionary approach demonstrates specific actionable interventions
   which enable them to create space and advantage for themselves. The lack
   of a new articulative strategy means that commitment to local content
   remains only as paper plans and symbolic gestures.},

Abstract = {Cow protection is not new to India. However, the political ascendancy of
   the Bharatiya Janata Party and by extension, that of its parent
   organization, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, gives new force to beef
   bans. These have significant consequences for the religious freedom and
   material welfare of India's minorities. The article locates the beef
   bans among rising Hindu chauvinist trends, and examines the textual,
   communal, and historical antecedents of cow protection. We subject the
   bans to the essentials of religion test which the state has used to
   resolve contentious religious issues in the past, finding that
   proscriptions on beef consumption are not essential components of Hindu
   religious practice. The beef bans are also emboldening violence by
   fringe groups such as cow vigilantes. Though ostensibly supported by the
   Constitution and enacted in order to protect Hindu sensibilities, in
   practice beef bans endorse an excessively narrow, Brahmanical form of
   HinduismHindutvawhile simultaneously impoverishing the material,
   religious, and physical well-being of minority communities such as
   Muslims and Dalits. The cumulative effect is totalitarian and inimical
   to the democratic and secular foundations of the Indian state.},

Abstract = {This article examines the influence of cultural-institutional factors on
   user-provider relationships in public services. Using Grid-Group
   Cultural Theory (CT) as a way to structure the complexity of public
   service relationships, the article considers the extent to which public
   services are attuned to users' relational concerns. This analysis shows
   particular tensions between how users think the service `should be'
   compared with how they think the service `actually is'. Additional study
   evidence is used to assess these findings; in particular, the effects of
   different patterns of compatibility on both the perceived quality of
   public service relationships and the value added by this. Finally,
   relationships between `good opportunities' for user voice and the above
   results are discussed. In response, opportunities for improvement are
   identified (within the institutional work done by public service
   organizations), and the implications for the relative value of CT
   analysis are discussed.},

Title = {NAPLAN data: a new policy assemblage and mode of governance in
   Australian schooling},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {37},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {568-582},

Abstract = {As part of a policy assemblage, the National Assessment Program -
   Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) is representative of a new mode of
   governance for Australia's schooling systems, indicative of
   international trends in educational accountability based on testing. The
   policy assumption was that the introduction of a national performance
   measurement system would tightly couple school practices to national
   agendas targeted at improving learning outcomes. This paper presents a
   comparative case study of two primary schools within a single Queensland
   region to interrogate how coupling and decoupling strategies are enacted
   in respect of the policy usage of NAPLAN data. The granular analysis of
   the governance relationship between the school principals and their
   supervisors is set against the politics, policies and pressures of
   NAPLAN that recast the initiative as high stakes for systems, schools
   and their leadership. Specifically, we argue that Queensland's choice
   and enactment of policy instruments have produced a new mode of
   governance of principal conduct, but one mediated by the specific
   contexts of the two schools. The analysis shows how this mode has
   precipitated two types of decoupling.},

Abstract = {In this article, I argue that the present low-point in US Russian
   relations does not negate the existence of order between the two great
   powers. US Russian relations remain remarkably orderly irrespective of
   the continued presence of irritants and points of friction in the
   relationship. That is the Russian Federation and the USA continue to
   conceive of each other as indispensable members of international society
   in, at the very least, the `pluralist' sense of this concept. I
   empirically buttress this argument by way of a tour d'horizon of US
   Russian relations during the administration of President Barack Obama,
   spanning, thereby, the administrations of presidents Dmitry Medvedev and
   Vladimir Putin.},

Abstract = {This article examines the shootings of 26 unarmed civilians, 14 of which
   proved fatal, by members of the British Parachute regiment in Derry,
   Northern Ireland, in 1972. The article will provide a new explanation
   for this incident which remains highly controversial in British and
   Irish politics. It will argue that macro-explanations for the killings
   are insufficient and that the micro-situation on the ground that day
   needs to be examined in order to understand this event. Different
   narratives in relation to the actions of the soldiers will be outlined.
   However, it will be maintained that Randall Collins' micro-sociological
   theory of violence, in particular its forward panic pathway, best
   explains the level of violence on that day. This will in turn improve
   our understanding of Bloody Sunday.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL THEORY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},

Pages = {436-447},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Buzan and Lawson's The Global Transformation establishes that many of
   the basic parameters of world politics originated in the long 19th
   century'. Despite finding much to admire in their book, we are concerned
   that it lacks an explicit theory of change. In its drive to highlight
   the novelty and exceptionalism of the 19th century, it offers
   insufficient guidance on two key issues: first, how international
   relations scholars should situate Buzan and Lawson's global
   transformation' in existing debates over transhistorical processes; and,
   second, how they should apply lessons from that transformation to
   understanding emergent trends in the contemporary world. We argue that a
   more explicit study of causal factors might help account for why the
   19th century was unusual. We conclude with thoughts about how the field
   should proceed after The Global Transformation. In particular, it points
   to how concatenating changes could profoundly alter international
   politics - an approach we term Exotic International Relations'. Buzan
   and Lawson's book therefore serves as a marker for the importance of
   systematically theorizing how radical potentialities for transformation
   might rearrange existing structural assemblages in world politics.},

Abstract = {Advanced metering infrastructure provides the first building block in
   smart grids by empowering customers and utilities with real-time
   information regarding energy use. It is a key element in the U.S.
   government's push for electric grid modernization. Using a panel dataset
   for 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia over the years
   2007-2012, we evaluate the impacts of a polycentric governance system
   and socioeconomic contexts on states' performance in smart metering
   deployment. We find that the advanced metering technological change in
   the United States has been exclusively created by the interdependencies
   and interactions between different layers of government. High-tech
   industry is the only socioeconomic factor that has a negative impact on
   smart meter deployment, whereas other factors, such as pressures from
   energy consumers and environmental groups, and electric grid conditions,
   have negligible impacts.},

Title = {GIFTS, THREATS, AND PERCEPTIONS OF BALLOT SECRECY IN AFRICAN ELECTIONS},
Journal = {AFRICAN AFFAIRS},

Abstract = {Are contingent electoral strategies, like vote buying and intimidation,
   effective in Africa? No, according to recent scholarship: unlike parties
   in other developing regions like Latin America, African parties lack the
   capacity to violate ballot secrecy and force voters to stick to their
   end of the bargain. Voters can therefore ``defect{''} and vote their
   conscience. We challenge this perspective. Recent Afrobarometer data
   show that nearly one in four Africans doubt ballot secrecy. We argue
   that the perception of ballot secrecy violation is sufficient for
   enabling contingent strategies. Drawing upon Afrobarometer data and an
   original exit poll conducted during the 2008 Ghanaian election, we show
   that doubts about ballot secrecy correlate with vote buying,
   intimidation efforts, and measures of campaign intensity, suggesting
   that they are a deliberate product of party efforts. Pervasive doubts
   about ballot secrecy challenge the notion that African parties are too
   weak to implement contingent electoral strategies. African parties can
   and do convince voters that their vote choices are known, particularly
   in urban areas where party capacity and community accessibility are
   highest. Doubts about ballot secrecy enable both vote buying and voter
   intimidation strategies, and suggest that formal rules enshrining the
   secret ballot offer insufficient protection to African voters.},

Abstract = {Community resilience is a central concept within crisis management
   policymaking, but it has escaped critical analysis. This article
   responds to this problem by examining a community-led response to a
   large natural disaster (the Queensland floods of 2010-11). The findings
   emerge from the application of a novel ethnographic method, uniquely
   informed by an insider's view of the disaster, which generated
   narratives from `the ground'. These narratives highlight a darker side
   to community resilience, which is largely unacknowledged, but needs to
   be understood so that we can critically appraise the concept more
   effectively in the future.},

Abstract = {While many militaries have tried to capitalize on the potential of
   information operations in internal war, few have succeeded. I argue that
   military information campaigns fall short of expectations for two
   reasons. First, the theory of influence militaries generally embrace -
   communications as a non-lethal weapons system - is largely invalid.
   While treating information as a weapons system makes it easier to
   integrate it into the existing military planning system, this overstates
   the independent effects of communications on behavior and understates
   the importance of interactive effects of what commercial marketing
   theory refers to as the marketing mix - product, price, promotion, and
   placement. It would be more appropriate to treat military information
   operations as a form of marketing: a composite effort to induce a
   specific behavior in a target audience by applying a combination of
   material and ideational instruments. The marketing model suggests that
   the efficacy of information operations will depend not simply on the
   message and its delivery (promotion) but on the behavior the sender
   seeks to induce (the product), the costs of that behavior (the price),
   and the opportunities available for such behavior (the placement).},

Abstract = {Preferences are crucial to the analysis of many key questions regarding
   international institutions. This article analyzes the key predictors of
   states' preferences over universal treaties. It does so by using a
   spatial-modeling approach that conceptualizes a treaty commitment
   preference space that includes agreements across multiple policy areas.
   I analyze the treaty commitment preference space in order to better
   understand the key dimensions of these preferences. I find that
   economics, and particularly trade, is the clearest and most consistent
   predictor of treaty commitment preferences, including with respect to
   many treaties in noneconomic policy areas.},

Abstract = {In the literature on collaborative governance, it is often assumed that
   collaborative capacity (i.e., the ability of actors to coordinate their
   activities around public issues in a collaborative fashion) is primarily
   generated during the collaborative process itself. In this article, we
   show that collaborative capacity can already emerge before the start of
   collaborations, in the form of a common ground and the bridging position
   that some actors attain through their involvement in different projects
   that build up to the collaboration. We introduce a conceptual framework
   that captures these dimensions of collaborative capacity, and we present
   findings on two case studies to test several propositions, using an
   approach called event sequence analysis. We find that in both cases a
   common ground develops before the start of collaborations and influences
   the aims that are chosen during the collaborations themselves. We also
   find that actors that attain a bridging position before the
   collaboration play an important role in assembling building blocks for
   collaboration together. Our findings have relevance primarily for
   regional collaborations that involve large numbers of professional
   organizations.},

   Abolish Nuclear Weapons' Operationalization of Critical IR Theories},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) has aimed
   to reenergize global civil society activism on nuclear weapons through a
   discursive strategy, borrowing self-consciously from critical and
   post-positivist international relations (IR) theories. ICAN aims to
   generate a new disarmament discourse that establishes nuclear weapons as
   inherently inhumane. Alongside the state-led Humanitarian Initiative,
   ICAN campaigners are helping to reshape the conversation at certain
   international meetings on nuclear weapons. They have helped to contest
   the dominance of national security narratives and force even the
   nuclear-armed states to address the humanitarian consequences of nuclear
   weapons. In supporting a reframing of the conversation, they have opened
   nuclear disarmament policy making to new voices. However, as with the
   transmission of many ideas from one arena to another - in this case from
   academia to global policy making forums - there is a translation process
   as ICAN campaigners selectively adopt from post-positivist IR to meet
   their political goals. It is possible that this translation of critical
   theorizing into the setting of multilateral forums has necessitated
   reducing the potency of the disruptive critique of the original ideas.},

Abstract = {Most of the analysis dealing with so-called ``emerging powers{''} in the
   field of peace and security seek to explain the intentions and
   motivations (supposedly) behind these states' foreign policy and
   changing normative positions. Several of those studies see foreign
   policy decisions as the result of rational processes, defined by a
   ``means-and-ends{''} logic, essentially oriented by preconceived
   national interests, clear ideational precepts and fixed identities.
   Through a non-conventional analysis of the participation of Brazil in
   the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), the paper
   aims to advance an understanding of foreign policy as an identity
   practice that, especially in moments of domestic identity crisis, helps
   reinforce and stabilize specific representations of the state self and
   of those acting in its name. Informed by a post-positivist approach, the
   case discussed in the paper opens some avenues to explore how
   interventionism can be analysed beyond traditional foreign policy
   rationales and mainstream international relations theories.},

Abstract = {On the basis of the premise that China, besides being a powerful
   civilization and state, is also a powerful discourse, this essay will
   set forth, as a preliminary analytical step, a plausible definition of
   the `Chinese mind' by describing certain essential characteristics that
   have been forged in China's classical culture and thought. When placed
   in the more creative sphere of discourse construction, these essential
   characteristics become ideological compounds of the here theorized
   `discourse called China', whose impact is weighed up as the focal
   analytical point in the discursive space of the PRC's foreign policy and
   diplomacy.},

Abstract = {Based on findings from the Everyday Peace Indicators project, the
   article considers how top-down and bottom-up narratives and
   understandings of conflict often differ. The article posits that
   top-down narratives are often the result of a peculiar framing system
   that imposes imaginaries on conflicts and those experiencing them. The
   bottom-up narratives, based on research in South Africa, South Sudan,
   Uganda and Zimbabwe, show that localised perceptions of peace, safety
   and security are not only articulated in different ways to top-down
   narratives but also raise different issues.},

Abstract = {This article uses the community of practice framework conceived by Jean
   Lave and Etienne Wenger to demonstrate how museums form communities to
   support practices that aim to improve the human rights experiences of
   marginalized groups. The recent rise of a human rights museum practice
   provides rich examples of how communities of practice are formed around
   human rights. Museums are involved in legal practices at all moments in
   law's narrative arc, from the initiation of claims to ordering remedies.
   The framework describes how communities support learning difficult
   knowledge, and how new norms are established, strengthened and shared
   amongst particular groups.},

Abstract = {This study proposes a novel methodology for the study of the mindset,
   motives, and cognitive style of individual suicide bombers in
   Israel/Palestine, based on a comprehensive corpus of personal farewell
   letters (which also serve as last wills) that were written by suicide
   bombers to their family during the Second Intifada (2000-2006). To avoid
   privileging certain a priori sentiments, motivations, or concepts over
   others, I used a programmatic bottom-up sequence of quantitative
   psycholinguistic procedures, in which prominent themes or concepts from
   one level of analysis are further qualified and contextualized in the
   next. This afforded a minimally biased view of the cognitive content of
   Palestinian suicide bombers, including the sentiments, motivations, and
   concepts that they were more preoccupied with, and the context in which
   these ideas were expressed. The results are largely consistent with
   theories of political violence that place pro-social sentiments at the
   forefront of the motivations for suicide terrorism, and paramount to
   antisocial sentiments such as hatred and revenge. Since the linguistic
   patterns that were uncovered in this analysis cannot be controlled
   consciously, and the farewell letters of suicide bombers have rarely
   been rigorously analyzed linguistically, this study may provide an
   unprecedented glimpse into the cognitive style and content of individual
   suicide bombersa glimpse that is minimally biased by political,
   partisan, or sectarian preconceptions.},

Title = {The asset debates: How (not) to use asset indices to measure well-being

Abstract = {Asset indices are ubiquitous in the debate about well-being in African
   countries, not least because of the paucity of traditional household
   income and expenditure data. Indeed, asset data have fuelled the
   creation of a new, more optimistic picture of well-being in Africa,
   where both income and the middle class are growing fast. This is the
   first review of the use of asset indices for African countries. Readers
   are guided through key debates over the use of asset data, including the
   use of assets to measure trends over time as well as socio-economic
   status and class. We argue that the theoretical and empirical advantages
   of the asset index over traditional welfare measures are clear, but that
   caution is needed. Most asset indices show significant improvements in
   private wealth and social welfare in African countries due to increases
   in the number of household assets and improvements in health and
   education. However, we argue that simplistic conclusions in the
   economics literature about the growth of income or of a `middle class'
   using asset indices are poorly founded.},

Abstract = {The quality of laws on access to information can be explained by
   traditional static indicators as well as by dynamic variables such as
   the effects of time. The ``traces of time{''} affect the quality of
   these laws. The moment at which a law on access to information is
   adopted has an impact on its quality, due to the process of learning and
   dissemination it involves; and in countries undergoing a transition to
   democracy, with a history of lack of transparency, the enactment of such
   a law is seen as a step that can reverse the perception of secrecy.
   Explanations based on static indicators, such as levels of political
   rights and civil liberties, fail to allow understanding of the diversity
   of content of transparency laws, nor their capacity for compliance.},

Abstract = {Principal-agent (PA) has come a long way since it was introduced to the
   political science sphere. Nowadays, PA has established itself as an
   institutional midrange theoretical framework that encompasses various
   methodological as well as theoretical approaches. This article argues,
   however, that scholars still assume, a priori, that the agent is an
   opportunistic and disloyal actor. This article seeks to question this
   theoretical assumption by demonstrating how principals could be as much
   problematic as their agents, a phenomenon that it terms pathological
   delegation. In so doing, it offers a first analysis of the small strand
   of the literature that examines problems embedded in the principals'
   side as well as provides new empirical evidence in the context of the
   European Neighbourhood Policy. Finally, the article posits that scholars
   should not treat pathological delegation as an anomaly but rather
   attempt to integrate, test, and develop new theoretical assumptions on
   this phenomenon.},

Abstract = {Property tax in probably one of the most controversial taxes which were
   ever announced in Croatia's recent history. There was not a single tax
   or government measure which has occupied so much media and public
   discourse with the exception of the introduction of VAT. Most of the
   discussion regarding the new tax was focused on the actual fiscal impact
   of the new tax, how it will be calculated and what will be the overall
   fiscal impact. This paper however takes another approach and tries to
   determine the overall long term effects of the new tax in terms of the
   class separation and sociological impact this tax will have. Particular
   focus is paid on possible ghettoization of Croatia cities. The paper
   creates a model which investigates how the new tax affects the
   households long term consumption plans. If the households cannot adjust
   its consumption due to the new taxation it is forced to sell its
   property and move into lower value neighborhood. Over time this process
   leads to a large reclassification and regrouping of the households
   depending on their income. The paper also investigates how the
   introduction of the new tax will affect the educational system. Our
   model shows the new tax will have an adverse effect on the educational
   system and quality of education in Croatia.},

Abstract = {One of the most neglected aspects of the national question discourse in
   Nigeria is on the role of land as a site and source of conflicts,
   especially given the increasing demand for its redistribution and reform
   in the periods before and after the implementation of the structural
   adjustment programme. This study discusses land as a crucial aspect of
   the national question discourse in Nigeria. It examines the question of
   how colonialism - through its policies and programmes as well as the
   administrative structures and political systems put in place by the
   colonial state - introduced new complications and dimensions to the land
   question, mainly through the creation and development of contradictions
   in colonial and postcolonial Nigeria. Drawing on data generated from
   focus group discussions and oral interviews carried out across the
   locations with pronounced incidences of land-based conflicts in the six
   states across South-Western Nigeria, it examines the impact of economic
   considerations in the ethnically motivated conflicts in Nigeria over
   land from 1999 to 2015. It establishes the contradictions and injustices
   characterising the articulation of the citizenship question vis-a-vis
   various ethnic majorities and minorities as well as historically
   dominant minorities, especially indigenes and settlers in Nigerian
   history and politics; and how these generate violent ethnic protests,
   struggles and other divisive consequences. Tapping into ethnicity,
   migration and other issues underlying intergroup polarisation, it
   discusses the conflicts between Hausa-Fulani pastoralists and indigenous
   Yoruba farmers in South-Western Nigeria as an illustration of the
   contradictions underpinning citizenship and the prevailing frameworks of
   land ownership in Africa.},

Abstract = {In the large and growing literature on hydropolitics, insecurity
   generated through water-related conflicts is most often conceptualized
   under a model of economic resource scarcity. Conflict is generally
   reduced to the question of who has water, who needs water and thus what
   cost, in economic, political or military terms, is appropriate to
   acquiring access to water. This article argues that while such analyses
   effectively chart the central resource-strategic relations involved in
   the geopolitics of water, they nonetheless disregard the deeper
   biological and cultural (that is social, ethnic, religious) significance
   of water in any water conflict. Such analyses, it claims, are too
   strongly linked to the traditional (as opposed to human) security
   discourse and therefore run the risk of misdiagnosing the complexity of
   the water resource challenge. To respond to this challenge the article
   will develop a human security metrics' for analysing water-based
   conflicts in human security terms. It will then compare an analysis of
   the Indus Waters Treaty based upon the human security approach with an
   analysis based on a traditional' security assessment of the treaty in
   order to assess the viability of the two approaches. Finally, the
   article will link the comparative assessments back to the water wars
   literature, drawing conclusions about its strengths and weaknesses and
   the possibility of a synthesis of traditional and human security in the
   analysis of water conflict.},

Abstract = {We conduct a survey experiment to examine the effects of international
   compromise, war, and foreign government rhetoric on presidential
   approval. We find that, in certain conflicts, popular approval tracks
   fairness heuristics-leaders seeking to maximize voter approval prefer
   equitable divisions of disputed goods and are risk acceptant for
   divisions below this threshold. Moreover, aggressive rhetoric by a
   foreign leader increases domestic leaders' expected approval from war,
   decreases the value of compromise, and provides them with powerful
   incentives to fight harder. Thus, leaders motivated by popular approval
   have preferences that are inconsistent with the non-satiated,
   risk-averse preferences defined over shares of an objective good-that
   is, with those that much of the rationalist literature on conflict
   assumes. Fairness heuristics and the rhetorical framing of disputes
   during the conflict process may be at least as important as material
   factors in understanding why some disputes result in war.},

Abstract = {Recent U.S. military engagements in the Middle East have drawn public
   attention to the thorny issue of religion in the armed forces but the
   scholarship on religion in the military lags far behind these
   developments. Scholars have not developed a coherent research program
   around the challenges that religion faces in the armed forces or the
   religious issues that soldiers, commanders and military institutions
   grapple with on a daily basis. This papers seeks to initiate a scholarly
   conversations about the roles and effects of religion in the armed
   forces. I propose exploratory hypotheses that touch on some key themes
   that such a research program might cover, at three levels of analysis.
   At the institutional level, scholars should interrogate the relationship
   between religious norms and constitutional challenges in society and in
   the military. At the unit level, research should explore the impact that
   chaplains and group rituals have on unit morale. At the individual
   level, this research program should initiate a comprehensive
   investigation of the effects of individual religious practices on the
   mental health of soldiers and, in turn, the impact that participation in
   combat has on soldiers' religiosity. These illustrative hypotheses are
   far from exhaustive and should be regarded as invitations for future
   exploration.},

Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {465-491},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article seeks to examine the foreign policy behaviour of weak
   states in regions marked by politically turbulent geostrategic
   environments. An analysis of Afghanistan's foreign policy behaviour
   vis-a-vis Pakistan and India lends focus to this aim. India-Pakistan
   rivalry has gained traction as a key factor in determining Afghanistan's
   stability in the wake of the drawdown of Coalition forces. Missing from
   this debate, however, is consideration of Afghanistan's agency as a weak
   state with an independent set of policy preferences. Based on primary
   interviews with a diverse set of Afghan political actors the article
   outlines two competing policy advocacies: Pakistan friendly and Pakistan
   averse. The article argues that these advocacies are key to
   understanding Afghanistan's India-Pakistan dilemma. Departing from the
   ethnic lens used to explain Afghan politics and its regional linkages,
   this article shows that Kabul's relations with Islamabad determine its
   approach towards New Delhi regardless of ethnic rivalries. Understanding
   domestic Afghan narratives in this regional context is therefore
   imperative to adequately assess South Asia's prospective security
   calculus.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {64},
Number = {2},
Pages = {335-350},

Abstract = {Jurgen Habermas argues that Adam Smith believed that men used a
   calculative form of reason in the economic realm. Yet it was not
   calculative reason, but a variety of forms of prudence that animated
   Smith's economic system. The individual exercise of prudence motivated
   mankind to labor, the collective exercise of prudence, expressed as
   supply and demand, disciplined mankind to labor where the disposition
   was lacking, and the combination of the individual and collective
   exercise of prudence allowed Smith's economic system to establish the
   norm of a just price. The pervasive importance of prudence in Smithian
   thought implies that the economy of the public sphere should be aligned
   with a latter-day form of traditional prudence rather than with
   systematized and calculative rationality. This re-conception implies
   that Habermas' democratic theory should be revised to consider
   free-market economic activity - and especially the process of price
   formation - one of those autonomous activities that comprise civil
   society, connect the lifeworld to democracy and require the protection
   of the democratic polity.},

Abstract = {To be able to decide and act quickly and efficiently in a complex world,
   individuals rely on mechanisms that reduce information in a meaningful
   way. Instead of holding a set of partially contradicting cognitions,
   individuals construct coherent interpretations or stories to make sense
   of the available information using interactive activation. Interactive
   activation describes cognitive processing as bidirectional propagation
   of activation among simple processing units, which allows individuals to
   integrate large amounts of information quickly and with little cognitive
   effort. However, interactive activation also has important downsides
   that can prevent individuals from detecting looming disasters and can
   even contribute to their emergence. I describe the functioning of
   interactive activation and how it can be modeled using connectionist
   networks. Later I explain how interactive activation causes a set of
   biases (e.g. coherence effects, overconfidence, hindsight bias and
   status-quo bias) that make it hard to detect looming disasters and how
   these biases lead to discontinuities in understanding of problems and
   rapid behavioral switches that can contribute to the emergence of
   disasters.},

Abstract = {Human activity is dramatically shaping all of Earth's natural systems,
   producing unprecedented challenges for people and nature. Climate
   disruption, altered hydrology, and ecosystem degradation reflect both
   threats to human wellbeing and changes in the rules of the game' that
   make management difficult. While ecologists, conservationists and
   environmental scientists clamor for radical action to reverse these
   threats, their own management actions in response to climate are too
   often business as usual. I hypothesize that restrictive and often
   unspoken mental models of ecological and environmental science are
   robbing these managers and their institutions of the flexibility
   required to respond to the Anthropocene's uncertain changes. The three
   most profound mental traps are: (1) an undue emphasis on historical
   reference points; (2) an ecological concept of resilience that fails to
   reckon with the Anthropocene's dynamism; and (3) a precautionary bias
   against new technologies and dramatic interventions. Caught in these
   mental traps, environmentalists too often reject entrepreneurial
   experimental approaches that could make them more relevant to
   policymakers, corporations and other institutions that seek to respond
   more proactively to impending disruption.},

Abstract = {Can literature and the arts in general help to prevent catastrophes? In
   the article this question is entertained through examination of the
   contrast between ancient cultural productions (comprising those legends
   and sermons which constitute literature' in the larger sense) and
   contemporary fiction. The article shows, first of all, how ancient
   culture not only engaged in forward-looking thought when it came to
   catastrophes through the attribution of responsibility and by
   recommending moral reform but also by constituting a memory of
   catastrophes and in making practical suggestions. Our contemporary world
   has been swamped with fictional treatments of catastrophes - treatments
   that might seem to have the power of heralding these catastrophes and
   certainly of nurturing an obsessive fear of them. But contemporary
   fiction (literary or filmic) principally expresses a consciousness of
   its own impotence; if literature can prepare people for catastrophes, it
   can only be along ethical lines.},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine how European authorities have responded to
   reported threats to aviation resulting from individual terrorist
   tactics. We do so by applying the notion of political resilience and
   drawing on Palonen's policy, polity, politicking, and politicization
   model as well as on Malcolm Anderson's concept of politics of the latest
   outrage. We argue that the European Union response to aviation terrorism
   has created polity transformation and generated a long list of new
   policies but has also in the process become politicized and subject of
   politicking, with some high-profile measures being criticized for having
   a deleterious impact on passengers' rights.},

Abstract = {This article argues that systemic resilience in the face of terrorism is
   best conceptualized as a response to disruption of the political sphere,
   brought about by the forceful incursion of a would-be political actor.
   The ideological negotiation required to deal with political disruption
   is related to the cycle of contention model: engagement may take
   inclusive or exclusive forms, with consequences for the openness and
   hence the future resilience of the system. When the arguments used to
   support the British government's Prevent counterradicalization
   initiative are analyzed in these terms, the engagement is shown to be
   emphatically exclusive.},

Abstract = {The present study extends previous research on the influence of social
   dominance orientation (SDO) in international affairs by investigating
   the role of sociocognitive processes such as social identity complexity
   (SIC) and intergroup dehumanization in explaining the relationship
   between SDO and support for Arabs' autonomy. An Italian heterogeneous
   sample (N = 123), in terms of gender, age, political orientation,
   religiosity, and income level, was considered. We expected that those
   low on SDO would be more likely to support Arabs' autonomy, would have
   higher SIC, and would be less likely to dehumanize Arabs. We also
   expected that SIC and dehumanization would sequentially mediate the
   relationship between SDO and support for Arabs' autonomy. Results
   revealed that Italians low on SDO have higher SIC (i.e., a more
   inclusive social identity) which endorses lower dehumanization of Arabs.
   This in turn explained the influence of SDO on support for Arabs'
   autonomy. These findings integrate the literature about SDO and SIC and
   enhance the understanding of the sociocognitive processes underlying
   people's support for international egalitarian movements.},

   conflicts, we uncover how their discourse reveals conceptions of lacking
   agency and powerlessness during the conflict, how it reconstructs power
   relationships within and between ethnic groups, and how it reflects
   identity management strategies destined to elude blame and
   responsibility. Our findings demonstrate how discourses are tainted by
   the legitimizing framework in which the conflict unfolded but also how
   they are shaped by the particular context of the communicative
   situation. Findings are discussed in terms of their significance for
   international criminal justice and its stated objectives.},

Abstract = {The institutions of global governance have changed dramatically in
   recent years. New organizational forms-including informal institutions,
   transgovernmental networks, and private transnational regulatory
   organizations (PTROs)-have expanded rapidly, while the growth of formal
   intergovernmental organizations has slowed. Organizational ecology
   provides an insightful framework for understanding these changing
   patterns of growth. Organizational ecology is primarily a structural
   theory, emphasizing the influence of institutional environments,
   especially their organizational density and resource availability, on
   organizational behavior and viability. To demonstrate the explanatory
   value of organizational ecology, we analyze the proliferation of PTROs
   compared with the relative stasis of intergovernmental organizations
   (IGOs). Continued growth of IGOs is constrained by crowding in their
   dense institutional environment, but PTROs benefit from organizational
   flexibility and low entry costs, which allow them to enter ``niches{''}
   with limited resource competition. We probe the plausibility of our
   analysis by examining contemporary climate governance.},

Title = {Not as Bad as We Feared or Even Worse Than We Imagined? Assessing and

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {64},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Although often treated as such, political parties are not unitary
   actors. Presumably, therefore, their leaders have to take at least some
   account of the views of their followers - not least when deciding
   whether or not to enter a coalition with other parties. Hitherto there
   has been relatively little research into those views. This article uses
   a survey of members of the UK's Conservative Party in order to elicit
   and explain their thinking on the coalition the party formed with the
   Liberal Democrats in 2010, on the performance of the government since
   then, and on the prospects of a similar arrangement after the next
   general election. It finds that, although they largely approve of the
   government's record, grassroots Tories regret the decision to go into
   coalition in the first place. However, they would sanction a
   continuation of the arrangement as the price of hanging on to power
   after the next election. Different members, of course, have different
   views, and these are best explained by ideological rather than
   demographic variables, as well as by members' views on their party
   leader and - at least in part - their levels of activism.},

Abstract = {What drives autocrats to default on their sovereign debt? This article
   develops the first theory of sovereign debt default in autocracies that
   explicitly investigates survival incentives of political actors in
   nondemocracies. Self-interested elites, fearful of threats to their
   tenure because of urban unrest, may be willing to endure the long-term
   borrowing costs that defaulting creates rather than risk the short-term
   survival costs of removing cheap food policies for urban consumers. I
   test my main claims that both urbanization and food imports should be
   associated with greater likelihood of autocratic default using panel
   data covering forty-three countries over fifty years, finding that
   autocracies that are more reliant on imported food and that are more
   urbanized are significantly more likely to be in default on their
   external sovereign debt. I emphasize the regime-contingent nature of
   these effects by demonstrating that they are reversed when considering
   democratic sovereign default. I also substantiate the mechanisms put
   forward in my theory through illustrative historical cases of sovereign
   debt default in Zambia and Peru, in which I demonstrate that fear of
   urban unrest in the face of rapidly increasing food prices did indeed
   drive autocratic elites to default on international debt obligations. In
   addition to providing the first political theory of debt default in
   autocracies, the article introduces two robust predictors of autocratic
   default that have been overlooked in previous work, and highlights the
   importance of urban-rural dynamics in nondemocratic regimes.},

Abstract = {Recent interest in Global international relations (IR) theory has
   prompted efforts to give voice to non-Western approaches to
   international politics, accentuating how cultures and their specific
   local problems contribute to distinct scholarly practices, and how this
   in turn challenges the hegemony of taken-for-granted,
   ``universalized{''} Anglo-American IR theory. Encouraged by the
   overtures of Western academics, Chinese scholars have begun to
   articulate the role of ``traditional{''} mindsets in Chinese thinking
   about world politics, proposing avenues toward the development of an IR
   theory ``with Chinese characteristics.{''} Although these efforts are a
   laudable attempt to break through ethnocentrism, broaden the relevance
   of IR theory, and legitimate non-Western knowledge, we argue that the
   fact that gender seems to be entirely absent from the China-centered
   portion of this collaborative ``West/non-West{''} project results in a
   partial and problematic approach: It fails to engage Chinese feminist
   theorizing by relying upon unexamined gendered concepts. This article
   uses the results of a series of interviews with mainland scholars to
   spotlight the challenges faced by existing Chinese IR feminists whose
   work is overlooked in mainstream Chinese IR's holistic, Confucian
   approach to international society. We suggest ways gender sensitivity
   might inform debates about ``Chinese IR{''} and how to improve Western
   efforts to engage non-Western IR more broadly.},

Abstract = {Ideology and political parties are frequently depicted as disparate
   entities, with scholars citing a range of exogenous and endogenous
   changes to demonstrate the decreasing relevance of ideology to party
   politics. This article moves away from such accounts by looking at the
   role of actors, and specifically party leaders, in contributing to
   perceptions of ideological decline. Through an examination of the
   rhetoric of Labour and Conservative Party leaders in Britain between
   1946 and 1997, this article contends that politicians have engaged in,
   what is termed here, ideological quietism'. In this sense, parties have
   not abandoned ideology but have made rhetorical shifts indicative of
   ideological decline.},

Abstract = {The democratic transition and constitutional reforms in Brazil raised
   hopes that critical environmental challenges and egregious social
   deficits could finally be remedied through law, but political and legal
   legacies, fragmentation among actors, and disarticulation between and
   within institutions and between the state and citizens have complicated
   this transformation. Examination of the emerging role of the courts and
   the law in promoting social rights and environmental protection in the
   water and sanitation sectors in SAo Paulo reveals how long-standing
   urban problems are reified or altered through legal means. It also shows
   that ongoing challenges have prompted a search for new, proactive
   strategies of coordination, tested old assumptions about state/society
   relationships, and provoked broader conversations about difficult
   socioeconomic and political questions at the heart of creating
   sustainable, just societies. A transicAo para a democracia, e as
   reformas constitucionais, no Brasil crearam a esperanca de que puder-se
   corrigir os desafios do meio-ambiente e as deficiencias sociais dos mais
   flagrantes por meio da lei. Infelizmente essa transformacAo se complicou
   pelas herancas politicas e legais, pelas divisoes entre os atores, e a
   desarticulacAo entre as instituicoes e dentro delas, e o afastamento
   entre o Estado e os seus cidadAos. Um exame do papel emergente dos
   tribunais e da lei na promocAo dos direitos sociais e em proteger o
   meio-ambiente nos setores do abastamento de agua e do saneamento na
   Grande SAo Paulo mosta como se mudam ou se reificam os problemas urbanos
   de larga duracAo pelo meio do sistema legal. Revela tambem como os
   desafios consistentes estimularam a procura de novas estrategias
   proativas de coordinacAo, poem a prova as velhas assumcoes sobre a
   relacoes entre o Estado e a sociedade, e provocaram conversacoes mais
   amplas sobre essas questoes socio-economicas e politicas que jazem no
   coracAo do esforco de crear as sociedades sustentaveis e justas.},

Abstract = {Much research suggests that employee goal commitment is predictive of
   work behaviour and performance. However, public administration research
   has yet to establish the linkage between goal commitment and task
   performance in the context of public service employees. Using survey
   data on school teachers with administrative data on students, this
   article employs within-student between-teachers fixed effects and shows
   how teachers' goal commitment affects their task performance. Moreover,
   the article shows how task difficulty moderates this relationship. The
   findings suggest that higher goal commitment promotes teacher task
   performance, in particular, at moderate to high levels of task
   difficulty.},

Abstract = {What drives leaders' decisions about whether to continue or end an
   ongoing war? The private information explanation for war holds that
   leaders fight because they believe that doing so will advance national
   interests, and they settle hostilities when new information reduces
   their optimism about the possibility of long-term success. Yet
   significant theoretical disagreement exists about both the extent to
   which and the manner in which new information, especially battlefield
   information, promotes settlement. This article unpacks the logic of the
   informational mechanism, arguing that settlement will be more likely
   when there has been more extensive fighting and that countries are more
   likely to make concessions to end wars when battlefield results have
   deteriorated; short-term spikes in war intensity by contrast do not
   promote settlement. Moreover, building on work on leadership turnover
   and settlement, I show that leader replacement is sometimes part of the
   information-updating process, especially in autocracies: new leaders
   without political ties to the person in power at the start of the war
   are more likely both to come to power when war is going poorly and to
   end wars once in office. Tests of these arguments make use of new
   participant-level data on the timing of battle deaths for all Correlates
   of War interstate wars, which allows me to examine the effects of
   changing battlefield developments across a wide range of cases in a
   manner that was previously impossible.},

Abstract = {Recently there has been a revival of interest in debates about the
   British political tradition. In part, this is a reflection of the
   `ideational turn' in Anglophone comparative politics. However, this
   ideational turn immediately raises two of the most important
   meta-theoretical debates in social science; the relationships between
   institutions and ideas and the material and the ideational. In our view,
   anyone who suggests that political traditions shape political outcomes
   has to take a position on these debates, although they are rarely
   addressed. This article seeks to address that omission. We argue that,
   while the predominant ideas about democracy and political practice in
   the UK, what we term the British Political Tradition, do affect the
   institutions and processes of government, these ideas exist in a
   dialectical relationship with those institutions and, more broadly, with
   the material context within which the tradition, and indeed the
   institutions, operate(s).},

Abstract = {Each terrorist organization faces a critical tradeoff between
   effectively managing the organization's violent behavior while remaining
   secure from counterterrorism efforts. Drawing on organization theory and
   terrorism literature, this article develops theoretical linkages between
   the organizational design of a terrorist group and this critical
   tradeoff. It considers the impact of four key design parameters:
   membership, operational space and time, formalization, and
   centralization. The first two structural parameters construct the
   physical anatomy of a terrorist organization. The latter two structuring
   parameters prescribe or restrict the behavior within this organizational
   context. Net advantages by means of rising structural design parameter
   values are increasingly offset by the organizational strength and
   security vulnerabilities that inherently follow from the rising
   structuring parameters.},

Abstract = {The role of the media in public accountability has often been discussed.
   This is especially the case for public sector organisations, whose
   accountability relations have changed in the shift from government to
   governance. In this paper, we develop a typology of the ways mass media
   are involved in public accountability processes. Media can stimulate
   actors to reflect on their behaviour, trigger formal accountability by
   reporting on the behaviour of actors, amplify formal accountability as
   they report on it or act as an independent and informal accountability
   forum. To explore the presence of these roles in practice, we focus on
   public sector organisations in the Netherlands. Our quantitative and
   qualitative analysis in the Netherlands suggests that the media
   primarily serve an indirect role in public accountability, either by
   invoking pre-emptive self-criticism in public organisations in
   anticipation of potential media scrutiny or by triggering formal
   accountability demands from MPs},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},

Volume = {25},

Pages = {613-632},
Abstract = {The recent rise of resilience thinking in climate security discourse and
   practice is examined and explained. Using the paradigmatic case of the
   United Kingdom, practitioners' understandings of resilience are
   considered to show how these actors use a resilience lens to
   rearticulate earlier storylines of climate conflict in terms of
   complexity, decentralisation, and empowerment. Practitioners in the
   climate security field tend to reinterpret resilience in line with their
   established routines. As a result, climate resilience storylines and
   practices turn out to be much more diverse and messy than is suggested
   in the conceptual literature. Building on these findings, the recent
   success of resilience thinking in climate security discourse is
   explained. Climate resilience - not despite but due to its messiness -
   is able to bring together a wide range of actors, traditionally standing
   at opposite ends of the climate security debate. Through resilience
   storylines, climate security discourse becomes something to which a wide
   range of actors, ranging from security to the development field, can
   relate.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the roles and impacts of public involvement in
   public- private partnerships (PPPs). Our findings contribute to the
   literature on public-private collaborations by demonstrating the ways
   that the facilitation of deliberative activities can provide
   administrative benefits to PPPs. The results suggest that although
   public involvement can improve support from citizens and political
   leaders for PPPs and improve the tailoring of project designs to local
   conditions, the processes have little effect on expediting project
   delivery or in addressing power imbalances between public and private
   sectors. We also find that a combination of in-person approaches and
   virtual approaches to public involvement can improve the achievement of
   performance standards in PPPs.},

Abstract = {This Handbook links together four social science research
   programmes-peace studies, security studies, development studies and
   environmental studies-which have had only limited exchanges on
   sustainable development, human security and sustainable peace. The
   Handbook connects these three concepts within the research paradigm of
   `sustainability transition'. This research paradigm focuses on a
   large-scale and long-term transformative change of the dominant
   carbon-intensive development path by addressing the causes of global
   environmental and climate change. There has been an exponential increase
   in GHG emissions since the 1950s and a rapid destruction of biodiversity
   and ecosystem services. These texts can be used in graduate seminars in
   different scientific disciplines and research programmes and in new
   transdisciplinary degree programmes. The texts foster longer-term
   proactive strategies and policies and specific measures to realize two
   policy goals, `sustainable development' alongside and contributing to a
   `sustainable peace', as the possible result of a large-scale transition
   of the systems of production, consumption, and governance.
   Among the key questions in this Handbook are a) whether
   business-as-usual policies and the growing number of climate-induced
   natural hazards that threaten the survival of millions of people pose
   threats to international peace and security; b) whether anticipative
   learning and a forward-looking discourse on long-term transformative
   changes may contribute to sustainable development and address new
   dangers to international peace and security in a preventive manner; and
   c) what lessons may be drawn from the violent consequences of the
   industrial revolution and used to promote a long-term transformative
   change towards sustainable development with sustainable peace.
   This chapter consists of eight parts. After a brief sketch of opposing
   scientific and political visions (1.1.), the purpose and objectives of
   the Handbook are highlighted (1.2.) and a survey (1.3) reviews the
   challenges posed by global environmental change: population growth, the
   impacts of climate change, loss of biodiversity, soil erosion and
   desertification, water scarcity and stress, food scarcity and hunger,
   and gender implications. It addresses the impacts of different economic
   development paths (1.4), through integrating the results of global
   research programmes, of their linkages and their assessment by the IPCC,
   and through the nexus debates between the fields of water, food and
   energy security (1.5). The three key concepts of sustainable
   development, sustainability transition and sustainable peace are
   introduced (1.6), the evolution of different approaches to
   sustainability transition is reviewed, the debates on ecosystem
   restoration, green growth and decarbonization are noted, and six
   dimensions of the research on `sustainability transition' are outlined
   (1.7). The last section introduces the ten parts of this Handbook and
   offers an overview of its 40 peer-reviewed contributions (1.8).},

Abstract = {Japan's economic and political relationship with South Africa has been
   characterised historically by ambiguity. Throughout the twentieth
   century, economic ties were underpinned by mercantilist and strategic
   considerations. During apartheid, this placed Japan in an uneasy
   position as it sought to balance a relationship of expediency with wider
   foreign policy objectives in the rest of Africa and beyond. The demise
   of apartheid created the space for new forms of engagement centred on
   the pursuit of cognate goals. This has seen the intensification and
   deepening of economic ties in particular. Yet relations, especially at
   the political and diplomatic levels, have also been more complex than
   anticipated, and in recent years, the rise in Africa of other players
   from Asia and the Global South has had a bearing on South Africa-Japan
   ties. In this paper, it is argued that two related dynamics pivoting on
   policy elites' changing conceptions (or self-view) of the nature of the
   state they are running and its place in the wider world order help
   explain the post-apartheid evolution of the South Africa-Japan
   relationship. First, there has been an apparent shift in South African
   foreign policy elites' self-view, mediated by a changing systemic
   context. The development and manifestation over time of a stronger
   Global South self-conception in South African foreign policy, fashioned
   in juxtaposition to what have been considered in the past key Global
   North relationships, had direct consequences for South Africa-Japan
   ties. Second, meso-and microlevel dynamics - the role of the general
   operations in the diplomatic (i.e. bureaucratic) arena, and the
   personalities and shifting political preferences of individual executive
   leaders - had major impacts on how South Africa engaged with Japan in
   the past two decades.},

Abstract = {This research focuses on the impact of public procurement for innovation
   (PPI) on a country's level of innovativeness. The available literature
   primarily consists of case studies that identify PPI's impact on the
   innovativeness of particular firms. Therefore, this paper developed an
   econometric model to investigate the impact of PPI on the innovativeness
   of EU countries. The model tested the impact of four different
   innovation policy measures (PPI, R\&D subsidies, regulations and
   cooperation). The results showed that in different model settings, PPI
   was positively and significantly related to countries' innovativeness,
   whereas the other three measures showed low significance. These research
   fmdings may be important to policy makers when selecting appropriate
   measures for promoting innovation and thereby also enhancing their
   country's competitiveness},

   conflict resolution},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {297-313},
Abstract = {This article applies the concepts of linkage and leverage as developed
   by Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way and elaborated by Gwendolyn Sasse in
   the introduction to this special issue of East European Politics to
   Russia's involvement with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the two
   quasi-independent states in the South Caucasus. Through this
   re-conceptualisation of the developments in Abkhazia and South Ossetia,
   combined with new empirical insights, the article aims to increase our
   understanding of the conflicts in the region, of the involvement of the
   Russian Federation in particular, and consequently of the prospects of
   international conflict resolution. Compared to other political entities
   in the former Soviet Union, Abkhazia and South Ossetia represent an
   extreme case of Russian linkage and leverage. This article focuses on
   the period after the Russian-Georgian war in 2008, when Russia
   recognised the regions' independence and effectively turned them into
   Russian protectorates. The economic, intergovernmental, technocratic and
   social linkages between Russia and the two regions are extraordinarily
   deep, and they directly undermine the autonomy of the regions. The
   post-war delegation of Russian cadres and institutional and legislative
   diffusion creates additional linkages underpinning Russian leverage.},

Abstract = {Over the past two decades, South Africa has sought to perform several
   roles on the world stage, such as the economic dynamo of Southern
   Africa, a diplomatic heavyweight representing the African continent, and
   a norm leader on the world stage as a so-called `middle-power'. Although
   South Africa's evolution and rise as an important player in global
   affairs has generated a welcome body of critical scholarly literature,
   comparatively little analysis has been allocated to understanding how
   norm dynamics and the country's ever-evolving international identities
   have enabled it to construct and reconstruct its `interests'. Social
   constructivism is best suited for such an analysis because it can
   operationalise norms, commitments, identities, and interests, and it
   provides the epistemological tools to map the increasingly multilateral
   connections between global, regional, and domestic forums. By employing
   a rationalist approach to constructivism, this paper remedies the
   aforementioned gap in the literature by illustrating how South Africa
   constructs and reconstructs its identities and interests in relation to
   membership in international organisations (IOs). To that end, the paper
   examines the evolution of South Africa's participation in the African
   Union (especially `peacekeeping' contributions) and the International
   Criminal Court. The paper concludes by assessing the theoretical
   implications and practical ramifications of the norm dynamics involved
   in South Africa's commitment to these two IOs.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the counterintuitive emergence of
   self-regulation in the Russian construction sector. Despite its
   proclivity for centralizing political authority, the government acted as
   the catalyst for the delegation of regulatory powers to private industry
   groups. The article argues that a factor little considered in extant
   literaturenamely, a weak and corrupt bureaucracyis key to explaining why
   the normally control-oriented executive branch began to promote private
   governance despite industry's preference for continued state regulation.
   The article's signal contribution is to theoretically explain and
   empirically demonstrate how a government's prior inability to establish
   intrastate control over an ineffective and bribable public bureaucracy
   creates incentives for political authorities to search for alternative
   means for policy implementation outside of existing state agencies.
   These findings are important for understanding the impetus and logic
   behind particular regulatory shifts in countries where the state
   apparatus is both deficient and corrupt.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) presents a unique
   opportunity to assess global public goods theory and the inner dynamics
   of global public private partnerships (PPPs) for health. Drawing on
   interviews with officials in the GPEI, this study evaluates the global
   public goods (GPG) concept as it relates to polio eradication. The
   findings from this analysis emphasise the connection between polio
   eradication, crucial cases, and levels of public goods distribution.
   Collectively, these findings suggest an added dimension to the ongoing
   and contested conversation regarding the GPG concept and GPG theory.
   These findings also confirm certain public goods criticisms as they
   relate to the rational choice leanings of public goods theory. In
   addition, while much has been written about the nature and purpose of
   global PPPs, such research remains abstract and intangible. This
   ambiguousness has contributed to an inadequate understanding of the
   inner dynamics of global PPPs. Thus, this study highlights the strengths
   and weaknesses of the GPEI and provides the reader with a deep
   understanding of what makes this partnership work and what hurdles it
   has overcome since its inception. The relative success of the GPEI makes
   it a PPP that future health collaborations may choose to emulate.},

Abstract = {Academic studies of terrorism and mass political violence have developed
   largely independently of one another. Insurgents, in contrast, have
   tended to incorporate terrorism tactics along with other types of
   unconventional warfare in their repertoire of action. This tendency has
   become more apparent among insurgents engaging in armed confrontations
   in the twenty-first century. In order to take account of this
   development, scholars and others interested in contemporary warfare need
   to incorporate terrorism studies within the broader subject of
   insurgencies and small warspolitical violence, in other words.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {365-379},
Abstract = {Numerous important concepts we use in policy studies lack material
   being, including collective will, altruism, passion, experience, and
   social structure. Lack of materiality has not prevented social
   constructivists, especially feminists and phenomenologists, from making
   significant intellectual contributions using such concepts. But in this
   article I envisage that, after the linguistic turn, we could do better
   by now turning to context realism as informed by quantum theory. Having
   appreciated Ludwig Wittgenstein's linguistic, social-constructivist
   epistemology that brings attention to conventions and context, I turn to
   Alexander Wendt's attempt to make quantum theory relevant to the social
   sciences. I speculate that the quantum wave function accommodates
   subjective and collective consciousness as part of physical reality, and
   thus affords reality status to many concepts and dynamics that lack
   materiality but are nonetheless important in scholarly research.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},

Volume = {25},

Pages = {569-592},
Abstract = {Plans to replace an aging diesel backup energy plant with liquid natural
   gas (LNG) generators in Whitehorse, Yukon, resulted in a public outcry,
   involving community meetings, massive petitions, and demonstrations. Are
   these civil society protests just a case of a local siting dispute - a
   response to an unwanted industrial site in an urban neighborhood? Here,
   it is argued that siting debates are not the driver of these campaigns,
   but instead are harnessed by activists to advance a broader
   environmental movement. By linking the LNG project to more distant
   extraction, involving hydraulic fracturing ('fracking'), movement
   leaders portray the entire territory as part of the `local' for
   Whitehorse residents. Movement leaders rely upon two key mechanisms:
   claiming insider status, and identifying visible symbols. This case
   reveals the strategic use by environmental movements of local concerns
   to recruit support for broader campaigns, and the value of local,
   place-based activism for broader environmental movements.},

Title = {Party-directed personalisation: the role of candidate selection in
   campaign personalisation in Hungary},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Pages = {466-486},
Abstract = {This article aims to capture the effect of candidate selection on
   campaign personalisation during two Hungarian general elections (2010
   and 2014). Our main hypothesis is that candidates who think their
   selection was mostly influenced by the national party leadership (i.e.
   it was centralised and at the same time exclusive) pursue less
   personalised campaigns than those who think that other actors played a
   major role in candidate selection. By using data from the Comparative
   Candidates Survey, we show that centralised and exclusive selection
   practices affect personalisation in Hungary. The main finding of this
   article is that - besides its main effect - candidate selection affects
   the personalisation of various groups of candidates (local politicians
   and national party leaders) in different ways. The result confirms that
   centralisation and exclusiveness in candidate selection is definitely
   important in shaping how candidates approach campaign personalisation.},

   of Representatives of the Parliamentary Assembly had passed the Law on
   the State Anthem but the House of Peoples, the upper Chamber, refused to
   follow suit. The High Representative, using the authority conferred on

Abstract = {This article proposes Amazonia as a site to think world politics. The
   Amazon is invisible in the study International Relations (IR), yet its
   experiences are deeply global. I present the international dynamics at
   play in Amazonia at different historical moments to posit that this
   periphery has contributed to forging the political-economy of what is
   refer to as the core. The Amazon's absence from the study of IR speaks
   about the larger inequality in processes of knowledge production.
   Serious engagements with Amazonia are one way to invite a plurality of
   worlds in the production of theories, disrupting global divisions of
   labor in knowledge production ally.},

   EU politics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {38},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {633-642},
Abstract = {This article synthetises the contributions of the special issue along
   three major lines of reasoning. First, the European Council is
   considered as a catalyst of post-Maastricht integration. This is mainly
   due to its policy-making role in core new areas of European Union (EU)
   activity. Second, inter-institutional relations that have emerged
   between the European Council, the Council, the Commission and the
   European Parliament in the post-Maastricht era and in particular the
   post-Lisbon era are seen to reflect both the centrality of the European
   Council and a novel way of initiating and implementing EU policy.
   Finally, the political process within and around the European Council is
   considered that has taken place against the background of the most
   recent crises conditions. In particular, the simultaneous occurrence of
   consensus and domination is identified as a key element of further
   research related to the `new intergovernmentalism' and the
   `intergovernmental union'.},

Series = {Hexagon Series on Human and Environmental Security and Peace},

Abstract = {Sustainability Transitions require a knowledge production that
   contributes actively to the Grand Challenges of twenty-first-century
   societies. Scientific institutions play a key role in this domain in the
   transformation towards sustainability and peace. Against this background
   a Transformative Science is needed: a mode of science that not only
   analyses processes of transformation, but also actively supports and
   accelerates them. This chapter will introduce the concept of
   Transformative Science and its implications for (1) the methodologies of
   transdisciplinary and transformative research, (2) institutional
   capacity-building for facilitating such a research approach, and (3) the
   national science systems and national science policies that enable this
   new mode of knowledge production. The case of the German science system
   is introduced to describe an ongoing science system transition with
   special regard to the role of civil society organizations.},
