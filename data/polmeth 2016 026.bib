Abstract = {In 1956, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) launched Operation Harvest, an
   overtly ambitious guerrilla effort that was meant to secure the
   political unity of Ireland by force of arms. It was waged against the
   backdrop of a thaw in international relations and drew inspiration from
   successful anti-colonial guerrilla struggles in Algeria and Cyprus. The
   IRA was unaware of the simultaneous, parallel, unsuccessful irredentist
   efforts in Central and Eastern Europe in which anti-communist guerrillas
   clashed with totalitarian security apparatuses of the USSR or its
   satellite states. Studying the latter campaigns, which had begun earlier
   and were conducted by far larger and more effective guerrilla forces,
   might have convinced the organisation that such insurgencies in
   post-1945 Europe had very little hope of success. This article for the
   first time thematically contrasts the irredentist efforts of the IRA and
   the parallel Central and Eastern European guerrillas. It aims to bring
   to light cases that are hardly ever discussed in the Irish context but
   which could be of surprising use if one wishes to comparatively assess
   Ireland or the IRA.},

Abstract = {Fukuyama tried to expound political development in contemporary China
   and justify its universal effectiveness, with the interpretation mode of
   modern political order supported by the state, rule of law and
   accountability. It is appropriate to describe, analyze and conclude that
   current political development in China is under the circumstance of a
   powerful state, weak rule of law, and soft accountability. However,
   because of the absence of the premise of interpretation, it is doubted
   that Fukuyama's interpretation mode of modern political order, which is
   supported by three pillars, is universally effective. It remains
   unsolved that the standard of defining modern state is much vaguer
   rather than clearer, the course of China's development is more
   unpredictable rather than more explicit, and that the construction of
   modern political order is more evasive rather than more certain. In
   general, Fukuyama's interpretation of modern political order is
   restrained within its positive approach. Therefore, his task of
   implementing normative interpretation in order to justify modern
   political order remains unaccomplished.},

Abstract = {This chapter examines the drivers and barriers to innovation in the wind
   energy sectors in Brazil, India and South Africa. We analyse actors and
   institutions that have played a role in the development and diffusion of
   wind energy technologies in these countries from a technological
   innovation systems (TIS) perspective. We introduce innovation
   capabilities, the enabling environment and policy-independent strategies
   as the main drivers for the development of the TIS. This analysis will
   contribute to improving our understanding of drivers of and barriers to
   innovation relevant to successful transitions towards cleaner
   technologies and less carbon-intensive economies. We found that some
   countries are more successful in developing wind energy technologies
   because of three factors: stronger technological capability, prime
   movers, and big market size, and this relates to the enabling
   environment and policy incentives. We found that in India and Brazil,
   entrepreneurial activities independent of public policy were critical
   for the development of the local wind energy industry. In South Africa,
   policy-independent entrepreneurial activity was scarce and operated in
   an unfavourable environment which hampered the development of a local
   wind energy industry.},

Abstract = {Political budget cycles (PBCs), namely the manipulation of taxation or
   government spending close to elections, are an enduring topic in the
   study of economic policy-making. While the literature explains their
   occurrence based on information asymmetries between incumbents and
   voters, we argue that a source of variation in the extent of PBCs is,
   via the effect of clientelism, the level of economic development. In
   jurisdictions where voters have few economic opportunities outside those
   provided by the government, they will be highly dependent on the
   incumbents for their income. The latter can thus use clientelistic
   tools, such as their control over employment in the public sector, for
   electoral purposes. This argument is assessed with a study of health
   personnel spending in the Italian regions.},

Abstract = {Research initiatives to enhance knowledge-based societies demand
   regionally coordinated policy approaches. By analyzing the case of the
   European Commission, Directorate-General Research and Innovation, this
   study focuses on examining the cognitive mechanisms that form the
   foundation for institutional transformations and result in leadership
   positions in regional governance. Drawing on policy learning theories,
   the study emphasizes specific mechanisms of institutional change that
   are often less noticeable but can gradually lead to mobilizing diverse
   groups of stakeholders. Through historical and empirical data, this
   study shows the importance of policy learning through communication
   processes, Open Method of Coordination initiatives, and issue framing in
   creating a stronger foundation for policy coordination in European
   research policy since the 2000s.},

Pages = {571-585},
Abstract = {The post-Maastricht era is characterised by a growing importance of the
   European Council in the integration of various policy-fields. In this
   respect, EU energy policy is no exception. The fragmentation in three
   coexisting strands and external shocks has emphasised the need for
   intergovernmental coordination and oversight. This new
   intergovernmentalism, exemplified prominently by the recent move towards
   Energy Union, is surprising in two respects. On the one hand, energy is
   an area of diverse member state interests that repeatedly thwarted
   ambitious plans for deepening European integration. On the other hand,
   the European Council's new intergovernmentalism challenges the classical
   role of the European Commission in the field that was rooted in its
   single market competence. However, rather than implying a shift in the
   interinstitutional balance, developments of the past decade reveal
   increased cooperation between the two key institutions and flexible
   working mechanisms through which the Commission has retained substantial
   policy initiative capacities.},

Abstract = {Recent history clearly confirms John Rawls' claim that peoples'
   fundamental interest in self-respect makes them insist on `receiving
   from other peoples a proper respect and recognition of their equality'.
   Even before the US president Barack Obama promised numerous nations new
   relationships based `on mutual respect', many foreign leaders had
   already begun to insist on being `duly respected' by the United States
   and other (mostly Western) countries. What is unclear, however, is how
   far such moral claims actually extend, especially as far as peoples'
   trials during their history and ... their culture with its
   accomplishments' (Rawls) are concerned. When can peoples justifiably
   complain about `inadequate respect'? When does international morality,
   understood as practical reasoning in the Kantian tradition, command a
   change in foreign attitudes and behaviour? This article focuses on the
   range of universal norms that should regulate the allocation of esteem
   and attention in an increasingly integrated world. It shows that
   cultural diversity among peoples all but excludes substantive criteria
   for specifying `due respect', thus leaving mostly formal criteria, such
   as consistency and reciprocity, for identifying uncontroversial cases of
   disrespect.},

Abstract = {Selected provisions from Geneva Law that emphasise the humane treatment
   of detainees during an international armed conflict are reviewed. The
   legal vagaries of a non-international armed conflict (NIAC) are
   considered in the Iraq context following the judgement in Serdar
   Mohammed and Secretary of State for Defence that questioned the legal
   basis for detention in an NIAC. The factors and thresholds of prevalent
   alleged offences are analysed by reference to the International Criminal
   Court Elements of Crime and international jurisprudence. The incongruent
   or complementary status of international humanitarian law and
   international human rights law, including lex specialis, is considered
   by reference to international and European jurisprudence. The importance
   of the UN Torture Convention is highlighted and contextualised with
   regard to domestic legislation and government policy.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {64},
Number = {4},
Pages = {910-929},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Why is it that social movements engaged in contention sometimes
   experience radicalization of member factions? This article argues that
   relational practices of contacts, ties, exchange of information and
   bargaining among the contending parties mediate the influence of
   violence-prone ideologies as well as impulses, incentives and motives
   for aggression on actual engagement in political violence. A
   mechanism-based comparison of two similar yet different-in-outcome
   episodes of Jewish settler contention demonstrates the mediating role of
   relational mechanisms, the combined influence of which is conceptualized
   and operationalized as an Infrastructure of Coordination (IOC). Despite
   ample environmental stimuli and widespread violence-prone ideologies
   present in both episodes, in the Gaza Pullout radicalization was impeded
   through high levels of coordination established between and within the
   contending parties. Conversely, in the dismantling of the Amona outpost
   the disintegration of the IOC propelled radicalization. Supportive
   evidence is provided from a multi-method research design, including
   in-depth interviews, content analysis and contentionrepression data over
   a series of critical events.},

Abstract = {Why do members of some ethnic groups rebel against the state? One
   approach holds that groups subject to exclusion from national politics
   engage in armed conflict. We theorize that the presence of resource
   wealth moderates the effect of political exclusion. Ethnic groups
   subject to exclusion whose settlement area includes oil wealth are more
   likely to experience the onset of armed conflict than groups
   experiencing exclusion alone. We depart from the convention of
   cross-national analysis to examine subnational, geocoded units of
   analysisethnic group settlement areasto better capture the impact of
   natural resource distribution. Using data on ethnic group political
   exclusion derived from the Ethnic Power Relations database and geo-coded
   indicators, we conduct a series of logistic regression analyses for the
   years 1946 to 2005. We find that exclusion alone increase the likelihood
   of conflict, while the presence of oil wealth further raises the risk of
   war.},

Abstract = {Non-legally binding agreements provide an important tool for
   establishing international cooperation. We know little, however, about
   the variation in the implementation of such agreements. This article
   identifies a major cause of this variation: legal tradition. Nonbinding
   agreements, which may be adapted to local needs and circumstances, are
   consistent with the gradual, organic evolution of common law; by
   contrast, they are an uneasy fit with the civil-law tradition that
   neatly distinguishes between ``law{''} and ``nonlaw.{''} Consequently,
   common-law countries are more likely to implement nonbinding agreements
   than civil-law countries. Survival analysis of three nonbinding
   instruments-United Nations model laws aimed at harmonizing commercial
   legislation-finds strong support for this argument: common-law countries
   prove significantly more likely to implement these model laws.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the capacity of governments to implement fiscal
   reforms in times of austerity. Unlike existing studies, which mostly
   focus on gradual policy changes like government spending, this analysis
   distinguishes between consolidation events and consolidation size to
   examine fiscal reforms. This strategy clarifies contradictory results in
   previous research and yields new insights into the underlying mechanism
   of fiscal reform. Based on an action-based data set that includes
   information about discretionary changes in taxation and government
   spending policies from 1978 until 2009 for 16 advanced (OECD) countries,
   the study shows that left and right governments are equally likely to
   implement cuts. Strategic considerations play a major role for the
   timing of fiscal consolidation, as the probability of fiscal cuts is
   highest at the beginning of the legislative term. When governments
   reform, the left cut as much as necessary, whereas right governments
   take the opportunity to reduce spending more.},

Title = {The fiscal roots of urban bias},
Journal = {BUSINESS AND POLITICS},

Volume = {18},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Why do some countries indulge in urban bias, potentially harming
   economic development in the process, while others promote a vibrant
   agricultural sector? Two main explanations have been put forth. On the
   one hand, market failures, due to information asymmetries, mean that
   farmers who dearly require credit to succeed are shut out of lending
   markets, even if lenders could potentially benefit from making loans
   more readily available. On the other hand, political failures, due to
   state capture, mean that farmers will be subject to implicit taxes as a
   way of generating rents for politically powerful, industrial interests
   in the city. This paper builds on the latter view and corroborates
   {[}Bates, Robert. 1981. Markets and States in Tropical Africa. Berkeley,
   CA: University of California Press.] insight that the state might have
   its own fiscal reasons for indulging in urban bias since both infant
   industries in the manufacturing sector and monopsony endowing marketing
   boards in the agricultural sector potentially provide easy-to-collect
   revenues. I adduce cross-national empirical support for the fiscal roots
   view that is robust across measures of state capacity and instrumental
   variables. A case study of Mexico also provides supporting evidence.},

Abstract = {Mechanisms for controlling government organizations have attracted major
   interest from public administration researchers. Cultural theory has
   been used as a tool to identify the core control approaches of
   individual organizations. Whereas major existing studies have applied
   the theory based on the cultural types using nominal-level measures,
   this article builds a novel set of interval measures, focusing on two
   fundamental factors of government control proposed by cultural theory:
   grid-group dimensions. The measures are applied to assess suicide risk
   control systems in the English (HMPS) and Japanese prison services
   (JPS). The results highlight the fatalistic approach in HMPS and
   egalitarian approach in JPS, as well as demonstrating the structural
   characteristics of each risk control system beyond nominal lists of
   control tools.},

Abstract = {One central result of macro-quantitative studies in comparative public
   policy is that the importance of partisan politics on policy outputs has
   strongly decreased in recent decades. This finding may well be a
   methodological artefact. I argue that ad hoc standards in panel data
   analysis, especially using country-years as periodization, create
   estimation problems which potentially influence results against partisan
   variables. Therefore, I propose a simple and straightforward, as well as
   theoretically suitable, alternative to test the influence of partisan
   politics on policies and use cabinets instead of country-years. Using
   comparative welfare state research as an example, I show that partisan
   effects are strong and stable when using a cabinet-based periodization
   and fragile and weak within the standard procedure based on annual data.
   This article aims at suggesting that annual periods do not need to be
   the best simplification of time in empirical analyses.},

Abstract = {This article argues that gangs, clans, mafias and insurgencies are, like
   states, forms of governance. This insight is applied to the case of
   Somali piracy and the article explores whether protectors of piracy were
   clearly distinct from pirates; and to what extent protectors coordinated
   their activities across the Somali coastland. It is shown that clan
   elders and Islamist militias facilitated piracy by protecting hijacked
   ships in their anchorages and resolving conflicts within and between
   pirate groups. Protection arrangements operated across clans, as
   illustrated by the free movement of hijacked ships along the coastline
   and the absence of re-hijacking after ransoms were paid. Piracy
   protection can be thought of as part of a continuum of protection
   arrangements that goes from mafias to legitimate states. The article
   concludes by highlighting the implications of the findings for the
   debate on state-building and organised crime.},

Abstract = {The array of public affairs programs has been growing in the past 27
   years in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Traditionally,
   public administration programs concentrated primarily on legal and
   formal institutional aspects of governing, whereas public policy and
   management programs were entirely absent and remain relatively new. This
   article discusses the contents of the MPA/MPP programs in five CEE
   countries (the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia)
   in order to identify major features in terms of the disciplinary and
   methodological character of these programs. Our ultimate question is to
   assess whether these programs reveal a clear, relatively robust public
   administration ``identity,{''} and whether there is a convergence among
   programs in the region towards the so-called mainstream programs in the
   world. (C) 2016 Policy and Society Associates (APSS). Published by

Abstract = {The bayonet has long been regarded as an obsolete piece of military
   technology. This article advances a proxemic account of close combat,
   which points to its continuing utility under modern battlefield
   conditions. It is argued that bayonet training remains an effective way
   of preparing soldiers to psychologically dominate contested spaces on
   the battlefield. Thus, although other weapons and techniques can fulfil
   the same role, it can nevertheless be argued that the bayonet's enduring
   presence is not simply the result of some atavistic military mind-set.},

Abstract = {This response concentrates on two sets of issues raised by the
   contributors to the symposium: the first centers around theory, the
   second around history. On the former, our argument is that, contrary to
   some of the comments made by our interlocutors, the book contributes to
   theoretical debates ranging from issues of causation to those concerning
   history as a theoretical enterprise. We use these arguments to engage
   with, and extend, historical questions raised about the book, paying
   particular attention to the issue of comparisons across time. Our
   overarching reaction to the symposium is positive - the book has
   generated an exciting range of responses. This makes us hopeful that The
   Global Transformation will stimulate both intra- and inter-disciplinary
   conversations, even if these conversations sometimes emerge from
   frustration with paths not taken and issues not addressed.},

Abstract = {This article examines under what conditions descriptive representatives
   of national minorities can also act as substantive representatives. It
   provides an empirical analysis of the behaviour of the representatives
   with ethnic minority backgrounds in the eighth National Assembly of the
   Republic of Serbia. Specifically, the article builds upon a content
   analysis of all interventions in the plenary parliamentary debates of
   the thirty-one minority MPs in the period between June 2008 and March
   2012. The analysis suggests that having a minority ethnic background or
   political party registered as a political party of national minority are
   not sufficient conditions for substantive minority representation. The
   findings show that minority representatives elected on minority
   electoral lists engage more in substantive representation of minorities
   than descriptive representatives elected to parliament either as members
   of mainstream parties or through pre-electoral arrangements of minority
   parties with mainstream political parties.},

Title = {Hitting the target without missing the point: New Zealand's immunisation
   health target for two year olds},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {37},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {535-550},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The use of health targets as a form of performance measurement has
   become more prominent internationally as governments have sought to
   control public expenditure, produce greater efficiency and improve
   accountability. However, health targets have faced criticism for their
   potential to produce negative outcomes within a health system. This
   paper examines how a health target was used as a policy instrument
   within the New Zealand health system to improve immunisation coverage at
   two years of age. It explores how the immunisation health target was
   implemented within four case study sites and discusses the effectiveness
   of the health target as a policy instrument for improving immunisation
   coverage and addressing persistent immunisation inequities. Measuring
   and monitoring performance towards the immunisation health target
   improved accountability for immunisation coverage within the New Zealand
   health system and focused attention on improving immunisation coverage
   in a way that previous policy attempts had failed to do. Health targets
   may be an effective policy instrument for creating change within
   specific areas of a health system if their potential for dysfunctional
   consequences are taken into consideration at the outset.},

Volume = {26},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Many contemporary regulatory programs rely on third-party organizations
   to fulfill monitoring and enforcement functions. Third-party regulatory
   designs introduce complexity and potentially conflicting incentives that
   can impact program delivery. This article examines how regulatory
   program outputs are shaped by third-party administrators through an
   investigation of the organizations charged with administering US organic
   food regulations. Based on the notion that third-party arrangements draw
   attention to administrator organizational characteristics, the article
   asks: To what extent does sector (public, nonprofit, for-profit) affect
   third-party administrators' regulatory approaches in the administration
   of uniform regulatory standards? A secondary analysis explores an
   economic facet of dimensional publicness among nonprofit third-party
   administrators. The study draws on regulatee survey data and uses
   multilevel analysis to account for how regulatory approaches vary across
   third-party administrator characteristics, as well as according to
   respondent-level attributes. The findings indicate that little
   systematic variation in regulatory approaches can be attributed to
   administrator sector. The facet of regulatory approach in which sector
   appears to play a role is found in public third-party regulatory
   organizations' lower provision of technical assistance, when compared to
   their for-profit counterparts. The article discusses explanations for
   the limited relationship between third-party sector and regulatory
   approaches and suggests future research for better understanding the
   linkage between regulatory program design, administrator organizational
   characteristics, and program outputs.},

Title = {Closing the regulatory cycle? A meta evaluation of ex-post
   legislative evaluations by the European Commission},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {23},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1329-1348},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Theoretically, ex-post legislative (EPL) evaluations play an important
   role in the European regulatory cycle. By critically assessing the
   administration, compliance or outcomes of legislation, they may allow
   for learning and inform enforcement. At the same time, the European
   Commission may have incentives not to evaluate, as EPL evaluations may
   lead to undesired policy change or repeal. Furthermore, the development
   of systematic, high-quality EPL evaluations is threatened by more
   technical problems in the sphere of evaluability. Hence, the odds are
   against the systematic production of high-quality evaluations in the
   European Union (EU). This article assesses this argument by conducting a
   meta evaluation of the coverage and quality of ex-post legislative
   evaluations by the European Commission, using two novel datasets. The
   main findings are that EPL evaluation coverage indeed is patchy, with no
   clear upward trend in recent years. EPL evaluation is primarily a matter
   of legislative obligation instead of own initiative. There is great
   scope, finally, for enhancing the quality of EPL evaluations, by
   improving methodological quality, stakeholder involvement and
   transparency.},

Abstract = {US surveillance operations in the Chinese Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)
   and entry into the 12 NM of China-held reefs in the South China Sea have
   met with aggressive People's Liberation Army intercepts. This
   cat-and-mouse' game is a symptom of the structural conflict of interests
   that define enduring Sino-US tension. On the other hand, both Washington
   and Beijing have tried to strike a subtle balance between maintaining a
   broadly-based bilateral relationship, demonstrating resolve in
   protecting their vital interests and formulating crisis management
   measures to avoid an irreversible free fall in the bilateral ties with
   grave regional impact. This dictates a unique and dynamic
   action/reaction pattern by the two militaries in the South China Sea and
   China's EEZ. This paper aims to reconstruct this pattern of contention
   and the trend of evolution. It argues that although the two countries
   have prioritised maintenance of a workable Sino-US relationship among
   different strategic considerations, the on-the-spot encounters may
   trigger some standoffs that may put the bilateral relationship under
   great stress. Crisis management is the key for this cat-and-mouse game
   to be under control, but it will become increasingly more difficult in
   the years to come.},

Abstract = {This article analyses a women's movement that emerged in the context of
   increased land commodification in Morocco. It focuses on the dynamics
   that characterised the making of this coalition of actors across the
   social divide. It mainly analyses the division of tasks among the
   different partners, highlighting the role played by intermediate
   organisations and actors in connecting and merging together local,
   national and international norms, practices and actors. The empowerment
   of this intermediate layer of leaders indicates a gradual inversion of
   the power hierarchy and illustrates the fluidity of domination
   relationships within social movements.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses change in oil and gas policies pushed by the U.S.
   Bureau of Land Management (BLM) during the administrations of Presidents
   George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Administrative policy changes occurred
   not only because of election outcomes and the emergence of new governing
   coalitions but BLM's selective utilization of policy tools such as
   rulemaking, planning, environmental impact analyses, and the use of
   discretionary authority to increase or relax enforcement decisions. The
   data reveal that BLM put more emphasis on the use of discretionary
   authority to limit environmental inspections and to limit environmental
   reviews of proposed drilling projects under Bush while agency officials
   gave priority to adopting new planning procedures to allow greater
   stakeholder input under Obama as well as increasing the number of
   environmental inspections.},

Abstract = {The Ebola epidemic in 2014 in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone
   demonstrated for the first time that in an interdependent and
   interconnected world the Ebola virus is no longer a negligible threat
   limited in its lethal impact to a few isolated African villages. By
   linking Carol Gould's concept of transnational solidarity with the
   concept of transnational advocacy networks, this article argues that a
   variety of actors from governments, academia, civil society and the
   private sector must join forces to establish a mechanism with the
   potential to considerably accelerate research and development (R\&D) on
   Ebola. By presenting the key logic underlying three existing
   public-private partnerships on neglected diseases, the Drugs for
   Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi), the TB Alliance and the Medicines
   for Malaria Venture (MMV), the article tries to identify the principal
   characteristics of such a new mechanism to successfully pool resources,
   knowledge and expertise for the development of tested and effective
   Ebola treatment. The article concludes by emphasising that the present
   atmosphere of transnational solidarity with those African countries
   affected by the Ebola epidemic represents a unique window of opportunity
   to create such a mechanism.},

Abstract = {It is widely believed that China's growing links to the global economy
   are translating into increased Chinese political influence abroad. This
   article explores this possibility quantitatively by examining whether
   increased trade with China correlates with an increased willingness by
   countries to accommodate Chinese interests. I use newly collected data
   that capture cross-national variation in the willingness of individual
   countries to support Chinese government positions relating to Taiwan and
   Tibet, and China's status as a market economy. I find that increased
   trade dependence on China is correlated with an increased likelihood of
   taking an accommodating stance on the economic issue (market economy
   status). But the evidence linking trade to an accommodating stance on
   the political issues is more ambiguous.},

Abstract = {Many countries use state-owned, for-profit, and third sector
   organizations to provide public services, generating hybrid'
   organizational forms. This article examines how the hybridization of
   organizations in the public sector is influenced by interaction between
   regulatory change and professional communities. It presents qualitative
   data on three areas of the UK public sector that have undergone
   marketization: healthcare, broadcasting, and postal services.
   Implementation of market-based reform in public sector organizations is
   shaped by sector-specific differences in professional communities, as
   these groups interact with reform processes. Sectoral differences in
   communities include their power to influence reform, their persistence
   despite reform, and their alignment with the direction of change or
   innovation. Equally, the dynamics of professional communities can be
   affected by reform. Policymakers need to take account of the ways that
   implementation of hybrid forms interacts with professional communities,
   including risk of disrupting existing relationships based on communities
   that contribute to learning.},

Title = {Freedom of Religion and Apostasy: The Malaysian Experience},
Journal = {HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Freedom of religion is a basic need central to the nature of human
   beings. Man needs a belief, authority or power to guide him to the right
   path and to achieve the objectives of his life. From the very beginning,
   man has realized the importance of safeguarding the freedom of religion,
   such as through the enactment of laws. The right to freedom of religion
   is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed in many international and
   regional human rights instruments. In Malaysia, the safeguard of this
   fundamental right is provided under Article 11(1) of the Federal
   Constitution, albeit with limitations. Freedom of religion is a set of
   beliefs and essentially an intensely personal matter; therefore, it is
   inevitable that the protection of religious rights is particularly
   problematic for states that face significant challenges in framing laws
   that strike the proper balance between permitting freedom of religion
   and religious practices on the one hand, and protecting the rights of
   non-adherents on the other hand. Lately, we have witnessed this same
   struggle play out in Malaysia. In particular, there are areas where
   religious, cultural, and ethnic interests are competing and clashing
   over controversies regarding apostasy, conversion, and deviationist
   Islam and related activities. This article aims to look into these
   issues with a view of giving a clearer picture to the public on how
   religious freedom is approached under the Malaysian Federal
   Constitution. This article concludes that in Malaysia, there is a need
   for reform as far as freedom of religion is concerned. This is due to
   the fact that, although Article 4(1) of the Federal Constitution
   declares the document to be the supreme law of the Malaysian Federation,
   a wide gap has developed between theory and practice. For example, in
   relation to Islamic matters, a silent and informal rewriting of the
   Constitution seems to have taken place.},

   addressing social fracture, and the need for more punitive
   counter-terrorism powers. These exercises in public political

   the questions they pose for widespread claims about public disconnection

   identification and reactions to moral violations perpetrated by ingroup
   members depends on the mode of identification: while glorification
   lowers group-based guilt, critical attachment enhances it. In our first
   study, based on comparative survey research, this pattern was replicated
   in Serbia, but not in Croatia. In Croatia, highly attached respondents
   tended to reject criticism of the past war irrespective of their mode of
   identification. In a second study, we sought to explain the Croatian
   results by examining how critical attachment is denied legitimacy. We
   analyzed the rhetorical structure of a parliamentary debate around
   regime-critical media coverage. The analyses show how the
   marginalization of critics is anchored in (1) a monolithic construction
   of the nation, which sacralizes particular elements and places them
   beyond discussion, and (2) a construction of the international context
   as too threatening to permit any dissent. Overall, the results of this
   mixed-method study highlight that the opportunity to be recognized as a
   critical patriot depends on a nation's sociopolitical climate.},

Abstract = {In this article, I present findings from a survey experiment in which
   Chinese university students exposed to a treatment designed to increase
   feelings of national threat were-based on their responses to the
   four-item postmaterialism values-priority battery-significantly more
   likely to be classified as ``pure materialists.{''} These findings are
   presented in support of the proposition that perception of a hostile
   international environment may tend to exaggerate citizens' authoritarian
   and nationalistic sentiments at the expense of more democratically
   favorable value orientations. Media and political figures in the West
   who rail against the evils of China's authoritarian leadership might
   believe that they are championing and encouraging democratic aspirations
   among the Chinese people, but might instead be inciting impulses and
   attitudes that are far less ``democracy-friendly.{''}},

Abstract = {There is widespread concern about declining public involvement in
   established democracies. Europeans are turning away from mainstream
   electoral politics towards new forms of political engagement. This is
   particularly the case for younger citizens. If young people are
   reinventing political activism' (Norris, 2002), in which forms of
   participation and in which countries is it most true? Drawing on data
   from the European Social Survey, the following article compares and
   contrasts young people's politics in the 15 old member states of the
   European Union. Youth engagement generally reflects a country's
   civic-political culture. However, there are significant differences in
   levels of youth participation, in ratios of youth participation
   (compared to the adult population as a whole) and in the relative
   popularity of different forms of political action. The United Kingdom
   stands out, however, with a disturbingly large gap between the political
   engagement of young people and older adults.},

Abstract = {A critical though underexplored decision that regulatory agencies make
   is their choice of which statutes to implement as they set their
   regulatory agenda. In a standard positivist framework, strategic
   agencies should be expected to implement statutes of varying partisan
   origins in order to satisfy the ideological preferences of their
   political principals-conservative principals, for example, may prefer
   regulation that implements statutes passed by conservative coalitions.
   In this article, I demonstrate that regulatory agencies can choose
   different statutes to prioritize and I present empirical evidence that
   this choice changes with party control of political institutions. The
   use of statutory deadlines by enacting coalitions to insulate agencies
   from such politically motivated implementation schedules does not alter
   the empirical patterns.},

Abstract = {Market segmentation methodologies are increasingly used in public
   policy, arts and culture management and third sector campaigning. Rather
   than presume that this is an index of creeping neoliberalisation, we
   track the shared and contested understandings of the public benefits of
   using segmentation methods. Segmentation methods are used to generate
   stable images of individual and group attitudes and motivations, and
   these images are used to inform strategies that seek to either change
   these dispositions or to mobilise them in new directions. Different
   segments of the population are identified as bearing particular
   responsibilities for public action on different issues.},

Abstract = {The widespread supposition that collaborative management designs enhance
   legitimacy must be examined empirically, and the rich diversity of
   different collaborative arrangements should be better acknowledged in
   this endeavor. This study adopts a social network perspective and
   examines three state-initiated and interest-based collaborative
   management arenas in Swedish wildlife management: wildlife conservation
   committees (WCCs). Is there a link between social network structures in
   collaborative management arenas and the perceived legitimacy of output
   by policy stakeholders? This puzzle is addressed through social network
   analysis combined with survey data and interviews. The empirical results
   confirm the notion that collaborative arenas consisting of high network
   closure with many bridging ties across organizational boundaries enjoy a
   higher level of support among stakeholders directly involved in
   management, as members of the committees, than networks with a more
   sparse structure do. This type of well-integrated network structure
   seemingly increases stakeholders' understanding of other actors'
   perspectives through deliberation. Contrary to what was expected,
   though, the empirical analysis did not verify the effect of linking, or
   outreaching ties between the committee members and the organizations
   that they represent, on the organizations' support of WCC decisions.
   Given the rapid rise of collaborative designs in public administrations,
   the topic elaborated in this paper is urgent and further research is
   encouraged.},

Abstract = {Rebel involvement in drug trafficking is broadly found to prolong and
   intensify civil wars. Being an illicit good with strong demand, high
   profit margins, limited barriers to entry, and few interdiction
   opportunities, narcotic drugs disproportionately benefit rebel groups as
   a source of funding in civil wars. Furthermore, drug trafficking is
   believed to prolong civil wars by creating war economies that benefit
   rebel groups, making them reluctant to engage in peace negotiations.
   However, recent peace agreements suggest that drug trafficking can in
   some cases be used to ``buy off{''} rebel leaders, whereas other
   insurgents willingly relinquish this source of funding. This article
   compares attempts at conflict resolution in Colombia and Myanmar,
   focusing on the impact drug trafficking by Fuerzas Armadas
   Revolucionarias de Colombia (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) and
   United Wa State Army has on contemporary peace negotiations.},

Abstract = {This article investigates why the governments of Australia and Poland
   decided to contribute military forces to the United States led invasion
   of Iraq in March 2003 when a majority of Australian and Polish citizens
   were opposed to national involvement in the invasion. The objective of
   the article is to increase understanding of the conditions under which
   governments ignore the public in their foreign policymaking. The article
   examines the explanatory power of four intervening variables: issue
   salience, elite debate, timing of the next election and the importance
   assigned to international gains by the government. On the basis of the
   Direct Method of Agreement, the article concludes that government
   perceptions of international gains and the timing of the next election
   were potentially necessary factors for the outcomes of the cases, while
   issue salience and elite debate were not necessary conditions. A distant
   election may, thus, provide sufficient electoral protection for a
   government that conducts a foreign policy to which the public is
   opposed.},

Volume = {94},
Number = {2, SI},

Abstract = {Managing disasters generally demands multiorganizational collaboration
   and collaborative skills. In Turkey, observed shortcomings in disaster
   management collaboration prompted a reorganization of the disaster
   management system that led to the emergence of a centralized hybrid
   network. The network governance literature generally heralds
   decentralized organization and shared network governance, which
   facilitate collaboration by maximizing trust and legitimacy and
   minimizing power imbalances. Through the use of 24 semi-structured
   interviews, this article's objective is to assess the applicability of
   prior theoretical assumptions regarding interorganizational
   collaboration in a political-administrative context different from that
   in which they were originally developed. The study contributes to the
   theoretical discussion about how political-administrative system
   attributes might influence interorganizational disaster management
   collaboration. The results suggest that `tailor-fitting'
   interorganizational network designs to the political-administrative
   culture can be beneficial for collaborative disaster management.
   Furthermore, results suggest that more effort should be devoted to
   examining cases where actors manage to overcome barriers to
   collaboration despite challenging institutional and
   political-administrative landscapes.},

Title = {Revisiting the Concept of Social Exclusion: It's Relevance to Policies
   against Poverty in Latin America},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {The notion of social exclusion emerged in France in the 1960s and took
   great relevance to welfare policies promoted by the European Union in
   the early 1990s. Later on, such a concept was employed in Latin America
   through the works produced by the International Labour Organization
   (ILO) mainly. Despite the concept of social exclusion is still mentioned
   in policies against poverty delivered within the Latin American context,
   its relevance has diluted during the last decade. Poverty, along with
   vulnerability, risk and social protection, have become dominant concepts
   in this field. Drawing upon the proposals of Peter Townsend (1979 and
   1997), John Veit-Wilson (1998) and Ruth Levitas (2005 and 2013), this
   article aims to revisit the critical approach of social exclusion, a
   perspective which is not only relevant but urgent to be included in
   policies against poverty in Latin America. Four characteristics of the
   Latin American context are identified in order to justify the need of
   such an approach: i) the colonial trauma and the monopolization of
   channels of influence, ii) the fragility of welfare systems and the
   limited coverage of rights; iii) the deficits of citizenship and the
   weakness of democratic systems, and iv) the inequality gaps.},

Abstract = {Currently, governments and individuals are surrounded by information and
   a great number of databases are everywhere and include data about very
   diverse matters. It is possible to find data about production, services,
   commerce, environment, public policies, or legislation, among others.
   Data could be shared, grow every day, and could be potentially used to
   improve the quality of life, develop new businesses or help solving
   diverse social problems. When data can be accessed and used freely, they
   are considered open data that can be linked to configure big data
   networks. Because governments are among the largest producers of data
   and information, linking open governmental data becomes a great
   opportunity to promote the principles of open government. This paper
   presents some basic concepts about open data and linked data and relates
   them to the available Mexican public sector data, as an example. Results
   lead to think about the need to achieve a greater use of open government

Abstract = {9/11 and the subsequent war on terror in Afghanistan have severely
   challenged the idea of a world politics based on secular modernity.
   While the post-9/11 Afghan society remains troubled with the
   post-secular conflict between the so-called Islamic-terrorist and
   secular-democratic forces, the need for a humanist' political discourse
   that could pave the way for peace has become paramount. This paper
   explores the viability of post-Islamism' as an alternative humanist
   political discourse. It sets out to demonstrate how a post-Islamic
   humanist discourse, which is defined by the dialogic process of
   developing a hermeneutical understanding of Islamic philosophy, has the
   potential to not only carve the way for peace amidst perilous
   entanglement between politics and religion in post-secular Afghanistan,
   but also vindicate Islam of its unjustified denigration in the
   contemporary world.},

Abstract = {This article uses critical political theories to engage with regional
   economic development as a site of exclusion, inequality and interwoven
   power relationships, which would benefit from theoretical analysis. It
   does this through the concept of lifestyle from regional development
   creative industries discourses and regional branding, considering how
   time operates in the narratives of place used to represent and promote a
   region to the outside world. Using Cornwall as a case study and an
   analysis informed by complexity theory, the article claims that regional
   narratives need to be understood not just for how they are produced and
   what they say, but also for the futures that they imply. It argues that
   while strategic development narratives need to be situated within an
   affective assemblage that resonates with popular perceptions of place,
   they also need to have a narrative that opens up spaces of possibility
   for future action and facilitates adaptation.},

Abstract = {Against the predominantly structural explanations of policy fiascos in
   the public policy literature, this contribution questions whether
   idiosyncrasies of individual decision-makers should be considered as
   alternative sources of foreign policy fiascos. The contribution uses the
   leadership trait approach and the operational code approach from the
   field of foreign policy analysis (FPA) to discern the personality traits
   and political beliefs respectively of British prime ministers who ended
   up with major foreign policy fiascos. The computer-aided content
   analysis of more than 900 speech acts shows that British `fiasco prime
   ministers' do indeed exhibit certain `extreme' personality traits (e.g.,
   a considerably higher level of self-confidence) and political beliefs
   (e.g., a greater inclination to pursue conflictual strategies) that
   distinguish them from British `non-fiasco prime ministers' and other
   world leaders. This suggests that the public policy literature might
   benefit from allowing for a greater role of individual decision-makers
   in their analyses of policy fiascos.},

Abstract = {On 29 August 2013, the British parliament voted against two motions to
   censure the Syrian government which were expected to lead to military
   action. The result was a shock to external commentators and quickly
   interpreted as a fiasco. This article charts the construction of the
   severity and agency involved in this fiasco and notes the extremely
   personal nature of efforts to attribute blame for the outcome. It argues
   that this process enabled policy-makers to ignore underlying trends
   impacting on foreign policy, including the breakdown of bipartisanship,
   increasing public scepticism about government use of intelligence and
   the utility of force, severe reductions in Britain's capacity to act, as
   well as a deeper identity crisis about what kind of actor Britain should
   be in the world. Constructing this event as a fiasco can be seen as a
   form of denial of Britain's loss of agency in global affairs.},

Number = {5, SI},

Abstract = {The authority of credit rating agencies (CRAs) has been surprisingly
   resilient even in the face of recurrent, widely recognized and severe
   rating failures. This contribution analyses why rating fiascos have had
   little impact on CRAs' status as transnational private authorities. This
   resilience is not only owing to CRAs' own (genuinely private) sources of
   authority. Rather, previous public authorization of CRAs as
   quasi-regulators and the path-dependent politics of post-fiasco
   re-regulation have institutionally entrenched and legitimated their
   status as private authorities. Relying on a historical institutionalist
   approach and focusing on the regulatory setting of the European Union
   (EU), the article retraces how flawed public policy choices in the past,
   i.e., granting CRAs a recognized regulatory role, and non-intended
   institutional dynamics have spawned later regulatory dilemmas in dealing
   with CRAs' rating fiascos. Thus, CRAs' recent mistakes have
   paradoxically fostered a progressive institutionalization rather than a
   downgrade of their role as private governors.},

Title = {Who Wants a Progressive Income Tax? Determinants of Tax Policy
   Preferences in Post-socialist Eastern Europe},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {30},

Abstract = {Using multi-level modeling, this study investigates the determinants of
   public opinion on personal income taxation (PIT) in Central and Eastern
   European countries. The analysis finds that socio-economic and
   demographic variables, such as household income, occupational social
   class, and age, are important in determining PIT preferences. However,
   beliefs about fairness and perceptions of corruption also play a
   significant role. Support for progressive taxation decreases with the
   acceptance of income differences as a reward for talent and effort.
   Also, distrust of the legal system and a conviction that tax authorities
   treat certain people more favorably than others increase support for
   progressive taxation, although this latter effect is constrained to the
   less affluent. These results indicate that progressive PIT might be
   understood by the public as a corrective measure vis-a-vis inequalities
   arising due to corruption. The study finds little evidence for the
   importance of country-level variables, such as income inequality or the
   institutional features of income tax systems. Nevertheless, there is a
   moderately strong association between overall economic development and
   average support for progressive taxation. The public in less developed
   post-socialist countries are more in favor of non-redistributive forms
   of taxation, such as the flat tax and lump-sum taxation. This tendency
   may reflect their increased willingness to accept neoliberal reforms
   under circumstances of growing pressure to improve the international
   competitiveness of the domestic economy.},

Abstract = {At its simplest, migration refers to the movement of people and their
   temporary or permanent geographical relocation. People have always been
   on the move and they have moved over great distances. In this article I
   set out a brief historical understanding of migration, and then focus on
   Europe and, finally, current dilemmas of European migration policy. In
   an era of climate change, war and uneven development, the pressures of
   migration have grown and could soon create an ever greater avalanche of
   movement. States act in a paradoxical way. On the one hand, they
   recognise the nature of the migration crisis and the necessity to
   broaden the definition of those who need urgent assistance. On the other
   hand, most host countries act on increasingly narrow definitions of
   those who warrant assistance and perhaps resettlement. This dilemma is
   examined and tentative steps are set down to show how it might be
   resolved.},

Abstract = {The actors we study do not reflect upon their background ideas. They
   simply take them for granted. Precisely because of this
   taken-for-grantedness, these ideas are very powerful. They shape world
   politics in profound ways. The discipline of International Relations has
   neglected background ideas for a long time. In the last two decades,
   however, a heterogeneous cluster of research has developed that inquires
   into what constitutes background ideas, how backgrounds affect politics,
   and how they come to change. The purpose of this special forum is to
   take stock of the current state of research, to make authors embracing
   different perspectives on background ideas engage with one another's
   arguments, and thus to improve our explanatory and normative
   understandings of backgrounds in world politics.},

Abstract = {This article explores the role law plays in defining conflict and its
   consequences. Two elements of law's categorisations are critical; first
   law's cataloguing of activities fixing actions into particular
   classifications and second law's choosing of temporal points from which
   to analyse conflict, looking both forward and backward at events. The
   article uses two case studies to demonstrate these two features; Rwanda
   and Ukraine. Both examples, one historical the other contemporary, are
   replete with examples of law's categorisations of events and temporal
   points while demonstrating the tremendous impact that these choices have
   upon our understanding of how negotiations ought to proceed. This
   article does not call for a withdrawal of law from these situations but
   rather cognisance that heavy reliance on law can serve to mask both
   events and actors critical to successful negotiation and parties must
   bare this in mind when dealing with conflict.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to analyze perceptions and activities of
   policy actors, who are actively involved in or knowledgeable about the
   politics of hydraulic fracturing in New York, Colorado, and Texas. The
   analysis is guided by research questions drawn from the Advocacy
   Coalition Framework that focus on policy actors' policy positions,
   problem perceptions, political capacity, activities, and interactions.
   In doing so, we examine the differences between those policy actors who
   are opposed to hydraulic fracturing relative to those who support
   hydraulic fracturing across the three states using data from online
   surveys administered in 2013 and 2014. The results show polarization
   between opponents and proponents in their policy positions on hydraulic
   fracturing, which are associated with problem perceptions. Proponents
   and opponents of hydraulic fracturing also have different capacities,
   activities, and interactions. The results are similar across states but
   not without nuanced differences, including greater polarization in New
   York, higher levels of government support for proponents of hydraulic
   fracturing in Texas, and more frequent coalition building in Colorado.},

Title = {The Tragedy of the Uncommons: On the Politics of Apocalypse},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {67-80},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The tragedy of the commons' is a classic type of problem, involving
   multiple actors who face individual incentives to deplete shared
   resources and thereby impose harms on others. Such tragedies can be
   overcome if societies learn through experience to mobilize collective
   action. This article formulates a distinct type of problem: the tragedy
   of the uncommons', involving the misperception and mismanagement of rare
   catastrophic risks. Although the problem of rare and global catastrophic
   risk has been much discussed, its sources and solutions need to be
   better understood. Descriptively, this article identifies psychological
   heuristics and political forces that underlie neglect of rare
   catastrophic uncommons' risks, notably the unavailability heuristic,
   mass numbing, and underdeterrence. Normatively, the article argues that,
   for rare catastrophic risks, it is the inability to learn from
   experience, rather than uncertainty, that offers the best case for
   anticipatory precaution. The article suggests a twist on conventional
   debates: in contrast to salient experienced risks spurring greater
   public concern than expert concern, rare uncommons risks exhibit greater
   expert concern than public concern. Further, optimal precaution against
   uncommons risks requires careful analysis to avoid misplaced priorities
   and potentially catastrophic risk-risk trade-offs. The article offers
   new perspectives on expert vs public perceptions of risk; impact
   assessment and policy analysis; and precaution, policy learning and
   foresight.},

Abstract = {Relationship quality is usually studied only in terms of a few tourism
   subsectors, and the quality of buyer-seller relationship is revealed in
   the context. The dimensions of interorganizational relationships are
   analyzed only in a fragmentary manner; only a few separate dimensions,
   as opposed to their entirety, are evaluated. There is a lack of studies
   that would reveal the relationship quality of tourism cluster
   participants and its impact on tourism cluster performance. Thus the
   purpose of the paper is to identify the quality dimensions of
   interorganizational relationships in a tourism cluster and to verify
   their expression using a local example of Kedainiai region tourism
   cluster. The paper contributes to the domain of interorganizational
   relationships quality research through the analysis of in-depth
   interview with participants of Kedainiai region tourism cluster.},

Abstract = {The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) is seen as arising from a new social
   structure of accumulation that institutionalised a neoliberal form of
   capitalism post the 1980s. This gave rise to ``financialization,{''}
   which has increased both the power of financial markets over other
   economic sectors, and of financial market actors over national
   governments. However, while the neoliberal ideology underpinning
   financialization had a global impact, it sprang from the leading free
   market economies of the US and UK and was most readily embraced by
   states sharing their institutional support for it, such as Australia and
   Canada. But to what extent has it been questioned in these states since
   the crisis? In this article we examine perceptions of the legitimacy of
   finance via a 6 year comparative study of editorials in the mainstream
   press over 2007-2012. We do so because shifts in perceptions of the
   legitimacy suggest the extent to which the GFC produced the potential
   for more fundamental institutional change. We find that rather than this
   legitimacy having been undermined, or transformed, existing viewpoints
   instead hardened over the period considered. This indicates that,
   despite regulatory reform, the power of finance remains relatively
   unchanged.},

Abstract = {An important element of the EU policy discourse during times of crisis
   has been a call to invest more in research and innovation as sources of
   future growth. To study the effects of crisis in this policy area, this
   article draws on an analysis of expert interviews, policy documents and
   relevant literature. It argues that the crisis has led to incremental
   and path-dependent changes in EU policy instruments and priorities. To
   respond to the crisis, EU research and innovation policy has focused on
   two main issues. Firstly, it has aimed to facilitate structural reforms
   and to increase the level, quality and efficiency of public and private
   investments in research and innovation at the national level. Secondly,
   the EU has increased its own research and innovation funding. These
   decisions have involved compromises between the European Commission, the
   European Parliament, the Council and stakeholder organisations.},

Abstract = {Theories of contracting out offer contrasting perspectives on the
   noneconomic determinants of local government contracting. Some suggest
   that ideological motives predominate, with contracting decisions
   reflecting the ideology of ruling parties. Others emphasize political
   motives, with governments responding to local preferences. In this
   article, we draw on ideas about isomorphic pressures within
   organizational fields to examine whether institutional influences might
   also affect contracting behaviour. Using a spatial auto-regressive
   probit model, we evaluate whether mimetic pressures as well as
   ideological and political motives shape the decision to contract out
   service provision in English local governments. In addition, we analyse
   whether those factors also determine whether contracting local
   governments decide to contract with a commercial firm or a
   not-for-profit provider. The statistical results suggest that the
   decision to contract out is spatially dependent, and hence reflective of
   institutional forces. By contrast, political motives and market size
   considerations shape with whom local governments contract.},

Abstract = {Mainstream international relations (IR) has been built as an extension
   of imperial concerns. Thus, a restricted focus, even a self-styled
   demarcation was born: A(0)etat A double dagger est moi. This
   organizational boundary-setting left behind a good deal of the way the
   discipline evolved in other areas of the world. In this sense, Latin
   America has been caught between North-South and Western-non-Western
   traditions, emerging with questions, problems, and challenges different
   from those of European and North American scholars. Throughout history,
   Latin-American IR studies have been marginalized from Western mainstream
   IR approaches, being a theory adopter but not a theory exporter.
   However, Latin-American IR is not new. We can trace its roots to the
   nineteenth century when the processes of nation-building arose as a
   result of the end of the European occupations. Since then, an idea of
   region started to develop and, with it, several shared approaches to IR
   emerged. This article aims to bring the Latin-American IR agenda on
   regionalism into light both in terms of issues and traditions,
   challenging the conventional wisdom about the sources of IR theory and
   proving evidence that Latin-American scholars and policymakers made
   notable contributions that flourished on the edges of the mainstream.},

   `reluctant'. Thus, by process-tracing the EU-India relationship, this
   article reveals the significance of 1999 as a crucial point that has
   urged both Brussels and New Delhi to significantly alter both their
   outlook on global life and on each other. The bilateral relationship
   will be shown to be a story of two actors aspiring to global prominence,
   who-to their mutual frustration-find themselves consigned and
   constrained to play a leading role only in their respective
   neighbourhoods. The bilateral relationship seems only to reinforce this
   marginalization in global affairs, as neither of the strategic partners
   considers the other significant enough to develop meaningful relations
   with them.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to explain through the contextualized comparisons of
   a few critical cases how national preferences on an interstate
   bargaining issue are formed domestically. It proposes an interaction
   framework of national preference formation (NPF), which emphasizes the
   government's policy autonomy, the size of the ruling party or coalition,
   and the party unity in aggregating divergent domestic preferences for
   interstate bargaining. The framework is tested against major European
   Community members' preference formation on Economic and Monetary Union
   (EMU). Case studies reveal that the interaction framework quite
   accurately describes the national preferences of Germany, Britain, and
   France over EMU.},

Abstract = {This article asks whether and how transformational leadership in the
   public sector can influence the use of normative public values in
   organizational decisions. We focus on transformational leadership's
   influence on three core normative public values (representation, equity,
   and individual rights). The extent to which public organizations and
   their employees emphasize normative public values in their
   decision-making can signal important messages to external stakeholders
   about respect for and responsiveness to all citizens, valuing citizens
   from different walks of life equally, and respect for constitutionally
   guaranteed rights. We propose a model in which transformational
   leadership has a direct influence (infusing) and an indirect influence
   (convincing others) on employee use of public values in organizational
   decision-making. Empirical tests provide support for the proposed model,
   with the indirect influence (convincing others) providing a stronger
   impetus. The article concludes with a discussion of the results and
   implications.},

Abstract = {Many European integration treaties - most notably the failed
   Constitutional Treaty - have faced ratification by referendum in various
   member states. Although the literature on voting behaviour in these
   referendums in now well established, the reasons why these referendums
   were held in the first place is under-scrutinised. This article examines
   the reasons EU member states decide to call referendums in order to
   ratify EU treaties and argues that they do so primarily as a result of
   domestic political pressure arising from three sources: electoral
   pressure when the EU is unpopular and elections are close, rules
   governing the use of referendums, and domestic institutional veto
   players. This theory is tested using a combination of single and
   multi-level logistic regression analysis, which finds support for the
   hypotheses developed here.},

Abstract = {In 2013, at the request of the European Commission, the European Food
   Safety Authority (EFSA) announced a new risk assessment policy: Guidance
   on the environmental risks of genetically modified (GM) animals
   (Guidance'). This policy specifies the issues to be addressed in future
   risk assessments for GM animals. EFSA is the European Commission's
   scientific arm, responsible for food-related risk assessment. EFSA
   relies heavily on independent experts and consults non-state actors.
   Employing expert interviews and documentary analysis, the article
   explores non-state actor involvement in a traditionally expert domain
   through a case study. Analysis of EFSA's consultation demonstrates the
   inability of non-state actors to influence policy. The article argues
   that despite international legal obligations to develop risk assessment
   policy, the European Commission failed to recognize the Guidance as
   policy. When policy masquerades as science, unjustified restrictions are
   placed on non-state actor involvement and value judgements are cloaked
   from public scrutiny.},

Abstract = {This study examines how European Union member states have undertaken
   constitutional change to adjust to the new conditions that follow from
   membership in this supranational organization. The article seeks to
   explain what factors determine why constitutional reform induced by EU
   membership is sometimes brought about by changing the wording of the
   constitutional document (explicit change), and sometimes by changing the
   meaning of the constitution while leaving the constitutional text itself
   unaltered (implicit change). The current study provides new insights
   regarding constitutional change by formulating and testing a number of
   rival hypotheses about what explains cross-national variation in the use
   of different methods for achieving constitutional reform. The results
   show that three factors stand out as important determinants for
   EU-induced constitutional change: constitutional rigidity; public
   opinion; and the number of cabinet parties.},

Abstract = {This article develops an identity performance model of prejudice that
   highlights the creative influence of prejudice expressions on norms and
   situations. Definitions of prejudice can promote social change or
   stability when they are used to achieve social identification,
   explanation, and mobilization. Tacit or explicit agreement about the
   nature of prejudice is accomplished collaboratively by persuading others
   to accept (1) an abstract definition of prejudice, (2) concrete
   exemplars of prejudice, and (3) associated beliefs about how a target
   group should be treated. This article reviews three ways in which
   prejudice can be defined in the cut and thrust of social interaction,
   namely, by mobilizing hatred and violence, by accusation and denial, and
   by repression. The struggle for the nature of prejudice determines who
   can be badly treated and by whom. Studying such ordinary struggles to
   define what counts (and does not count) as prejudice will allow us to
   understand how identities are produced, norms are set into motion, and
   populations are mobilized as social relations are reformulated.},

Abstract = {This article examines local narratives on Kosovo and their role in
   crafting and articulating interpretations of Kosovo and international
   missions. Using the concept of `home', as used and conceptualised by
   Jacques Derrida, the article reverses the order of who is `guest' and
   `host' in Kosovo and how that defines the local narratives on the
   subject. In the first part, attention is paid solely to letting local
   narratives deconstruct themselves, while in the second part we let them
   deconstruct the international narrative on Kosovo. The aim of the
   article is to present Kosovo as a battleground of division and
   commonality among the narratives and at the same time as an `impossible'
   `home' of all its narratives. In conclusion, some thoughts pave the way
   for the idea of `renegotiating' the concept of `home' with particular
   focus on `home' in interventions and missions and its ultimate influence
   on the ethics of intervention.},

Abstract = {The problems connected to conventional agriculture promoted by some
   multinationals find fruitful ground in international agreements mainly
   oriented to the patenting of seeds, local knowledge and traditional
   processes/products. Thus, few varieties are favoured compared to the
   detriment of the biodiversity that communities own as cultivation and
   culture. Since the objectives of KHFA (Knowledge, Health and Food for
   All) project, it's observed that an alternative model of management of
   agro-biodiversity should contain a combined use both of regulatory and
   legal tools and of socio-educational device for ensuring local
   communities to safeguard and value their local knowledge, skills and
   traditional knowledge in a framework of self / co-management of these
   common goods at one with institutions.
   This article shows the results of KHFA project, with reference to
   normative-legal tools developed in deliberative focus groups by numerous
   international experts and professionals get involved in the project.
   These deliberative focus groups have successfully produced a Concerted
   Document carrying out some specific proposals aimed at promoting
   agro-biodiversity along a dialogue between communities and institutions.
   These proposals, developed in the advocay and lobbying campaigns of the
   project were summerized in a motion. The Committee of the Regions of
   Europe submitted this motion for ratification by some local, regional
   and national governments also pushing for its implementation. At the end
   of the project, an expert group has assessed the project using the
   technique of scale of priorities.},

Abstract = {This study aims to understand whether recent tensions between the EU and
   Russia are likely to increase support for a common European foreign
   policy among national political elites. Although the EU as a whole is
   still far from being able to speak with one voice, it is difficult to
   explain the reasons sovereign states decide to cooperate in foreign
   policy. This study relies on two detailed elite surveys describing the
   opinions of national parliamentarians in 16 EU member states before and
   after the Russo-Georgian War in the summer of 2008. The results show
   that following the war, the perception of a threat from Russia helps
   persuade the least Euro-enthusiastic MPs to support a common EU foreign
   policy.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the impact of the Turkish Repentance Laws in
   undermining the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). Did the repentance laws
   increase the PKK surrender, thereby decreasing the PKK violence? Vector
   Auto-Regression analysis indicates that enactment of repentance laws did
   not have any significant impact on PKK surrenders, failing to
   significantly decrease PKK violence. Yet it does not establish any
   meaningful relationship between the use of force and PKK surrenders.
   Descriptive analyses show the significant number of surrenders took
   place in 1993-94, 2001, and 2003, while the highest number of penitents
   submitted to the Return to Home Law in 2003. These values relate to a
   specific context. This study, however, asserts that surrendered and
   applicant PKK members were too few to influence the overall conflict,
   concluding that, in addition to what these laws mean to the penitents,
   the success/failure of repentance policies are related to the nature of
   Turkey's counterinsurgency and their respective context.},

Abstract = {This article draws from the wealth of literature surrounding China's
   role in global markets. In particular it focuses on the debate regarding
   China's Lewis turning point and burgeoning market share. This article
   constructs a theoretical framework surrounding globalisation theory and
   Richard Freeman's great doubling' thesis, and assesses the implications
   of China's reserve-labour surplus for global labour standards. It
   reviews a wide range of the literature on related topics, assessing the
   validity of the data therein. Market signals suggesting the depletion of
   China's reserve-labour surplus are distorted due to state policy known
   as hukou, which itself may cause China's Lewis turning point to be
   pushed further into the future. There is evidence that China can catch
   up with advanced economies in terms of capital intensive production
   (although they remain some way from doing so) and that China's crowding
   out of neighbouring economies' market shares might be seen more
   accurately as redirection, rather than outright displacement. Finally,
   this article highlights evidence of a race to the bottom.},

Title = {Borders, conflict and security},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {27},

Pages = {487-504},
Abstract = {Purpose - Border environments differ as foci for conflict discourse.
   While classic realist theories are used to account for mechanisms of
   securitized borders, socially oriented theories are often invoked to
   characterize relaxed borders. This distinguishing pattern regarding
   securitization reflects a deeply rooted focus on idealized borders,
   based on implicit expectations that relaxed borders are a viable option
   and goal for all. This orientation is prone to mistaken assumptions
   regarding local, national and regional interests and ultimately
   threatens delicately balanced states of stability. This paper aims to
   question this somewhat simplified categorization and posit that
   securitized borders are longstanding realities which warrant more
   complex theoretical conceptualization.
   Design/methodology/approach - The analysis is based on documentary study
   and qualitative field research, mapping and evaluating Israel-Jordan
   cross-border interactions conducted during 2006-2014. Local civilian
   interactions were studied using three tools: interviews, non-participant
   observations and a sector-based analysis of original and secondary
   sources. In the course of research, many tours and observations of the
   border region were conducted, and key actors in Israel and Jordan were
   interviewed: entrepreneurs, local residents, local and national
   government officials, security personnel and representatives of
   non-governmental organizations involved in the administration and
   funding of normalization-promoting initiatives.
   Findings - In light of internal and external security threats which
   challenge states and border regions in conflict environments and in
   normalized settings, there is increasing value in recognizing
   multi-level power relations ({''}bringing the state back in{''}) that
   design, inhibit and ultimately control the inevitability, circumstance
   and social-political effectivity of any cross-border interaction.
   Cross-border cooperation (CBC), which evolves gradually, monitored by
   the border regime and reflecting actual levels of inter-state political
   dialogue, is a slower yet safer option and a more realistic expectation
   for CBC, especially in regions of minimal communication between
   cross-border neighbors. In the backdrop of the Middle East turmoil,
   Israel and Jordan mark 20 years of peaceful relations, enjoying
   stability based on shared political and security interests, yet
   displaying no apparent tendency toward increased cross-border
   interaction. Given the stark differences in regimes and ongoing regional
   unrest, this securitized border fulfills local and regional needs and is
   far from a temporary ``second-best{''} reality.
   Originality/value - The analysis is based on original fieldwork and
   documentary study, mapping and evaluating Israel-Jordan cross-border
   interactions conducted during 2006-2014.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the role of the European Council in two key
   legislative packages on economic and budgetary coordination, the
   Six-pack and the Two-pack, which were negotiated under the ordinary
   legislative procedure. It assesses how and to what extent the key actor
   in the literature on the new intergovernmentalism - the European Council
   - is able to curb the powers of the supranational institutions - the
   Commission and the European Parliament - in a policy area where the
   community method has been applied since the Treaty of Lisbon. It tracks
   the development of the legislative negotiations - from the stages
   preceding the Commission's proposal to their conclusions, relying on
   official documents, press reports and 30 original interviews with key
   decision-makers. The strong role of the European Council both as an
   agenda-setter and in the legislative negotiations stands out, and
   suggests that the implications of new intergovernmentalism may well
   extend beyond intergovernmental decision-making processes.},

Volume = {53},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {News reports of clashes between Muslims and Christians in countries such
   as Nigeria are increasingly common. Yet, interreligious violence erupts
   only in some communities but not others. Under what conditions does
   religious identity become the fault line of communal violence? We argue
   that informal power-sharing institutions on the communal level are
   essential in shaping the incentives of potential perpetrators. We
   provide both qualitative and quantitative evidence for our claim that
   districts in which informal power-sharing agreements exist are less
   likely to experience interreligious violence. We conducted interviews
   with community leaders in 38 Nigerian districts to trace the process by
   which local power-sharing institutions exert influence on actors'
   incentives to engage in religious violence. We complement this with
   quantitative analyses of a new dataset capturing interreligious violence
   on a subnational level. The analyses show that the overall degree of
   interreligious violence is significantly lower in districts with
   power-sharing than in those without. We also identify two causal
   mechanisms through which informal power-sharing institutions operate.
   First, these institutions affect the incentives of elites to appeal for
   cooperation. We show that the rhetoric of elites in districts with
   power-sharing is significantly more conciliatory. Second, power-sharing
   affects the general population's perception of the interreligious
   tensions. Individuals living in districts with power-sharing
   institutions are less likely to experience religious diversity as
   threatening. Local-level informal power-sharing institutions are
   therefore an important foundation for communal peace and interreligious
   cooperation.},

Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Pages = {405-425},
Abstract = {The study of small state foreign policy has traditionally focused on
   size and the influence it plays on small state behaviour. This article
   instead uses the social identity theory to evaluate small state
   behaviour. Using the concept of status, Estonia's bilateral development
   cooperation with Georgia and Moldova is evaluated. Despite Estonia's
   limited resources, the impact of its aid was significant in terms of
   boosting Estonia's status in the eyes of Georgia and Moldova. Using the
   concept of status is promising in its ability to explain and understand
   small state behaviour. The potential impact of this approach is
   significant as size might best be understood not as material or
   relational but as psychological.},

Volume = {4},

Pages = {136-150},
Abstract = {While the international community stresses the importance of including
   women at the peace table so peace processes will better represent their
   needs and interests, it is unclear what specifically this inclusion
   entails. Do women need to be negotiators, mediators? Do peace agreements
   adequately represent women's interests when women are included? This
   article engages UNSC Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security as a
   framework through which to assess peace processes and agreements. A
   woman-focused examination of all civil war peace processes reveals that
   less than 10\% meet women's inclusion as envisioned in UNSCR 1325. This
   article focuses on the three conditions accounting for women's
   substantive representation in peacebuilding. What emerges are three
   joint necessities: an explicit women's agenda; access to the peace
   process; and advocacy within the process. The final sections
   problematise how even in all of these positive cases women had to fight
   to participate.},

Title = {Does Power Sector Deregulation Promote or Discourage Renewable Energy
   Policy? Evidence from the States, 1991-2012},
Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Pages = {22-50},

Abstract = {Both within the United States and across the world, power sector
   deregulation has changed the environment in which governments formulate
   renewable energy policy. Utilizing data from U.S. states for the
   1991-2012 period, this article shows that there is no difference in the
   adoption of new renewable energy policy in states that have and have not
   already gone through power sector deregulation. However, the evidence
   also shows that governments formulate renewable energy policy as part of
   a legislative package for power sector deregulation in a dynamic we call
   issue linkage. While power sector deregulation is neither an impediment
   nor an impetus to renewable energy policy, the strategic challenge of
   passing deregulatory legislation requires concessions to constituencies
   that prefer renewables. For policy makers, the results are important
   because they indicate that deeper reforms in electricity generation are
   consistent with more ambitious renewable energy policy.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},

Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Pages = {365-388},
Abstract = {What specific forms of reasoning underlie the US approach to Asia, what
   downside risks do they imply, and to what extent can they be mitigated?
   This article examines the theoretical underpinnings of the US
   ``rebalance{''} to Asia by categorizing US policies according to three
   types of logic: military power; economic liberalism; and
   institutionalism. It then uses international relations theory as a
   diagnostic tool to assess risks in these approaches. Recent efforts
   toward improving transparency in contested maritime areas and
   capacity-building of local allies and partners may address the
   strategy's most acute risks, while inevitably generating more in the
   process.},

Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {408-421},
Abstract = {Responding to Brendan O'Leary's `Power-Sharing and Partition', this
   essay challenges both O'Leary's approach and the general invocation of
   direct Israel-Palestine negotiations for a two-state solution. The essay
   makes this challenge both through a critique of the Israeli and
   Palestinian positions and of the interests and possible interventions of
   other States and groups in the region. Pursuing their foreign policy
   goals and using the conflict to mobilize domestic support, those States
   are unable to support a resolution or have no impetus to do so. With no
   foreseeable change in the Israeli approach opening up possibilities in
   direct talks, this essay proposes a reframing of the `regional' and
   `international' as an alternative to the status quo. In spaces such as
   the United Nations and the International Criminal Court, Palestinian
   constituencies can pursue a legitimacy and autonomy to build political,
   legal, and economic capital. Provided this is accompanied by
   reconciliation among Palestinian groups, this can lay the foundation for
   a new approach to negotiations which do not rest primarily on fixed
   Israeli conditions.},

Abstract = {This article analyses civic activities in East European countries using
   data from the European Values Study (2008-2010), which reveals the
   linkage between civic activities and democratic political culture at the
   country level. The analysis looks at the elements of democratic
   political culture which could promote or prevent the rise of civic
   engagement in Eastern Europe, namely trust towards political
   institutions, interest in politics, and satisfaction with democracy.
   Whilst it is too early to apply the concept of ``critical citizen{''} to
   a civic activist in the area - it is suggested that the concept
   ``dispassionate, but interested{''} be used.},

Pages = {46-62},
Abstract = {In spite of earlier research that pointed at Romania as being one of the
   East European countries with a low level of civil activism, in 2013, it
   witnessed the largest wave of protests in its post-communist history.
   This article seeks to find out what caused the Romanian Autumn - as
   these protests have been called - by analysing it in the context of the
   anti-austerity, anti-capitalist, and/or environmentalist world protests
   and the political opportunity structure related to the domestic
   framework. The latter is investigated by taking into consideration: (a)
   the tensions between the political actors; (b) the political support for
   the corporative activity against the public will; and (c) the biased
   campaign conducted by foreign corporations, mainstream media, and
   political authorities in favour of the exploitation without any prior
   public debate.},

   political tensions},
Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Pages = {297-316},
Abstract = {A key component of post-conflict reconstruction is inclusive and
   equitable economic development. In the post-Cold War era, Western donors
   have promoted the liberal peacebuilding model that emphasises
   democratisation and marketisation to accomplish stability and
   development. Attracting Foreign Direct Investment is an essential
   component of these marketisation policies, contributing to creating new
   employment opportunities, bringing in new technologies, skills and
   access to international markets. Others point to potential negative
   consequences for social stability of large international firms entering
   post-civil war countries, creating winners and losers and contributing
   to conflicts over access to land, jobs, social services and revenues
   generated by the companies. This paper examines the socioeconomic and
   political consequences of FDI flows in Liberia. It argues that the very
   success of encouraging FDI, mostly channelled into palm oil, forestry,
   rubber and iron ore mining, undermined other policy goals, and in
   particular poverty reduction strategies, contributing to an increase in
   political tensions and protests in the project-affected communities.},

Title = {Encountering the Pluriverse: Looking for Alternatives in Other Worlds},
Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE POLITICA INTERNACIONAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {59},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The lack of ontological pluralism in International Relations has been a
   strong determinant of the general scope of the discipline and its
   objects of study, as well as all that is rendered irrelevant to the
   study of the ``international{''}. IR has marginalized difference not
   only by disciplining epistemologies, but also by rejecting other
   ontologies, particularly those which belong to indigenous peoples, by
   relegating them to the realm of myths, legends and beliefs. The roots of
   ontological marginalization are deeply seeded, so much so that they are
   present in virtually every field of science (social or not). In order to
   understand this concern with ontology, we need to refer to the modern
   age, specifically its Western and now liberal manifestations. The main
   objective of this article is to put the ontological question on the
   table. It is argued that the ``truth{''} of one-world, one reality and
   one universe is also a myth, showing how it has hidden many worlds and
   many realities. The concept of the pluriverse is used to show how - from
   different ontological positions, particularly relational cosmovisions
   like the Andean worldview -, alternatives actually appear. The text is
   divided into three parts: the first one depicts the pluriverse and what
   it implies and enables, the second describes how the pluriverse has been
   occulted by the myth of modernity, and the third part is an attempt to
   illustrate how relational ontologies contribute to the theoretical
   constitution of the global.},

Title = {Does Changing the Rules Really Matter? Assessing Procedural Justice
   Perceptions Under Civil Service Reform},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {129-141},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Civil service reforms over the last four decades have sought to provide
   new flexibilities to managers, particularly in relation to performance
   management. Reforms undertaken by many US states are consistent with
   this trend. State employees report these managerial flexibilities are
   decreasing perceptions of fairness. At the federal level, personnel
   reforms in the US Department of Defense also sought to increase
   managerial discretion. Defense identified employee perceptions of
   fairness as key to the successful implementation of the system. This
   study examines changes in fairness perceptions in response to civil
   service reforms at Defense in three distinct ways. First, procedural
   justice perceptions are examined before, during, and after repeal of the
   personnel reforms. Second, we consider whether the procedural justice
   perceptions of employees and managers are different over the time
   periods. Procedural justice research includes few studies controlling
   for managerial status, despite early arguments that position in the
   organization is likely to change fairness assessments. Third, the use of
   control groups allows us to consider if changes in procedural justice
   perceptions are due to the personnel reforms or reflect governmentwide
   trends. US Office of Personnel Management surveys covering a 10-year
   period are analyzed using a difference-in-differences-in-differences
   model. Results indicate that manager and employee perceptions of
   procedural justice are different over the time period, these perceptions
   change in different ways in response to the reforms, and the observed
   changes are unique from governmentwide trends.},

Abstract = {Despite the great number of articles and publications on anticlerical
   violence during the Spanish Civil War, this is the first to focus on the
   perceptions of its victims. In the documents they left behind, these
   imprisoned clergymen represented themselves as martyrs. With no
   influence from rebel propaganda, these statements provide evidence that
   the rhetoric of martyrdom was embedded in Spanish Catholic culture prior
   to the coup d'etat against the Second Republic in 1936. Through a case
   study of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Barbastro, one of the districts
   most disrupted by anticlerical violence, this article explores the
   existence of a Catholic agency which transformed death in the name of
   God into a path of perfection; a path toward the improvement of oneself
   and of the whole of society. They thought of their martyrdom as a
   contribution to the victory of the rebels that would bring the Kingdom
   of God closer to Spain. Imbued by this ideal they performed their own
   martyrdom.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {University-driven partnerships and experiments for advancing urban
   sustainability are flourishing around the world. Responding to drivers
   such as calls for stakeholder engagement in research, tangible social
   and economic contributions, and government funding incentives, Asian
   research universities are also forming cross-sector partnerships and
   implementing various sociotechnical experiments. In this chapter we
   examine the role of university partnerships in knowledge co-production
   and implementation of urban sustainability experiments in industrialized
   Asian nations. By examining fifteen cases from Singapore, Japan, Hong
   Kong and Korea, we highlight common attributes (focus areas, actors,
   motivations and mechanisms) and then investigate the functions,
   motivations, barriers and significance of roles assumed by differing
   societal sectors. A detailed case study of an ambitious project from the
   University of Tokyo then follows to further illustrate these attributes
   in context.
   Key findings are that, overall, university partnerships for urban
   sustainability in our Asian sample are dominated by technical
   approaches. Yet the most significant barriers are human aspects such as
   time restraints, lack of unity, and poor management and leadership, to
   name several. On key drivers, government funding is playing a major role
   in enticing partnership formation and influencing particular approaches
   to urban sustainability. Measures are required to encourage the
   participation of the social sciences and humanities, and non-technical
   sustainability experiments. Case study evidence suggests that the
   ability of partnerships to tackle complex social issues and trigger
   societal transitions towards sustainability is often constrained by
   existing research projects and the institutional capacities of
   universities and their partners.},

   unprecedented oversight and controlling powers over national
   governments' political economy and social policies (budgetary
   supervision of the European Commission, the ``conditionality policy{''}
   of the European Central Bank, etc.), the exteriority of the
   ``independent branch{''} from the circuit of representative democracy as

Abstract = {Violent nonstate groups are usually weaker than the states they target.
   Theory suggests that groups carefully condition their choice of tactics
   on anticipated state response. Yet scholars know very little about
   whether and how groups strategically plan attacks in anticipation of
   state response. Scholars do not know if and under what conditions groups
   employ violent tactics to provoke or avoid a forceful state response,
   although extant theory is consistent with both possibilities. Relatedly,
   there is little systematic evidence about why groups choose terrorist or
   guerrilla tactics and how this choice relates to anticipated state
   response. I develop a theoretical and empirical model of the interaction
   between groups and states that generates unique evidence on all three
   fronts. Using data on attacks in Western Europe from 1950 to 2004, I
   show that guerrilla attacks are sometimes associated with provoking
   forceful state response, whereas terrorist attacks are generally
   associated with avoiding forceful response. Groups effectively choose
   their tactics to avoid forceful state responses that are too damaging
   for themselves but provoke forceful responses that disproportionately
   harm civilians. These findings survive several robustness and model
   specification tests.},

Abstract = {The formation of Hong Kong citizenship was under tensions and struggles
   after the change of sovereignty in 1997. In spite of the limited
   political and social rights, many incidents showed that the promised
   civil rights were declining. More importantly, subject to the
   intensified transborder population mobility of Chinese citizens, there
   were public discourses addressing that the social rights of Hong Kong
   citizens were threatened. Protests in response to the intensified
   transborder population mobility were found, with the rightist public
   discourses advocating to conserve the essences of Hong Kong citizenship.
   Being the neoliberal exception of China, Hong Kong is positioned to
   contribute for China by its market economy, as well as the relatively
   well-established socio-economic institution. However, as this article
   argues, in spite of the logic of exception, i.e. the zoning technology
   that the state deploys, the intensified transborder population mobility
   and economic activities between the neoliberal exception and the
   sovereign state can lead to the struggles and contentions concerning the
   citizenship of the former.},

Abstract = {When do countries abandon coalition partners during war? Prominent
   arguments about alliance dissolution focus on peacetime, yet the ability
   of alliances to influence international politics ultimately hinges on
   their cohesion or dissolution during war. In this article, I argue that
   battlefield circumstances heavily influence the likelihood of defection
   from coalitions. First, countries fighting independently from their
   partners make attractive candidates for wedge strategies and hence are
   more likely to defect. Second, coalitions are more likely to collapse
   when their members see victory in the overall war as less likely. These
   predictions contrast with common expectations from theories of the
   balance of power and of collective action. I test hypotheses about
   wartime developments statistically using new time-varying data on both
   front-level troop contributions and battle deaths. Consistent with
   theoretical predictions, countries are more likely to abandon coalition
   partners if fighting alone and when the coalition fares worse in recent
   fighting.},

Abstract = {This article examines an alternative logic for candidate renomination to
   the European Parliament (EP), based upon the size and ideological nature
   of a Member of the European Parliament's (MEP's) home party, as well as
   timing of EP elections. I derive expectations from the second-order
   election hypothesis to show that parties from outside of the national
   mainstream should expect to benefit disproportionately from EP elections
   and therefore renominate experienced incumbents at higher rates. Using
   original data on the career behaviour of MEPs during the 2009 and 2014
   elections, I find that such parties are more likely to treat EP contests
   as first order' in their importance, particularly when European
   elections are held during the midterm period of the national election
   cycle. My findings have new implications for the differentiated
   volatility of the EP, specifically, as well as for internal party
   dynamics in multi-level systems, more generally.},

Abstract = {This article examines the current attempt by the European Union and
   Japan to negotiate a Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA). Sitting
   alongside negotiations for an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), this
   SPA represents an attempt to reignite bilateral relations between these
   two global powerhouses. Still confined by the origins of their
   institutionalised partnership in 1991, this article argues that both
   sides find it hard to break away from earlier functional and normative
   assumptions about their relative significance and about each other, in
   order to forge a new meaningful, overarching partnership. It examines
   the development of Japan-EU relations building up to the preparations
   for this SPA, against the background of path-dependent processes of
   engagement. Path dependency in its various forms views institutions as
   carriers of history,' which maintain existing behavioural norms and
   cultural patterns throughout time'. Despite some of the problems such
   claims elicit, as will be explored below, this article proposes that
   path dependency - and a particular focus on imprinting' - offers a
   useful starting point for explaining the apparent institutional inertia
   and incremental change that characterise much of this bilateral
   relationship today.},

Title = {Revisiting Bilateral Foreign Direct Investment Inflows into BRIC
   Economies},
Journal = {Global Policy},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {510-520},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Tracking the origins of bilateral foreign direct investment (FDI) flows
   is required to understand de facto real linkages between countries,
   which remains an important area of research and policy concern. However,
   existing bilateral FDI data may fail to correctly identify the original
   sources of FDI flows because they are based on flow of funds rather than
   ultimate ownership. As a consequence, several offshore financing centers
   (OFCs) and tax havens emerge as top sources of FDI flows which provide a
   misleading picture of bilateral real linkages between countries. In this
   context, this paper proposes an alternative framework to overcome this
   problem by examining data on mergers and acquisitions (M\&As), which
   offers a far more informative geographical breakdown of sources of FDI
   inflows. The paper reconciles bilateral FDI inflows data with M\& A data
   for the BRIC economies covering Brazil, Russia, India and China, for the
   period 2001-12. Further, in light of the increasing M\& A flows to
   BRICs, of equal policy importance is the issue of what kind of FDI
   should the BRICs attract. In this regard, the paper also sheds some
   light on the macroeconomic policy implications of the different kinds of
   FDI flows to the BRIC economies.},

Abstract = {Scholars often assert that the delegation of policy discretion to
   administrative agencies is driven, in part, by partisanship. In short,
   the ``ally principle{''} dictates that elected officials delegate more
   policy discretion to agency officials when their partisanship aligns
   because such an alignment reduces uncertainty about future policy
   choices. In contrast, we draw on insights from social identity theory to
   theorize that partisan alignment may, in practice, decrease the overall
   perceived policy discretion by agency officials. We evaluate this
   hypothesis using data collected across three decades of state political
   elections and over 6,000 American state agency heads, finding consistent
   evidence against the ally principle. In fact, in keeping with our
   theorizing, we uncover slightly lower-not higher-levels of policy
   discretion are associated with partisan alignment. We conclude that
   partisanship may play a role in narrowing the perceived policy authority
   available to politically like-minded agency officials.},

Abstract = {Machiavelli consistently advises that well-ordered republics must keep
   their citizens poor'. Although this maxim recurs throughout the
   Discourses, Machiavelli never directly elaborates on what this
   prescription for civic poverty requires. To the limited extent that this
   maxim has received critical examination, it is commonly regarded as
   contending that citizens must live in a condition of material austerity.
   Through an analysis of Machiavelli's writings on the German free cities,
   this article challenges this interpretation and argues that rather than
   requiring that citizens live at some particular level of poverty, the
   maxim instead requires only that citizens maintain certain attitudes
   towards poverty and wealth.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},

Pages = {614-629},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {It is argued in this article that legislative vote trading by
   representatives is both ethically permissible and may be ethically
   required in many cases. This conclusion is an implication of a thin,
   general account of representation that requires representatives to vote
   on the basis of the perceived preferences or interests of their
   constituents. These special duties arise from a thin account of
   representation and create a weak, defeasible duty for representatives to
   engage in what they believe will be beneficial vote trades. After
   establishing this claim, the article considers two objections to this
   duty. One is based on equating legislative vote trading with corruption,
   and the other argues that logrolling iolates the duty of civility'.
   Neither objection undermines the main claim that there is a weak duty to
   engage in logrolling. Nevertheless, the implications of this duty may be
   troubling for other reasons.},

Abstract = {The American states are engaged in a variety of policy efforts to
   mitigate climate change and alter energy usage. While a number of
   studies have considered the reasons for adoption of renewable energy and
   climate change policies, they typically consider only one policy in
   isolation. This study examines policy adoption of 14 energy and climate
   change programs in a pooled event history analysis. Our primary research
   questions consider average effects of horizontal policy diffusion, while
   also identifying factors that vary across policy type. We offer a method
   of testing whether predictors vary across policies and use this test to
   incorporate interactions by policy in the statistical analysis. Our
   results indicate that many of the primary drivers of adoption are
   political in nature, including state ideology, environmental interest
   group membership, and diffusion via ideologically similar neighbors. In
   addition, we find that given policy heterogeneity, a number of
   determinants vary by policy type, though differences are in magnitude
   rather than direction.},

Abstract = {As part of this special issue examining policy transfer between the
   Labour parties in Australia and Britain, this paper seeks to explore the
   relationship between the two on ideological positioning. In the 1990s
   there was substantial ideas transfer from the Australian Hawke-Keating
   government to Blair New Labour' in Britain, as both parties made a lunge
   towards the economic centre. This paper analyses how the inheritors of
   that shift, the Rudd/Gillard government in Australia and the Miliband
   and Corbyn leaderships in Britain, are seeking to define the role and
   purpose of Labour parties in its wake. It examines the extent to which
   they are learning and borrowing from one another, and finds that a
   combination of divergent economic and political contexts have led to
   strikingly limited contemporary policy transfer.},

Title = {WHY STRONG COORDINATION AT ONE LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH
   STRONG COORDINATION ACROSS LEVELS (AND HOW TO LIVE WITH IT): THE CASE OF
   THE EUROPEAN UNION},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {94},
Number = {3},
Pages = {579-592},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The European Union (EU) inherited indirect administration' from
   classical international organizations: policies adopted by the
   international organization are subsequently to be implemented nationally
   by member states themselves, and not by bodies owned by the
   international organization. This arrangement has often led to
   legislation being incorporated and applied rather differently across
   countries. In order to harmonize implementation practices within the EU,
   we have witnessed a development from indirect administration' to more
   direct administration' in the sense that national agencies work closely
   with the European Commission, EU agencies and sister agencies in other
   member states, partly bypassing national ministries. Thus, stronger
   coordination across levels may counteract strong coordination at the
   national level. This coordination dilemma' seems to have been largely
   ignored in the literatures on EU network governance and national
   joined-up government', respectively. The ambition of this article is
   twofold: first, the coordination dilemma is theoretically and
   empirically illustrated by the seeming incompatibility between a more
   direct implementation structure in the multilevel EU administrative
   system and trends towards strengthening coordination and control within
   nation states. Second, the article discusses organizational arrangements
   that may enable systems to live with the coordination dilemma in
   practice.},

Volume = {53},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The alarming upward trend since 2012 in the number of fatalities
   incurred by organized violence did not continue in 2015. Indeed, 2014
   saw more than 130,000 people killed in organized violence while in 2015
   this figure was close to 118,000. This is still an unusually high
   number, the third-worst year in the post-Cold War period. The number of
   conflicts continued to increase from 41 in 2014 to 50 in 2015. This
   increase was by and large driven by the expansion of the Islamic State.
   Most of the fatalities, over 97,000, incurred in state-based conflicts.
   Non-state conflicts also increased, from 61 in 2014 to 70 in 2015, the
   highest number recorded in the 1989-2015 period. No non-state conflict
   passed the threshold of 1,000 battle-related deaths, but 11 state-based
   conflicts did - a decrease by one from 2014. Seven of the ten most
   violent state-based conflicts in 2014 became less violent. Twenty-six
   actors were registered in one-sided violence just as in 2014, while the
   number of fatalities decreased from over 13,500 to 9,500.},

Title = {The Importance of Global Extinction in Climate Change Policy},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {315-322},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {For problems like global climate change that may involve global
   extinction, we must not just focus, as most economic analysts do, on the
   trading-off of current consumption (current mitigation investment
   reduces consumption) against future consumption (less need for future
   investment), but also consider the effects of mitigation investment in
   reducing the extinction probabilities. Future utility/welfare values
   should only be discounted at the uncertainty of their realization,
   making these values even in the far future important as this discount
   rate should be very low (0.01 per cent per annum or less). Immediate and
   strong actions of environmental protection including greenhouse gas
   reduction may thus be justified despite high consumption discount rates
   (about 5 per cent). Unexpectedly, an increase in the extinction
   probabilities may increase or decrease our willingness to reduce them;
   precise conditions are given. The related intuition that, the higher the
   probability of destruction of your house by fire, the less willing you
   will be in investing on things like interior decoration that does not
   change the probability of destruction, but the higher your willingness
   to pave a fire clearance that does reduce the probability of
   destruction, is examined.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {53},
Number = {5},
Pages = {665-679},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article takes a game-theoretic and latent variable approach to
   modeling the effect of international social hierarchies on conflict
   among states. I start with the premise that international states are
   social actors and are nested within informal social networks of friendly
   and conflictual relationships. Rather than lateral relationships among
   equals, networks among states tend to have a vertical or hierarchical
   structure. Although international hierarchical relationships may arise
   as a result of material power asymmetries, this article focuses on
   non-material asymmetries that stem from political legitimacy or policy
   innovation - a subject that has received less attention in scholarly
   research. I argue that, within these hierarchies, states adopt one of
   two roles - a dominant or a subordinate. Each resulting (dyadic)
   dominant-subordinate relationship is a social contract, in which the
   subordinate concedes some autonomy in exchange for the dominant's
   protection. This social hierarchy affects the relationships among
   subordinates, as well as between a dominant and subordinates. The model
   predicts that a state's degree of subordination reduces its probability
   of conflict initiation against other subordinates. Moreover, the
   decision to initiate conflict is influenced by the expectation that the
   dominant will intervene, which itself is affected by the target's
   relative level of subordination to the dominant vis-a-vis the
   challenger. These predictions are supported by empirical analyses of the
   US hierarchy (1950-2000).},

Title = {Old wine in new bottles? Revisiting contract farming after agrarian
   reform in Zimbabwe},
Journal = {REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {86-98},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This contribution explores emerging features of social relations of
   production as expressed through the contract farming system in Zimbabwe.
   It seeks to link earlier research on plantation-based outgrower schemes
   in tea and sugar that were on a modest scale, to contemporary contract
   farming in tobacco and cotton that has expanded to a relatively large
   scale in the post-land reform period. The article questions whether the
   current expansion wave is a qualitatively new process or a variant of
   old wine in new bottles' in terms of relations between growers and large

Title = {Reckoning with Dictatorship in Brazil: The Double-Edged Role of
   Artistic-Cultural Production},
Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {43},
Number = {5},
Pages = {12-28},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A conventional approach that takes into account only official reckonings
   might lead one to believe that Brazil has lacked a culture of memory of
   the military regime, at least until recently. Widening the scope to
   include cultural production, however, provides a different view: one of
   a long tradition of reckoning with the dictatorship. In
   postauthoritarian Brazil, the process of transition has been marked by a
   disjuncture between the profusion of cultural responses to the
   dictatorship era and the legalistic silence resulting from the 1979
   amnesty law, which continues to grant impunity to former human rights
   perpetrators. An approach that, instead of emphasizing political
   measures, asks how cultural production may have impacted Brazil's
   particular way of approaching its violent past helps to answer such
   questions as how to reconcile the lack of popular mobilization in the
   1980s with the fact that guerrilla memoirs turned out to be best sellers
   and whether culture served as a catalyst for debates about the
   authoritarian past. In the Brazilian context cultural production appears
   to strengthen the amnesty framework (reconciliation) rather than to
   undermine or overcome it (mobilizing for punishment). The function of
   cultural and memory work is double-edged, requiring a close reading of
   both the portrayal of violence in each cultural work and the larger
   historical and political context of each country case.},

Abstract = {This article examines banking structural reforms introduced in the
   European Union (EU), placed in an international context. The concept of
   `regulatory cascading' is put forward to investigate how European
   policy-makers tackle complex multi-faceted problems, such as that of
   banks which are `too big to fail'. The article shows that partial
   solutions to the problem introduced in other areas of banking
   regulation, coupled with strategic activism at the domestic level by key
   EU member states have constrained the opportunities to design a coherent
   EU framework regulating bank structures. In response to the Commission's
   proposal for harmonised European banking structural reforms, the Council
   has stressed in its position two approaches that closely correspond to
   the measures adopted in France and Germany, on the one hand, and the UK,
   on the other hand. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

Abstract = {Since 2003, hundreds of open primaries for the selection of
   parliamentary candidates have been held by the British Conservative
   Party as a means of democratising party organisation and enhancing
   representativeness. In the run-up to the 2015 general election, only 26
   primaries could be identified. This article will apply the analytical
   framework provided by Hazan and Rahat to demonstrate that the relative
   failure of the experiment in terms of intra-party competition,
   participation, representation and responsiveness is counterbalanced by
   the benefits brought by this procedure, both as a tool of party branding
   at the national level and as a strategy for raising the profiles of
   candidates at the local level. Therefore, if mainstream parties conceded
   that the advantages of open primaries need not necessarily be understood
   in terms of internal democratisation but of party self-promotion, they
   would realise that open primaries could also serve as a means of
   preempting populism.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to review the recent incarnation of a long-standing
   engagement in international political economy (IPE) and critical theory
   between open Marxist perspectives (OMPs) and their critics. The article
   aims to identify the enduring relevance of this debate in order to think
   about the possibility and future of critical social inquiry in our time
   constructively. It criticises elements on both sides of the debate that
   no longer serve but rather hinder achieving this objective. We argue
   that the recent criticisms make a number of important constructive
   points that could help enhance the explanatory power of OMPs yet still
   portray the latter uncharitably. We propose to take the emphasis on
   openness in OMPs seriously as a scholarly and political orientation
   without immersing the debate with the charges of reductionism,
   instrumentalism, determinism and functionalism which are frequently
   raised by various versions of Marxism against one anotheroften to little
   avail.},

Abstract = {Implicit social pressure, applied via exposure to eyespots in
   nonpartisan, direct-mail blandishments to vote, has been shown using
   randomized field experiments to raise turnout in elections. Similar
   eyespot effects have been observed across a wide range of prosocial
   behaviors. A series of recent replications conducted by Matland and
   Murray (2016) have failed to consistently produce statistically
   significant eyespot effects on voter turnout, however, leading the
   authors to conclude the effects observed in previous research were
   likely illusory. In this article, I rebut this claim, arguing that an
   alternative, more circumspect interpretation of the authors' key results
   points to a different conclusion that supports the notion that eyespots
   likely stimulate voting, especially when taken together with previous
   findings.},

Abstract = {Research in evolutionary biology and neuroscience has recently entered a
   domain previously the preserve of philosophers: human morality and
   altruism. Save for a niche in empirical economics, such research has
   been widely neglected by social scientists. This article examines recent
   advances in life sciences to reconsider traditional explanations
   regarding donors' motives in granting official development assistance
   (ODA). Foreign aid has been remarkably persistent over the past four
   decades among industrialised countries and it is expanding in emerging
   economies, despite significant criticism surrounding its underlying
   motives and somewhat disappointing return on investment. Traditional
   international relations (IR) and economic models fall short of
   explaining the emergence, persistence and extension of ODA. Drawing on
   research on altruism in other disciplines, we build an empirical model
   and test the nature-vs-nurture arguments with a view to explaining ODA
   levels and variation over time. The results lend slightly clearer
   support to the nature than the nurture argument or to altruism as
   hardwired rather than the product of cultural traits and call for
   further interdisciplinary research including evolutionary biology and
   neurology to examine typical issues of interest in IR and development
   studies such as the determinants of ODA levels and variation.},

Abstract = {The past decades have seen a dramatic increase in the number of
   regulatory agencies ( RAs) across countries and policy domains. To
   establish credible regulatory regimes, many RAs are formally shielded
   from direct political influence and thus enjoy high levels of legal
   autonomy. While granting formal independence to an agency may erect some
   institutional barriers to politicization, it also generates a strong
   incentive to appoint ideologically likeminded individuals to the agency
   leadership. An analysis of about 700 top-level appointments to over 100
   RAs in 16 West European countries between 1996 and 2013 shows that
   individuals with ties to a government party are much more likely to be
   appointed as formal agency independence increases. Higher levels of
   legal independence are thus associated with greater party
   politicization-a finding that casts doubt on the effectiveness of formal
   independence as a tool to reduce political influence in RAs.},

Abstract = {The public versus private nature of organizations influences their
   goals, processes, and employee values. However, existing studies have
   not analyzed whether and how the public nature of organizations shapes
   their responses to concrete social pressures. This article takes a first
   step toward addressing this gap by comparing the communication
   strategies of public organizations and businesses in response to
   large-scale social protests. Specifically, we conceptualize, theorize,
   and empirically analyze the communication strategies of 100
   organizations in response to large-scale social protests that took place
   in Israel during 2011. We find that in response to these protests,
   public organizations tended to employ a positive-visibility strategy,
   whereas businesses were inclined to keep a low public profile. We
   associate these different communication strategies with the relatively
   benign consequences of large-scale social protests for public
   organizations compared with their high costs for businesses.},

Abstract = {Sanctions are designed to reduce the amount of resources available to
   the targeted actor and have the potential to be an effective tool for
   bringing disputing sides in a civil conflict to the bargaining table by
   altering incentives for continued fighting. Thus, there is reason to
   believe that sanctions can shorten the duration of civil conflicts.
   However, once sides in a conflict have moved to the use of violence to
   settle their dispute, it is hard for sanctions, in isolation, to impose
   enough cost to convince warring factions that settling a conflict has
   greater value than what could be expected from continued fighting. In
   this article, we argue that sanctions, in isolation, are unlikely to
   affect the duration of civil conflicts. However, when sanctions are
   combined with military interventions they can contribute to conflict
   management strategies resulting in shorter civil conflicts. We test our
   expectations empirically using data on civil conflicts from the Uppsala
   Conflict Data Program Armed Conflict Database and data on economic
   sanctions from the Threat and Imposition of Economic Sanctions Database.
   Our results suggest that the best hope for sanctions to shorten the
   duration of civil conflicts is if they are used as part of a
   comprehensive international response that includes institutional
   sanctions and military interventions.},

Abstract = {This study offers an empirical test of the effect of decentralisation on
   political trust. A comparative analysis of citizens in 47 countries
   suggests indirect and heterogeneous consequences of decentralisation.
   First, while various dimensions of decentralisation are significantly
   associated with political trust at the country level, no dimension has a
   direct effect on political trust at the individual level. Second, not
   all forms of decentralisation contribute to the promotion of political
   trust. And, finally, two dimensions of decentralisation (that is, fiscal
   and administrative) promote political trust through reducing the
   negative effect of democratic values.},

Abstract = {The intensification of the international migration flows sent by
   developing countries and received by developed countries is `reshaping'
   the aid map of the 21st century. However, to date the influence of
   immigration on the geographical distribution of aid has been little
   studied. This paper proposes a general framework for analysing the
   extent to which immigration flows affect the allocation of Official
   Development Assistance (ODA). We apply this model to the case of Spain
   (a country that, in a short time, became one of the top-ten bilateral
   donors and one of the main recipients of immigration in Europe) during
   the period from 1998 to 2009 (prior to the current economic crisis,
   which has slowed down the immigration flows temporarily and reduced the
   ODA budget drastically). The estimations reveal that immigration is
   relevant both to the selection of aid partners, and to the allocation of
   aid quotas, thus `reshaping' the geographical strategy of Spain's public
   aid.},

Abstract = {The domestic far-right movement has existed in the United States for
   many years. During that time, groups have appeared, disappeared, and
   reappeared. Unfortunately, very little is known about what causes these
   groups to disband. Prior research has focused on long-lived groups, but
   the majority of extremist or terrorist groups fail to survive for an
   extended period of time. This study examined a variety of external and
   internal correlates of organizational death identified from both
   terrorism and organizational literature, to empirically test which
   correlates lead to a group dying young.},

Abstract = {As postindustrial societies become more dependent on technology, they
   also become encumbered by greater risk. With the mounting news reports
   of cyberattacks, a common reaction to these technology-based hazards is
   anxiety. Whether anxiety enhances or erodes information processing is a
   topic of debate in previous literature, and equally uncertain is whether
   mass anxiety facilitates or hobbles the public's ability to contemplate
   current events. In light of three theoretical models in the basic
   research of anxiety, we hypothesized that (1) anxious participants are
   less able to recall the information in a news report of cyberattack than
   their nonanxious counterparts, (2) they become increasingly inept at
   recalling the details as the storyline unfolds, and (3) this impairment
   is unique to anxiety. Participants in Study 1 (130 college students) and
   Study 2 (392 American adults) viewed a news story of a cyberattack and
   then reported their emotional states and their levels of understanding
   of the various parts of the report-except that the anxiety in Study 1
   was naturalistic, and in Study 2, experimentally manipulated. Results
   from both studies showed that anxiety undermined recall performance. In
   addition, Study 1 found that the recall was worse towards the middle and
   the end of the news story and that other emotions were not significantly
   associated with memory deficit. Anxiety is discussed as a barrier for
   the public to stay informed about cyberattacks.},

Abstract = {In exploring wars and conflicts, Critical Security Studies and Feminist
   International Relations (IR) use various methodologies, including
   nontraditional avenues of inquiry. This study follows these theoretical
   and methodological perspectives and suggests a methodology that will
   contribute to contemporary debates in IR. Specifically, the study offers
   an innovative application of Carol Gilligan's method, the ``Listening
   Guide{''} (LG). The research demonstrates the utility of the LG analysis
   in uncovering additional forms of knowledge regarding armed conflicts.
   The context for analysis is women in combat. The implementation of the
   LG assists us in uncovering various voices, representing different
   aspects of the women combatants' experiences in a conflict zone. In this
   study, this analytical tool, applied to conduct narrative research,
   enabled the researchers to hear both multiple and silenced voices. We
   suggest that this methodology should continue to be used in future
   studies and incorporated into the Security Studies and IR toolkit.},

Abstract = {This article argues that, as wage work has become more precarious, the
   importance of the household in the livelihood strategies of precarious
   South African workers has increased. The shifting importance of the
   household in relation to the workplace in the economic lives of workers
   has implications for the political strategies that these workers adopt.
   The article draws on data from a national household survey combined with
   insights from the author's fieldwork across rural and urban sites in
   South Africa. It contributes to the growing literature on the politics
   of precarious work in the global South.},

Abstract = {This article offers an analysis of the cooperation between the European
   Union (EU) and the United States on customs security in the context of
   the two actors' fight against terrorism. While other aspects of EU-U.S.
   counterterrorism cooperation have received some scholarly attention, not
   so much research has focused on security cooperation in the EU-U.S.
   customs and supply chain. To investigate the emergence of transatlantic
   cooperation in this field this article employs regime theory in
   examining the 2004 EU-U.S. customs security agreement, the 2012 EU-U.S.
   mutual recognition decision, and the transatlantic disagreement on the

Abstract = {This article applies recent advances in network analysis to highlight a
   central tension faced by policymakers - balancing the benefits of
   engaging with the international system and the associated domestic
   policy costs. International trade rewards certain domestic practices,
   such as respect for human rights. Enforcing such practices, however, is
   politically costly and sometimes prohibitive to state leaders who rely
   on political repression to stay in power. In such cases, domestic elites
   often resort to an alternative strategy of securing the benefits of
   international trade - setting up indirect trade channels through
   intermediary states. These competing incentives are modeled within a
   single framework using a formal network game in which states form
   trade-links (direct or indirect) with other states, while simultaneously
   choosing their optimal level of domestic human rights protections. The
   model suggests that there may be an inverse relationship between a
   state's embeddedness within a network of indirect trade and respect for
   human rights: indirect trade channels serve as loopholes that allow
   domestically troubled states to enjoy the benefits of trade without
   pressure for domestic improvement. The predictions are supported by the
   results of the empirical analyses of the international trade and
   repression data (1987-2000), conducted using a coevolutionary
   actor-oriented longitudinal-network model - a statistical estimator that
   closely mimics the theoretical model.},

Abstract = {Using a large sample of articles and books published between 2012 and
   2015, this review shows the recent trends in environmental politics and
   policy scholarship. Environmental policy scholarship has embraced the
   concept of governance to explain the variety of actors and institutions
   that surround environmental problems and solutions. Scholars in the past
   three years used theories and methods to capture these governing
   dynamics in far-reaching and complicated issues like climate change.
   This article discusses recent patterns in the literature and
   demonstrates that new methods, recent theoretical focuses, and even the
   environmental issues covered by scholars reflect the field's
   acknowledgement that scholars can and should account for complexity in
   their work. However, the literature has neglected certain regions and
   processes, such as the developing world and policy feedback processes,
   leaving significant gaps in our understanding.},

Abstract = {Despite growing asymmetry in material capabilities, Russia has not
   decided to hedge against China On the contrary, as has been particularly
   visible in the aftermath of the 2014 Ukrainian crisis, Russia turned to
   China not only for political but also economic support. This article
   argues that Moscow's adaptation to China's pre-eminence has its roots in
   the 2008-2009 global economic crisis and has been accompanied by
   Beijing's self-restraint in its dealings with Russia. The ever-growing
   power imbalance did not prevent Moscow from closer co-operation with
   Beijing. Both states forged an energy partnership and deepened their
   security collaboration encompassing a revival of Russian arms export to
   China. Self-restraint, on the one side, and adaptation, on the other,
   made it possible to avoid conflict in Central Asia, where both actors
   have potentially incompatible interests and pursue competing projects.
   In the global realm, the strategies of both states towards the US
   converged.},

Abstract = {Scrutiny of the legal elements of international criminal tribunals such
   as the ICTY are frequent and important, but this article suggests that
   new avenues need to be taken in order to truly understand what is taking
   place within the courtroom sociologically. Embedded within courtroom
   interactions are symbolic exchanges that can stand as both reflections
   of and implications for the success or failure of transitional justice
   as a tool to promote community understanding post-conflict. Using a
   mixture of social psychology and cognitive linguistics, this article
   examines the significance of in-court references to memory, theorising
   that the concepts of remembering and forgetting as discussed in
   transcripts reveal greater struggles between the witnesses and the court
   over narrative control. This ultimately raises questions about the
   nature of the relationship between international legal bodies and the
   individual victim-witness, and demonstrates that there are failings
   occurring here that could make processes of reconciliation and community
   healing more difficult.},

Abstract = {Despite legal reforms, Nepali widows face barriers in exercising their
   property rights. This article provides a qualitative perspective on
   Nepali widows' understanding of their rights and their ability to pursue
   legal entitlements due to widowhood. In-depth interviews and focus
   groups were conducted with seventy-six Nepali widows, four paralegals,
   and three key informants. They demonstrate that widows have limited
   success in exercising their property rights and seeking government
   benefits primarily because of a dominant patriarchal society, familial
   traditions, and bureaucratic restrictions. Nepali widows' continued
   denial of property constitutes a human rights violation that Nepal's new
   government should seek to redress.},

Abstract = {The major terrorist attacks in Western countries during the last fifteen
   years have had consequences way beyond the countries in which they have
   happened. The article provides a primary source-based account of the
   development of counterterrorism policy in Finland, which is one of those
   countries with a low national threat level. The article demonstrates the
   significant role that international pressure, through obligations,
   recommendations, and social learning, plays in developing national
   counterterrorist policies. The article calls also into question whether
   the pressure to comply with international pressure always contributes
   toward sound national counterterrorism policies that foster political
   resilience to terrorism.},

Abstract = {The terms Deep Web, Deep Net, Invisible Web, or Dark Web refer to the
   content on the World Wide Web that is not indexed by standard search
   engines. One can describe the Internet as composed of layers: the upper
   layer, or the Surface Web, can easily be accessed by regular searches.
   However, deeper layers, the content of the Deep Web, have not been
   indexed by traditional search engines such as Google. Michael K. Bergman
   who wrote the seminal paper on the Deep Web, compared searching the
   Internet to dragging a net across the surface of the ocean: a great deal
   may be caught in the net, but there is a wealth of information that is
   deeper and therefore missed. In fact, most of the Web's information is
   buried far down on sites, and standard search engines are unable to
   access it.},

Title = {US nuclear weapons and non-proliferation: Is there a link?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {53},
Number = {2},
Pages = {166-179},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {According to a widespread conventional wisdom, there is a link between
   US nuclear weapons and nuclear proliferation and, therefore, in order to
   prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to other states, the US government
   must first make changes to its own nuclear arsenal. This article
   challenges the notion that US nuclear posture has a significant bearing
   on the proliferation and non-proliferation behavior of other states.
   Contrary to the received wisdom in policy circles, this article
   maintains that state decisions on nuclear non-proliferation issues are
   driven by a range of other security, economic, and political factors
   and, once these considerations are taken into account, there is little
   if any remaining variance to be explained by US nuclear posture. Using a
   dataset on US nuclear arsenal size from 1945 to 2011, this article
   examines the relationship between the size of the US nuclear arsenal and
   a variety of nuclear non-proliferation outcomes. It finds that there is
   no evidence of a relationship between the size of the US arsenal and:
   the exploration, pursuit, or acquisition of nuclear weapons by other
   states; the provision of sensitive nuclear assistance to non-nuclear
   weapon states; and voting on non-proliferation issues in the United
   Nations Security Council. The results are robust to alternate
   conceptualizations and measurements of US nuclear weapons and in various
   subsamples of data. This article breaks new ground on an empirical
   research agenda on how the nuclear policies and postures of the major
   nuclear powers affect the spread of nuclear weapons and has important
   implications for nuclear security policy.},

Volume = {94},

Abstract = {The existing literature explains the emergence of European regulatory
   networks through the need for regulatory coordination and the battle for
   power between policy makers. Bringing together the Europeanization and
   policy feedback perspectives, this article suggests that European
   regulatory networks should also be seen as the result of a more complex
   process of mutual influence between the European and the national
   levels. An in-depth case study on the telecommunications sector reveals
   that the implementation of EU policies has contributed to the
   empowerment of national regulatory agencies, which, in turn, has
   conditioned the development of European regulatory networks. EU policy
   has thus indirectly conditioned the rise of European regulatory networks
   by previously transforming national administrations. Besides expanding
   our understanding of European regulatory networks, by bridging the
   Europeanization and policy feedback literatures, this article indicates
   promising orientations for future theoretical development in both
   fields.},

   trends related to the emerging powers and the idea of dialogue of
   civilizations. My starting point is to understand multipolarity as part
   of a broader epoch making process of transformation of contemporary
   international society beyond its Western-centric matrix. In the first
   part of this article, I therefore argue for an analytical understanding
   that emphasizes the emergence of a new multipolar world of
   civilizational politics and multiple modernities. In the second part of
   the article, I reflect on how to counter the risk inherent in the
   potential antagonistic logic of multipolarity by critically engaging the
   normative Huntingtonian construction of a multicivilizational-multipolar
   world order. I argue that the link between dialogue of civilizations and
   regionalism could represent a critical issue for the future of global
   peace. In particular, multiculturally constituted processes of regional
   integration are antidotes to the possible negative politicization of
   cultural differences on a global scale and can contribute to the
   emergence of a new cross-cultural jus gentium. These elements are
   critical to the construction of a realistic dialogue of civilizations in
   international relations while preventing the risks inherent in its
   growing multipolar configuration. They shape what, drawing on Amitav
   Acharya's work, could be named a multicivilizational-multiplex world
   order.},

Abstract = {The accession of post-communist states into the Council of Europe system
   enlarged greatly the territory of effective protection of human rights
   in Europe and at the same time compelled the European Court of Human
   Rights to address the current effects of past violations of human rights
   by communist regimes. It gave the Court an opportunity to establish a
   legal standard of how to deal with matters such as the public presence
   of communist symbols and insignia, de-registration of neo-Communist
   parties, and the relevance of past membership in the Communist parties
   for an exercise of electoral rights in a newly democratized state. This
   opportunity was at the same time a challenge, and the Court was less
   than successful in meeting this challenge, despite the fact that it had
   already established the relevant legal standards when deciding about the
   cases triggered by the Nazi past. Without making it explicit, and
   without articulating openly the relevant differences, the Court has not
   established any equivalence between legal treatments of the aftermath of
   the two types of criminal regimes in the European recent past. The
   article discusses three recent cases belonging to these categories and
   concludes that there is a clear contrast between the Court's treatment
   of ``post-ommunist{''} cases and the same Court's earlier treatment of
   equivalent ``post-Nazi{''} cases; the article offers some explanations
   for the discrepancy which reflects a broader dualism in European
   collective memory of the past.},

Abstract = {In view of Turkey's increasing distance from the European Union (EU),
   the continued partial alignment with EU standards is often attributed
   either to domestic factors, or to diffusion processes induced by
   external actors other than the EU. However, based on interviews with
   officials from Turkey and the European Commission on recent reforms in
   migration policy, this article argues that two factors are responsible
   for continued EU influence on policy processes. First, the EU is still
   able to set incentives for compliance. Second, the instrument for
   pre-accession assistance has an impact that goes beyond that of a mere
   facilitator of domestically defined interests.},

Abstract = {This study discusses the dynamics of de-Europeanisation and the changing
   impact of Europe on the politically mobilised civil society involved in
   the public debates concerning Turkey's Kurdish question. The article
   first critically assesses how and in what ways the legal and
   constitutional reforms on the freedom of assembly required by the
   European Union (EU) changed the political structure in which civil
   society organisations (CSOs) operate in Turkey. It then examines the
   views of CSOs on the potential roles and limitations of the EU in the
   Kurdish question and the peace process which lasted between March 2013
   and July 2015. It also delineates the reasons why the political context
   of Europeanisation is not seen as instrumental by these CSOs to framing
   and justifying their arguments.},

Abstract = {By the end of the 1980s, very different meanings of `global change'
   existed, promoted by different constituencies in the social and natural
   sciences (Price 1989). One could be described as anthropocentric,
   emphasizing the interactions between people and their institutions,
   primarily at scales extending to decades. This chapter presents and
   discusses the emergence of initiatives for research on the human
   dimensions of global change until the 1996 launch of the International
   Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP). In
   1987, the International Social Science Council (ISSC) joined with IFIAS
   and UNU to develop a Human Response to Global Change Programme. In 1990,
   ISSC launched the Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change
   Programme (HDP), based on the ``Framework for Research on HDGEC{''}
   (Jacobson/Price 1990), identifying seven broad areas in which research
   should be done. The first half of the 1990s were also characterized by
   the emergence and development of various national and regional (e.g.,
   European) initiatives for research on HDGEC. In the subsequent two
   decades, as described elsewhere in this book, substantial advances have
   been made; many of them emerged from the initiatives described in this
   chapter.},

Pages = {392-404},
Abstract = {Governance in contemporary China presents external analysts with a
   number of challenges, the most significant of which is how to use
   general political science models to adequately conceptualize the
   Communist Party of China-a hybrid force that aims to cover all possible
   political territory in the People's Republic and perform a function
   which is more extensive and yet more abstract than political parties in
   liberal democratic systems. Using the three areas of government
   modernization referred to by Francis Fukuyama-the state, rule of law and
   accountability-this essay looks at the ways in which the Communist Party
   has engaged in a progress of partial reform, tactically conceding space
   for other actors in some areas, while maintaining control of the core
   issue for control-political organization and the articulation of broad
   overarching goals for Chinese society, and how it has attempted to do
   something unique-create a modern, developed, market economy while still
   being governed by a Communist Party exercising a monopoly on power.},

Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {774-794},
Abstract = {This article evaluates the effects of terrorism on interventions into
   civil wars. Considering civil wars from 1970-1999, this study analyzes
   how the use of terrorism as a tactic affects external interventions on
   behalf of opposition groups, interventions on behalf of governments, and
   diplomatic interventions. While some authors would suggest that groups
   might utilize terrorism as a tactic to gain external support, this study
   finds little evidence that groups are actually successful in gaining
   such support. In fact, terrorism that targets civilians appears to
   actually decrease the likelihood of military interventions on behalf of
   opposition groups. Furthermore, in civil wars with high numbers of
   terrorist attacks there is a greater likelihood of economic intervention
   on behalf of governments, further weakening the potential benefit for
   groups in utilizing terrorism as a tactic. While this is certainly a
   welcome finding, a consideration of five case studies of suicide
   terrorism (Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Iraq, India, and Turkey) provides
   evidence that the use of suicide terrorism within civil wars may have
   decreased the likelihood of external interventions on behalf of the
   government and of diplomatic interventions. These results are more
   troubling and suggest potentially grave consequences for mediating many
   of these conflicts.},

Journal = {PHILIPPINE POLITICAL SCIENCE JOURNAL},

Pages = {167-189},
Abstract = {Intergovernmental fiscal transfer (IFT) is one of the ways in which
   local government units (LGUs) source their funds. In the Philippines,
   the most common IFT is a lump-sum grant called the Internal Revenue
   Allotment (IRA). Empirical studies show that the unconditional lumpsum
   grant is the IFT type that stimulates spending the least. Using data
   from Philippine cities, this paper finds evidence that total city
   government expenditures is positively associated with IRA. A one peso
   increase in IRA is associated with an almost unitary peso increase in
   city government expenditures. This estimate is much higher than the
   result of most similar empirical studies using data from other
   countries. Moreover, this relationship varies according to the capacity
   of the local government to generate its own funds. IRA has a smaller
   marginal effect on local government spending for LGUs with more locally
   sourced revenues. Furthermore, not all components of local government
   spending are affected by the IRA. Results also suggest that different
   income sources have different marginal effects on spending.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the recent autonomy movement in Santa Cruz,
   Bolivia, within a theoretical framework typically reserved for `ethnic'
   political or social movements. The paper begins with a brief chronology
   of the Santa Cruz autonomia movement as it developed into a powerful
   political oppositional movement during the rise of Evo Morales. In doing
   so, the movement's leaders consciously adopted the organizational
   tactics and forms of discourse typically identified with traditional,
   indigenous-popular Bolivian social movements. As such, the Santa Cruz
   case both highlights the fluidity of multiculturalism and challenges our
   notions of how ethnic identity is publicly constructed.},

Title = {The impotence of conventional arms control: why do international regimes
   fail when they are most needed?},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},

Pages = {200-222},
Abstract = {Amid tensions with the West over Ukraine, Russia pulled out of the
   Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe in March 2015. The Russian
   case is another example of a country disengaging from conventional arms
   control when relations with other member states deteriorate. This raises
   an important question: can arms control regimes aimed at preventing
   conflict survive periods of tension and preserve peace? This article
   argues no. It demonstrates that the prospect and stability of
   conventional arms control regimes depend on healthy international
   relations. In times of tension, governments rely on military
   institutions for advice and absorb military biases incompatible with
   arms control. Therefore, these regimes fail when most needed and are
   impotent as instruments of peace. Beyond conventional arms control, the
   article hints at the fragility of nuclear agreements such as the 2015
   Iran deal and the 2010 New START between the United States and Russia.},

Title = {Adding peacekeepers to the debates of critical liberal peacebuilding:
   new insights from the perspective of peacekeeping training in Africa},
Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Pages = {231-246},
Abstract = {This article expands upon the theoretical discussions within the
   critical liberal peacebuilding scholarship through the introduction of
   peacekeeping training to these debates. As an under-explored aspect of
   international peace efforts, the article, while guided by the overall
   question of whether or not the concepts of `hybrid peace' and `recourse
   to localism' can be operationalised, argues that bringing the
   peacekeepers and their training back in is critical to these debates.
   Exploring the training efforts of the Kofi Annan International
   Peacekeeping Training Centre (KAIPTC) and the African Centre for the
   Constructive Resolution of Disputes (ACCORD), I show that these training
   providers are faced with the overwhelming challenge of addressing the
   complexities of today's peace support operations, while providing scope
   for active learning methods. Based on the training realities on the
   ground at KAIPTC and ACCORD I draw a picture of what these realities
   reveal with regard to the obstacles on the path of operationalising the
   concepts of `hybrid peace' and `recourse to localism'.},

Abstract = {Security sector reform (SSR) has never been undebatable mostly because
   of the lack of local ownership. The burgeoning literature on
   `infrastructures for peace' also stresses to `localise' the way
   peacebuilding is exercised. But aviation, migration, economic and cyber
   issues at present `deterritorialise' security - a fundamental pillar in
   peacebuilding. This article reviews SSR experiences in 10 postwar
   countries and explores the determinants of outcomes. It then examines
   the potentials in the `infrastructures for peace' concept to complement
   or substitute such outcomes. It locates the determinants in three
   echelons: subject, peripheral and ideational context. Against the
   background of previous studies that concentrate on subject and
   ideational contexts, this article brings peripheral context into
   analysis that includes the power structures and international political
   contexts. Because security restructuring is not viable merely with
   informal infrastructures for peace, the article suggests such
   architectures need to rise above local boundaries to negotiate on
   security issues transnationally.},

Volume = {4},

Pages = {194-209},
Abstract = {The article seeks to theorise an integrated decolonised feminist frame
   for peacebuilding in an African context. Arguing that a
   decolonial-feminist lens has the potential to change the way we look at
   peacebuilding practices, I propose the notion of `feminist frontiers' -
   an engaged yet stabilising heuristic tool for analysing racialised and
   gendered relations post-conflict. The argument is structured around
   three pillars, namely: metageographies as metaphoric mental-space
   constructions of a colonial peace; masks that constrain the introduction
   of complicated and intersected human subjecthoods; and mundane matter
   that elicits ambivalent engagements between human and post-human
   subjectivities in the areas of everyday political economies and
   infrastructural rule of peacebuilding. I conclude that such feminist
   frontiers represent intermediate and mediated spaces or epistemological
   borderlands from where the undertheorised and empirically understudied
   discursive and material dimensions of peacebuilding from a gender
   perspective can be investigated.},

Abstract = {The EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and Common Security
   and Defence Policy (CSDP) occupy a unique space in EU governance. Both
   policies have supranational elements, yet their formally
   intergovernmental status shields them from the increased scrutiny powers
   granted to national parliaments after Lisbon. National parliamentary
   scrutiny of these policy areas has thus received relatively little
   attention. Using an analytical framework of `authority ability and
   attitude', this paper argues that attitude, meaning MPs' willingness to
   scrutinise CFSP, is the most important factor in explaining the
   empirical variation in the quantity and quality of national
   parliamentary scrutiny of CFSP Drawing on qualitative research and
   interviews conducted as part of the OPAL project, the paper demonstrates
   that formal powers do not, in practice, equate to `strong' scrutiny,
   arguing that the strongest parliaments are those that make CFSP scrutiny
   a systematic, normalised and culturally accepted part of
   parliamentarians' everyday work.},

Abstract = {Through an analysis of climate policy-making in the European Commission
   (EU), this article argues that co-ordination in the Commission displays
   the same characteristics as the co-ordination across ministries in
   central governments, i.e., the properties of negative co-ordination. The
   article is based on a survey among Commission officials. Overall, the
   article reveals that a public administration perspective on the
   Commission proves invaluable to gain insights on how decisions are made
   at the European Union level. The article contributes to the emerging
   literature viewing the Commission as an ordinary bureaucracy - as
   opposed to a unique supranational organization.},

Abstract = {Different sources indicate signals that our current economic ideas no
   longer function. New ways of organizing are emerging in which
   sustainability is often central. This chapter presents the results of
   exploratory research initiated by Radboud University Nijmegen on new
   business models (NBMs). The research demonstrates that NBMs appear to be
   `hot' and `happening'. But what is a business model and in what sense is
   it sustainable? This study focuses on business models that create
   so-called `multiple value(s)', which refers to a way of organizing that
   not only focuses on the task of organization itself, but also on
   organization between organizations-or better: organizing entities. This
   approach to organizing generates social and ecological value, in
   addition to economic value. For the purpose of this research, a series
   of interviews were conducted in order to gain insight into the
   phenomenon of NBMs. The aim was to combine this fresh empirical evidence
   with theoretical underpinnings from previous scholarship in order to
   explore the field, discover the nature of NBMs, their features, and how
   they function in (micro-)practice. Ultimately, this examination revealed
   the phenomenon of an altered balance between the simultaneous
   organization of different values such as nature, care, attention, and
   money. While many roads lead to interesting discoveries with respect to
   these aspects, and the research is still at an early stage, the first
   results from the study indicate some initial clear common denominators
   emerging from this journey. These preliminary findings suggest that
   early NBMs can be generally categorized into different streams based on
   the practice of sharing, trading, and creating. Most significantly, the
   results indicate that the ability to connect holds increasing social and
   economic value, and that these connections create all sorts of new
   consortia and constituent configurations.},

Title = {A Gender Perspective on State Support for Crime Victims in Switzerland},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {128-140},
Abstract = {Since the mid-twentieth century, the effects of violence and crime on
   the victim have become an increasingly important topic. In Switzerland,
   men and boys are affected by criminal acts of violence recorded by the
   police to a similar extent as women and girls. The Victims of Crime Act
   (VCA; Opferhilfegesetz, OHG), in place since 1993, treats men and women
   equally. It guarantees free legal, medical, psychological and social
   counselling, as well as some financial compensation, for victims of
   violent crime. However, male victims of violence are clearly
   underrepresented in victim support. This article seeks explanations: it
   first looks at the extent of reported and not-reported criminal acts to
   explain the differences. The review of the literature suggests that
   ``being victim{''}is linked to ``femininity{''}. This leads to the
   elaboration of a theoretical framework on the gender-regime in this
   field. The main argument is that institutions treat ``being a
   victim{''}differently for men and women and that the consequences of
   being a victim are different for men and women. To analyse the argument,
   we carry out a discourse-analytical study on how the social negotiation
   processes of ``becoming a victim{''}take place. We find that victimised
   men and women differ in the manner and extent to which they are
   construed as victims in these negotiation processes. This affects the
   way victim support is organized and entails manifest effects regarding
   use of victim support and the expected clientele counselling services.},

Pages = {455-471},
Abstract = {There is no disagreement that during the crisis the EMU has gone through
   an institutional change. However, there is no agreement concerning the
   type of change and its drivers. This article focuses on the impact of
   the ECB's unconventional policies on the EMU at large. The article draws
   on the historical institutional theory of gradual change, and argues
   that the ECBs policies led to processes of conversion and displacement
   in the EMU. The article concludes, therefore, that during the crisis the
   EMU was not simply `completed' but it had its institutional path
   altered.},

Abstract = {The notions of ``international system{''} and ``international

   exposing what we call, following Johannes Fabian, the ``denial of
   coevalness{''} of alternative worlds and theories. We do so by turning
   to three different articulations of and responses to the colonial
   encounter.},

Journal = {AFRICAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {115},
Number = {458},
Pages = {73-96},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In 2014, the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) government in Tanzania decided to
   discontinue the market-based system for textbook provision that was
   established in the early 1990s and revert to full state control. Drawing
   on the theory of political settlements and the literature on Tanzania's
   industrial politics, the article examines the political economy of
   textbook provision in this country in order to generate new insights
   into the relations between the educational, political, and economic
   spheres. It shows how donor ideology and practices, while subjecting
   textbooks to generic market principles, also promoted the interests of
   Western publishing corporations. It then argues that the distribution of
   power within the state, and the ambiguous relations between the CCM
   ruling elites, bureaucrats, and the capitalist class, prevented the
   consolidation of a textbook industrial policy geared towards supporting
   the local publishing industry. Finally, the article explores elites'
   diverse corrupt practices to capture public funding for textbooks at the
   national and local levels. Under Tanzania's country-specific political
   settlement, the textbook sector, far from primarily serving educational
   goals, has indeed been reduced to a vast site of primitive accumulation.},

Abstract = {A statutory minimum wage has been introduced in Germany, in the face of
   business opposition but abetted by union support. The political
   coalition in favour of minimum wage regulation brought together the
   centre-left and the centre-right with the argument that regulation is
   needed to prevent disfunctional interaction between low wages and the
   social security system. Thus, the dualization which characterizes
   Germany's inegalitarian form of coordinated capitalism has provoked a
   corrective political response. The contribution traces the long path to
   government intervention and assesses why employers were unable, or
   unwilling, to pre-empt intervention by maintaining the coverage of
   collective bargaining. It is argued that market liberalization has had a
   paradoxical effect on employer power: intense domestic as well as
   international competition has reduced employers' capacity to act
   strategically to fend off regulation by the government.},

Abstract = {The role of norms and military utility in the use of weapons is disputed
   by constructivist and realist scholars. Through an examination of US
   decision-making regarding anti-plant and irritant agents in the Vietnam
   War, I advance this debate in three key ways. First, I develop
   structural realism's expectations regarding the role of military
   utility. Second, I demonstrate that social and material factors are at
   play in our understandings of both `norms' and `military utility', and
   that both played a role in US decisions. Third, I find that the dominant
   role - as structural realism expects - was played by military utility.},

Abstract = {Environmental nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Australia have
   struggled to generate and sustain public concern about climate change.
   If debates about climate policy can be viewed as sites of contestation
   between competing actors, Australia's environmental NGOs have found it
   difficult to compete against countervailing forces that have sought to
   shape public attitudes to climate action and the contours of policy
   responses. While to a significant degree this reflects the power of
   those forces and the sentiments of the government of the day, there is
   also a case to be made that some of Australia's most prominent
   environmental NGOs have appeared wedded to strategies inconsistent with
   building or sustaining public support for action or guiding policy
   responses. How have Australia's largest environmental NGOs engaged
   climate politics, and why has this engagement taken that form? Pierre
   Bourdieu's political sociology provides unique insight for coming to
   terms with the multifaceted nature of the constraints, opportunities,
   and drivers of political action, from the context of climate politics to
   the forces behind Australian NGOs' engagement with that politics, and
   the limits of that engagement. Bourdieu's work also suggests possible
   avenues for more effective forms of political communication on climate
   change in the Australian context.},

Abstract = {This article describes and assesses the process of territorial and
   non-territorial devolution in Belgium. After providing a description of
   the linguistic structure of the country and the background that led to
   its transformation from a unitary consociational democracy to a federal
   one mixing forms of territorial and non-territorial autonomy, it
   provides an assessment of the functioning of non-territoriality in
   Brussels and its capacity to accommodate linguistic diversity and
   conflict. It concludes with an overall positive assessment, since the
   solution that was reached allowed linguistic conflict to be kept at a
   tolerable level and granted a substantial degree of autonomy to each
   linguistic community. Nevertheless, the Belgian case also points to some
   problems. First, non-territorial autonomy has mainly been based on a
   system of dual monolingualism rather than true bilingualism, and this
   has contributed to separation between the two communities and to the
   centrifugal forces unleashed since the linguistic territorialisation of
   Flanders and Wallonia. Second, because of the coexistence of territorial
   and non-territorial autonomy, the definition of the border of the
   non-territorial area has been problematic and contested. This has
   favoured the persistence of conflict, though concentrated on the border
   between the two areas; but it has not escalated into expressions of
   violence.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {446-463},
Abstract = {The notion that ideas powerfully shape policies seems highly intuitive.
   How actors think about policy matters, and their thinking is not just a
   mechanistic function of uninterpreted conditions around them. Yet
   turning this intuition into clear claims about the influence of ideas is
   challenging. This contribution extracts guidelines from the growing
   literature on ideas to suggest how to best display four common kinds of
   intersections between ideas and context that make the ideas powerful. We
   can show that certain ideas gain influence because `believers' obtain
   power for unrelated reasons; because the ideas somehow empower actors to
   achieve power; because they make possible new coalitions of actors; or
   because they inform the crafting or retooling of institutions that
   matter. The essay highlights what some of the strongest literature on
   ideas does well and how it can become still more persuasive.},

Abstract = {This article provides findings from a detailed analysis concerning
   Anglo-American newspaper coverage of the conflicts in Bosnia (1992-1995)
   and Rwanda (1994). A comparison of the response to both crises evidences
   three things. First, Rwanda received less attention than Bosnia despite
   the former witnessing more deaths in a shorter time frame. Second, the
   violence was only of primary concern in specific instances with other
   issues, such as Western involvement, often being prioritised. Third, to
   varying degrees, the victims were often caricatured or otherwise
   marginalised. The findings therefore ask us to consider factors such as
   the qualitative nature of the violence, proximity of the violence, and
   perception of the victims when trying to interpret Anglo-American media
   responses to mass violence. It seems that genocide in itself is not
   always deemed important enough to warrant coverage, the implications of
   which need to be factored into future thinking on the Responsibility to
   Protect.},

   Montenegro passed the Law on State Symbols and the Day of Statehood,
   which proclaimed the anthem of Montenegro to be the song with the title
   `O svjetla majska zoro' ('Oh, the Radiant {[}Bright 1] Dawn of May').
   The law set out the prescribed words of the anthem (Zakon 2004). As we
   shall see, these lyrics have since been a matter of controversy. `O,
   svjetla majska zoro' is also the title and the first verse of an old
   Montenegrin folk song; whether its first published version is the one
   sung in a theatrical performance in 1863 (see below) is a matter of
   controversy too.},

Journal = {SOUTH EUROPEAN SOCIETY AND POLITICS},

Volume = {21},

Pages = {561-585},
Abstract = {After a stunning breakthrough in the 2014 European election, Podemos
   became the third largest parliamentary party in Spain in the 2016
   general election and achieved representation in all regions. This
   article examines how Podemos has adapted to the opportunities and
   dilemmas posed by Spain's multi-level setting in several ways: its
   formation in early 2014 and its evolution since; its ideological
   principles and policy menu; its organisation; and its political
   strategies and electoral alliances. The hypotheses test the effects of
   adaptation to multi-level competition on the party electorate. The
   findings indicate the positive effect of support for more
   decentralisation on the likelihood of voting for Podemos, but also how
   this effect is territorially differentiated and could affect the party's
   cohesion and internal debate.},

   place in the intellectual history of International Relations Theory, its
   contributions to interpreting Latin American international politics and
   its insights for the future. After revising the intellectual merits and
   tenets of the theory in the four initial sections, we show how it
   predicted the behavior of Latin American states under unipolarity.
   Finally, we review its implications for a world where China may hold
   economic primacy.},

   Climate Change},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},

Abstract = {Political communicators work under the assumption that information
   provision, such as framing, may influence audiences and elicit some
   desired attitudinal or behavioral shift. However, some political issues,
   such as climate change, have become polarized along party lines, with
   partisans seemingly impervious to disconfirming information. On these
   highly polarized issues, can framing sway partisans to moderate their
   positions, or are partisans so motivated in their issue stances that
   framing fails? Using a variety of vignettes, and Republican climate
   change skepticism as a case, this article reports an experiment of how
   partisans respond to counter-attitudinal framing on a sharply polarized
   issue. Results indicate that Republicans are resistant to frames that
   encourage support of governmental action or personal engagement against
   climate change. There is strong evidence of motivated skepticism, given
   widespread backfire (or `boomerang') effects and decreased attitudinal
   ambivalence following exposure to framing, suggesting that issue
   polarization may severely constrain attempts at communication.},

Abstract = {In response to corruption and inefficient state institutions in
   recipient countries, some foreign aid donors outsource the delivery of
   aid to nonstate development actors. Other donor governments continue to
   support state management of aid, seeking to strengthen recipient states.
   These cross-donor differences can be attributed in large measure to
   different national orientations about the appropriate role of the state
   in public service delivery. Countries that place a high premium on
   market efficiency (for example, the United States, United Kingdom,
   Sweden) will outsource aid delivery in poorly governed recipient
   countries to improve the likelihood that aid reaches the intended
   beneficiaries of services. In contrast, states whose political economies
   emphasize a strong state in service provision (for example, France,
   Germany, Japan) continue to support state provision. This argument is
   borne out by a variety of tests, including statistical analysis of
   dyadic time-series cross-section aid allocation data and
   individual-level survey data on a cross-national sample of senior
   foreign aid officials. To understand different aid policies, one needs
   to understand the political economies of donors.},

Abstract = {In 2006, the European Commission released its Global Europe
   Communication, in which it announced a shift from a multilateral to a
   bilateral trade strategy. One of the key pillars of this new strategy
   was to strengthen the bilateral trade relations with key Asian
   countries. In contrast to existing analyses that focus on European Union
   (EU) decision-makers' agency, we propose an explanation for this notable
   shift in the EU's trade policy that stresses the political role of
   import-dependent firms. In light of the increasing integration of such
   firms into global value chains, the article argues that a plausible case
   can be made, both theoretically and empirically, that import-dependent
   firms had a clear stake in the signing of preferential trade agreements
   between the EU and Asian countries and that their lobbying efforts
   significantly affected the EU's decision to start negotiations on such
   agreements with South Korea, India and Vietnam.},

Abstract = {The complicated and multi-layered policymaking process in the European
   Union presents private interests, such as business firms, with an
   interesting strategic choice of whom and how to lobby. As the costs of
   lobbying at the domestic level increase, firms are expected to, instead,
   devote their resources to lobbying at the European level. Specifically,
   this article examines how domestic access points and domestic
   partisanship affect the costs and benefits of lobbying at the domestic
   versus European level. Using data on firm-level decisions to lobby the
   EU, this research finds that in countries where is it more costly (or
   less beneficial) to lobby domestically, firms are more likely to lobby
   at the EU level.},

Abstract = {Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) are increasingly popular, yet little
   is known about their impact. This article investigates their influence
   on party choice, party loyalty and electoral participation, relying on a
   complex experiment conducted before and after the 2010 Hungarian
   election. Participants were directed to two VAAs, some received advice
   from one and some from both, while the control group visited none.
   According to subjective recollections, 7 per cent changed their vote
   intentions, but according to the panel study the VAAs were unable to
   direct users to specific parties. Sheer exposure to the advice did not
   have mobilising or demobilising effects either, but
   preference-confirming outputs increased party loyalty while
   preference-disconfirming recommendations decreased it, and double
   exposure amplified further the impact of the VAAs. Converging advice
   from two different sources increased the rate of electoral
   participation, but more by provoking, rather than by persuading, the
   users.},

Abstract = {Civic education can have a significant impact on democracy. This article
   offers evidence for this assertion by comparing the effects of the
   widely different choices made in the early 1990s by two post-communist
   countries: Poland and Hungary. Initially, the effects of civic education
   were confined to teenagers; later, as generational replacement started
   to have an effect, one can see an impact on the politics of the two
   countries. The success of civic education in Poland and its failure in
   Hungary is illustrated by the differences in young people's voting
   patterns: throughout the last decade, the vote of Polish youth has
   consistently been less authoritarian than the vote of older Poles,
   unlike in Hungary, where the pattern is reversed. Ultimately, these
   developments likely had an impact on democracy: one sees democratic
   progress in Poland and democratic regression in Hungary.},

Abstract = {This article explores a neglected aspect of the wider debate about EU
   enlargement: bilateral disputes between a member state and an applicant,
   where the former uses, or threatens to use its membership status to
   block the applicant's progress in order to resolve a bilateral dispute.
   Through analysis of three cases - Italy and Slovenia, Slovenia and
   Croatia, and Greece and Macedonia - we show that the EU's transformative
   power does not always flow outwards' towards the state seeking
   membership. This raises interesting questions about enlargement as a
   process of international bargaining between sovereign states filtered
   via a supranational entity formally responsible for negotiations. The
   cases suggest limits to the EU's transformative power in the context of
   disputes that are linked to the meaning and significance of borders. It
   is not surprising that the European Commission prefers disputes to be
   resolved bilaterally or via a third party.},

Abstract = {The article analyses the sources of local actors' legitimacy perceptions
   towards international peacebuilding operations. Local legitimacy
   perceptions are increasingly recognised as shaping local behaviour
   towards international peacebuilding, which influences the effective
   functioning of the operation. Legitimacy debates in peacebuilding are
   either absent or imported from the literature on domestic legitimacy,
   without respect to the specific temporal and spatial situation of
   international operations. The article first explores which legitimacy
   sources influence local legitimacy perceptions of international
   peacebuilding operations. It finds that two sources are relevant: output
   and procedure. Second, it investigates how exactly legitimacy arises
   from them. In doing so, it demonstrates that output and procedure are
   umbrella terms comprising several sub-elements which influence
   legitimacy in different, sometimes contradictory, ways. Finally, the
   article empirically explores which of the sources are important to local
   actors' legitimacy perceptions using field data from the EU
   peacebuilding operations EULEX in Kosovo and EUPM Bosnia-Herzegovina.},

Abstract = {There is growing interest in how genes affect political beliefs. To
   better understand the role of genes in politics, we examine the
   relationship between cognitive style (the need for cognition, the need
   for cognitive closure) and various measures of political attitudes
   (issue-based ideology, identity-based ideology, social ideology,
   economic ideology, authoritarianism, and egalitarianism). We show, for
   the first time, that the need for cognition and the need for cognitive
   closure are heritable and are linked to political ideology primarily,
   perhaps solely, because of shared genetic influences; these links are
   stronger for social than economic ideology. Although prior research
   demonstrated that Openness to Experience shares genetic variance with
   political ideology, we find that these measures of cognitive style
   account for distinct genetic variance in political ideology. Moreover,
   the genetic Openness-ideology link is fully accounted for by the need
   for cognition. This combination of findings provides a clearer
   understanding of the role of genes in political beliefs and suggests new
   directions for research on Big Five personality traits and ideology.},

Abstract = {The recent economic crisis has brought into focus how even open and
   highly interdependent economies in the European Union try to govern
   their economies according to territorially defined interests. The aim of
   this article is to examine an area, online gambling, with the
   technological and legal conditions that challenge approaches that favour
   economic patriotism. The article compares two cases, the United Kingdom
   and Italy, that represent two different models of economic governance to
   argue that they are similar in which interests they seek to protect and
   at which level.},

Abstract = {This study explores the local effects of internal armed conflict on
   postwar violent crime in Northern Ireland. It argues that exposure to
   wartime violence will lead to higher levels of violent crime in the
   aftermath of conflict. Particularly, it claims that exposure to violence
   committed by armed groups challenging the state (anti-government groups)
   will have this effect, as it erodes the legitimacy needed for local law
   enforcement agencies to function effectively. This, in turn, is expected
   to contribute to the emergence of a postwar public security gap that
   lowers opportunity costs to resort to violent crime for a range of local
   actors. To evaluate these propositions, spatial statistics on a
   subnational dataset covering war-related fatalities for the period
   1969-98 and police crime records for the postwar period 2002-06 are
   employed. The results indicate that the more an area has been exposed to
   violence, and the larger the proportion of this violence committed by
   anti-government groups, the more violent crime on the local level. This
   study hence contributes both to the burgeoning literature on the
   legacies of civil war and to recent research emphasizing the need to
   disaggregate non-state actors.},

Abstract = {Africa has often been defined and represented by outsiders. In
   International Studies (IS), the continent is frequently viewed as
   peripheral and uninteresting. This is clearly a problem, and an
   increasingly apparent one as the number of courses on Africa and IS
   grow, both in Africa and beyond. Many academics who run these courses
   are keen to challenge the continent's traditional marginalisation and
   perceived dependency; however, they are limited by the resources
   available to them and the fact that many are establishing new courses
   from scratch. This article contributes to the literature by identifying
   key debates around teaching Africa and IS, setting the scene for the
   articles that follow.},

Abstract = {Israel is increasingly the epicentre of Jewish peoplehood, shaping the
   lives of diaspora Jews as both an engine driving interconnectedness and
   a source of division. `Israelization' impacts diaspora Jews differently
   according to country of domicile. This article examines British Jewry,
   providing historical context and drawing on interviews to explore the
   community's shifting identity and culture. It argues that Britain
   represents a unique model between America and France. In America, where
   security is greater, Jewish ethnic ties are loosening, whereas in
   France, doubts over the Jewish community's future increase their focus
   on Israel. While British Jews experience hostility, they feel safer than
   in France. Flourishing British Jewish culture reflects commitment to
   multi-ethnic Britain, alongside loyalty to Israel. The dynamics of those
   loyalties are changing, however, with dissent against Israeli policies
   increasingly legitimised. We conclude that the Israelization of British
   Jewry is all encompassing, even while allowing for a thriving diaspora
   community.},

Abstract = {Performance measurement has an implicit performance theory embedded
   within its practice; performance measurement perforce performs.
   Performance measurement has a performative effect on performance.
   Drawing together and building on the various empirical observations from
   the preceding papers in this collection, this concluding paper firstly
   examines the circumstances in which performance measurement performs,
   that is, when it produces authentic' performance improvements, compared
   to when performance measurements misfire. The paper secondly explores
   several paradoxes of performance measurement - such that performance
   measurement measures only part of the performance it seeks to be
   performative on, incentives to perform incentivise poor performance and
   so on. These paradoxes, contradictions and ironies must be apprehended
   and appreciated in discovering, discerning and deciphering the diverse
   dynamics of measuring performance. They also demonstrate that analysing
   and working with performance measurement requires a perspective that
   eschews absolutes and clear directions, and embraces the uneasy and
   potentially destabilising tension of Escher's performative art.},

Title = {The world after Brexit: From British referendum to global adventure},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {53},
Number = {6},
Pages = {689-707},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The decision by a majority of the British people to leave the European
   Union was in turn shocking insofar as few experts saw the `Leave' camp
   winning, unprecedented insofar as no other country has ever tried to
   leave the European Union before, and deeply upsetting to the rest of the
   international community who with one notable exception had been banking
   on the UK staying inside the European Union. Interpreted by various
   pundits after the event as being either a revolt against globalisation,
   a rejection of an austerity regime that had left many on that proverbial
   trash heap of history, or quite simply a nativist rejection of all
   things foreign, there is little doubt that the consequences of what
   happened on June 23rd will be both long-lasting and potentially
   disturbing for the UK in particular and the rest of the world in
   general. But as this article seeks to show the decision itself, and the
   determination by the new British government to makes sure that ``Brexit
   means Brexit{''}, leaves nearly every question unanswered. It is of
   course perfectly reasonable to think of what has happened and might
   happen in the future as `events'. But it is by now becoming perfectly
   clear that the actual withdrawal of Britain from the EU itself will be
   less an event and more a process in which all manner of outcomes are
   possible. Indeed, as this article shows, the process will unfold through
   multiple overlapping negotiations, which will take place at various
   levels of policy making and involve numerous political actors. The
   outcome may possibly be the benign one forecast by the Leave campaign.
   On the other hand, there are plenty of opportunities for a breakdown in
   relations in UK politics, between the UK and the EU, and in European
   geopolitics with international implications. But whether this happens or
   not depends now on a series of complex negotiations. The purpose here is
   to discuss these in some detail identifying the main actors, the key
   issues and possible outcomes.},

Abstract = {In International Relations arguments about historical origins provoke
   theoretical debates, as origins assume an emergent theoretical unit of
   inquiry - an international order, system, society, etc. - while at the
   same time defining its core properties and dynamics. By boldly casting
   the long 19th century as the origin of global modernity and, in turn,
   the modern international order, Buzan and Lawson's The Global
   Transformation challenges the romance with Westphalia that undergirds so
   much of our theorizing. Yet, the contributions to this symposium push
   deeper than usual, challenging established ways of conceiving change,
   and suggesting very different models of proper theorizing. While all of
   the papers ostensibly debate large-scale systems change, three modes of
   change are in contention: breakpoint, evolutionary, and processual. The
   further one pushes towards the latter, however, the more elusive the
   idea of system' becomes, eroding the fundamental boundary condition that
   undergirds the systemic mode of theorizing that dominates the field.
   Similarly, a persistent theme in these contributions is Buzan and
   Lawson's purported failure to theorize change. But instead of offering
   rival theories, contributors advance very different conceptions of
   theorizing, from pre-observational conceptualization to causal
   explanation. This not only challenges the field to reflect more
   systematically on the process of theorizing, but to acknowledge forms of
   theorizing that it currently brackets.},

Abstract = {The article provides one of the first political economy accounts of the
   regulation of peer-to-peer (P2P) lending in the United Kingdom, drawing
   on interviews with platforms representing the vast majority of the
   market at the beginning of the regulatory process. The article links the
   regulation of P2P lending with debates about regulatory capture. It
   challenges conventional understandings of its consequences by showing
   how the regulation of P2P lending displays characteristics of regulatory
   capture but appears to have realised several aspects of regulators'
   visions for a `socially useful finance', rather than facilitating the
   kind of rent-seeking behaviour that has been identified in the case of
   other areas of finance. P2P lending is found to represent one of the
   latest forms of consumer and small business finance that works towards
   so-called `financial inclusion', with ambiguous social outcomes that
   necessitate further critical investigation.},

Abstract = {The civil war in El Salvador (1980-1992) resulted in the death of
   approximately 75,000 people, the vast majority killed by state and
   paramilitary forces. In the postwar era, the Museo de la Palabra y la
   Imagen in San Salvador promotes historical memory in order to denounce
   state violence and advance social justice. It departs from the historic
   role of museums in upholding ruling-class hegemony and offers a
   progressive model for disseminating and critically engaging with
   historical memory. This museum makes history relevant to younger
   generations through the use of oral history, popular pedagogy, and
   innovative engagement strategies. However, its impact is limited by
   neoliberal atomization and relatively low levels of grassroots
   mobilizationcommon obstacles faced by popular education initiatives
   around the world. La guerra civil en el El Salvador (1980-1992) causo la
   muerte de aproximadamente 75,000 personas, la mayoria asesinadas por el
   Estado y las fuerzas paramilitares. En la posguerra, el Museo de la
   Palabra y la Imagen en San Salvador promueve la memoria historica para
   denunciar la violencia del Estado e impulsar la justicia social. Se
   aparta, entonces, del papel historico de los museos como defensores de
   la hegemonia de la clase dominante al usar un modelo progresista para
   diseminar y examinar de forma critica la memoria historica. Por medio
   del uso de la historia oral, la pedagogia popular y varias estrategias
   de participacion innovadoras, el museo trata de que la historia sea algo
   relevante para las generaciones mas jovenes. Sin embargo, su impacto es
   limitado debido a la atomizacion neoliberal y a los niveles
   relativamente bajos de movilizacion popular -obstaculos que comparte con
   otras iniciativas de educacion popular alrededor del mundo.},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to both corporate political activity (CPA)
   research and capabilities theory research by offering models that better
   describe the process that managers undertake to nurture a political
   capability. This is done through the interplay of four factors inherent
   in political actions, namely (i) corporate structure, (ii)
   firm-government linkages, (iii) political access and (iv) public policy
   pressure. Additionally, recognizing that political capability attainment
   is not a binary endeavor, I offer a political capability continuum to
   better categorize the magnitude by which differing firms allocate
   resources toward molding public policy. This paper adds to the scant
   literature on management-focused CPA research that integrates the
   resource-based view (RBV) of the firm and political action research.},

Abstract = {With a referendum set to take place on 23 June 2016 in a large and
   important European Union (EU) member state on whether it should remain
   within the Union or leave altogether, this year will prove crucial for
   all Europeanists. Brexit is a real possibility that both the Union and
   other member states must be prepared to plan for and eventually absorb
   the potential impact of. Whilst the process of will they, won't they'
   will continue until the referendum, and even beyond, this level of
   uncertainty creates challenges for the existing actors with a stake in
   the process. This introductory contribution will set the scene for the
   ensuing debate, which flows from the various perspectives that each of
   the authors have with regard to the ultimate question of a Brexit. The
   three editors introduce the legal, political and economic themes that
   run through the articles, whilst simultaneously attempting to map out
   the trajectory for if, when and how a Brexit may actually occur, given
   the differing perspectives in the debate.},

Abstract = {Scholars and practitioners of grand strategy agree that the use of
   military force should be supplemented by appropriate economic policies.
   However, strangely few accounts of economic complements to military
   grand strategies have been presented in recent discourse on US grand
   strategy. This paper takes a first step to fill this information gap. I
   first assess the role that could be played by economic measures under
   two types of grand strategies - one focusing on the balance of power and
   the other emphasising influence and order. Second, I introduce what I
   call the influence-capability dilemma' and discuss tradeoffs in adopting
   certain economic policies in order to help the US sustain pre-eminence
   in the international system. Third, I discuss how the US should address
   this dilemma of economic means in dealing with the rising China.},

Abstract = {Petroleum subsidies are economically costly and environmentally
   destructive. Autocracies tend to offer higher subsidies for petroleum
   products than do democracies. Why? This study uses a global dataset of
   gasoline prices in developing countries for the years 2003-9 to show
   that the autocratic subsidy premium stems from countries where much of
   the population lives in small cities. Urban riots are a major threat to
   autocratic political survival, and high fuel prices cause social unrest.
   In large cities, autocrats can use public transportation to mitigate the
   effects of high fuel prices, but this strategy is not practical in small
   cities. Therefore, autocratic rulers offer high petroleum subsidies if
   they have large urban populations living in small cities. These findings
   suggest that the exact nature of urbanization has a critical effect on
   the political calculus of leaders and on policy outcomes.},

Abstract = {In times of economic crisis, municipalities have faced serious fiscal
   stress and have had to implement responsive measures such as lowering
   operational costs, a hiring freeze or layoffs. Yet some cities even
   boost their bureaucratic apparatus. Based on empirical results of Czech
   statutory cities, it is argued, that the main cause of bureaucratic
   growth is party fragmentation, government alternations and weak mayors
   because post-communist administrations are affected by widespread
   patronage and clientelism. Decline or cutbacks strategies are linked to
   fiscal stress though in times of elections are determined by political
   context rather than the economic environment.},

Abstract = {The unprecedented geopolitical shift resulting from Brexit reflects deep
   socioeconomic fault lines within and beyond the UK. In many ways
   foreshadowing the US presidential election of Donald Trump, Brexit
   brought to the surface and gave a public voice to socio-economic
   divisions that were deeply embedded, sometimes illogical, but until now
   had either been ignored or hushed out of `respectable' public debate.
   This Discussion Forum emanates from a spontaneous seminar organized 2
   days after the Brexit vote on June 25, 2016 as part of the SASE
   conference held in University of California-Berkeley and followed by an
   open call for papers by Socio-Economic Review. The papers here draw
   attention to the origins of the Brexit vote in deep-seated
   socio-economic divisions (O'Reilly), widening differences in economic
   performance across sectors and regions of the UK (Froud, Sukhdev and
   Williams) and the growth of poor quality jobs (Warhurst). Meanwhile, the
   political dynamics of the Brexit vote were also shaped by the fractured
   nature of UK business elites (Morgan), divisions between locals and
   cosmopolitans (Grey) and creative but muddled actions of elites that
   arguably generated consequences they themselves failed to fully
   anticipate (Wood and Wright). From the perspective of Europe, Brexit
   reflects a history of dysfunctional economic policy in Europe that
   prioritized market competition in ways that neglected and ultimately
   undermined solidarity (Boyer). Here, Brexit reflects a political
   strategy to both renationalize and recommodify solidarity in the face of
   fears over migration, and which are likely to have major consequences
   for social solidarity in Europe more generally (Frerichs and Sankari).
   However, Brexit is unlikely to provide a durable social and political
   solution to the wider tensions between globalization and democracy,
   which also affect all countries throughout Europe (Rona-Tas).
   Ultimately, the Brexit vote underlines social divisions that combine
   class inequalities with regional ones, not just in Britain but
   throughout Europe (Le Gales).},

Abstract = {This article argues that the principle of indivisibility in the
   relationship between political and administrative elites acted as a
   central convention of the Westminster system for much of the twentieth
   century. It explores how in more recent decades this principle has been
   challenged by the shift to a principal-agent approach. It considers the
   extent to which this shift diminishes the traditional Westminster
   model's understanding of the minister-civil servant relationship as one
   based on a symbiotic interdependent partnership. In its place has
   emerged a more universal command and control relationship that is seen
   as necessary to meet the demands of modern accountability and
   transparency. Such a change has fundamentally altered a long-established
   power-bargain between ministers and civil servants and undermined a core
   tenet of the Westminster model.},

Abstract = {The recent history of real estate developers in the Netherlands and
   Belgium shows that financialization processes are geographically
   variegated. Although real estate developers, the intermediary between
   capital and the local built environment, faced a similar rise of more
   market-oriented banking, Dutch developers financialized their activities
   while their Belgian counterparts did not. The Dutch case demonstrates
   how financialized corporations can make accumulation cycles more
   extreme, particularly by placing the creation of fictitious capital at
   the centre of their business strategies. The Belgian case illustrates
   how patient capital, i.e. multi-generational wealth looking for
   sustainable growth, can function as a strong barrier to financialization
   processes, thus moderating the influence of financialized capitalism on
   the economy.},

Abstract = {In this article, we analyse an instance of revitalisation of a dormant
   interregional organisation dating back to the Cold War: the Zone of
   Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic (ZOPACAS), initially
   launched by South American and African states in 1986 through the UN
   General Assembly. Drawing on the concepts of ``consensual hegemony{''}
   we argue that the current phase of ZOPACAS' existence is characterised
   by Brazil's efforts to rekindle it, thus reflecting its aspiration to
   create a new space of influence. Rather than pursuing more traditional
   forms of regional leadership, Brazil uses ZOPACAS as part of a
   persuasion-based strategy based on regional multilateralism that is
   designed in antagonism to other international organisations and Western
   powers. However, this strategy also faces important limitations
   resulting from resource constraints, lack of institutionalisation and an
   excessive exclusionary focus on minimising the role of global powers
   with interests in the region.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {53},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {Our knowledge of the set of concepts that influence the number of terror
   attacks experienced by different countries is rudimentary. Existing work
   on the incidence of terror focuses upon the structural characteristics
   of polities, economies, and societies, and fails to place competition
   between dissidents and states center stage. It also tends to treat
   terror as isolated from other tactics that dissident groups might use to
   pressure the state. This study addresses these shortcomings by placing
   government and dissident group behavior at the center of the analysis.
   Drawing on arguments from the larger literature on dissent and
   repression, we argue that government behavior and dissident behavior are
   likely to be more important determinants of terror attacks than
   structural factors. We scour the literature for existing arguments to
   round out our model specification, and evaluate hypotheses using
   Bayesian statistical techniques and a broad scope of relevant data. For
   many of our independent variables we construct indices using measurement
   models that are able to account for measurement error and missing data,
   resulting in a more comprehensive set of data than previous studies. The
   results demonstrate that measures of government and dissident behavior
   have more explanatory power than measures of the concepts that populate
   existing research.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {The dominant paradigm of international relations theory has long seen
   influence over nuclear arsenals as the preserve of presidents, premiers
   and generals of the world's great powers, not underfunded activists,
   feminist campaigners, radical nuns or even diplomats of small states.
   The approach of this special section could not be more different. In
   fact, we have intentionally curated a collection of articles that try to
   de-center' the academic conversation about nuclear weapons. The
   inspiration for our approach comes from the Humanitarian Initiative on
   Nuclear Weapons, which since its emergence after the 2010 Review
   Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, has dramatically
   reshaped the diplomatic discussions on nuclear disarmament, led by small
   states and middle powers. The shift in discourse has been accelerated by
   revitalized civil society action, represented by the International
   Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, a global NGO coalition, as well as
   renewed calls for disarmament from religious leaders - most notably Pope
   Francis. This special section, written from the perspective ofscholars
   and practitioners associated with the Humanitarian Initiative, examines
   its dimensions and its potential impact on global policy making.},

Title = {`SUPRANATIONALISM' IN QUESTION: BELIEFS, VALUES, AND THE SOCIALIZING

Abstract = {Do international organizations affect the views of the people who work
   for them? Although increasingly sophisticated methods have been used to
   address this question, disagreement persists about whether the beliefs
   of staff are formed before they join, after they enter the institution,
   or are shaped by instrumental calculation. Drawing on an original
   dataset based on the first fully representative survey of the European
   Commission's workforce, this article breaks new ground by putting
   different definitions of supranationalism' to the test and by capturing
   multiple ways in which individuals may be affected by the experience of
   working for the organization. For the first time, it demonstrates that
   commitment to supranationalism' varies between Commission staff
   groupings, that the influences on belief vary with the measure of
   supranationalism' used, and that both post-recruitment experience and
   pre-recruitment roles play a part in shaping beliefs.},

Abstract = {Muralism is one of the most striking expressions of one of Chile's most
   emblematic working-class neighborhoods, La Victoria, which is known for
   the land takeover in which it originated and its resistance to the
   military dictatorship. Muralism served as the physical carrier of
   messages of resistance during the dictatorship and later consolidated an
   imaginary of political condemnation and venting in the face of
   repression. With democracy, muralism has made the memory of the
   neighborhood graphic, propitiated a dialogue between the experience of
   the land occupation and the dictatorship, and generated a discourse
   that, emerging from the popular, continues to confront the mechanisms of
   forgetting circulated by the official truths imposed by the compromised
   democratic transition.},

Abstract = {The perceived clash of norms associated with the emergence of rising
   powers is nowhere more pronounced than in relation to the responsibility
   to protect (RtoP). However, attempts to explain rising powers'
   engagement with norms such as the RtoP are often limited and limiting in
   what they can tell us. Orthodox models portray predominantly linear and
   diffusionist logics of norm evolution that underplay the complex
   interaction implicit in unpredictable outcomes at the systemic level.
   This article identifies a range of factors that drive participation (or
   generate hesitation) amongst emerging powers in the development and
   application of the RtoP. It proceeds to illustrate how changes in
   normative behaviour emanate from top-down and bottom-up processes as
   well as the feedback between them. It argues that norm evolution is
   consequently a unique and emergent outcome of complex international
   society and therefore argues for using complexity thinking as a
   heuristic to augment current models and explanations of the evolution of
   norms in the international system.},

Abstract = {Since the Great Recession, some have argued that local governments have
   become austerity machines' that cut and privatize services and undermine
   unions. We conducted a national survey of US municipalities in 2012 to
   examine how service provision level and delivery methods are related to
   local stress and capacity, controlling for community need and place
   characteristics. We find that local governments are balancing the
   pressures of stress with community needs. They use alternative revenue
   sources and service delivery methods (privatization and cooperation) to
   maintain services. Unionization is not a barrier to innovation. Further,
   we find that ethnically diverse suburbs are providing more services than
   other suburbs, thus acting more like metro core cities. We find that the
   Great Recession has not dramatically shifted local government behaviour
   to a new normal' of fiscal austerity. Instead, we find municipalities
   practising pragmatic municipalism' to maintain their public role.},

Abstract = {Economic development generally promotes women's autonomy. Yet women in
   resource-rich autocracies fare more poorly than women in similarly
   wealthy industrial and postindustrial states. Some attribute this
   puzzling outcome to cultural causes, describing the apparent link
   between restrictions on women's autonomy in resource-rich countries
   (especially in the Middle East) as spurious. Others argue that oil and
   gas rents cause a gendered resource curse through macroeconomic
   mechanisms. By contrast, we explain the association as a consequence of
   a political mechanism. We propose a theory of autocratic survival via
   antisocial policies chosen for the harms they inflict on targeted
   groups. Autocrats need to placate ideologically motivated members of
   their winning coalition. Antisocial policies serve as a costly and
   visible measure of rulers' fidelity to these winning coalition members.
   Resource rents enable rulers to afford such policies, which would be
   infeasible in tax-reliant regimes. Restricting women's autonomy thus
   forms part of a strategy of autocratic rule in resource-rich
   autocracies. Using quantitative evidence, we demonstrate that variations
   in women's autonomy correlate with variations in oil income per capita
   in cross-country regressions. To trace variations within cases, we
   present case studies of Saudi Arabia and Iran to demonstrate processes
   consonant with our theory.},

Abstract = {The Republic of Turkey (RoT) is closely observing negotiations of the
   first three mega-regional preferential trade agreements. Of greatest
   concern to the Republic is the US-EU Transatlantic Trade and Investment
   Partnership (TTIP), intended to establish the standards for preferential
   regimes beyond ambitious next generation free trade areas (FTAs). The
   Republic's primary concern is TTIP's potential impact on the Turkish
   economy given interaction with the RoT-EU Customs Union (CU). This
   interaction reflects the problem of outdated trade agreements' overlap
   with the spaghetti bowls of next generation and now mega-regional
   agreements. Although immediate Turkish TTIP inclusion is unlikely, TTIP
   triggered a critical juncture for the Republic given the agreement's
   potential interaction with the CU's outdated features and hub-and-spoke
   structure. This juncture provides the Republic with strategic leverage
   to pursue the CU's review and possible revision. The RoT's strategic
   sequencing of its CU review with TTIP engagement may prove advantageous
   by altering its structural relationship with its hub and primary
   economic anchor of the EU as well as facilitating its entry into
   ambitious mega-regional agreements and contributing to its EU accession
   process. It also highlights the way in which states may strategically
   consolidate their particular cases of overlapping preferential trade
   agreements (PTAs).},

Abstract = {In his treatise Han Fei Zi, the Chinese ancient thinker Han Fei proposes
   a governance structure that emphasizes the institutionalization of legal
   norms, judicious sovereign intervention, and ministerial obligations.
   These three core concepts of Han's legal thinking are informed by both
   the Taoist law of Nature and the Confucian philosophy as is expounded by
   Xun Zi. Recognition of the Taoist and Confucian influences brings to
   light the ethical and normative dimensions of Han's legal thought,
   dimensions that, I propose, provide new insights into China's legal and
   institutional reforms today.},

Abstract = {Market-based public management reform has introduced customer choice
   among competing providers of public services. Choice entails exit, an
   option which Albert Hirschman famously reserved for the market, while
   voice is the key mode of communication in political life. Based on elite
   and mass surveys, the article studies how exit is perceived by citizens
   and local political and administrative leaders in Norway and Sweden, and
   how the two strategic options relate to each other. Citizens are more
   positive towards customer choice and exit than are leaders, albeit with
   some variation across different public service sectors. Political and
   administrative leaders are positive towards customer choice models as a
   strategy to empower clients but more critical in terms of the potential
   loss of accountability and control that contracting out services may
   entail.},

Volume = {37},

Pages = {533-550},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Get-out-the-vote mailers using explicit social pressure consistently
   increase electoral turnout; however, they often generate a negative
   reaction or backlash. One approach to increase turnout, yet alleviate
   backlash, may be to use implicit social pressure. An implicit social
   pressure technique that has shown promise is to display a set of eyes.
   Researchers contend eyes generate a feeling of being watched, which cues
   subjects to act in more prosocial ways to demonstrate compliance with
   social norms. Several studies support this argument, including two voter
   mobilization studies. The technique has not been widely tested, however,
   in the political context. In five randomized field experiments, we test
   the impact on turnout of mobilization mailers using eye displays. We
   extend previous research by testing for differences in effects between
   male and female eyes and across political cultures. The effects are
   substantively and statistically weak at best and inconsistent with
   previous findings.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on a challenge in the current terrorism literature,
   namely the methodological justification concerning the collection and
   analysis of empirical data. Lack of detailed methodological accounts of
   the collection and analysis of the data makes it difficult to evaluate
   presented findings, especially if these data are confidential or focused
   on specific aspects of the phenomenon. This article offers an extensive
   overview of the methodological procedures conducted in a large empirical
   research project on jihadist networks based on confidential police files
   (2000-2013), interviews, and trial observations. The article illustrates
   how grounded theory-based methods can be used to collect and analyze
   such data and to develop and test new theories in this research field.},

Abstract = {While scholars have studied various aspects of election campaigns, they
   have not examined their effects on political knowledge in Africa. Since
   many problems are blamed on information scarcity, campaign-related
   learning could affect democratic development positively. This article
   focuses on the case of Uganda, using unique panel data from the 2010-11
   campaign. I find that knowledge on office holders, candidates, and
   institutions increased significantly over the campaign. Importantly,
   these increases were not concentrated amongst the previously privileged,
   but also occurred amongst often-disadvantaged groups, such as women, the
   poor, the less-educated, and rural dwellers. In fact, the campaign seems
   to have diminished, although not eliminated, pre-existing knowledge gaps
   between advantaged and disadvantaged populations. It does not appear
   that Ugandans learned because the campaign made them more excited about
   politics, but rather because they were exposed to political
   communications, door-to-door canvassing, and increasingly politicized
   media content. Finally, knowledge increases are significantly correlated
   with increased criticism of institutions, but not with increased support
   for democracy or participation. While we cannot generalize to the rest
   of the continent, given that interest in a non-competitive campaign like
   Uganda's might be relatively limited, we might expect similar or larger
   learning effects in more-democratic settings.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the formalization of hiring processes and its
   impact on the type of the employee hired. Using the French Offre
   d'emploi et recrutement (OFER) survey on the hiring practices of 3584
   firms in 2005, we investigate how firms organize the selection of job
   applicants and analyse the outcome of this selection with regard to the
   profiles of successful applicants. The data analysis reveals four types
   of screening processes: an informal process (streamlined) and three
   formalized processes (written-based, testing and professionalized). The
   use of a type of screening process depends on the constraints and
   resources of the firm and on the expected type of match. Finally, logit
   regressions show that personal and professional networks tend to
   penalize women and formal testing screening processes seem to favour
   unemployed or inactive people, whereas the formalized screening
   processes are likely to penalize individuals without diplomas.},

Abstract = {A growing number of scholars, academics and policy makers advocate
   substantial reforms of the existing European institutional architecture.
   Advocates of deepening the European integration recommend that the
   optimal development of the European Union (EU) would be to establish a
   fully developed banking union, an advanced form of fiscal union and to
   ultimately achieve a political union based on common economic
   governance. Accordingly, the ideal scenario for European integration
   would be to adopt, to the largest possible extent, a path toward the
   classical federal model. Leaving aside the practical feasibility of such
   a development, the purpose of this article is to explore whether a
   direction toward the model of classical federalism is the only possible
   way forward for European integration. Comparative constitutionalism has
   developed several substantially different models of federalism.
   Therefore, this article explores other possible trajectories for
   European integration while pointing to the limitations of classical
   federalism. In the face of the protracted social and economic crises in
   many European member states and their regions, article also examines the
   possibilities of establishing cooperative or even experimental
   federalism as a new model for European integration.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of the article is to identify which components of
   public internal financial control (PIFC), as part of risk management,
   have been improved by the crisis the most at the regional level, and
   what is the possible reason for that. During the period 2008-2014,
   healthcare in the EU and consequently in Slovenia was under the pressure
   of aggravated circumstances. Therefore, it is important that healthcare
   organizations, especially regional hospitals, as a main provider of
   secondary healthcare, have risk management tools in place that prevent
   risks and provide a reasonable assurance that public funds are being
   used for the intended purpose. To test which components significantly
   improved in that period, a paired-samples t-test is performed on a
   sample of 10 Slovenian regional hospitals. The empirical results show
   that the components of risk assessment and control activities saw the
   greatest improvement.},

Abstract = {Historically, Latin American social development has been diverse and
   heterogeneous. It depends on the use of natural resources (with greater
   or less added value and productive diversity), the influence of social
   movements, the role of political parties, the level of education, and
   the prevailing culture. Inequality and social exclusion are still
   prevalent in most Latin American countries. Poverty and environmental
   deterioration tend to be correlated. Therefore strategies for mitigation
   of and adaptation to climate change must consider measures for
   overcoming poverty and reducing inequality. El desarrollo social en
   America Latina es historicamente muy diverso y heterogeneo. Depende del
   uso de los recursos naturales con mayor o menor valor agregado y
   diversidad productiva , de la influencia de los movimientos sociales,
   del papel de los partidos politicos, del nivel educacional alcanzado y
   del tipo de cultura imperante en las diferentes sociedades. Aun persiste
   la desigualdad y altos indices de exclusion social en la mayoria de los
   paises latinoamericanos. Pobreza y deterioro del medio ambiente suelen
   correlacionarse. Los pobres por lo general viven en territorios
   degradados y vulnerables. Las estrategias de mitigacion y adaptacion al
   cambio climatico deben, en consecuencia, contemplar medidas de
   superacion de la pobreza y disminucion de los niveles de desigualdad
   social y ambiental.},

Abstract = {In an innovative use of government manifestos, this paper examines the
   salience and shape of anti-corruption policies in Slovakia and the Czech
   Republic during the period 1990-2013. Both the intensity and shape of
   anti-corruption efforts appear to be related less to the actual extent
   of corruption or external influences and more to the growing domestic
   electoral pressure expressed through the higher ranking of corruption on
   the list of public problems and to an ideological bent of governments.
   We also use cultural theory to examine the philosophy of anti-corruption
   measures. We find that the hierarchical approach clearly dominates, but
   there is also extensive evidence of an egalitarian approach. There are
   only a small number of individualist measures and there is nearly no
   evidence of fatalist measures. We found that the political right in both
   the Czech Republic and Slovakia is associated not just with an
   individualist and market-based approach to anti-corruption, but even
   more with emphasis on anti-corruption itself and empowerment, civil
   society and public accountability as a means of fighting corruption.},

   for several decades, they are still presents in the political and

   they are used often of incorrect form in the public area. We want to
   elaborate therefore a theory on these concepts and to discuss his

Abstract = {What does the rise of China mean for the international order, especially
   the liberal institutional order? Despite of the enormous scholarly
   attention paid to this important question, there has been no systematic
   effort to map out this order and how China relates to it. We examine the
   international institutional order using an original dataset, the
   Multilateral Agreements and Protocols (MAP). We further develop a new
   metric of a country's embeddedness in the international institutional
   order. Our analysis leads us to reconsider prominent conjectures about
   China's evolving relationship to the current international liberal
   order. We find that, relative to the global average, China is less
   inclined towards deep commitment to the current international
   institutional order. Indeed, China's wariness about this order seems in
   contrast to the growing global appetite for deep commitment.
   Furthermore, China seems less embedded in some issue areas that are
   central to the international liberal order. These findings suggest that
   the integration of China into the current Western liberal order may not
   be as automatic as some have suggested and reinforce concerns over the
   future of global governance.},

Title = {Sites of Knowledge (Re-)Production: Toward an Institutional Sociology of
   International Relations Scholarship},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {In his 1998 article, The Sociology of a Not So International Discipline,
   Ole Waever suggested to assess the development and organization of the
   International Relations (IR) discipline through a three-tier comparative
   sociological research framework. It is by looking at the intellectual,
   institutional, and political layer of IR, so he argued, that one can
   fully understand the specificities of IR as a complex social field of
   work as well as the particular forms of knowledge that are developed in
   this field. In the years following its publication, Waever's article was
   joined and followed up by a growing and increasingly sophisticated body
   of literature studying IR scholarship. Yet, a thorough reading of this
   literature shows that the emerging sociology of IR has come to focus
   strongly on only two of Waever's three analytical layers: It is the
   intellectual and political layers of IR that garnered significant
   attention thus far, whereas work about the field s institutional layer
   remains surprisingly scarce. This forum seeks to address this gap by
   means of promoting a dedicated engagement with the field's institutional
   determinants: How is the institutional layer of IR organized in
   different places? How is the discipline embedded in distinct sites? And
   how is it governed by material and immaterial institutional constraints?
   To answer these questions, the forum s six individual contributions
   focus on conventional university departments and hybrid sites of
   international relations alike. In doing so, the forum s ambitions are
   both to highlight the empirical diversity of sites and settings where
   specialized knowledge about international relations is produced, shaped,
   and re-instantiated, and to illustrate how a focus on the institutional
   layer of IR can become an important vector for opening up the literature
   to insights from related fields of study.},

Title = {Does political uncertainty affect water resources development? The case
   of the Eastern Nile},
Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Pages = {151-163},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In water resources, there is a long tradition of utilization of methods
   to address hydrological and economic uncertainty. Less frequently
   considered, however, is how uncertainty rooted in political factors such
   as power asymmetry, the strength of institutions, and the interests of
   stakeholders, contributes to decision-making. This paper explores
   political uncertainty and its interaction with more routinely considered
   forms of uncertainty in international river basins. Using the example of
   the controversies surrounding major new infrastructure projects in the
   Eastern Nile Basin, we show that political uncertainty may play a key
   role in shaping the decisions of individual riparian countries about how
   to proceed with water resources development. Specifically, we consider
   whether uncertainty over the prospect of future cooperation might help
   explain why seemingly optimal economic outcomes that require cooperation
   (due to interconnectedness) remain elusive. We conclude with reflections
   on other dimensions of the water resources planning problem - climate
   change, changes in regional development matters, and preferences that
   similarly require a framework that accounts for political uncertainty.

Abstract = {Scholars of public and foreign policy have emphasized the role of
   decision processes in the creation of policy failures and fiascos and
   have demonstrated the importance that psychological factors play in
   policy mistakes. Using Ulrich Beck's notion of world risk society and
   drawing on advances in our understanding of a key psychological factor
   central to decision-making pathologies - cognitive dissonance - this
   contribution explores the ways in which features of the risk era could
   alter important decision dynamics and increase decision-making mistakes.
   In combination with the catastrophic potential of world risk society,
   this would suggest an increase in the frequency of policy-making
   fiascos. Bridging the gap between the `macro' conditions of
   globalization and the `micro' processes of decision-making also
   challenges our conception of both the nature and sources of
   policy-making mistakes and suggests that our scholarly understanding of
   `decision-making mistakes' may need rethinking.},

Abstract = {The emergence of Pentecostalism on the Brazilian scene has raised new
   questions about the way religion relates to the definition of a people,
   how religious minorities can be politically and legally integrated into
   the mainstream of national identity, and to what degree the
   state-religion relation is constitutive of society in a context of
   increasing sociocultural, religious, and political pluralization. The
   argument draws on the concept of minoritization proposed by William
   Connolly, against the background of Laclau's problematic of the
   formation of a people as a hegemonic actor. An analysis of Pentecostal
   discourse on the public and the people reveals that Pentecostalism
   minoritized itself in response to perceived exclusion and this
   accentuated pluralization within it. An unintended effect of this logic
   was the fluidity of the boundary between sacred and profane, religious
   and secular. In a context of growing cultural, social, and political
   pluralization, these discursive practices have the potential to lead
   either to the aggiornamento of Pentecostalism or to the regressive
   closing of a populist right-wing discourse. A emergencia pentecostal na
   cena publica brasileira tem colocado novas questoes quanto a forma como
   a religiAo se relaciona a definicAo de um povo, como as minorias
   religiosas podem ser politica e legalmente integradas ao filAo principal
   da identidade nacional, e em que medida a relacAo entre religiAo e
   estado e constitutiva da sociedade, num contexto de crescente
   pluralizacAo socio-cultural, religiosa e politica. O argumento
   desenvolve-se em torno do conceito de minoritizacAo proposto por William
   Connolly, com base na problematica laclauniana da formacAo do povo como
   ator hegemonico. Uma analise do discurso pentecostal sobre o publico e o
   povo revela que os pentecostais minoritizaram-se em resposta a uma
   percepcAo de exclusAo e que a minoritizacAo acentua a pluralizacAo no
   interior do pentecostalismo. Um efeito nAo-pretendido dessa logica e a
   fluidificacAo da fronteira entre sagrado e profano, religioso e secular.
   Num contexto de crescente pluralizacAo cultural, social e politica,
   essas praticas discursivas tem o potencial de aprofundarem o
   aggiornamento do pentecostalismo ou de seu fechamento regressivo num
   discurso populista de direita.},

Abstract = {According to the punctuated equilibrium thesis, government attention
   allocation alternates between long periods of stasis and dramatic spurts
   of disequilibrium because democratic institutions enable minority groups
   to obstruct change. This article presents a critical discrepancy in
   contemporary China, where punctuated instability is significantly more
   intense despite a lack of democratic institutions to empower minority
   obstructionism. Our empirical analysis further reveals that punctuated
   intensity goes even higher for Chinese regions facing fewer signs of
   social discontent. We attribute the intensification of punctuated
   dynamics to an information disadvantage arising from the lack of
   diverse, independent sources of information under authoritarianism. Our
   finding contributes to punctuated equilibrium theory by underlining the
   function of opposition groups not only as obstructionists but also as
   challengers to policy priorities. By marginalizing these challengers,
   authoritarian institutions confine attention to known problems, leading
   to serious delays in the discovery of and adjustment to emerging issues.},

Title = {Alliance networks and trade: The effect of indirect political alliances
   on bilateral trade flows},

Abstract = {How does the network of international political alliances influence
   trade flows? Previous work suggests that alliances matter in predicting
   trade outcomes because governments align trade policies with national
   security interests and firms take political relations between states
   into account when assessing risk. However, work to date investigates
   only the relationship between direct political alliances and trade,
   which ignores the complexity of international alliance structures. In
   this article, I argue that states and firms not only consider direct
   political relationships when shaping international trade, but also focus
   crucially on indirect alliance relationships. I find that higher levels
   of trade result when states have more shared alliances and when they are
   in the same alliance community. Once these indirect relationships are
   accounted for, the apparent association of dyadic alliances with trade
   is drastically reduced. Joint membership in an alliance community
   predicts an increase in trade that is more than twice the increase
   associated with a dyadic alliance. This effect is magnified when
   considering highly central' states in the alliance network. States trade
   significantly more with central states in their own alliance community
   and less with central states in other communities.},

Abstract = {France showed incremental increases in foreign aid for human
   immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS)
   with the slope being steeper than Japan but being gentler than the
   United States in the 1980s. The intermediacy in the behavioral pattern
   was conditioned by domestic social and cultural determinants that
   constituted the understanding and the view of the impacts and the
   implications of the epidemic among the public and the policymakers. The
   newly emerged epidemic was distinctively framed and understood as `gay
   disease', `social phenomenon' and `national cause'. The research traces
   the process in which such determinants as the number of HIV-infected,
   role of the media and activism of civil society organizations shaped the
   perception of HIV/AIDS as something that needed to be publicly discussed
   and immediately responded at the national level.},

Abstract = {The article uses newly available consistent military expenditure data
   for 1960-2014 to examine past and current global spending trends during
   and after the Cold War. We are particularly interested in the impact of
   the end of the Cold War, 9/11 and the 2008 recession on military
   spending worldwide. The global share of military spending of East Asia
   \& Pacific and the Middle East \& North Africa increased relative to
   other regions since 1985. This increase underscores the need for western
   allies to bolster their power projection capacities. After 1999, both
   China and Russia raised their real defense spending, with China's
   increases far exceeding that of Russia. Both countries have a long ways
   to go to rival US capabilities. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization
   (NATO) continues to be heavily dependent on US defense spending. The
   post-1998 expansion allies assume about 2.4 per cent of the alliance's
   defense burden, while representing significant risks to NATO, given
   recent Russian actions in the Ukraine.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {60},
Number = {3},
Pages = {403-433},

Abstract = {We present a new theory of interstate crisis bargaining. A country's
   resolve is a function of intrinsic qualities of the government and
   external circumstances, both of which are unknown by the domestic
   electorate and the foreign country. When domestic political debate
   reveals that circumstances favor the use of force, the government can
   extract better terms than if circumstances are revealed to be
   unfavorable. The revelation of circumstances, however, exacerbates
   reputational incentives. Because governments can no longer hide behind
   unknown circumstances, voters can better discern the government's type
   from its actions, strengthening the incentives to appear resolved. The
   model bridges the gap between audience costs and its critiques, showing
   how domestic audiences punish leaders for inappropriate policies rather
   than empty threats. At the same time, it highlights how the prospects
   for peace are worse if uncertainty about the circumstances is removed,
   suggesting that greater transparency does not always promote peaceful
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {Most scholars engaged in ideational analysis agree that the availability
   of new ideas may cause existing welfare state policies and institutions
   to alter. This article considers the extent to which the open functional
   approach and constructivist approaches are able to explain the role of
   ideas in policy and institutional change. Notwithstanding their
   contribution to the study of the role of ideas in policy and
   institutional change, these approaches suffer from some shortcomings as
   they fail to view ideas as non-stable entities. In order to address
   these shortcomings, an alternative poststructuralist discourse
   theoretical explanatory model is presented. Applying this model to the
   case of the rise and fall of Dutch life course policy, the article shows
   how a discourse theoretical view of ideas as FLoating signifiers
   contributes to the study of the role of ideas in welfare state change.},

Abstract = {Governments that want to subsidize goods or services can delegate
   responsibility for production to a public agency as part of its overall
   mission, subsidize production of specific outputs, or subsidize specific
   beneficiaries of excludable goods and services. For public postsecondary
   education, the corresponding funding mechanisms are operating
   appropriations that delegate authority to choose outputs and
   beneficiaries to public colleges and universities, grants and contracts,
   or student financial aid. Consistent with theories explaining delegation
   of policymaking authority, I find that the mix of funding mechanisms
   depends on institutions that affect planning capacity and oversight
   costs: States with more professional legislatures or statewide
   coordinating boards delegate less, that is, they spend more on grants
   and contracts and need-based student aid relative to appropriations.
   Relative use of grants and contracts decreases as the number of
   institutional governing boards increases, but use of need-based aid does
   not.},

Abstract = {There is accumulating evidence that decision makers (DMs) are sensitive
   to the distribution of resources among themselves and others, beyond
   what is expected from the predictions of narrow self-interest. These
   social preferences are typically conceptualized as being static and
   existing independently of information about the other people influenced
   by a DM's allocation choices. In this article, we consider the
   reactivity of a DM's social preferences in response to information about
   the intentions or past behavior of the person to be affected by the DM's
   allocation choices (i.e., how do social preferences change in relation
   to the other's type). This article offers a conceptual framework for
   characterizing the link between distributive preferences and
   reciprocity, and reports on experiments in which these two constructs
   are disentangled and the relation between the two is characterized.},

Abstract = {Thucydides said that `Right, as the world goes, is only in question
   between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the weak
   suffer what they must'. Such is the characterization by many scholars of
   the US dominance of Mexico. We challenge this claim in explaining a
   puzzle: why American unilateralism in the `war on drugs' results in
   symbolic and material gains for Mexico as it shifts the United States
   from a unilateral to a cooperative policy. We examine five major cases
   over the last five decades and identify a dynamic cycle that begins with
   unilateral US action and ends with bilateral agreements, where
   mechanisms for clear communication are created, and resource transfers
   take place. Although we recognize that our claims are both contingent
   and context-dependent, a clear pattern emerges: Like the Roadrunner,
   Mexico has triumphed again.},

Abstract = {States have rights to unilaterally determine their own immigration
   policies under international law and few international institutions
   regulate states' decision-making about immigration. As a result, states
   have extensive discretion over immigration policy. In this paper, I
   argue that states should join international migration institutions that
   would constrain their discretion over immigration. Immigration
   restrictions are morally risky. When states restrict immigration, they
   risk unjustly harming foreigners and restricting their freedom.
   Furthermore, biases and epistemic defects pervasively influence states'
   decision-making about immigration policy. States should transfer some of
   their decision-making authority over immigration to more reliable
   institutions in order to mitigate the risks that they will unjustly
   restrict immigration. International institutions that include the
   interests of potential immigrants would be more reliable with respect to
   immigration policy than unilateral state decision-making. Thus, states
   should subject their immigration policies to international control.},

Abstract = {The G20 has emerged as the premier forum for international economic
   policy coordination. For small EU states, the EU's participation in the
   G20 represents a particular challenge as they may be faced with
   decisions in which they had no say. This article looks at the
   possibilities for small state involvement in the G20 process and
   analyses the extent to which they can influence the EU's participation
   in the G20. The article suggests two sets of variables to explain the
   possibilities for influence of small states in the EU's external
   relations. Looking into four financial and economic policy dossiers, the
   article explores the conditions of success of small states' strategies.
   The article does not contradict that the big member states dominate the
   EU presence in the G20, but it does argue that small states may
   successfully use the EU as a foreign policy platform to pursue national
   objectives. Their influence varies strongly and is bound to a number of
   conditions.},

Abstract = {The literature on international regulatory regimes has highlighted how
   rival standards can create different points of convergence. Scholarly
   attention has also focused on how the European Union (EU) and the United
   States (USA) attempt to `export' their environmental standards
   internationally. Here, we explore the effectiveness of these attempts by
   means of third states' decisions to ratify the Cartagena Protocol on
   Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, a multilateral
   environmental agreement regulating genetically modified organisms that
   is promoted by the EU but opposed by the USA. Our findings confirm that
   both rivals are able to influence the ratification decision of states,
   but they also suggest that these effects may have different origins.
   Countries relying more heavily on US markets for food exports tend to be
   less likely to ratify the Cartagena Protocol, while countries that have
   applied for EU membership are more likely to ratify the protocol.},

Abstract = {This article addresses co-governance which can be defined as a dynamic
   interaction between public and private actors to secure the provision of
   common goods. Which types of relationship between public and private
   actors exist? Do the forms of co-governance change over time? When is
   the relationship between public and private actors cooperative, when is
   it competitive, and when do we witness conflictual relationships? These
   research questions lie at the heart of this introductory article, which
   seeks to shed further light on the origins and impacts of the various
   co-governance patterns. By reviewing the body of research on this topic,
   we show that different relationships between public and private actors
   exist, and that the forms of co-governance can also change over time.
   While the dominant form of co-governance is cooperation, one can also
   observe instances of competition or even conflict between public and
   private actors. Most importantly, we find that both public and private
   actors are ready to reclaim competences in areas where they perceive the
   other actor to have gained too much influence. As we discuss in this
   article, the degree of cooperation and competition mostly depends on the
   existing regulatory arrangements, the congruence of goals of the
   different actor groups, and the institutionalization of industrial
   relations. These insights help us to better understand the role
   co-governance can play in addressing complex public problems. (C) 2016

Abstract = {In this article we explore Mark Carney's place in the gendered political
   economy of British central banking. We document the gendered narratives
   surrounding Carney around the time of his appointment as Governor of the
   Bank of England, suggesting that they worked to naturalise certain
   gender constructions in finance. We show how Carney seemingly had the
   ability to successfully embody a combination of two ideal-types of
   masculinity: both `transnational business masculinity' and `traditional
   bourgeois masculinity'. We argue this contributed to three
   depoliticising moves, each of which gain their strength in part from the
   naturalisation of masculinities in finance, while obfuscating important
   questions of gendered finance. To elucidate the latter, we highlight
   some of the gendered outcomes that are obscured by the furore
   surrounding Carney's character, suggesting that the monetary and
   financial stability concerns of the Bank under his stewardship are
   likely to reproduce the uneven and exploitative relations of gendered
   finance.},

Abstract = {Despite of many institutional changes, Latin American States still are
   known by the low technical capacity of their bureaucracies. This lack of
   coherence between human resources and public policy needs makes talent
   management in the public sector an issue of outmost importance for the
   countries of the region. This work will focus on one aspect untreated by
   recent studies of public administration in Latin America: the training
   systems of civil servants. At first, the characteristics of national
   bureaucracies in the region is shown, followed by the exposition and
   analysis of training systems for public officials, detailing the two
   different models used for the generation and capture of talent in Latin
   American public administrations. For this purpose, 18 countries of the
   region are analyzed. Finally, overall conclusions of the analysis and
   some points of interest for capacity building and talent management in
   Latin American bureaucracies are presented.},

Abstract = {The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
   negotiations are evolving to reflect changes in national and global
   economic circumstances. However, this shift has been far smaller in the
   critical issue of climate finance, which remains too mired in an
   increasingly antiquated North-South, developed-developing country
   dichotomy. This inertia poses a serious threat to our ability to
   mobilize the finance required to meet the climate challenge, and could
   hamstring the new climate agreement countries are seeking. However, an
   important new trend can help move this discussion forward: the rise of
   climate finance within and among developing countries. Far from
   diminishing the need for developed countries to increase their support
   for mitigation and adaptation in developing countries, so-called
   South-South Climate Finance' (SSCF) can help unlock much needed
   additional resources for the climate challenge. This article provides an
   initial mapping of SSCF and argues that: (1) the emergence of SSCF
   offers countries an opportunity to mobilize additional climate finance,
   including through multilateral development banks (MDBs); and (2) parties
   to the UNFCCC should track and foster the role of SSCF so as to more
   effectively align it with traditional' climate finance that flows from
   developed to developing countries.},

   Antisemitism during the 1905-1907 Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland},

Abstract = {This article investigates the rise of political antisemitism during the
   1905-1907 Revolution in the Russian-controlled Kingdom of Poland.
   Extensive, diachronic discourse analysis of political leaflets reveals
   the role antisemitism played as a political device assisting the
   construction of new political identities and their dissemination through
   political mobilization. National Democracy and their labor branch, the
   National Workers Union, took the nation as the basic form of
   affiliation. The forging of such national unity, however, was difficult
   to engender among the workers owing to unique historical circumstances,
   the experience of exploitation, and longstanding socialist agitation.
   This process was aided, however, by the reference to a strong negative
   figure of the Other. When ``nationalism began to hate,{''} antisemitism
   appeared to be an extremely effective mobilizing device, and the Jews
   started to act as a negative, constitutive point of reference for the
   construction of national unity among the Poles. The analysis of the
   mobilization process and focus on discourse as a main factor in shaping
   political identities demonstrates that National Democratic antisemitism
   was neither an automatic activation of already present popular
   anti-Jewish sentiments due to the rise of mass politics nor a sheer
   creation of nationalist ideologues. It was, rather, the logic of
   discourse that ushered in a need for a negatively evaluated outsider,
   Jews being easily invested in this place due to a particular
   sociodemographic conjuncture and older judeophobic tendencies.},

Abstract = {Following the AKP's victory in the 2002 general elections, `conservative
   democracy' has emerged as a trademark in Turkish politics, focusing on
   cosmopolitanism and European integration. In the late 2000s, the party's
   favourite notion was `advanced democracy', this time underlining
   Turkey's leadership claim in the region and displaying a more critical
   approach to `Europe'. In this paper, I aim to show how different
   narratives on `Europe' emerged within the context of these empty
   signifiers. The paper claims that the difference in the two narratives
   on `Europe' in two different periods does not point to a complete and
   fully fledged de-Europeanisation trend.},

Abstract = {The increasing use of private military and security companies (PMSCs)
   has attracted considerable scholarly attention due to its corrosive
   effects on US democracy. Drawing on neoclassical realism, this article
   provides a comparative dimension to the study of the political drivers
   of military privatisation by analysing contractor support to US and UK
   operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Domestic political constraints have
   shaped both US and UK response to the need for more boots on the ground,
   increasing the propensity to use contractors as a force multiplier in
   spite of their problematic impact on military effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Previous large-N studies have found that the advancement of women's
   rights leads to a decline in conflict, but no large-N research has
   explored the possibility of a similar relationship between women's
   rights and terrorism. Nevertheless, policymakers have long argued that
   the advancement of women's rights forms a key component of
   counterterrorism policy. Simply put, we lay out a rationale for the
   argument that increased women's rights reduce the likelihood of
   terrorism. We test this hypothesis using CIRI's women's rights data
   combined with two datasets accounting for domestic terrorism and the
   production of transnational terrorism. While the results show that
   women's rights overall are not a panacea for both types of terrorism,
   the provision of women's rights is shown to have a negative relationship
   with domestic terrorism. States and international institutions should
   take the differing effects of women's rights across different types of
   terrorism into account when designing counterterrorism policies.},

Abstract = {The Philippine military rolled out the Internal Peace and Security Plan
   (Bayanihan) in 2011, legitimizing the military's support role to the
   government's peace initiatives. Bayanihan commits the military to
   cooperative relationships with local stakeholders in all its activities
   towards the goal of turning over internal security responsibility to
   local governments and effecting an institutional shift towards an
   external security role. Based on research that used community-member
   focus group discussions and interviews of military officers and NGO
   leaders involved in construction, peace and development and disaster
   response activities in select Panay island localities, local military
   units have a limited number of nontraditional activities featuring
   seminal outward linkages, resource and expertise sharing with government
   agencies, the private sector, and local community from 2010 to 2014. The
   use of civilian mechanisms for project conceptualization, design and
   implementation were uneven, but with clearer parameters for disaster
   response. Counterinsurgency considerations continue to inform the choice
   and dynamics of non-traditional activities. Despite institutional
   capability deficits, these activities provide crucial learning
   experiences for junior officers.},

Title = {Conflict management and age in service professions},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {302-330},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper was to examine age differences in
   conflict management strategy use, effectiveness and in exposure to
   customer stressors in service interactions.
   Design/methodology/approach - Moderated regression and mediation
   analyses were conducted to test hypotheses in a sample of 444 German
   service employees from different service branches with frequent customer
   contact.
   Findings - Results revealed that older service employees experienced
   fewer customer stressors. Customer stressors mediated the negative
   relationship between age and burnout. Age was associated with use of
   passive avoidant (avoiding) and active constructive (problem solving)
   conflict management strategies. Furthermore, older employees used those
   strategies more effectively. Especially when avoiding conflicts, older
   employees reported more professional efficacy than younger colleagues.
   In contrast, younger employees benefited considerably less from strategy
   use and reported higher levels of burnout in general. Thus, results
   suggest older employees' effective conflict management and their
   positive perception of customer stressors contribute to lower levels of
   burnout.
   Practical implications - Results speak against a general deficit model
   for older workers as they show specific strengths of older employees in
   social conflicts. Their expertise in dealing with negative social
   interactions represents an important resource for organizations and
   training interventions, such as mentoring programs.
   Originality/value - This study is one of the first to examine
   age-related conflict management skills with regard to customer
   conflicts, employee health and effectiveness of strategy use. It
   replicates existing findings on age and conflict management and extends
   them in several ways thereby ruling out alternative explanations for age
   effects.},

Title = {Green violence: Rhino poaching and the war to save Southern Africa's
   peace parks},
Journal = {AFRICAN AFFAIRS},

Volume = {115},

Pages = {1-22},

Abstract = {Over a thousand rhinos were killed in 2013 and 2014 as the poaching
   crisis in Southern Africa reached massive proportions, with major
   consequences for conservation and other political dynamics in the
   region. The article documents these dynamics in the context of the
   ongoing development and establishment of ``peace parks{''}: large
   conservation areas that cross international state boundaries. The
   rhino-poaching crisis has affected peace parks in the region, especially
   the flagship Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park between South Africa,
   Mozambique and Zimbabwe. In order to save both peace parks and rhinos,
   key actors such as the South African government, the Peace Parks
   Foundation, and the general public responded to the poaching crisis with
   increasingly desperate measures, including the deployment of a variety
   of violent tactics and instruments. The article critically examines
   these methods of `green violence' and places them within the broader
   historical and contemporary contexts of violence in the region and in
   the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park. It concludes that attempting to
   save peace parks through `green violence' represents a contradiction,
   but that this contradiction is no longer recognized as such, given the
   historical positioning of peace parks in the region and popular
   discourses of placing poachers in a `space of exception'.},

Abstract = {Media celebrities and political dynasts dominate Philippine electoral
   politics, but little individual-level research has been done to
   understand who votes for them. This article studies three senatorial
   election cycles, and based on the theoretical argument that name recall
   plays a major role in vote choice in these elections, hypotheses are
   posed regarding associations with education, wealth status, media
   exposure, trust of the electoral process, and abstention rates. Tests
   indicate that wealthier voters and more educated ones are less likely to
   vote for media celebrities, and more highly educated voters are more
   likely to vote for dynastic candidates. No associations were found with
   media exposure and trust in elections. Abstention rates are highly
   associated with voting for media celebrity and dynastic candidates.
   Implications on the future of Philippine electoral politics are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Focusing on EU visa liberalization policy with Russia and Eastern
   Partnership countries as a case study, this article seeks to investigate
   the drivers of EU external migration policy in regards to its
   neighbourhood. In doing so, the article seeks to understand whether
   policy objectives and instruments employed by the EU emphasize security
   or normative considerations, or both. It also scrutinizes the factors
   behind this emphasis. In particular, it examines the degree to which EU
   external migration policy is framed by intra-EU bargaining and
   interaction with partner countries. The hybrid nature of EU visa policy
   towards its neighbourhood stems first and foremost from persisting
   differences in the prioritization of security and values among the major
   EU actors involved in the policy process. Yet as the article argues,
   interaction with partner countries crucially shapes the outcomes of the
   visa liberalization policy, thereby altering the balance between
   normative and security considerations that results from negotiations
   between EU actors.},

Title = {Structural and Institutional Determinants of Influence Reputation: A
   Comparison of Collaborative and Adversarial Policy Networks in Decision
   Making and Implementation},

Abstract = {The central assumption in the literature on collaborative networks and
   policy networks is that political outcomes are affected by a variety of
   state and nonstate actors. Some of these actors are more powerful than
   others and can therefore have a considerable effect on decision making.
   In this article, we seek to provide a structural and institutional
   explanation for these power differentials in policy networks and support
   the explanation with empirical evidence. We use a dyadic measure of
   influence reputation as a proxy for power, and posit that influence
   reputation over the political outcome is related to vertical integration
   into the political system by means of formal decision-making authority,
   and to horizontal integration by means of being well embedded into the
   policy network. Hence, we argue that actors are perceived as influential
   because of two complementary factors: (a) their institutional roles and
   (b) their structural positions in the policy network. Based on temporal
   and cross-sectional exponential random graph models, we compare five
   cases about climate, telecommunications, flood prevention, and toxic
   chemicals politics in Switzerland and Germany. The five networks cover
   national and local networks at different stages of the policy cycle. The
   results confirm that institutional and structural drivers seem to have a
   crucial impact on how an actor is perceived in decision making and
   implementation and, therefore, their ability to significantly shape
   outputs and service delivery.},

Title = {The effect of team empowerment on team performance A cross-cultural
   perspective on the mediating roles of knowledge sharing and intra-group
   conflict},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {62-87},
Abstract = {Purpose - Based on extant literature on empowerment and team management,
   this paper aims to examine the effect of power distance and collectivism
   on the relationship between empowerment and team performance through the
   mechanisms of knowledge sharing and intra-group conflict.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper conceptualizes a model
   depicting the relationship between team empowerment and team performance
   across cultures.
   Findings - The authors argue that team empowerment can increase both
   knowledge sharing and intra-group conflict in working teams. Knowledge
   sharing facilitates team performance, while intra-group conflict impairs
   team performance in the long run. Team empowerment yields different team
   performance across cultures due to the respective moderating effects of
   power distance and collectivism.
   Originality/value - This paper explicates the moderating roles of power
   distance and collectivism on the relationship between empowerment,
   knowledge sharing, intra-group conflict and team performance. The
   authors suggest that the effectiveness of team empowerment is contingent
   on the cultural context that the team operates in.},

Abstract = {This article constitutes the first systematic effort to promote a
   spatial and a subnational turn in the study of EU legal integration by
   demonstrating how geospatial methods and the selection of a subnational
   unit of analysis can improve our understanding of the use of the
   preliminary reference procedure. We conduct a theory-testing case study
   leveraging an original dataset of all references submitted by Italian
   courts from 1964 through 2013 and utilize geographic information systems
   (GIS) technology to analyze subnational patterns in reference activity.
   We use these data to evaluate whether several existing hypotheses
   explain recent subnational variation in reference rates. We uncover
   several illuminating findings. First, although population levels and
   domestic litigiousness best explain variation in reference rates, there
   is evidence that the domestic litigation effect is subnationally
   heterogeneous. Second, although use of the reference procedure has
   diffused since the 1960s, subnational reference rates are spatially
   clustered by issue area.},

Abstract = {A secure cyberspace is a necessity for the functioning of the economic,
   political and social structures of modern-day society. The stability and
   development of cyberspace is not preordained, but something that has to
   be facilitated. Cyberspace is constantly changing and to govern the
   complex set of interests, agendas and implications multistakeholder
   initiatives that promote cooperation between the public and private
   sector and civil society are increasingly put forth as the solution.
   This form for cooperation is widely seen in the policy community as a
   panacea for securing cyberspace. While academics have questioned these
   initiatives' functionality, few have studied why they do not work in
   practice. By focusing on the power dynamics between the different actors
   this article takes a step towards understanding how these dynamics
   create conflict of interest in governing cyberspace. Through case
   studies of multistakeholder initiatives on the international level and
   in Norway, this paper argues that these initiatives are implemented
   without the necessary preconditions for such a form of governance.},

Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {32},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {192-214},
Abstract = {This article investigates positions on network governance-type
   arrangements in Russian non-oppositional media. State-based actors
   articulated a discourse of mutual dependency, akin to observations in
   liberal parliamentary democracies. The state described itself as
   possessing necessary funding and competence to regulate and coordinate,
   while non-state actors were described as possessing resources necessary
   to fulfil state policy. Non-state actors occasionally cast doubt on the
   state's competence to regulate, but fears of state cooptation were
   rarely articulated. The hegemonic discourse on mutual dependency, and
   the state as an active network manager, mirrors the observed growth of
   state-controlled arenas for civil society inclusion in Russia.},

Abstract = {Government Accountability Office reports and secondary sources reveal
   that the U.S. Congress has employed three distinct legislative
   approaches to address the federal counterterrorism information-sharing
   impasse: coerce, consent, and coax. One main example illustrates each
   approach: the Homeland Security Information Network project exemplifies
   the coerce approach; Intellipedia illustrates the consent approach; the
   office of the Program Manager of the Information Sharing Environment
   exemplifies the coax approach. Secondary examples are utilized including
   those of regional Fusion Centers, the Office of the Director of National
   Intelligence, and the National Counterterrorism Center. The merits and
   challenges of the three approaches are discussed and compared. The
   conclusion proposes ideas for using the approach most appropriate to
   specific counterterrorism challenges.},

Volume = {32},

Pages = {81-104},
Abstract = {Why do some political parties join popular protests, whereas others
   abstain or even oppose them? Using a paired case-study comparison
   between the Russian regions, we examine political parties' strategies
   towards the ``For Fair Elections{''} movement in 2011-2012 and explain
   these choices through two jointly operating mechanisms: level of party
   institutionalisation; and co-optation. We show that despite the
   symbiosis of the state and political parties and overall parties'
   loyalty to the regime, they differ in strategy and degree of involvement
   in social movements on an organisational level. We argue that the
   mechanism of party institutionalisation explains the switch between
   involvement and abstention, while co-optation does a better job in
   explaining the ``support/counteract{''} choice.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {23},
Number = {7, SI},
Pages = {1077-1096},
Abstract = {Many problems confronting today's societies are transnational in
   character, leading states to increasingly rely on international
   organizations (IOs) for policy solutions. Yet, the performance of IOs
   varies extensively. This contribution suggests that systematic,
   comparative research is required to advance our understanding of IO
   performance, and that a policy output approach offers particular
   advantages for that purpose. This approach privileges the results IOs
   produce in terms of policies, and is distinct from the main alternative
   approaches to IO performance, emphasizing either behavioural change by
   targets (policy outcome) or problem-solving effectiveness (policy
   impact). The contribution introduces a typology that captures five
   generic features of policy - volume, orientation, type, instrument and
   target - and explains how these dimensions may be used to map the output
   and assess the performance of IOs. The contribution concludes by
   discussing what methods and theories may be most useful in explaining
   policy output, as the research agenda on IO performance advances.},

Abstract = {This article offers a descriptive analysis of the propaganda activities
   of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb on Internet social media. It examines
   the group's propaganda actions from its creation in 1998 until the end
   of 2015 and argues that the use of social media, Twitter in particular,
   has failed to offer any real remedy to its mediocre propaganda actions.
   During the period in which its Twitter profiles were active, the
   organization continued to manifest the same problems, including a
   shortage of qualified human resources and poor internal coordination,
   which had prevented it from engaging in efficient propaganda activity
   previously. The study of the social media experience of the group offers
   further evidence of the vulnerabilities of this Maghrebi jihadist
   organization.},

Abstract = {The victory of the radical-left SYRIZA in the September 2015 election
   confounded expectations given the failure of the SYRIZA-ANEL government
   formed in January either to deliver on its central promise of reversing
   austerity policies or to capitalise on its major victory in the July
   referendum. The article examines both the election and the referendum
   that preceded it, offering an explanation for SYRIZA's victory. It also
   attempts to trace the trajectory of the current party system in Greece
   and its ongoing realignment process in light of the 2015 electoral
   contests and the busy political timeline since the formation of the
   first SYRIZA-ANEL government.},

Abstract = {Ever since the 197os, ``pathamentarization{''} as Europe's has been
   conceived as the voie royale to the gradual democratization o f EU
   polity, and reform treaties have attempted to shape and stage Europe as
   a ``representative democracy{''} comme les mitres. Yet, the handling of
   the recent crisis of the Eurozone over the past six years has
   highlighted the continued precariousness of democratic legitimacy in the
   context of the European Union. Drawing on results from the political
   science literature, this chapter points at the relative failure of this
   sophisticated institutional engineering of a European ``representative
   democracy,{''} always at risk of appearing as a mere ``Potemkin
   democracy.{''} Part of this failure to re-orient Europe's political
   trajectory lies, I suggest, in our inability to seize Europe as it
   really is.},
