Abstract = {The article assesses whether the homogeneity of preferences of the
   largest member states is required for European Union (EU) cohesiveness
   to materialize ahead of the Group of Twenty (G20) meetings. In
   particular, it examines the economic preferences of France, Germany and
   the United Kingdom against the content of the EU-agreed negotiating
   stance in the G20 Leaders meetings that took place from 2008 to 2012.
   The analysis focuses on the three main economic dossiers that have
   characterized the G20 Leaders agenda since its creation, namely:
   financial regulation, fiscal policy co-ordination and macroeconomic
   imbalances. In doing so, the article argues and illustrates that
   preference homogeneity was not a necessary condition for EU cohesiveness
   but medium levels of cohesiveness materialized on issues and at times
   when the economic preferences of the large member states were
   fundamentally different, provided that the issues under negotiations
   were not politically salient.},

Abstract = {Earlier chapters conducted a philosophical investigation into a
   particular set of moral problems, set against a background of particular
   philosophical dimensions. The aim of this chapter is to examine the
   practical implications of the interconnected ethical approach that has
   emerged from this analysis and to consider implications for aid
   practitioners, institutions, and policy-makers. Beginning with two
   real-world cases, this chapter will seek to explain how current
   practices and policies can and do result in unintended outcomes, how
   such outcomes are currently hidden from moral scrutiny, and how
   responsible action, inclusive engagement, and accumulative duties within
   an interconnected ethical approach are impeded by contemporary
   institutional arrangements. It then considers what measures would be
   required from a policy and practice perspective to ensure that outcomes
   can be evaluated and scrutinised so that recipient populations can be
   protected, assisting agencies can act responsibly, and unintended harms
   can be addressed. It examines the implications for the various sets of
   actors engaged in the practice of assistance introduced in chapter one
   and seeks to establish the ethical reference points that can guide
   industry actors in their activities, and provide a more informed basis
   for ethical practices of assistance. From a policy perspective, such an
   account demands a much more holistic approach to aid, with a specific
   need to bridge policy and institutional gaps between humanitarian action
   and short term interventions, with longer term development aims and
   objectives.},

Abstract = {Many of the leading theories of the policy process are aimed at
   providing insights into the factors that make policy change more (or
   less) likely. In general, policy change is seen as a result of shifting
   dynamics within policy subsystems. However, building on theories of
   policy feedback and interest mobilization, this article examines whether
   policy change, apart from being an effect of subsystem dynamics, can be
   a cause of shifting dynamics as latent actors are motivated to
   participate in the subsystem as a result of policy change. Two
   hypotheses regarding post-policy change mobilization are developed and
   tested using data on participation in congressional hearings concerning
   the management of nuclear waste. The findings suggest that policy change
   can activate latent policy actors, specifically those actors that view
   themselves as losing as a result of the policy change. These results
   point to the need for scholars to examine the potential impacts of
   post-policy change dynamics on policy development.},

Title = {Differential Online Exposure to Extremist Content and Political
   Violence: Testing the Relative Strength of Social Learning and Competing
   Perspectives},
Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {28},

Abstract = {The present study applies Social Learning (Differential Association)
   Theory to the explanation of political violence, focusing on exposure to
   extremist content through new social media (NSM) and controlling for key
   variables derived from rival theories. Data are gathered using (a) a
   paper-and-pencil study among high school students, and (b) a web survey
   targeting youths between 16 and 24 years old. A total of 6020
   respondents form the dataset. Binary logistic regression is used to
   analyze the data. Results show that even when controlling for background
   variables, strain variables, personality characteristics, moral values,
   and peer influences, the statistical association between measures of
   extremism through NSM (ENSM) and self-reported political violence
   remains significant and fairly constant. The most persistent effects are
   found for those measures where individuals actively seek out extremist
   content on the Internet, as opposed to passive and accidental encounters
   using NSM. Furthermore, offline differential associations with racist
   and delinquent peers are also strongly and directly related to
   self-reported political violence, as are some mechanisms from rival
   perspectives. This indicates that political violence can only partially
   be explained by social learning and suggests that the impact of ENSM is
   mediated by real-world associations and that the offline world has to be
   taken into account.},

Abstract = {The 2008 Constitution was the political opening for food sovereignty in
   Ecuador. By framing food sovereignty as a right to sumak kawsay (living
   well), the indigenous and peasant movements garnered support from
   diverse social groups and sectors forming coalitions like the Red
   Agraria. Through these coalitions, the social movements have shaped and
   negotiated policy in new ways. The Red Agraria works with the state's
   Conferencia Plurinacional e Intercultural de Soberania Alimentaria
   (COPISA) to formulate policies at local and regional levels and then
   negotiates these policies in the National Assembly. In this process,
   COPISA has helped create a synergistic relationship between civil
   society and the state. While it remains unclear whether social movements
   and the state will move toward implementation and practice, current
   gains in terms of synergies and opportunities for negotiation have been
   instrumental in institutionalizing food sovereignty.},

Title = {Towards deliberative and pragmatic co-management: a comparison between

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {729-748},
Abstract = {In seeking to answer the question `who should be included in fisheries
   co-management?', a constructive critique of the existing co-management
   literature is provided by filling the gaps of Habermas's deliberative
   theory of democracy with Dewey's pragmatism. Three conditions for
   ensuring democratic co-management are extrapolated from the theories:
   actors' authority over decision making (empowerment), actors' diversity
   (membership), and the right to self-nomination (procedures for external
   inclusion). The theoretical insights developed are supported with two
   examples of co-management institutions for inshore fisheries in the UK:
   Scottish Inshore Fisheries Groups (IFGs) and English Inshore Fisheries
   Conservation Authorities (IFCAs).},

Abstract = {This article explores the dynamics of institutional adaptation in
   fast-growing, highly interconnected polities in the developing world,
   and challenges the thesis in modernization theory which posits that
   economic growth and thus higher per-capita income lead over time to
   democracy. One mechanism often proposed to explain this link is the idea
   that economic growth and higher per capita income in a society lead
   individual citizens in that society to become more receptive to
   democratic values and norms, and that this receptivity can pave the way
   for the birth of democracy. Yet evidence increasingly demonstrates that
   the link is at best tenuous and often not empirically valid. Why have
   many fast-growing economies and modernizing societies not made a
   transition to democracy, as predicted by modernization theory? This
   paper addresses this question, with ideas from complex adaptive systems
   and evolutionary social psychology, as well as case analyses of Turkey
   and China.},

Abstract = {The family has been central to the analysis of Philippine politics. As
   such, its political role has been extensively scrutinized. Several
   theories have been advanced to explain why political families are able
   to perpetuate themselves in power. Despite the seeming permanence of
   political families as a recurrent fixture particularly in Philippine
   local politics, several societal factors have begun to alter the
   political landscape. This paper is a case study of the political
   dynamics that unfolded in a locality that has had a long history of
   political domination by a single family. Doing this allows us to view
   clan politics from a different angle, particularly that of the erosion
   of their dominance over a selected municipality. It is argued here that
   this line of research has been relatively ignored in the studies of
   political families in the Philippines. Analyses of both structural and
   agential elements critical for engendering change in local politics are
   explored in-depth. The paper also looks into the voting patterns in the
   selected local community over three successive electoral cycles in order
   to understand the interplay of local political actors in the midst of
   urbanization and demographic change.},

Abstract = {The year started auspiciously with the successful visit of Pope Francis
   in Manila. Unfortunately, the afterglow of the event was overshadowed by
   the tragic death of 44 members of the Special Action Forces (SAF), 18
   members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the Bangsamoro
   Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), and five civilians in a botched
   operation to capture Indonesian terrorist Marwan in Mamasapano,
   Mindanao. The major political fallout from the tragedy was the breakdown
   of the peace negotiations with the MILF. The administration was also
   beleaguered by accusations of incompetence in connection with the
   monstrous traffic crisis in Metro Manila, extortion rackets at the
   airport, and the mismanagement of LRT and MRT railway systems.
   Nonetheless, it demonstrated decisiveness in pursuing an arbitral case
   against China at the Permanent Court of Arbitration. Despite overseeing
   a succession of impressive economic growth, the legacy of the Aquino
   administration and the victory of its anointed successor in the 2016
   elections are endangered as a result of these political controversies.},

Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {74},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The article analyzes adaptations to the EU. Focus is on Norway's trade
   relations with the EU in the fields of food and agriculture. These
   fields are partially covered by the 1994 EEA Agreement (food
   regulations) and partly excluded (agricultural policy). The research
   questions are: 1) How have trade relations with the EU evolved since the
   EEA Agreement entered into force?; 2) What can explain Norway's
   adaptations to the EU? The article shows that Norway has adapted fully
   on areas covered by formal EEA obligations. However, Norway has gone
   even further in its adaptations to the EU. These ``voluntary{''}
   adaptations can partly be explained by an economic logic where
   issue-linkages and domestic economic interests are at play, and partly
   by the authorities' perceived constraints and obligations to cooperate
   with the EU in trade liberalization. The article shows how a combination
   of institutional constraints and balancing of economic interests has
   shaped Norway's adaptations to the EU, also in areas that were not
   originally part of the requirements of the EEA Agreement.},

Title = {Education outlay, fiscal transfer, and inter-region funding equity: a
   county-level analysis of education finance in China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE GOVERNANCE},

Abstract = {Over the past three decades, education finance in China has
   transitioned, against the background of high economic growth and fast
   socio-political development, from a local-only financing regime to a new
   regime that involves a combination of local, provincial and central
   funding. Beginning in year 2000, the central and provincial governments
   have stepped in to reduce inter-region disparity and to improve equity
   and the overall quality of basic education throughout China's vast rural
   areas. The fast-track transition provides a good window for scholars to
   study the impact of the changing education finance regimes. The paper
   analyses the differential effects of the local, provincial and central
   funding levels on the within-province equity of education finance, and
   provides evidence on how policy shocks in a fast growing economy can
   affect education provision in a transitioning system. We test the
   differential effects of the financing regime transition on the equity of
   education finance, taking advantage of provincial level data and a panel
   data set of county-level jurisdictions across the country. With a
   constructed inequity index, we examine the impact of policy shocks,
   controlling for multiple factors. While our results suggest the measures
   taken may have dampened growth in inequity, they do not provide evidence
   of improved equity overall, revealing that disparity is still growing
   between developed and less developed counties.},

Title = {Achilles' heels of governance: Critical capacity deficits and their role
   in governance failures},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {301-313},

Abstract = {This article assesses the usefulness of conceptions of policy capacity
   for understanding policy and governance outcomes. In order to shed light
   on this issue, it revisits the concept of governance, derives a model of
   basic governance types and discusses their capacity pre-requisites. A
   model of capacity is developed combining competences over three levels
   of activities with analysis of resource capabilities at each level. This
   analysis is then applied to the common modes of governance. While each
   mode requires all types of capacity if it is to match its theoretically
   optimal potential, most on-the-ground modes do not attain their highest
   potential. Moreover, each mode has a critical type of capacity which
   serves as its principle vulnerability; its Achilles' heel. Without high
   levels of the requisite capacity, the governance mode is unlikely to
   perform as expected. While some hybrid modes can serve to supplement or
   reinforce each other and bridge capacity gaps, other mixed forms may
   aggravate single mode issues. Switching between modes or adopting hybrid
   modes is, therefore, a non-trivial issue in which considerations of
   capacity issues in general and Achilles' heel capacities in particular
   should be a central concern.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the lessons learned from American and coalition
   experience in dealing with extremist groups such as al-Qaeda and the
   so-called Islamic State or ISIL. It also deals more generally with
   extremist networks, which increasingly have the capacity to function as
   nonstate actors, not only threatening the existence of a growing number
   of fragile states but increasingly acting as proto-states themselves. I
   raise issues that should be considered as the United States and its
   allies and partners gird themselves for the long-term struggle against
   violent extremism. I also address the challenges faced after long years
   of war, the general considerations in forming a coalition, the means for
   establishing and implementing a strategy, and thoughts on a way ahead in
   a negatively trending security environment. I focus on what needs to be
   done and avoid specifically praising or condemning successes and
   failures of the past.},

Abstract = {The ongoing European economic crisis provides a focus for academics
   wishing to understand the relationship between major exogenous shocks
   and changes to environmental protection. Yet, measuring change,
   particularly to policies, is notoriously fraught with difficulties. This
   research note explores the conceptual and methodological challenges
   associated with capturing change in response to the economic crisis in
   Europe, specifically focusing upon the environment. The environment is
   typically touted as a European Union success story, but there is good
   reason to suspect that this policy sector may have been - and continues
   to be - negatively affected by the economic downturn. We suggest a
   toolkit of measures that can capture changes to this sector, and which
   may also be employed by researchers of other policy sectors.},

   has been thoroughly evaluated by EU-commissioned impact reports and

   development transfers have been largely neglected. Concepts, methods and
   conclusions reached by studies of North-South development aid can help
   greatly to understand the medium- and long-term political impact of EU
   funds. This article is based on interviews with EU and Greek
   politicians, officials, beneficiaries and various stakeholders. The
   conclusion is a less positive - but familiar in other parts of the world

Abstract = {This article studies the consequences of the increased appointment of
   political Commissioners for the legislative process. Based on the
   principal-agent relation between the Council and the Commission, it is
   hypothesized that governments sharing national and partisan ties with
   the Commissioner responsible for a legislative proposal are less likely
   to cast a negative vote. Analysing 687 contested legislative proposals
   voted upon between 1999 and 2014, it is found that a Member State is
   indeed less likely to vote against a proposal by the Commissioner from
   that Member State. Likewise, if the responsible Commissioner is a member
   of the same European Party Group as at least one of the governing
   parties, contestation is less likely. European Commissioners seem to use
   the discretion the EU's legislative system grants them to promote the
   preferences of their home country and also - to a lesser extent - their
   party family.},

Abstract = {Ambivalence and misconceptions surround the Collective Security Treaty
   Organisation (CSTO). Relying upon the literature on multilateralism,
   state-IGO relations, regionalism and security governance, this study
   examines: which goals Russia is pursuing in its CSTO policy; how Russia
   engages with its individual members within the organisation; how Russia
   uses it in five foreign policy situations and with which results. It
   shows that Russia's CSTO policy is more mixed and complex than is
   usually assumed. Russia uses the CSTO in pursuit of unilateral ambitions
   but it is also searching for partners. Russia's policy has resulted in
   the formation of instrumental multilateralism within the CSTO.},

Abstract = {Examining the oil and gas industry in the Russian Arctic, this article
   investigates the gap between corporate social responsibility (CSR) as
   articulated in corporate offices and implemented at the local level. In
   Russia, global CSR norms interact with weak formal institutions and the
   strong informal expectations of state officials and local communities
   that companies bear responsibility for welfare and infrastructure. As a
   result, the concept of citizens as stakeholders' is underdeveloped.
   Instead, local residents remain subjects within a neo-paternalist system
   of governance that mimics some elements of the Soviet past. Compensation
   for damages to indigenous peoples has blurred legal obligations and the
   voluntary nature of CSR. However, the CSR in the region is constantly
   developing and formal methods of compensation may assist in clarifying
   the scope and practice of CSR.},

Abstract = {The end of World War II brought little relief to the lands it ravaged
   most. Mass wartime violence continued in the Soviet space beyond the
   false peace' of 1945. Historians have sought to explain this violence in
   terms of the wartime brutalisation' of state and citizens alike, though
   this approach is limited in explaining how and why violence continued
   after 1945. This article shifts focus from psychology to social history
   to argue that the disintegration of Soviet state control is central to
   explaining the enduring violence after 1945 and understanding its
   emergence as much from below' as from above'.},

Abstract = {Reparations programmes are one form of response to violence. However,
   scholars have criticized their tendency to focus on restoring victims to
   the position they were in before the conflict began, usually through
   awarding restitution, compensation or rehabilitation measures. Instead,
   critics have suggested that reparations should aim to transform the
   societal conditions that contribute to sexual violence and the
   inequality of women and girls through recognition, redistribution and
   representation. This article builds upon this emerging scholarship to
   explore the potential for transformative reparations in international
   criminal tribunals through examining the reparations mandate and
   practice of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC).
   It concludes that the ECCC's legal and institutional framework, and the
   context in which it operates, limit the contribution that it can make to
   transformation. It is therefore important to be realistic about what can
   be expected from such institutions.},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {68},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {699-725},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This essay uses the concept of security governance to explore the
   implications of Russia's intervention in Ukraine for the rules-based
   security order in Europe. It outlines key ideas in the literature about
   the post-Cold War European security order with respect to Russia's role
   and examines Russian debates on the Ukraine conflict. It then
   investigates European institutions' reaction to the conflict in order to
   understand to what extent Russia's exclusion (as a result of the West's
   policy of containment and deterrence) or self-exclusion now constitutes
   a structural factor in the security politics of the wider Europe. The
   essay concludes with the analysis of the challenges facing both Europe
   and Russia and considers the prospects for re-shaping this order to give
   meaning to partnership and shared security governance.},

Abstract = {This article takes a step toward filling the gap in the scholarly
   literature by examining the impact of religious intervention in the
   military on civil-military relations. Using the case of Israel, I argue
   that although the subordination of the Israeli military to elected
   civilians has remained intact, and the supreme command has been mostly
   secular, external religious authorities operate within the formal chain
   of command and in tandem with the formal authorities, managing the
   military affairs. This religious influence is apparent in three major
   domains: (1) the theological influence on military deployment, (2) the
   exclusion of women from equal participation in military service, and (3)
   the role expansion of the Military Rabbinate as a quasi-state agency and
   its reflection in the socialization of secular soldiers and the
   development of alternative military ethics. Consequently,
   extra-institutional control of the military is at work.},

Abstract = {Rationalization, a core concept of Max Weber's sociology, has so far
   largely been ignored in International Relations (IR) theory discussions,
   although his ideas about rationalization open new pathways for
   theorizing modernity and conflict. We revisit Weber's concepts of
   rationalization and domination to show the limits of two key bodies of
   related knowledge in IR: scholarship on international organizations as
   bureaucracies and ideas on rationalization in the world polity approach.
   Rereading Weber's approach to rationalization provides a distinct ground
   for our understanding of the current internationalization of rule. We
   illustrate the contribution our approach to rationalization makes by
   looking at budget support to sub-Saharan African states, and Mozambique
   in particular. The article concludes with a discussion of the
   implications that a critical rereading of Max Weber has for
   international politics.},

Abstract = {Since 1975, the numbers of Vietnamese living in Europe have steadily
   increased. As new emigrants appeared in various countries, new types of
   crime came with them. Also in the Czech Republic, where a relatively
   large Vietnamese diaspora has been in existence since communist times,
   numerous Vietnamese criminal networks were established. The Vietnamese
   networks have a specific structure and modus operandi. Their bosses
   create parallel power structures within the Vietnamese diaspora and
   frequently merge together legal and illegal activities. The Vietnamese
   criminal networks are engaged in a broad spectrum of criminal
   activities, including economic crime, people smuggling and trafficking
   in drugs.},

Abstract = {This article is concerned with the relationship between `reparations'
   and `assistance' in transitional justice (TJ). While seemingly
   technical, this issue exposes fundamental tensions at the heart of TJ:
   between inclusive and exclusive approaches to reparative justice;
   between the legal strictures of redress and the complex realities of
   violence; and between the supposed symbolic power of reparative justice
   and victims' actual experience of reparations in practice. I present two
   contemporary examples to demonstrate this: the International Criminal
   Court's forthcoming reparations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
   and Colombia's recent reparations program for victims of its armed
   conflict, both of which highlight that the line between reparations and
   assistance can become blurry in practice. They can look similar in form,
   have similar impacts, be distributed through similar processes and
   impart similar notions of responsibility and recognition to victims.
   Yet, in such contexts, there will always be forms of harm, types of
   violence and immediate needs that fall outside the boundaries of
   reparations programs. Assistance measures are a useful and necessary
   tool to help reparations overcome these shortcomings. Depending on how
   they are used and communicated to victims, assistance measures can both
   detract from the significance of reparations and increase their reach
   and impact. These cases present valuable lessons about how to navigate
   this tension. In particular, they suggest that while practitioners
   should always clearly understand the differences between reparations and
   assistance efforts, it may be better in some cases to intentionally and
   carefully blur the distinction.},

Abstract = {Neoliberal restructuring has targeted not just the economy, but also
   polity, society and culture, in the name of creating capitalist market
   societies. The societal repercussions of neoliberal policy and reform in
   terms of moral economy remain understudied. This article seeks to
   address this gap by analysing moral economy characteristics and dynamics
   in neoliberalised communities, as perceived by traders in Uganda and sex
   workers in Kenya. The interview data reveal perceived drivers that
   contributed to a significant moral dominance of money, self-interest,
   short-termism, opportunism and pragmatism. Equally notable are a
   perceived (i) close interaction between political-economic and
   moral-economic dynamics, and (ii) significant impact of the
   political-economic structure on moral agency. Respondents primarily
   referred to material factors usually closely linked to neoliberal
   reform, as key drivers of local moral economies. We thus speak of a
   neoliberalisation of moral economies, itself part of the wider process
   of embedding and locking-in market society structures in the two
   countries. An improved political economy of moral economy can help keep
   track of this phenomenon.},

Abstract = {This essay examines two recent Russian public debates related to Islam:
   the building of new mosques in Moscow and the terrorist action against
   Charlie Hebdo. It is argued that these cases exemplify two contradictory
   attitudes towards Islamic religiosity: a strong protection of
   `traditional religions', but also tightening control and the wish to
   keep non-Orthodox religiosity outside the public space. The opposition
   to new mosques reveals an attitude towards Islam as something alien, but
   the protection of religious sensitivities, including Islamic ones, finds
   much support. These two examples reflect the simultaneous projects of
   the desecularisation and secularisation of Russian society.},

Abstract = {In the early 1990s, John Ruggie famously referred to the European
   Community as an emerging `postmodern polity'. This article elaborates on
   the `postmodern promise' of European integration that Ruggie invoked,
   and formulates such a promise of European integration as one of
   radically breaking with the violent practices characteristic of the
   modern state. We argue that such a promise is immanent albeit
   historically marginalized in the project of European integration itself,
   exemplified in the article with a tradition called integral federalism.
   The article then evaluates such a `postmodern promise' in current
   practices of European integration against the background of a
   poststructuralist-informed critique of the violent effects of desires
   for bordered entities and identities. Such a poststructuralist
   sensibility enables the article to point to the problems of `scaling up'
   the state in a project of integration that also set out to challenge and
   subvert its organizing principles.},

Title = {The (impossible) repo trinity: the political economy of repo markets},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {23},
Number = {6},
Pages = {967-1000},
Abstract = {In its capacity as debt issuer, the state has played a growing role in
   financial life over the last 30 years. To examine this role and connect
   it to shadow banking, the paper develops the concept of the `repo
   trinity', which captures a set of policy objectives that central banks
   outlined after the 1998 Russian crisis, the first systemic crisis of
   collateral-based finance. The repo trinity connected financial stability
   with liquid government bond markets and free repo markets. It further
   reinforced the dominance of the US government bond market as
   institutional template for states adjusting to a world of independent
   central banks, market-based financing and global competition for
   liquidity. Central banks and the Financial Stability Board recognized
   the impossible nature of the trinity after 2008, attributing cyclical
   leverage (financial instability) and elusive liquidity in collateral
   markets to deregulated repo markets, markets systemic to shadow banking.
   The new approach triggered radical changes in crisis central banking but
   has not powered significant regulatory interventions in the absence of
   an alternative mode of organizing government bond markets.},

Abstract = {The European crisis has many causes. Worse, the different causes are
   mutually reinforcing. National economies lost competitiveness within the
   single currency, governments and households lived beyond their means,
   banks and other financial firms moved capital across borders and then
   called it back home again in a fit of panic. Europe is suffering as a
   consequence. European policy-making is suffering as well. With so many
   `causes', politicians are dividing their attention across different and
   at times competing remedies. Europe appears to be `muddling through'
   rather than acting decisively as a result. This paper argues that
   European policymakers should focus their attention on financial causal
   mechanisms. Although there is some truth to claims about lost
   competitiveness and excessive borrowing, a close focus on financial
   markets promises to offer the greatest leverage over the largest number
   of national economies. A close focus on finance also offers a clear
   choice between competing policy agendas: Europe's politicians must
   choose either to accept a renationalization of finance or they must
   embrace reforms necessary to stabilize international financial market
   integration. Only once that choice is made, and the necessary policy
   agendas are put in place, should politicians again turn their focus to
   issues of second-order (if still significant) importance related to
   market structural reform, fiscal consolidation, or asset market
   regulation.},

Abstract = {Early critics of the euro's design pointed to the disruptive
   potential-both political and economic - of country-specific shocks in a
   monetary union that is a far cry from an optimal currency area. The euro
   crisis has confirmed the risks associated with a `one-size-fits-all'
   monetary policy, decentralized financial supervision, and inadequate
   fiscal backstops. This article examines how the active use of national
   fiscal policies and macroprudential policies can mitigate these risks.
   Cross-border coordination of macroprudential policies is essential to
   ensure their effectiveness. In addition, area-wide reforms are necessary
   including a more complete banking union with a well-funded common
   backstop.},

Abstract = {This essay discusses modernisation from the point of view of the
   reformist drive to create increased opportunities for consumption in
   state socialist society from the 1960s onward. Within these reforms
   competition was a means to accelerate entrepreneurialism and creativity
   that were needed to reorient production to better fulfil the need for
   increased consumption. Competition was essentially a market-type of
   behaviour in a non-market-oriented society. In the urge to revitalise
   the communist system, the use of market models grew over time and
   eventually competition contributed to the gradual transformation of
   values widely across society and became a significant factor openly
   questioning the basis of the whole system.},

   Emergence of the Scientific Centre in Chernogolovka},
Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {68},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1179-1196},
Abstract = {This article explores the emergence of Chernogolovka, a scientific town
   near Moscow, during Khrushchev's thaw. Nikolai Semenov, the founder of
   the town, relied on the Khrushchev regime's fascination with modern
   science, its interest in expanding the scientific enterprise, and the
   more relaxed atmosphere of the thaw to transform what the Soviet state
   intended to be a military testing ground into a renowned scientific
   centre. This case study demonstrates that there was space for individual
   initiatives in the post-Stalinist system, as long as they came from
   well-connected individuals and conformed to the political and
   ideological objectives of the state.},

Number = {2},
Pages = {217-233},
Abstract = {What is the status of women scholars who study Canadian foreign policy
   (CFP)? Our study, the first of its kind to concentrate on the Canadian
   situation, addresses this question by studying publications and
   authorship. We assess the status of women in CFP since 1945 using the
   Canadian Foreign Relations Index, supplemented by studies on women in
   the academy. We show that the number of publications by women is
   substantially lower than those of men, and work by women remains
   underrepresented in the so-called core of what is traditionally defined
   as CFP. Regardless of the nature of the work, women scholars are less
   represented, and they appear to be disadvantaged by mixed collaborative
   work. These findings speak to the culture and personality of the
   discipline. They invite us to revisit assessments of the discipline as
   ``mature{''} and ``robust{''}.},

Abstract = {This chapter, written primarily as a letter to colleagues, grapples with
   one psychology instructor's attempts to understand why incorporating a
   civically engaged curriculum into an introductory psychology course
   initially appeared like an easy and intuitively obvious endeavor, but
   was ultimately very difficult to achieve in a way that felt meaningful
   and authentic. I begin by reflecting on my previous attempts to bring
   ``the civic{''} into psychology, as well as on students' struggles to
   build that critical bridge between the psychological concepts discussed
   in class and the community-based endeavors grounding the civic
   engagement component of the course. Following, I propose a curricular
   revision, which draws on narrative methodologies to assist students in
   using core psychological concepts as a vehicle for thinking about
   persons-in-context and working towards social change. Key features of
   this curricular revision include writing one's life story, interviewing
   an activist or community leader, and attempting to understand this
   activist's commitments via core psychological concepts such as
   ``generativity,{''} ``identity,{''} `` observational learning,{''} and
   ``prejudice.{''} Ultimately, I call for further reflection on what it
   means to ``do civic engagement{''} both within our particular
   disciplines and within the context of teaching and learning at a
   community college.},

Abstract = {In this paper, Sweden is used as an example of how organised politics
   has changed quite dramatically in the last couple of decades. The paper
   argues that there are a number of points that has recently changed
   Swedish organised politics in rather fundamental ways. These changes
   entail a new actor constellation in Swedish politics and policy-making,
   decreased visibility of political processes and the emergence of a
   strong feedback loop between inequality, participation and public
   policies. What this amounts to is a very different form of elite-driven
   policy-making than the old corporatist structures. An amorphous and
   quite invisible but still highly elite-driven process has emerged, in
   which inequality has increased dramatically, and the impact of money on
   politics has become stronger even in Sweden.},

Abstract = {The politics and party system of the late Civil War era are strikingly
   similar to what we have in the present day. Elections were consistently
   close; race, culture, immigration, and populism were salient issues; and
   states almost always voted for the same party in election after
   election. The states that supported Democrats then, however, mostly
   support Republicans now, and vice versa. In 1896, though, a new party
   system began to emerge. In this article, we evaluate bygone elections
   alongside contemporary ones to assess whether 2016 might be the
   beginning of something new in American electoral politics. Are national
   politics likely to follow the familiar pattern of the last four
   presidential races, or are Americans going to be presented altogether
   different choices? Our analysis suggests that race and populism are
   guideposts for potential change in 2016: if the concerns of race
   continue to define political conflict, the electoral map should change
   little, but if economic populism eclipses race as it did in 1896, a new
   political era may be ushered in in America.},

Abstract = {The logic of electoral competition suggests that candidates should have
   to adopt moderate issue positions to win majority support. But U.S.
   presidential candidates consistently take relatively extreme positions
   on a variety of important issues. Some observers have attributed these
   polarized positions to the extreme views of the parties' core
   supporters. I characterize the issue preferences of core Republicans,
   core Democrats, and swing voters over the past three decades and assess
   how well the positions of presidential candidates reflect those
   preferences. I find that Republican candidates have generally been
   responsive to the positions of their base. However, Democratic
   candidates have often been even more extreme than the Democratic base,
   suggesting that electoral polarization is due in significant part to
   candidates' own convictions rather than the need to mollify core
   partisans. Neither party's presidential candidates have been more than
   minimally responsive to the views of swing voters.},

   argue that homonationalism has evolved from its original formulation as,
   in part, a critique of politics, into, in its current guise, a
   diagnostic of international political relations. Although this
   transition offers insight into the international scene, I argue that
   homonationalism also loses its distinctiveness as a political formation
   in its own right as well as its critical capacity in the process. In
   particular, I argue that homonationalism becomes incapable of critically
   evaluating activist strategies, practices and discourses of political
   resistance.},

Abstract = {As 2015 got underway, most Americans were poised for another Bush vs.
   Clinton presidential election, but by the middle of the year it was
   clear something unexpected was unfolding in the race for the White
   House. In this article, we illuminate the political landscape heading
   into the 2016 election, paying special attention to the public's mood,
   their assessments of government, their attitudes about race and members
   of the other party, and the health of the nation's economy. Fundamental
   predictors of election outcomes did not clearly favor either side, but
   an increasing ethnic diversity in the electorate, alongside a racially
   polarized electorate, was favorable to Democrats. Ultimately, an
   ambivalent electorate divided by party and race set the stage for a
   presidential primary that played directly on these divisions, and for a
   general election whose outcome initially appeared far from certain.},

Abstract = {Since 1991, Russia has become one of the leading immigration
   destinations in the industrialised world. The inflow has prompted
   substantial public opposition, as surveys show that half or more of the
   public want to limit new arrivals. The sources of public disapproval,
   however, are unclear: while public discourse includes complaints about
   perceived economic and cultural ills of immigration, research on public
   opinion finds that neither economic nor cultural concerns have a
   consistent impact on individual attitudes. This study provides a new
   analysis, showing that economic vulnerability and cultural orientations
   (such as social conservatism and low levels of interpersonal trust) play
   a significant role in shaping anti-immigrant sentiment.},

   the conflict in Ukraine in light of the wider contestation between the

   Ukraine is first and foremost a symptom and not the root cause of the
   wider conflict between Russia and the West. The essay puts particular
   emphasis on examining the problems in the EU's approach concerning the
   East. In particular the problems in policy and scenario planning are
   pointed out. The essay ends with conclusions, warning of the potential
   for a wider rupture and even conflict between the EU and the West and

Abstract = {This essay investigates the shift in Germany's Ostpolitik approach to
   Russia as a result of the latter's increasing domestic authoritarianism
   and assertive foreign policy, particularly its violations of
   international law in the Ukraine crisis. This prompted Germany to take
   the initiative in formulating EU sanctions against Russia. However,
   Germany has attempted to reconcile the sanctions policy with a
   diplomatic approach to resolving the Ukraine crisis by seeking ways of
   engaging Moscow on broader security and economic issues, as Russia is
   considered an essential factor in European and global security and a key
   energy supplier. Thus, Ostpolitik has not been abandoned altogether; it
   continues to play a role and shapes the long-term objectives of
   Germany's Russia policy.},

Abstract = {Online criminal histories document and publicize even minor brushes with
   the law and represent people who may not even be guilty of any crime.
   This has dramatically changed the relationship that millions of
   Americans have with the criminal justice system and may affect their
   social and private lives. Drawing on interviews and fieldwork with
   people attempting to expunge and legally seal their criminal records, I
   explore how online versions of these records impact family
   relationships. Many who appear on mug shot and criminal history websites
   are arrestees who are never formally charged or convicted of a crime.
   The indiscriminate posting of all types of justice contact on websites
   may impact those who, for the most part, desist from crime and are core
   contributors to their family and community. I find that many of those
   who are affected by the stigma of online records did not know that
   records existed until they popped up unexpectedly, and that this
   experience leads them to self-select out of family duties that
   contribute to child well-being.},

Abstract = {The Europeanization literature predominantly credits the empowerment of
   pro-reform political elites through the EU's incentives for the
   democratization of non-EU countries. The existing studies
   under-emphasize the societal dimension of the EU's impact and the
   normative context in which the EU's leverage is applied. Taking a
   societal perspective, this article examines societal empowerment as an
   alternative to elite empowerment and proposes four mechanisms of EU
   influence on democratization through societies taking into account the
   EU's structural power and actorness, and considering their effects on
   the societal sphere and societal actions. Applying the mechanisms to a
   tough case for societal mobilization for democracy - Bulgaria - the
   article shows how the EU, through representing a legitimate model of
   democratic governance, has created a strong pro-reform societal
   constituency that can sustain the democratic dynamic. The article also
   demonstrates the relevance of cross-national diffusion processes for
   pro-democracy societal mobilization.},

Abstract = {What happens when a Member State challenges the unwritten rule of
   consensual decision-making in the Council of the EU? Are their diplomats
   marginalized, or do other countries make an extra effort to attempt to
   get them on board? In this article, I use the UK (United Kingdom) in the
   area of financial and economic EU co-operation as a case study to
   explore these questions. The British government has been unwilling to
   sign up for a range of recent EU crisis-management measures and has not
   been afraid of utilizing its veto. Based on 33 interviews with diplomats
   from 20 countries, this article demonstrates that British diplomats have
   not become marginalized, but changes have occurred; other countries no
   longer go the extra mile to get the UK on board and they are worried
   that they will be seen as obstructive if they align themselves with the
   UK.},

Abstract = {The period of very high foreclosure rates sets the 2007-8 financial
   meltdown apart from similar banking crises fueled by asset price booms.
   Why did the 2007-8 meltdown lead to a prolonged foreclosure crisis?
   Through a theoretical perspective built on Minsky's financial
   instability hypothesis, Polanyi's ideas about adverse consequences of
   commodity fiction, financialization of homes, and institutional
   coupling, I argue that commodifying houses as financial assets exposed
   mortgage loan holders to price fluctuations originating in capital
   markets and elevated their risk of default. I show how increased
   exposure to price fluctuations followed from the tight coupling between
   U.S. housing and capital markets, a coupling that resulted directly from
   the rising preponderance of securitization in U.S. housing finance. I
   provide further evidence from countries where housing finance was
   tightly coupled with capital markets (Iceland and Ireland) to countries
   where housing finance did not rely dominantly on capital markets (Canada
   and the Netherlands).},

Abstract = {Hans Morgenthau's The Purpose of American Politics was published in
   1960, at the end of the Eisenhower administration and on the eve of the
   civil rights movement and military intervention in Vietnam. It is
   Morgenthau's first attempt to author a book primarily about the United
   States, exploring opposing American political traditions and their
   implications for foreign policy. In the process, he comments on past and
   present domestic and foreign crises and the ways they are refracted by
   Hamiltonian and Jeffersonian understandings of the national purpose.
   Morgenthau is drawn to the Hamiltonian approach, which is realist in its
   assumptions; but he is nevertheless sympathetic to the Jeffersonian
   emphasis on freedom, which differentiates America, in his view, from
   other countries. The book represents Morgenthau's coming to terms with
   America, lauding the purposes for which the country was founded, but the
   overall argument is pessimistic. Morgenthau contends that America has
   lost its sense of purpose, on the home front and abroad. When read next
   to his Scientific Man vs. Power Politics, published in 1946, the book
   reveals a significant shift in his intellectual and political
   orientations.},

Title = {Reparations for `Guilty Victims': Navigating Complex Identities of
   Victim-Perpetrators in Reparation Mechanisms},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {146-167},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Reparations are often declared victim-centred, but in transitional
   societies defining who is a victim and eligible for reparations can be
   politically charged and controversial. The messy reality of conflict
   means that perpetrators and victims do not always fall into two separate
   categories. In certain circumstances, perpetrators can be victimized and
   victims can be responsible for victimizing others - this article
   explores these complex victims. Looking in particular at the 1993
   Shankill bombing in Northern Ireland, as well as at Colombia and Peru,
   such victims are often seen as `guilty' or `bad' victims undeserving of
   reparations. I argue that complex victims need to be included in
   reparation mechanisms to ensure accountability and to prevent their
   exclusion becoming a source of victimization and future violence. I
   consider the alternative avenues of human rights courts, development
   aid, services and community reparations to navigate complex identities
   of victim-perpetrators. I conclude that complex identities can be
   accommodated in transitional societies' reparation programmes through
   nuanced rules of eligibility and forms of reparations.},

Abstract = {During the Great Recession, Slovenia recorded one of the worst economic
   performances within the EU. Such a decline is surprising as the country
   was the most stable among the post-socialist states. The article
   individuates the root cause for the downfall in protracted reform
   gradualism, which resulted in an inefficient privatisation process. This
   locked the country into a partial reform equilibrium' where economic
   elites extracted rents. Following accession to the EU, the unsustainable
   lending practices of state-owned banks to corporate organisations and
   the gridlock in policymaking pushed the country into an economic and
   political bad equilibrium'. Even though the Slovenian export sector
   proved to be surprisingly resilient, a massive debt overhang and a huge
   reform backlog are still weighing down on a healthy recovery.},

Abstract = {Alexander Hamilton was the first US Treasury Secretary from 1789 to
   1795. When he started, the federal government was in default. During his
   tenure, US Treasuries became the ultimate safe asset. He successfully
   managed expectations, achieved debt service reduction, and stabilized
   financial panics. He delivered sound public finances and financial
   stability. In the end, the US possessed a modern financial system able
   to finance innovation and growth. At a time when Europe is working its
   way out of the sovereign debt crisis and implementing banking union and
   financial union, it is worthwhile to search for lessons from early US
   history.},

Pages = {465-489},
Abstract = {The literature on intelligence contains many laments that scholars of
   intelligence have not developed widely accepted theories, or even
   definitions, of intelligence. This paper describes, compares, and
   modestly theorizes about intelligence-related activities of two variants
   of non-state actors - violent insurgent/terrorist groups and advocacy
   NGOs - focusing on their counterintelligence and covert action-like
   activities. These groups operate in some ways similarly to, and in other
   ways dramatically different from, states' intelligence services. This
   comparative analysis extends the scope of intelligence studies and
   offers suggestions for additional research.},

   Visa Regime with the European Union},
Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},

Volume = {68},
Number = {1, SI},

Abstract = {This essay examines Russian argumentation on its visa-free regime with
   the EU within the context of discussions about modernisation. It
   examines arguments within the Russian foreign policy establishment about
   modernisation, Russia's modernisation partnership with the EU and
   visa-free travel, and how these issues are linked. First, the essay
   outlines two models of Russian modernisation, comprehensive and
   selective. Then the Russia-EU modernisation partnership is examined
   focusing on Russia's view of the nature of the partnership. Finally, the
   essay analyses Russian argumentation on visa-free regime and
   liberalisation. The essay concludes that in the Russian modernisation
   debate, be it comprehensive or selective, inclusion into the Western
   community is understood as an important prerequisite for modernisation.},

Abstract = {This article considers the political uses of conspiracy theories (CTs).
   It is widely accepted that post-Soviet citizens are prone to believe
   CTs, but there has been little research about the conditions under which
   politicians endorse conspiracy narratives and why those narratives
   sometimes become hegemonic. I argue that in times of high uncertainty,
   CTs have properties that are useful in providing political elites with a
   focal point for coordination in the absence of other bases for coalition
   formation. I demonstrate this logic by analyzing the politics
   surrounding the construction and spread of a conspiracy narrative
   following violence in Kyrgyzstan in 2010. Politicians with different
   interpretations of the event coalesced around a contrived conspiratorial
   narrative, and used it to paper over differences as they formed a ruling
   coalition. This argument has implications for how to understand the
   appearance and durability of conspiracy claims in states where political
   formations are fluid.},

Abstract = {IED attacks in Afghanistan went from 797 attacks in 2006 to 15,222
   attacks in 2012. In that time, 53,997 IEDs and their human collaborators
   injured more than 11,416 US soldiers and killed over 1,298 soldiers in
   Afghanistan. If you include Iraq, IEDs account for almost two-thirds of
   all US soldiers wounded and killed in both wars. This article
   investigates why something as low-tech as an improvised bomb is so
   significant to contemporary warfare. The article contends that, contrary
   to the effort to ``beat{''} the IED by the US Department of Defense, the
   IED is not a thing. The IED, I argue, is a condition of possibility
   present in almost all of contemporary life. IEDs are native inhabitants
   of a world of global relations and things that hover on the edge between
   tool and weapon. IEDs are the weaponization of the throbbing refuse,
   commerce, surplus, violence, rage, instant communication, population
   density, and accelerating innovation of contemporary global life. IEDs
   are ambient, integrated, and distributed by methods that make it
   difficult to detect and combat. Unlike precision weapons, IEDs are
   neither smart nor dumb. They are, I argue, environmentally aware.},

Abstract = {As the struggle against violent extremism continues 15 years after 9/11,
   practitioners of counterterrorism note that law enforcement and military
   approaches alone cannot break the cycle of violence, and new threats
   emerge as existing threats are defeated. This article provides an
   overview of post-9/11 efforts related to countering violent extremism
   (CVE), or the prevention, intervention, and rehabilitative efforts to
   provide a noncoercive, nonkinetic pathway toward preventing recruitment
   and radicalization to extreme violence. Specifically, this article
   explores the spread of the ISIS ideology and the Obama administration's
   CVE efforts, and provides an overview of subsequent articles in this
   series that expand on particular CVE approaches.},

Abstract = {Since 1970 the United Kingdom, like the United States, has developed a
   winner-take-all political economy characterized by widening inequality
   and spectacular income growth at the top of the distribution. However,
   Britain's centralized executive branch and relatively insulated
   policymaking process are less amenable to the kind of organized combat
   that Hacker and Pierson describe for the United States. Britain's
   winner-take-all politics is better explained by the rise of political
   ideas favoring unfettered markets that, over time, produce a
   self-perpetuating structural advantage for the richest. That advantage
   is, in turn, justified and sustained by reference to the same ideas.
   Inequality growth in the United Kingdom has been primarily driven by the
   financialization of the economy that began under the Thatcher government
   and continued under New Labour. The survival of pro-finance policies
   through the financial crisis provides further evidence that lobbying by
   a weakened City of London was less decisive in shaping policy than the
   financial sector's continuing structural advantage and the tenacity of
   its supporting political consensus.},

Abstract = {One of the key motives behind recent reforms of the EU's legislative
   process has been to increase efficiency. This study examines whether the
   Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon treaties have successfully increased the
   speed with which the EU creates new laws. An interrupted time series
   approach is utilized to detect the total effects of treaty change on the
   decision-making process. This study thus complements existing research
   on the effects of decision-making rules, by employing a design more
   robust to the challenge of endogeneity. The findings suggest that the
   Amsterdam treaty was very successful at increasing legislative
   efficiency. In contrast, the Nice treaty does not appear to have had a
   notable impact, and, more interestingly, neither does the Lisbon treaty.},

Abstract = {Union competition law protects `consumer welfare', but what role do
   consumers play in competition policy-making? This is the question that
   this article seeks to answer. In the search for an answer, the article
   investigates the moral ( output) and procedural ( input) legitimacy of
   the recent competition law reforms. Following a discursive approach, the
   article looks into the roles played by institutions deliberating for
   citizens ( consumer organizations, European Parliament and the Union
   Courts) in the reform process. This inquiry results in the questioning
   of the reforms' legitimacy, and it also leads to broader conclusions
   regarding the legitimacy of multi-level governance: expert discourses
   overshadow potential deliberative qualities of networks, which
   exacerbates networks' legitimacy problems. Also, the input/output
   legitimacy dichotomy appears problematic, as expert policy-making in the
   absence of citizen participation does not guarantee policies resonating
   with public interest.},

Abstract = {Decisions to deny asylum are often based on highly speculative
   credibility assessments. Language barriers, trauma, and cultural
   misconceptions have all been shown to impact the perceptions examiners
   form about cases. Yet, although contestable in principle, many negative
   rulings retain an aura of objectivity and are accepted as justified by
   the case's lack of empirical support and legal fit. This article
   examines how this aura of objectivity is accomplished. How is it that
   the essentially contestable nature of credibility assessments gets
   downplayed, so that the decision to deny asylum appears to be dictated
   by law and evidence? To address this question, the article draws on a
   case encountered during ethnographic research on the work of status
   determination in Brazil: the decision to deny refugee status to the
   asylum seeker known as Mrs. Z. It is argued that maintaining the
   perception that there was a pivotal moment of definition is a central
   aspect of how the decision to deny Mrs. Z's request came across as
   warranted. Talk of a pivotal moment of definition, the article shows,
   fosters the perception that the relevant sources of controversy ``have
   been dealt with,{''} foreclosing the possibility of dissent. Drawing on
   the work of American ethnomethodologist Michael Lynch, I adapt the
   notion of `` phase-work{''} to refer to this discursive device.},

Title = {Citizen preferences and public goods: comparing preferences for foreign

Abstract = {Different theories about the impact of aid make distinct predictions
   about citizens' attitudes toward foreign aid in recipient countries. We
   investigate their preferences toward aid and government projects in
   order to examine these different theories. Are citizens indifferent
   between development projects funded by their own government versus those
   funded by foreign aid donors, as aid capture theory suggests? To address
   this, in an experiment on a large, representative sample of Ugandan
   citizens, we randomly assigned the names of funding groups for actual
   forthcoming development projects and invited citizens to express support
   attitudinally and behaviorally. We find that citizens are significantly
   more willing to show behavioral support in favor of foreign aid projects
   compared to government programs, especially if they already perceive the
   government as corrupt or clientelist or if they are not supporters of
   the ruling party. They also trust donors more, think they are more
   effective, and do not consistently oppose aid conditionality. This
   experimental evidence is consistent with a theory that we call donor
   control which sees donors asbeing able to target and condition aid so
   that it is not fungible with government revenues and thus to be able to
   better direct it to meet citizens' needs.},

Abstract = {Why are some developing countries less open to technical election
   assistance than to election observation? My argument about who seeks and
   receives technical election assistance is two-fold, taking into account
   the incentives of recipients and providers. On the recipient side,
   governments are less likely to request technical assistance when the
   political costs are high (autocracy) or the benefits low (strong
   electoral institutions). On the provider side, international
   organizations are less likely to provide such technical assistance when
   the government appears to lack political will for reform and full
   project implementation is unlikely. Statistical analyses of global data
   on technical election assistance by the United Nations covering 130
   countries from 1990 to 2003 support this argument about political
   cost-benefit calculations in considering technical assistance. Case
   examples from Guyana, Indonesia, Haiti, and Venezuela illustrate some of
   these dynamics. My findings suggest that seemingly complementary
   international interventions (observation and technical support) can
   create different incentives for domestic and international actors. This
   helps explain why some countries tend to agree more often to election
   observation than to technical election assistance.},

Abstract = {This article analyses how Sarajevo's young adults from a middle class,
   interethnic background deal with the rigid ethnic categorisation
   enforced by state institutions and society. Their strategies (exit,
   reframing, and partial separation) appear to be unsatisfactory to the
   actors themselves, and wield generally no influence on the institutions
   they wish to change. Three factors have been setting into motion this
   dynamic: first, the difficulty of escaping ethnic group thinking when
   attempting to reframe ethnic categories; second, the rationality of
   avoiding open defiance to ethnic categorisation; and third, the young
   adults' tendency to centre their life on interethnic and international
   spaces. As a project elite', Sarajevo's young adults are rather
   separated from society, both discursively and socio-economically.},

Abstract = {People affected by the Brazilian civil-military dictatorship (1964-1985)
   often resist acknowledging their own victimhood. This essay looks into
   possible reasons for this reluctance to self-identify as a victim.
   Towards that end, a philosophical analysis of what is known as
   `scapegoat theory' is undertaken. According to this theory, victims must
   be regarded as absolutely blameless, thus being defined exclusively as
   objects upon which violence is perpetrated. Consequently, victims do not
   recognize themselves as either subjects or free political agents, ones
   able to demand their rights within the public sphere. In this sense, to
   revisit the theme of human rights and how it relates to democracy may
   clear a potential path for reflection on what an actual `victim' might
   be.},

Volume = {664},

Abstract = {Mass incarceration is commonly understood as a sweeping national policy
   development, which has obscured remarkable local variation at the policy
   implementation stage. California's Realignment (Assembly Bill {[}AB]
   109; 2011) is a reform that exploits this variation by design. Research
   consistently finds that, net of crime, demographic, political, and
   system capacity characteristics explain the variation in incarceration
   across local jurisdictions. Do these characteristics also explain
   decarceration? This study uses group-based trajectory modeling and
   logistic regression to examine the association of such characteristics
   with California county trajectories of state prison use in the decade
   preceding Realignment. County imprisonment trajectories and their
   related characteristics are then assessed as explanations for
   decarceration under AB 109. Distinct risk factors for high and/or
   increasing imprisonment trajectories are identified, as well as apparent
   protective factors. A clear association was found between previous
   trajectories and decarceration, but county-level characteristics did not
   demonstrate the predicted effects. Results indicate that decarceration
   cannot be explained as merely the mirror image of incarceration and
   should be examined as a distinct phenomenon. Implications for future
   research and policymaking are discussed.},

Title = {Levels of Centralisation and Autonomy in Russia's `Party of Power':
   Cross-Regional Variations},

Abstract = {The institutionalisation and nationalisation of Russia's party system,
   which is dominated by United Russia (Edinaya RossiyaUR), has played a
   major role in the building of Putin's power vertical'. Nevertheless,
   despite the fact that formal relations within UR are highly centralised,
   informal practices allow for far greater degrees of regional autonomy.
   Focusing on UR's candidate selection for the 2011 Duma election this
   article provides an examination of cross-regional variations in the
   relations between UR's Party Centre and its regional branches. As
   electoral legislation requires the segmentation of party lists into
   regional groups', the composition of the regional lists, specifically
   the share of native candidates', is considered as an indicator of the
   level of autonomy of regional branches. Ordinal regression analysis
   confirms our main theoretical hypotheses. In the more financially
   autonomous regions, UR's regional branches will have more leverage and
   bargaining power in their relations with the Party Centre. A second
   important factor is heterogeneity: the more a region's socio-economic
   indices deviate from the national average (either up or down), the less
   its UR branch is subordinate to the Party Centre.},

Title = {In from the Margins: Survivors of Wartime Sexual Violence in Croatia and
   an Early Analysis of the New Law},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Survivors of wartime sexual violence are seldom a priority in
   post-conflict societies and Croatia is no exception. For the last 20
   years, those who suffered sexual violence during the war in the early
   1990s have received little care or attention. In May 2015, however, the
   Croatian parliament adopted the Law on the Rights of Victims of Sexual
   Violence during the Armed Aggression against the Republic of Croatia in
   the Homeland War. This Law provides survivors of wartime sexual violence
   with a comprehensive range of rights, from compensation and health
   insurance to psychosocial assistance and legal support. The recentness
   of the Law means that it is too soon to know how it will work in
   practice. This article, however, offers an early analysis of the Law,
   identifying both its major strengths and some of its more problematic
   elements. It draws upon the author's fieldwork in Zagreb during the
   summer of 2015, as well as her extensive work over a 12-month period
   with survivors of wartime sexual violence in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
   Emphasizing the importance of followup research on the Law, the article
   concludes by outlining a threefold approach for analysing the Law's
   implementation.},

Abstract = {Through the prism of Northern Ireland, this article explores the
   function of existing and proposed archives within societies emerging
   from conflict, and highlights their potential in adding complexity to
   understanding conflict and challenging dominant narratives. The article
   outlines how, despite progress since the Northern Ireland peace accord
   in 1998, efforts to deal with the past and human rights violations have
   been piecemeal and politically contested. In the absence of a
   comprehensive approach to the past, testimony gathering, initiated
   `unofficially' at a community level, has provided opportunities for
   individuals' experiences of the conflict to be documented and
   acknowledged. The recent Stormont House Agreement (2014) seeks to
   establish an Oral History Archive as a central repository for
   individuals to `share experiences and narratives related to the
   Troubles'. The article discusses the challenges in developing this
   `official' archive, and the problem of reconciling competing historical
   narratives of the past. This is contrasted against the growth in
   bottom-up `storytelling' or testimony work. The article argues for
   supplementing the official process with wider testimony gathering
   processes directed by and located within community contexts. It is
   argued that the deliberate juxtaposition of contrasting horizontal or
   inter-community narratives held by different local parties may allow for
   the emergence of a more complex and inclusive narrative of the past,
   rather than attempts to impose a shared vertical narrative, which is
   subject to either further contestation or uncomfortable compromise.},

Abstract = {Belarus has a divided identity that reflects its complex history and
   culture. A mixed-methods investigation incorporating focus groups and
   national representative surveys conducted over a decade or more suggests
   that Belarusians themselves are more likely to regard themselves as
   European than their counterparts in Ukraine and Russia, but less likely
   to do so than in other European countries. There is substantial support
   for a hypothetical European Union membership, particularly among younger
   respondents, but there is also strong and widely distributed support for
   a closer association with the other members of the Commonwealth of
   Independent States. Consistently, it is the multidirectional foreign
   policy promoted by the current leadership, which seeks closer relations
   with East and West at the same time, that finds the greatest support.
   But a Slavic choice is also popular, and much more so than a Western
   choice or isolationism.},

Abstract = {This article explores how practice theory can be recruited for the study
   of European integration. New generations of EU researchers are
   fascinated by the prospect of leaving the armchair and studying the
   people and artefacts that make the EU on an everyday level. This article
   surveys key practice-oriented, anthropological and micro-sociological
   studies of the EU and European integration and shows how their findings
   challenge more traditional understandings of the dynamics of European
   integration. Moving beyond a stock-taking, the article distinguishes
   between `ordering' and `disordering' practices and explores the
   potential of a practice turn in EU studies for both theory (overcoming
   dualism, replacing substantialism with processualism and rethinking
   power) and methods (including unstructured interviews, fieldwork and
   participant observation). A practice turn will force us to rethink core
   assumptions about the EU and allow us to grasp otherwise uncharted
   performances and social activities that are crucial for European
   integration.},

   contribute to the debate on EMU governance and EU institutional reform.

   It then identifies policy priorities for the short and medium term. It
   uses these priorities to shape a longer term agenda for a sustainable
   Europe. And it concludes with suggestions for further research. If any
   economics window on an interdisciplinary crisis may shed some light,
   perhaps a political science window could shed more.},

Volume = {31},

Pages = {201-223},
Abstract = {Lessons for the intelligence community were publicly identified in a
   1983 report by Lord Franks and a 2004 report by Lord Butler. However,
   little is known of the lessons learned during the 20 years between the
   two. This article draws upon two newly released, previously classified,
   documents which examine British intelligence lessons from the 1990-91
   Gulf War. It provides a previously untold account of the crisis,
   exclusively from a British intelligence perspective, and presents new
   evidence that intersects across many intelligence debates. This article
   also challenges whether identified lessons remained learned and begins
   to question the wider learning process within the intelligence
   community.},

Abstract = {This article advances feminist analysis in the study of European
   integration through a focus on gender power in relation to masculinity
   constructs. It takes issue with the fact that gender studies tend to
   equate gender with women. It sketches a feminist contribution to
   integration theory, where the EU is perceived as gender regimes at
   multiple levels. Gender identity constructs-masculinities and
   femininities-rely on difference and are shifting across time, levels and
   sectors. Yet the variations of identity constructs are limited by
   well-established ideas-gender binaries-providing continuity and path
   dependences to maintain the gender system, for example through the ` EU
   protector masculinity ` in the EU CSDP. European integration thus is a
   process whereby EU masculinities and femininities are constructed
   through EU relations to other states in the global context and in EU
   policy-making and institution-uilding.},

Abstract = {The article argues that dissident voices which attempt to theorise
   Europe differently and advocate another European trajectory have been
   largely excluded and left unheard in mainstream discussions over the
   past decade of scholarship and analysis. Dissident voices in European
   Union studies are those that seek to actively challenge the mainstream
   of the study of Europe. The article briefly examines the discipline of
   mainstreaming, then surveys the extent of polyphonic engagement in EU
   studies, before setting out how the special issue contributors move
   beyond the mainstream. The article will argue the merits of more
   polyphonic engagement with dissident voices and differing disciplinary
   approaches for the health and vitality of EU studies and the EU policy
   field itself. It summarises the special issue's argument that by
   allowing for dissident voices in theorising Europe, another Europe, and
   another theory, is possible-indeed, probable.},

Abstract = {This essay explores the symbolic role played by football in the
   Tito-Stalin Split (1948-1953). In particular, it examines the Yugoslav
   national team's victory over the Soviet Union at the 1952 Olympics in
   Finland. It asks how Yugoslav sports administrators, athletes and the
   press negotiated the transition from a position of affectionate sporting
   emulation of the USSR, to one of hostile opposition. Both regimes paid
   close attention to international sporting competition and its potential
   propaganda benefits. Shedding light on an early intrasocialist rupture,
   this case deserves to be considered alongside better known instances of
   sporting conflict in the Cold War.},

Abstract = {In the present study we examine gender stereotyping in the traits and
   images emphasized by candidates in state judicial campaigns. Content
   analyses were conducted on televised campaign advertisements from state
   supreme court contests in election years 2008-2010. Our analyses
   indicate that women referenced masculine traits and were shown with
   masculine images in their ads more than men. In addition, the gender
   makeup of the race made a difference; when running against a man, women
   stress intelligence and being hardworking more than men. Conversely,
   women mentioned experience to a high degree when running against other
   women.},

   analysis of the evidence reveals how weak the Bolsheviks' influence was
   in the north. The result of this was a conflict of interests between the
   centre and Petrozavodsk over the policies introduced by the central
   Bolshevik government, Sovnarkom. However, this period of the Civil War
   was also one of survival, defined by a determined and united local

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to theorize the relationship between art
   and justice in times of transition so that a broader spectrum of
   political possibilities and their implications can be imagined. The aim
   is to offer a way to think about, and to render visible, the web of
   relationships that constitute this bond. By undertaking a close analysis
   and narrative investigation of the art installation REwind: A Cantata
   for Voice, Tape and Testimony, I use the artwork to elucidate four key
   ideas relating to paradigms, agency, encounters and space which make art
   relevant and meaningful to transitional justice. These four ideas frame
   two central arguments. First, I argue that an account of transitional
   justice without aesthetic dimensions is insufficient, precisely because
   transitional justice `acknowledges itself as a process inseparable from
   feelings of justice.' Artworks can fill out affective topologies in ways
   that facilitate or stimulate recognition and a `feeling of being there.'
   Secondly, I contend that art plays an important role in animating and
   activating individual narratives so that they take on collective
   importance. In doing so, the past can be shared so that a new political
   future can be imagined.},

Abstract = {Scholars routinely cite the landslide defeats of Barry Goldwater and
   George McGovern as evidence that American electorates punish extremism
   in presidential politics. Yet systematic evidence for this view is thin.
   In this article we use postwar election outcomes to assess the electoral
   effects of extremism. In testing ten models over the seventeen
   elections, we find scant evidence of extremism penalties that were
   either substantively large or close to statistical significance.},

Abstract = {The European Union is unique among jurisdictions in having
   constitutionalized its policy goals and methods, by embedding these in
   the Treaties. As a result, the legislature is far more constrained in
   its activities than is the case in other constitutional orders. Yet the
   Treaties are indeterminate, and it is the Court of Justice which
   interprets and delimits them, and instructs the legislature on how and
   to what extent it may pursue them. There is, in substance, a
   principal-agent relationship between the Court and the EU legislature,
   enforceable by the Court's capacity to annul legislation contrary to its
   preferences. An examination of internal market legislation shows that
   indeed it consists of codification of prior case law. The judicial
   constraints on the EU legislature are sufficiently tight that the
   legislature is more akin to a subordinate implementing regulator than to
   an autonomous political policy-maker.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the manner in which the parliaments of the EU and
   the US-two key global strategic partners -participate in the shaping of
   transatlantic relations. The article argues that the European Parliament
   ( EP) and Congress aim not only to influence their executive branches
   but also to act autonomously in the transnational arena through
   parliamentary diplomacy. They seek to secure concessions both formally
   by scrutinizing transatlantic international agreements, such as TTIP, as
   well as informally by exposing injustices and diplomatic misconduct
   through human rights advocacy and institutional pressure, such as in the
   cases of the NSA surveillance and CIA renditions. The article
   demonstrates that the EP and Congress have created capacities for
   internal scrutiny and transnational interparliamentary dialogue and that
   they utilize their consent powers to make claims, condition
   transatlantic negotiations and gain greater presence, visibility and
   influence in international affairs.},

Abstract = {Lucio Baccaro and Jonas Pontusson make a significant contribution to
   comparative political economy with their approach to analyzing growth in
   advanced economies, which focuses on the demand side of the economy and
   distributive conflict. In contrast to Baccaro and Pontusson, however, we
   view their approach as reinforcing recent developments in varieties of
   capitalism rather than undermining them. We also believe that the type
   of modern macroeconomics used by (for instance) Carlin and Soskice is
   better placed than their post-Keynesian framework to analyze growth
   models, and that their approach is not inconsistent with it. Modern
   macroeconomic models incorporate, as they do not, a role for the
   state-including monetary and fiscal policy-and provide a coherent
   framework within which to analyze both the supply and demand sides of
   the economy; they also enable us to understand the interactions between
   economies and hence the role of growth models in global imbalances.},

Abstract = {The article examines how Russian criticism of the normative power Europe
   (NPE) has evolved. Initially Russia insisted that NPE arguments covered
   realpolitik. However, two new approaches have recently emerged in
   Russian reporting on human rights in the EU. One is the demonstration
   that the EU does not qualify as a normative power. Another is the
   development of an alternative interpretation of human rights. Russia
   has, therefore, mastered all NPE critiques. This has occurred as the
   result of a change in how Russia views international relations. Moscow's
   ultimate goal has, however, remained unchanged; it is to reaffirm its
   equality with key global players.},

Abstract = {Can international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) influence
   domestic policy? This paper offers new quantitative evidence of the
   impact of INGOs in one specific policy area-Freedom of Information (FOI)
   laws-as well as highlighting an under-studied mechanism of INGO
   influence on the design of domestic laws. I test this argument by
   examining the effect of legal analyses of draft FOI legislation
   published by the INGO Article 19. These analyses provide expert legal
   assessments and make normative evaluations-both information politics and
   symbolic politics. I find that in countries in which Article 19
   conducted legal analyses, the design of the subsequently passed FOI laws
   was significantly stronger than in countries that were not subject to
   such analyses. I demonstrate that this finding is not an artifact of
   Article 19's selection process. I also present suggestive evidence that
   highlights symbolic politics, not information politics, as the more
   salient mechanism. Finally, I examine the process of FOI drafting and
   adoption in Serbia to illustrate the argument and specific mechanisms at
   work.},

Abstract = {California's 2011 Public Safety Realignment created an unprecedented
   policy experiment by transferring the authority over lower-level felony
   offenders from the state correctional system to fifty-eight county jail
   and probation systems. While centered in California, these changes are
   reflective of an ongoing national conversation about the appropriate
   level of government at which to focus crime control efforts. In this
   article, we first situate Realignment in criminological and sociolegal
   literatures, showing how the reform offers opportunities to further
   inquiry as to the effectiveness of a wide variety of correctional
   strategies, implementation, and local variation in correctional law and
   policy. We then review early research focused on the statewide effect of
   Realignment on recidivism, which has produced mixed findings depending
   on the measure of recidivism applied. We then examine variation in
   recidivism outcomes across county sites and present findings that
   indicate there is an important relationship between local Realignment
   implementation strategies and recidivism outcomes. Throughout, we focus
   on two overarching themes. The first is the challenge of disentangling
   the roles of offender behavior from justice system response in
   meaningfully interpreting changes in recidivism outcomes. The second is
   the challenge of evaluating the effects of policy or practice changes
   under limited data. Although the need for better and more expansive data
   is a common theme, we highlight it here in the context of a larger data
   collection that we have under way.},

Abstract = {This article examines the documentation of war crimes and human losses
   in Kosovo under the conditions of contested transitional justice and
   ethno-nationalist politics of remembrance. The article argues that the
   documentation of war crimes in Kosovo was utilized for retributive
   justice by the international community, for political revenge by former
   foes, and for power/identity consolidation by local protagonists.
   Attempting to overcome this suffocation of the past, the new politics of
   remembrance in Kosovo propagated by civil society groups aspires to
   liberate the past from ethno-nationalist tendencies by constructing a
   bottom-up and virtual memorialization. This is deemed to be inclusive
   for all sides in conflict; indestructible in its virtual and
   post-material constellation; and distinct with regard to volume and
   reliability. While civil society-based documentation has the potential
   to overcome the ethno-nationalist entanglements in Kosovo and to
   compensate for the inability of international transitional justice
   mechanisms to deliver justice and truth to victims, its impact on
   overcoming the past and improving ethnic relations in Kosovo remains
   questionable. Accordingly, the article illustrates the contextual
   interplay between material, relational, and virtual forms of remembrance
   in Kosovo.},

Abstract = {Pre-crisis global governance of finance was marked by considerable
   preference alignment between the two regulatory great powers, the US and
   the EU. The article's explanation of this surprising pattern in
   regulatory preferences takes the institutional context of global finance
   seriously. It highlights the endogenous, temporal effects of
   inter-national institutions at the core of global economic governance:
   transnational regulatory networks and the soft law they produce.
   Transnational soft law is not simply an articulation of a focal point,
   we demonstrate, but also a political resource that may be employed by
   reform-minded agents dissatisfied with their domestic policy status quo.
   We label such feedback processes `templates-as-disruptors,' meaning that
   the establishment of transnational soft law by regulatory networks at
   t(1) creates policy templates that disrupt pre-existing internal (e.g.
   domestic) political contests at t(2). In addition to improving an
   understanding of historical events and great power preference alignment,
   the paper highlights the temporal effects of informal cooperation and
   domestic--international interaction in global governance.},

Abstract = {Why, in the current geo-political and strategic context seemingly in
   stark contrast to the ``War on Terror,{''} does the emphasis on women in
   US foreign policy persist? Why the repeated references to the
   vulnerability of women who ``need{''} US help to become ``empowered{''}
   in the countries of the Arab Spring? An examination of US policymakers'
   discourses indicates a neo-orientalist biopolitical construction of the
   (Muslim) female population as one in perpetual need of
   ``empowerment,{''} presumably by American or western benefactors. Public
   statements by US foreign policy officials, discussions of government
   programs and Congressional testimony add to the repertoire of a
   western-constructed archaeology of neo-orientalist knowledge of Islam.
   Further, these gendered discursive ``imperial encounters{''} create
   open-ended possibilities for US interventionist policies in the region
   for years to come. The Arab (Muslim) woman may have participated in
   sparking and sustaining revolutions and even bringing down dictators,
   but she must still be trained and taught - by Americans or westerners.
   The sometimes didactic, often foreboding ``concern{''} for her
   empowerment is more nuanced, but no less significant, than the professed
   commitment to ``saving{''} her as justification for military operations
   in the heyday of the War on Terror.},

Abstract = {A European scholar explores the changing dynamics of integration
   processes within the Eurasian Customs/Economic Union in the new context
   created by the Ukraine crisis. The article examines positions adopted by
   member states Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus before and after onset of
   the crisis in Ukraine. Several rationales for justifying the Union are
   derived from international relations theory and documented in the
   rhetoric of actors from these three countries. The evolution of
   conflicting rhetorical postures mirrors a slowdown of the Eurasian
   integration process and growth in the bargaining leverage of Belarus and
   Kazakhstan vis-a-vis Moscow.},

Abstract = {This article explores one of the earliest centrally organized state
   intelligence services in world history. Contrary to the orthodoxy that
   sees systematized intelligence as a modern political phenomenon, this
   was developed in early modern Venice. The article reveals the complex
   organization of Venetian systemized intelligence that distinguished it
   from other contemporaneous states' espionage networks. It also shows how
   Venetian authorities commodified intelligence by engaging citizens and
   subjects in a trade of information for mutual benefits. Ultimately, the
   article challenges our understanding of early modern political
   communication and offers a fresh vista of intelligence as a business
   trait and economic necessity.},

Abstract = {In their battle to succeed Stalin in 1953, Lavrentii Beria and Nikita
   Khrushchev temporarily cooperated to launch an indigenising nationality
   policy in the Soviet Republics to compete for support among the
   non-Russian nationalities. The impact of this little known collaboration
   was the `New Course' for the Soviet periphery. This essay examines the
   `New Course' and its repercussions in Latvia. Moscow struggled to
   control the programme after it unleashed a wave of anti-Russian
   sentiment. With encouragement from nationalists in the Latvian
   leadership, Russian cadres were ousted from leading Party and government
   positions, sent back to Russia and replaced by ethnic Latvians.},

Abstract = {This essay examines the role of mechanisms and Bayesian inference in
   process tracing. With respect to mechanisms, I argue that the core of
   process tracing with causal inference is the identification of
   mechanisms understood as intervening events. Events are different from
   standard intervening variables when used with process tracing, because
   events are treated as sets in which cases can have membership. With
   respect to Bayesian analysis, I concur with recent writings that suggest
   Bayesian inference is at the heart of process tracing. The Bayesian
   nature of process tracing explains why it is inappropriate to view
   qualitative research as suffering from a small-N problem and certain
   standard causal identification problems. More generally, the paper shows
   how the power of process tracing as a qualitative methodology depends on
   and grows from its set-theoretic underpinnings.},

Abstract = {The euro area crisis has exposed flaws in the institutional framework of
   the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The immediate causes of
   the crisis have been widely debated - including weak governance,
   persistent erosion of competitiveness in some countries and easy
   financing by banks. However, there is little discussion about a
   fundamental shift in the nature of European integration, which took
   place in mid-1990s when plans for launching the euro became credible and
   binding. It was not understood that Europe had shifted from a Common
   Market Era, during which EMU's foundations were laid, to a `Union Era'
   which in retrospect exhibited an incomplete institutional framework.
   This article reviews the leap in governance now taking place, whilst
   taking stock of what has worked and proved resilient over the previous
   60 years. This is done by means of an index - the European Index of
   Regional Institutional Integration (EURII) - providing a tool to
   synthesise and monitor European institutional integration since 1958,
   and track all institutional reforms since 2010. EURII has both backward
   as well as forward-looking components anchored on the project put
   forward in the 2012 Four Presidents' Report.},

Abstract = {This essay uses the numerous statistics produced by revolutionary
   tribunals to explore the nature of counter-revolution after the October
   Revolution, how it changed and developed across the Civil War, and the
   importance of revolutionary justice, as represented by tribunals, in
   facilitating the Bolsheviks' victory. Statistics are unreliable sources
   and the state faced many problems in gathering data, but these figures
   permit us to explore key areas and trends, and demonstrate the ability
   of revolutionary justice to react in more nuanced ways to the
   counter-revolutionary threat than repressive organs such as the Cheka.},

Pages = {528-543},
Abstract = {This article examines the premises of corporate solutions to gender
   inequality in the Global South. In feminist debates, businesses'
   increasing emphasis on women's empowerment has been discussed both in
   terms of increasing feminist impact and the co-optation of feminist
   demands. To explore the ideological effects of corporate gender
   practices, focus is placed on the Coca-Cola Company's global ``5by20{''}
   campaign, which has the stated aim to empower five million women as
   small-scale entrepreneurs around the world and, in a ``win-win{''}
   fashion, to double sales by 2020. Based on interviews and participatory
   observations in Mexico, this article traces a particular narrative of
   empowerment, envisioned as a transition from dependency to
   self-sufficiency and threatened by psychological and cultural restraints
   rather than material conditions. It shows that self-help and positive
   thinking are essential affective drives, thus reinforcing market-based,
   individualized development strategies. In response to feminist debates,
   the article concludes that corporate gender practices can be seen as
   part of a neoliberal transposition of equality concerns from a political
   to an economic domain. In effect, when initiatives such as 5by20 promote
   the accumulation of ``human capital{''} to enhance gender equality, they
   simultaneously work to legitimize the inequalities that are necessarily
   entailed in competitive capitalism.},

Abstract = {For many citizens, public services are the most direct and tangible
   output of the democratic process, and yet in the past thirty years
   policymakers have privatized a broad swath of these services. This
   article asks whether privatization of state services changes citizens'
   willingness to use the ballot box to hold governments to account for
   service performance. It argues that citizens can hold governments to
   account for privatization, but only if they have genuine political
   alternatives. Where quality falls with privatization and citizens can
   vote for an anti-privatization party, what we call a clear signal,
   privatization can mobilize citizens to sanction incumbents. By contrast,
   where quality falls but there are few anti-privatization alternatives, a
   mixed signal, privatization reduces sanctioning behavior. To test this
   theory, the article draws on a panel difference-in-differences analysis
   of disability reform from the United Kingdom, leveraging a
   geographically varied introduction of private provision across two
   political contexts.},

Abstract = {How does International Criminal Court (ICC) action during ongoing
   conflict affect atrocities? This article addresses this question by
   analyzing the ICC's impact in the Democratic Republic of Congo vis-A
   -vis the CongrSs national pour la d,fense du peupleMouvement du 23-mars
   (CNDP/M23) rebel group, using data from original interviews with 36
   ex-CNDP/M23 combatants. The analysis suggests that ICC action produced
   mixed effects in this case. The publication of an arrest warrant in
   April 2008 for Bosco Ntaganda, then CNDP's chief of staff, had
   negligible effects. However, the announcement of the conviction of
   Thomas Lubanga and associated calls for Ntaganda's arrest in March 2012
   led to an escalation of atrocities, while Ntaganda's surrender in March
   2013 contributed to prevention by undermining M23's capacity. These
   findings suggest a broader reframing of ongoing debates and research to
   focus on the conditions under which ICC action alternately prevents,
   exacerbates or has no impact on atrocities, rather than whether the
   Court has any such effects.},

Abstract = {The first part of the article provides an overview of the efforts,
   initiatives, and contributions led by the Muslim World to confront the
   threats of violent extremism. I explore these efforts by highlighting
   contemporary key initiatives in two major categories: (1) global
   cooperation and (2) national strategies. The second part of the article
   provides an analysis of what is required to support the Muslim World in
   its efforts in countering violent extremism and what is the best
   approach to integrate these efforts into the wider global commitment to
   defeat violent extremism. These initiatives need continued support, and
   I argue that non-Muslim nations must continue to consider the Muslim
   World a strategic partner in the global efforts to prevent and counter
   violent extremism.},

Abstract = {The multi-level system of the EU (European Union) constrains the
   institutionalized representation of the regional tier of government.
   Consequently, SNAs (sub-national authorities) seek to represent their
   interests through various lobbying practices, including taking part in
   the European Commission's open consultations. In this article, we argue
   that varying levels with which SNAs take part in open consultations
   cannot be adequately explained by regional-level conditions such as
   resources or autonomy. Instead, we hypothesize that the specific policy
   context strongly affects regional involvement in open consultations. We
   test our hypotheses with evidence of the participation pattern of 296
   SNAs in eight online consultations situated in five policy areas: CAP
   (Common Agricultural Policy), EAP (Environment Action Programme),
   Horizon 2020, COH (Cohesion Policy) and TEN-T (Trans-European Network
   for Transport). Our analysis demonstrates that the probability that SNAs
   take part in open consultations increases significantly when private
   interests of the same region and/or other SNAs of the same country
   participate in the same consultation.},

Abstract = {One of the United States' main strategies of democracy promotion
   involves supporting civil society abroad. According to original data,
   most of the money spent by the United States on that task supports
   American NGOs working abroad rather than local NGOs in transitioning and
   non-democratic countries. Yet there are also significant variations
   across countries in donor officials' reliance on American NGOs. Why do
   American donor officials fund American NGOs as a strategy of aiding
   democracy abroad more in some cases than in others? This paper argues
   that donor officials find it easier to observe American NGOs than other
   NGOs and that American NGOs are more likely to share donor officials'
   preferences. Donor officials are therefore more likely to pursue a
   strategy of ``made-in-America{''} democracy support in countries that
   are salient for U.S. foreign policy. Evidence from a new data set of
   democracy assistance programs supports the argument. The findings have
   implications for the study of American foreign policy, foreign aid
   effectiveness, and NGOs in world politics.},

Abstract = {The article offers a succinct conceptual and analytical framework for
   approaching the `great rule of law debate' currently unfolding in the EU
   (European Union) and the contending positions of the various EU
   institutions embroiled in it. It addresses the challenge of
   conceptualization imbued in the notion of the rule of law, and
   critically examines the definition of the concept provided by the EC
   (European Commission). It then demonstrates that over the course of
   modern European integration, the rule of law emerged as a central
   dimension in four distinct core areas of EC/EU identity and activity.
   Should the contemporary crisis of foundational values persist or deepen,
   each of the four is expected to be adversely affected. Finally, the
   article explores the emerging `rule of law turn' in the EU.},

Abstract = {In the academic debate on the relative powers and influence of the EU
   institutions, it has become common to suggest - especially in the case
   of advocates of the `new intergovernmentalism' - that the European
   Commission is in decline. In this article we show that while in some
   limited respects this is indeed the case, the Commission's overall
   position in the EU system is not one of having become a weaker
   institutional actor. The extent of the losses of its powers and
   influence tends to be exaggerated, while in some aspects its powers and
   influence have actually been strengthened. We show this by focusing on
   three of the Commission's core functions-agenda-setter, legislative
   actor and executive-all of which are widely portrayed as being in
   decline. We incorporate into our analysis both the formal and informal
   resources available to the Commission in exercising the functions.},

Abstract = {The paper offers an account of the Euro crisis based on post-Keynesian
   monetary theory and its typology of demand regimes. Neoliberalism has
   transformed social and financial relations in Europe but it has not
   given rise to a sustained profit-led growth process. Instead, growth has
   relied either on financial bubbles and rising household debt
   ('debt-driven growth') or on net exports ('export-driven growth'). In
   Europe the financial crisis has been amplified by an economic policy
   architecture (the Stability and Growth Pact) that aimed at restricting
   the role of fiscal policy and monetary policy. This neoliberal economic
   policy regime in conjunction with the separation of monetary and fiscal
   spheres has turned the financial crisis of 2007 into a sovereign debt
   crisis in southern Europe.},

Abstract = {This article builds on prior studies that document how legal status
   stratifies society, specifically in outcomes related to international
   migration. Here, we study such outcomes in Bangladesh, a low-lying
   nation that has experienced dramatic environmental changes in recent
   decades and high rates of out-migration. We do event history analyses of
   a new and unique dataset that includes information from approximately
   eighteen hundred households in nine villages to investigate whether and
   how legal status differentiates out-migration from Bangladesh. We find
   substantial variation in legal status among the women and men who make
   an initial international trip and that unauthorized migration affects
   other labor market and economic outcomes: it reduces the number of hours
   that migrants work in destination countries, lowers the odds that
   migrants pay taxes or open a bank account, and increases the odds that
   migrants use social contacts to find jobs.},

Abstract = {Europeanization addresses the impacts of EU ( European Union) membership
   on national politics and policies. Over time, new policy processes have
   been developed, such as the use of soft law and the open method of
   co-ordination. What, though, are the consequences of these new processes
   for Europeanization? This article contributes to this under-researched
   area by examining the extent to which EU soft law influences policy
   adoption at the national level. Our empirical application is corporate
   governance, an area of growing EU policy interest, with significant soft
   law elements. We analyse the extent to which the European Commission's
   2003 plan to enhance corporate governance achieved its aim of
   `co-ordinating corporate governance efforts of Member States'. Our
   quantitative analysis of 95 national codes issued over 1992-2010
   suggests that the Action Plan did influence national policy-making, but
   that the degree of national policy alignment depends on when the
   corporate governance code was issued, where, and by whom.},

Abstract = {This article shows that planning for the organization of EU banking
   regulation and supervision did not just appear on the agenda in recent
   years with discussions over the creation of the eurozone banking union.
   It unveils a hitherto neglected initiative of the European Commission in
   the 1960s and early 1970s. Drawing on extensive archival work, this
   article explains that this initiative, however, rested on a number of
   different assumptions, and emerged in a much different context. It first
   explains that the Commission's initial project was not crisis-driven;
   that it articulated the link between monetary integration and banking
   regulation; and finally that it did not set out to move the supervisory
   framework to the supranational level, unlike present-day developments.},

Abstract = {In 1967, philosopher Bertrand Russell set up an unofficial war crimes
   tribunal to investigate the actions of the US in Vietnam. This article
   explores the link between the Russell Tribunal and transitional justice.
   In recent years, critical voices have called for a transitional justice
   that is less legalistic and state-centric and more concerned with
   socioeconomic issues. The Russell Tribunal was an early instance of a
   transitional justice practice whose traits resonated with these
   critiques. It challenged legalism, breached the judicial monopoly of the
   state and criticized the economic global order. Given this affinity, the
   Russell Tribunal can provide critical approaches to transitional justice
   with a historic antecedent and a mechanism to push their agenda forward.
   Unofficial tribunals, inspired by the Russell initiative, can be useful
   tools for a transitional justice that is broader and more amenable to
   alternative perspectives.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {The global diffusion of technology has spurred growth across a variety
   of sectors and increased linkages among actors in the global political
   economy. Advances in communication and travel technologies connect
   disparate regions around the world, while advances in medical
   technologies have increased the opportunities and options for both
   extending and creating life. Together these advances have led to the
   globalization of medical tourism and the rise of reproductive tourism.
   Reproductive tourism covers a variety of services, including surrogacy.
   As a result of such technological advances, not only is surrogacy
   increasing, it is increasingly transnational and commercialized. One of
   the top destinations for reproductive tourism is India, and Indian
   surrogates are becoming a hot commodity for western individuals looking
   to enlarge their families. Hailed by advocates as beneficial to all
   parties involved, critics are quick to point out the potential for
   exploitation and abuse in transnational commercial surrogacy
   arrangements. Adopting Spike Peterson's Reproductive, Productive and
   Virtual framing, this article explores the contradiction and the
   potential that results when the boundaries between economies blur and
   what has traditionally been considered a reproductive activity becomes
   another form of labor for sale.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {23},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {East Asian countries have implemented around 60 free trade agreements
   (FTAs), mostly bilateral, to become one of the most active sites of
   regionalism. The dominant analyses portray these FTAs as driven
   primarily by foreign policy motivations and promoted by political
   leaders with businesses marginally involved or interested. It is
   contended here that, compared to other forms of liberalization,
   bilateral FTA negotiations promote new institutional arrangements within
   government agencies and business associations and unique configurations
   of government-business relations. Formulation of FTAs imposes greater
   information demands on government officials, which should compel them to
   consult business associations. In turn, clearer identification of FTAs'
   impacts and greater chances to affect their formulation should increase
   business incentives to lobby for or against FTA liberalization
   domestically and across borders. Demands on officials and business
   associations upon successive FTAs should foster institutional
   change/creation to reduce information and coordination costs. These
   hypotheses were tested on the bilateral FTAs of Thailand and Malaysia.
   FTAs in these countries stimulated government-business consultations and
   lobbying by businesses that, for some key FTAs, took the initiative.
   Successive negotiations strengthened the technical capacities of
   officials and business associations and stimulated the emergence of new
   institutions, which may endure to provide similar functions for
   multilateral rounds.},

Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},

Volume = {10},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Policy designers seeking to harness profit-driven efficiency for public
   purposes are increasingly creating organizations with fractionalized
   property rights that distribute ownership among public and private
   actors. The resulting hybrids are quite diverse, including mixed
   enterprises, public-private partnerships, social entrepreneurship
   organizations, government-sponsored enterprises, and various other
   hybrid forms. Marrying public purposes to private sector efficiency and
   strategic flexibility provides a tempting rationale for mixing public
   and private owners in hybrid organizations. Because public-private
   hybrids involve fractionalized property rights, however, they exhibit
   tension among owners over both strategy and, more importantly, goals. To
   understand public-private hybrids, we assess them in terms of six
   dimensions of property rights: fragmentation of ownership, clarity of
   allocation, cost of alienation, security from trespass, credibility of
   persistence, and autonomy (of both owners and managers). The unclear
   allocation of fractionalized ownership rights facilitates the
   appropriation of financial residuals and asset ownership
   opportunistically. Other weaknesses in the property rights
   configurations of public-private hybrids create managerial dissonance or
   opportunistic behavior that typically leads to a narrowing of goals, but
   sometimes also to organizational failure.},

Abstract = {This research contributes to the literatures of Europeanization and
   European public administration by investigating EU rule advancement
   outside Europe. The article argues that the European Commission requires
   professional networks to advance the European Union (EU) acquis in
   Morocco and Algeria regarding climate change mitigation. However,
   certain conditions determine its network-building efforts outside
   Europe. Functional interests and sectoral interdependence provide the
   Commission with increased bargaining power in Morocco. Thus, market
   access and expertise offers trigger Morocco to develop technical
   dialogue over renewable energies. Instead, a Commission-led technical
   network over renewable energies creates antagonistic relations with the
   Algerian state elite. An alternative energy relationship with Europe
   beyond conventional resources could incur revenue losses for the state
   and a shift towards a different economic model. As a result, state
   hierarchies intervene in network-building and lead professionals to
   stagnant outcomes. The study takes an actor-centred approach, opting for
   proximity in network operations.},

Abstract = {This commentary highlights some of the key lessons from the preceding
   articles by Sarah Lageson on online criminal histories and Robert Apel
   on cohabitation and marriage. To provide additional perspectives on
   institutions and families, it draws briefly on interview data from the
   Minnesota Exits and Entries Project, comparing the reentry experiences
   of 18- to 25-year-olds leaving prisons, jails, the armed forces, the
   juvenile justice system, foster care, drug treatment, and mental health
   facilities. While the prison surely ranks among the most salient
   institutions for U.S. families today and as such merits close scrutiny,
   there is also great benefit in escaping prison: considering how the
   justice system might productively import or borrow ideas and programs
   from other institutional domains. In collectively showing how specific
   punishment conditions affect family life, we can provide the research
   base needed to help institutions better support individuals and
   families.},

Abstract = {Concomitant with globalization, neoliberal tax reforms have spread
   across the globe since the early 1980s. In many countries, statutory
   rates, the number of tax brackets, and the incidence of tax allowances
   have been reduced for income taxes; in the developing world,
   international liberalization has also been associated with reduced
   revenues from trade taxes and increased pressures for expansion of the
   value added tax and income tax revenue intake. Yet, competition for
   mobile assets and new opportunities for tax avoidance potentially
   constrains taxation of corporate and personal income. Thus, contemporary
   conditions create especially severe challenges for the pursuit of
   greater income equality and enhanced public goods provision in
   developing nations. The present paper situates this special issue's
   contributions within the theoretical and empirical literatures that seek
   to explain contemporary changes in taxation. I argue that we know quite
   a lot about the tax effects of globalization, domestic politics, and
   their interaction in rich democracies; we know much less about how
   international forces and domestic factors influence tax reforms in the
   developing world. In this context, I highlight how each paper in this
   volume contributes to our understanding of the impacts of globalization
   and domestic politics on tax policy choices and, in turn, the challenges
   and opportunities for revenue mobilization in developing nations.},

   Fair Trade International (FTI) certification. We focus on recent
   developments in the FTI certification system, including the split of
   Fair Trade USA from FTI and the emergence of the Small Producer's Symbol
   (SPP) as an alternative to FTI certification. We highlight the role of
   the three regional Producer Networks, in particular the Latin American
   Producer Network, the CLAC, in the politics and governance of the FTI
   system. In order to analyse these issues we employ an alternative
   reading of Karl Polanyi's work in relation to Fair Trade. We
   problematise the claim made by some in the literature that FTI
   certification is an example of Polanyi's concept of re-embedding.
   Instead, we draw on Polanyi's concept of oversight to analyse Fair Trade
   certification. We argue that the emergence of the SPP out of the CLAC
   shows promise for being a mechanism of oversight more reflective of
   Polanyian re-embedding than FTI certification. We also emphasise how the
   growth of the SPP and the pressure from the Producer Networks have
   prompted governance reform within the FTI system.},

Abstract = {One of the most contentious issues of the neoliberal agenda has been the
   privatisation of public services. The WTO GATS negotiations over the
   liberalisation of trade in services, which commenced in the year 2000,
   led to a strongly contested debate over whether the international level
   would provide an additional channel for the privatisation of public
   services. In particular, the position of the European Union was
   criticised for promoting this agenda. More recently, this question has
   regained its significance with the start of negotiations for the Trade
   in Services Agreement and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment
   Partnership. Thus, this article seeks to analyse the politics of scale
   in the field of trade in services and its specific impact upon the
   liberalisation of public services. By applying a Neo-Poulantzian IPE
   approach, we propose a typology of (i) scalar forms in trade policy and
   (ii) of particular liberalisation strategies. Our results suggest that
   the multilateral level is but one element in a strategic politics of
   scale, with the former primarily fulfilling the role of locking-in
   liberalisation gains achieved at other levels, while other scalar forms,
   in particular bi- and plurilateralism, are primarily used to
   progressively advance the liberalisation agenda.},

Abstract = {The California Criminal Justice Realignment is often seen as a sui
   generis penal experiment in response to a court mandate. However, when
   examined in a broader context, it can be understood as part of a
   recession-era institutional effort to reduce prison costs, fueled by a
   discourse of austerity and financial prudence, which I refer to as
   humonetarian. This article examines Realignment, its predecessor, Senate
   Bill 18, and its successor, Proposition 47, as examples of humonetarian
   policy, characterized by a rhetoric of costs and savings; bipartisan
   support; inmate transference practices; and a focus on nonviolent,
   low-risk offenders, whose incarceration expenses exceed the risk they
   pose. The analysis yields two insights: one, the financial context of
   reform; and the other, the unique, neopopulist California flavor of this
   financial context, which stands in the way of even more effective
   reform. I end with thoughts about the promise and perils of
   humonetarianism in the California context.},

Abstract = {International humanitarian law (IHL) is increasingly being invoked as a
   potential legal vehicle for individual claims to reparations, including
   compensation, postconflict. In this article, I explore the limitations
   of such an approach. In particular, I examine the distinctly pragmatic
   nature of IHL, which takes as its starting premise the existence of
   armed conflict and from this point seeks to attenuate the effects of
   conflict and address the suffering and needs of those caught up in it.
   Drawing largely on the work of Jean Pictet, I consider how a
   rights-based approach - which is founded primarily on legal constructs
   rather than the broader needs of victims of conflict - fits with the
   conceptual framework of IHL. This exploration feeds into discussions on
   the role of rights in the context of transitional justice.},

Abstract = {Focusing on the EU's relations with its periphery, this paper takes
   issue both with persistent normative' conceptions of the EU's
   international role in the European Studies literature and with the
   constructivist-rationalist divide in IR theory. The conceptualization of
   the EU - a vast, composite and ever-expanding entity with fuzzy' borders
   - as an empire of sorts bridges the theoretical divide and offers a
   powerful explanation of the EU's behaviour vis-a-vis its vicinity.
   Through the transfer of rules and practices beyond its borders, the EU
   is indeed engaged in normative' policies, which however primarily serve
   the security and economic interests of the EU and its Member States.
   Thus, the EU's (allegedly) norm-based behaviour is in itself a
   utility-maximizing strategy, which also serves the construction of a
   normative identity. The EU's response to the Arab uprisings serves to
   illustrate the argument, with the concept of empire' resolving the
   puzzle of seemingly inconsistent EU policies.},

Volume = {44},
Number = {1},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Eurozone's reaction to the crisis beginning in late 2008 involved
   not only efforts to mitigate the arbitrarily destructive effects of
   markets but also vigorous pursuit of policies aimed at austerity and
   deflation. To explain this paradoxical outcome, I build on Karl
   Polanyi's account of a similar deadlock in the 1930s. Polanyi argued
   that a society-protecting response to malfunctioning markets was limited
   under the gold standard by the prospect of currency panic, which bankers
   used to push for austerity, deflationary policies, and labor's political
   marginalization. I reconstruct Polanyi's governing by panic theory to
   explain Eurozone policy during three key episodes of sovereign bond
   market panic in 2010-12. By threatening to allow financial panics to
   continue, the European Central Bank promoted policies and institutional
   changes aimed at austerity and deflation, limiting the protective
   response. Germany's Ordoliberalism, and its weight in European affairs,
   contributed to the credibility of this threat.},

Abstract = {While the annexation of Crimea boosted Putin's popularity at home, the
   Donbas insurgency shattered the domestic ideological status quo. The
   Kremlin's position appeared somehow hesitant, fostering the resentment
   of Russian nationalist circles that were hoping for a second annexation.
   In this article, I explore the term Novorossiya as a live mythmaking
   process orchestrated by different Russian nationalist circles to justify
   the Donbas insurgency. The powerful pull of Novorossiya rests on its
   dual meaning in announcing the birth of a New Russia geographically and
   metaphorically. It is both a promised land to be added to Russia and an
   anticipation of Russia's own transformation. As such, Novorossiya
   provides for an exceptional convergence of three underlying ideological
   paradigms - red (Soviet), white (Orthodox), and brown (Fascist). The
   Novorossiya storyline validates a new kind of geopolitical adventurism
   and blurs the boundaries, both territorial and imaginary, of the Russian
   state.},

Title = {Understanding the Political Motivations That Shape Rwanda's Emergent
   Developmental State},

Volume = {21},

Abstract = {Twenty years after its horrific genocide, Rwanda has become a model for
   economic development. At the same time, its government has been
   criticised for authoritarian tactics and the use of violence. Missing
   from the often polarised debate are the connections between these two
   perspectives. Synthesising existing literature on Rwanda in light of a
   combined year of fieldwork, we argue that the Government of Rwanda is
   using the developmental infrastructure to deepen state power and expand
   political control. We first identify the historical pressures that have
   motivated the ruling Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) to reimagine the
   political landscape. Sectarian unrest, political rivalry, wider regional
   insecurity and aid withdrawal have all pressured the RPF to identify
   growth as strategic. However, the political transformation extends
   beyond a prioritisation of growth and encompasses the articulation of
   ideologies and new mindsets, the provision of social services and
   infrastructure and the reordering of the social and physical layout of
   the territory. Growth and social control go hand in hand. As such, this
   paper's main contribution is to bring together the two sides of the
   Rwandan debate and place the country in a broader sociological

Abstract = {Security Intelligence Middle East (SIME) remains an understudied aspect
   of British intelligence. In many respects it was a remarkable
   organization. Its wartime iteration was created in haste, ostensibly as
   a military body but based upon the Security Service's office in Cairo.
   It evolved into a truly `joint' unit but culturally was closer to the
   Security Service (MI5) than either the military or the Secret
   Intelligence Service (MI6). SIME changed dramatically as a result of the
   end of the Second World War: it became the sole responsibility of MI5;
   local cooperation between MI5 and MI6 was scaled-down and became the
   focal point of a broader inter-intelligence service dispute in London;
   and new nationalist threats caught SIME off-balance and eventually
   undermined its raison d'etre. SIME's contrasting wartime and peacetime
   iterations provide a useful example of how intelligence agencies respond
   to external pressures. It also provides a window into wider
   jurisdictional and constitutional conflicts at the heart of the
   relationship between MI5 and MI6, both during and after the war. Finally
   SIME shows practitioners what can be achieved under the right stimulus
   and what can be lost when that stimulus fades.},

Title = {It's all about mechanisms - what process-tracing case studies should be
   tracing},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {463-472},
Abstract = {Process-tracing (PT) as a distinct case-study methodology involves
   tracing causal mechanisms that link causes (X) with their effects (i.e.
   outcomes) (Y). We trace causal mechanisms whereby a cause (or set of
   causes) produces an outcome to both: (1) make stronger evidence-based
   inferences about causal relationships because the analysis produces
   within-case evidence of each step of the causal process (or absence
   thereof) in between a cause and outcome, and (2) because tracing
   mechanisms gives us a better understanding of how a cause produces an
   outcome. Yet, when we look at the methodological literature on PT, there
   is considerable ambiguity and discord about what causal mechanisms
   actually are. The result of this ambiguity and discord about what
   mechanisms are clearly maps onto existing applications of PT, with most
   PT case studies completely ignoring the underlying theoretical causal
   processes. In the few PT applications where mechanisms are unpacked,
   they are typically only developed in a very cursory fashion, with the
   result that there is considerable ambiguity about what theoretical
   process the ensuing case study actually is tracing. If we want to claim
   we are tracing causal mechanisms, the causal processes in between X and
   Y need to be unpacked theoretically. How can we claim we are tracing a
   causal `process' when we are not told what the process (i.e. mechanism)
   actually is? To alleviate this problem, the article attempts to develop
   a clearer definition of causal mechanisms to provide scholars with a
   framework for theorising mechanisms in a fashion that is amenable to
   in-depth empirical analysis using PT.},

Volume = {32},

Pages = {397-422},
Abstract = {During the 2008-2009 economic crisis, Russia's monotowns - one-industry
   towns left from the Soviet era - gained widespread attention as
   potential sources of social protest and unrest. Will such worries
   resurface under current economic conditions? While fears about monotowns
   were exaggerated during the last economic crisis, Russia's leadership
   has reason to remain concerned. Despite the dramatic transformations of
   the last two decades, Russia's post-Soviet industrial landscape has
   largely survived intact, leaving a significant number of monotowns with
   unprofitable enterprises in a precarious position. Yet given its
   emphasis on social stability, we can expect the government to continue
   subsidies, both explicit and hidden, that seek to maintain employment
   and avoid social conflict, but that preserve the country's inefficient
   industrial geography.},

Abstract = {This essay briefly analyzes the introduction of process tracing to the
   political science and political economy methodological toolkit. It then
   proposes a theory-guided variant of process tracing and distinguishes
   between its application in extensive and intensive type of processes. It
   argues that the comparative advantage of process tracing vis-a-vis other
   social sciences research methods lies in its potential to uncover the
   causal mechanisms that link the constitutive events of intensive type of
   processes. It shows that theory-guided process tracing of intensive
   processes can be successfully applied to illustrate, test and produce
   theory.},

Abstract = {The US Intelligence Community (IC) has been heavily criticized for
   making inaccurate estimates. Many scholars and officials believe that
   these criticisms reflect inappropriate generalizations from a handful of
   cases, thus producing undue cynicism about the IC's capabilities. Yet
   there is currently no way to evaluate this claim, because the IC does
   not systematically assess the accuracy of its estimates. Many scholars
   and practitioners justify this state of affairs by claiming that
   assessing estimative accuracy would be impossible, unwise, or both. This
   article shows how those arguments are generally unfounded. Assessing
   estimative accuracy is feasible and desirable. This would not require
   altering existing tradecraft and it would address several political and
   institutional problems that the IC faces today.},

Abstract = {The article explores Russians' satisfaction with their experiences in
   court and with the legal system more generally. The analysis draws on a
   nationally representative survey of Russians, fielded by the Levada
   Center in 2010. The results show that most court veterans believe that
   the decision in their case was just, and that the judge treated them
   well. But these positive feelings do not extend beyond their case.
   Russians who have no court experience tend to have more favorable views
   about the legal system than do court veterans. These findings serve to
   remind us of the difficulty of building confidence in the legal system
   in post-Soviet Russia.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {266-279},
Abstract = {As the field of intelligence studies develops as an academic complement
   to the practice of national security intelligence, it is providing a
   base of knowledge for intelligence practitioners to interpret their
   past, understand their present, and forecast their future. It also
   provides the basis for broader understanding of intelligence as a
   function of government for other government and security officials,
   academicians, and the general public. In recent years there has been
   significant growth in the numbers and kinds of intelligence-related
   educational and training opportunities, with the knowledge taught in
   these courses and programs derived from the body of intelligence studies
   scholarship. The question posed here is: to what extent is this body of
   knowledge sufficient as a basis for the development of intelligence
   studies as an academic discipline?},

Abstract = {This paper aims to examine the relevance of intelligence gathering as an
   essential prerequisite for any political or military decision, and the
   resulting special relationship between rulers and spies, through a
   theoretical comparison between renowned classics and niche literature on
   strategy, literature, philosophy and political science belonging to
   several periods and historical contexts. Findings suggest that criticism
   on intelligence does not concern its utility, but rather the reliability
   of the sources, the obstacles presented by intelligence gathering and
   the ethics of spying. Spies are often described as `ramifications' of
   the ruler, to whom they are tied by a special relationship of trust,
   rooted in a spirit of sacrifice, adequate remuneration and honours.},

Pages = {190-216},
Abstract = {This article proposes a political economy argument for the consistent
   empirical observation of a negative relationship between working women
   and corruption: employed women inFLuence the spending behavior of
   governments by requiring different public goods than men, thereby
   increasing the demand for public goods. Barring a significant rise in
   the government budget, fewer resources remain available for rents,
   lowering the level of corruption. I also argue that countries with a
   large public sector that have a high percentage of working women are
   less corrupt than countries with few working women. The robust empirical
   findings (136 countries, 20 years) support the hypotheses.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},

Volume = {31},

Pages = {871-887},
Abstract = {In New Zealand, Edward Snowden's revelations about the extraordinary
   scope of the National Security Agency's surveillance capabilities and
   the facilitating role of the Five Eyes alliance converged with
   increasing public concerns about the Government Communications Security
   Bureau Amendment and Related Legislation Bill in 2013. This generated an
   intense and sustained debate in the country about surveillance policy.
   It was a debate in which Prime Minister John Key has featured
   prominently. While apparently unable to clearly refute Snowden's claims
   concerning mass surveillance in New Zealand, Key's vigorous public
   interventions helped counter the short-term political and diplomatic
   fallout. However, the long-term impact of public concerns over the
   surveillance policies of the Key government may be much harder to
   predict in what is an intimate democracy, and the prospect of
   substantial political blowback cannot be ruled out.},

Abstract = {The United States displayed a keen interest in the nature, progress and
   results of the Yom Kippur War, because the fighting was thought to
   reflect how nonnuclear hostilities between the North Atlantic Treaty
   Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact (WP) would unfold on the plains
   of central Europe in case war broke out there. In contrast to many
   observers of the war, who concluded that the losses suffered by the
   Israel Defence Forces (IDF) at the hands of Egyptian and Syrian
   anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons had rendered the aircraft and the
   tank largely impotent, thereby revolutionizing how wars would be waged
   in the future, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analysts and United
   States Army Training and Doctrine (TRADOC) Command officers, based upon
   an in-depth review of the nature, progress and results of the fighting,
   re-affirmed the centrality of these weapons systems on the modern
   battlefield. Rather than focus obsessively on technological
   developments, they concluded that training, leadership and tactics were
   ultimately the decisive elements in the Yom Kippur War.},

Abstract = {Over the last decade China expanded its renewable energy sector with
   unprecedented speed. This success story presents a challenge to Western
   modes of environmental governance, where stakeholder participation is
   often deemed a necessary pre-condition for effective policy outcomes.
   Drawing on new research (including previously unpublished interview
   data), the article first discusses established modes of environmental
   governance before examining the growth of China's renewables sector
   through the theoretical lens of the developmental state'. The article
   then analyses renewable energy policy design and implementation in
   China, illustrating how top-down command and control strategies have
   successfully diffused renewable energy technology from a standing start.
   We argue that (1) China's distinct approach to the sector differs from
   Western modes of environmental governance and (2) this has revealed a
   new path towards renewable energy diffusion that authoritarian states in
   particular might regard as an attractive alternative to participatory
   models.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to recover and establish the distinct (and distinctly)
   institutionalist social ontology that underpins social constructivism as
   an approach to political economic analysis. It views social
   constructivism as a profoundly normative mode of political inquiry which
   seeks to discern, interrogate and elucidate the contingency of social,
   political and economic change - restoring politics (broadly understood)
   to processes and practices typically seen to be inevitable, necessary
   and non-negotiable. More controversially, perhaps, it also sees social
   constructivism, after both Berger and Luckmann and Searle, as
   ontologically institutionalist. Social constructivism, it is argued, has
   its origins in the attempt to establish the ontological distinctiveness
   of institutions as social' (as distinct from natural or brute') facts.
   This leads it to a distinct understanding of the relationship between
   actors and the environment (both natural and social) in which they find
   themselves and to its characteristic emphasis on the ideational
   mediation of that relationship. That in turn leads it to a particular
   type of analytic purchase on political economic realities, reflected in
   its distinctive emphasis on interpretive ambiguity, the social
   construction of political and economic imperatives and on
   disequilibrium. The argument is illustrated and developed further
   through an elucidation of the implications of such a social
   constructivism for the analysis of the period of crisis through which we
   now acknowledge ourselves to be living.},

Abstract = {This paper interrogates the emerging practices of narrative methods in
   research that focuses on mobility and migration. It seeks to understand
   how these methods enable a conceptualization of global politics that
   challenges the global/local divide, revealing instead complex
   entanglements through which the local and the global are mutually
   constituted. Focusing in particular on the primacy of narrative, and on
   the concept of ``translation,{''} the paper argues that participants in
   research author narratives in ways that reveal alternative, powerful
   accounts of global politics that are meaning-making and demand an
   understanding of ``local{''} knowledges as valid and important insights
   into how global politics is understood. Ultimately, these methods engage
   the heterogeneous, multiple, and ultimately fully relational narratives
   of individuals who are autonomous and creative, and the ways these
   accounts interrupt the dominant narratives of how the world is
   politically understood-and is politically practiced.},

Abstract = {This article examines the acte clair doctrine in light of the recent
   rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Ferreira da
   Silva and X and van Dijk. It first analyses the earlier case law on acte
   clair, disclosing inconsistencies in the application of its
   requirements. Then, it offers a critical review of Ferreira da Silva and
   X and van Dijk. It claims that the Cilfit criteria, although often
   quoted in judgments and doctrine, have been applied neither consistently
   nor truly rigidly by the Court. Instead, a more flexible approach to
   acte clair requirements is taking shape, while the Court is
   simultaneously reminding national courts that its discretion on
   preliminary reference issues is not unlimited. Finally, the article
   criticizes Ferreira da Silva and X and van Dijk for missing the
   opportunity to further clarify the normative content and the legal
   status of the Cilfit criteria.},

Abstract = {The jihadist threat emanating from the Middle East has transformed
   dramatically in the past five years due to unprecedented levels of
   sociopolitical instability. While the region and much of the world
   around it previously faced a threat dominated by al-Qaeda, developments
   in the heart of the Middle East since 2014 have given birth to a new and
   more dangerous dynamic-two international jihadist movements competing to
   outdo each other on an increasingly brutal and complex world stage. In
   recent years, al-Qaeda has undergone a consequential strategic
   evolution: increasingly autonomous affiliates have begun to adopt a
   patient, long-game approach to operations, while ISIS has sought to
   attain rapid results. As two divergent models of jihad develop,
   different threats result, with the one universal factor being the
   exploitation of political failure, failing states, and sociopolitical
   instability to further extremist narratives. It is now more important
   than ever to develop tailor-made policies designed not just to combat
   jihadism itself but to ameliorate underlying conditions that have
   allowed it to thrive.},

Abstract = {This article discusses individual mobilization to extremist violence
   from the perspective of a researcher and analyst, exploring what we know
   about the psychological and social factors motivating young people to
   join extremist groups and how that knowledge relates to the recruitment
   of individuals into ISIS. The biggest threat to the West, at least for
   now, is not core ISIS (or any jihadi group operating in the Middle East
   and North Africa region), but Westerners who self-mobilize for attacks
   at home or who return, trained to fight, from the ``jihad{''} abroad.
   Finally, the article suggests specific ways for governments to respond
   to this threat, noting the limits of what government can do, and arguing
   that they join forces with the private sector. Mobilization to extremism
   must be addressed with broad, multi-institutional social strategies.},

Abstract = {Although International Relations is still largely androcentric,
   masculinist and heteronormative, certain issues of gender and sexuality
   have gained currency over the last decade. At the same time, much of IR
   follows a Eurocentrist and occidentalist script that is systematically
   built into disciplinary ways of knowing. Adapting step-by-step Spivak's
   famous quote of white men saving brown women from brown men across a
   range of feminist and queer concepts like patriarchal genderism,
   embedded feminism, transnational sexism, homonationalism and queer
   imperialism, this article traces the flexible phenomenon of gendered and
   sexualized epistemic violence from British colonialism in India to
   imperial western politics today. It shows how the logic of who is to
   liberate whom for sex/gender reasons gradually shifts from
   heteronormativity and whiteness to more diverse patterns that contribute
   to a cognitive militarization of large parts of society. Introducing the
   notion of the occidentalist dividend that can be earned in this
   procedure, we can understand that some forms of sex-gender-culture talk
   are quite ambivalent achievements that constitute genuine challenges for
   antimilitarist feminist positions.},

Abstract = {Past research has shown that the perceived successes or failures of
   presidents have a durable influence on the partisan leanings and
   political attitudes of people who come of political age during their
   administrations. Here, I examine data from 344 Gallup surveys with a
   total of 399,755 respondents interviewed during the Obama presidency to
   (1) document the extent to which generational imprinting is visible
   among citizens and demographic subgroups in their party identification
   and ideology, (2) determine how the political identities and ideologies
   of people who have come of age during Obama's presidency have evolved
   compared with those of earlier presidential generations, (3) explore the
   implications of the population's changing demographic makeup and the
   political attitudes expressed by younger age cohorts for the future
   partisan balance of the American electorate, and (4) consider how the
   competition to succeed Obama is likely to affect partisan identities
   forged during his administration.},

Abstract = {In May 2014 the Legal Service of the Council delivered an opinion on the
   European Commission's Rule of Law Framework, stating the Commission's
   new mechanism was unlawful. This article sets out a critical analysis of
   this opinion, and questions whether the annual rule of law dialogue
   announced by the Council in December 2014 is a feasible response.
   Hungary is used as a case study to highlight the total failure of the
   Council to take any action whatsoever in the face of the grave and
   systemic abuses of human rights committed by the government of that
   country since 2010; and Poland where an autocratic regime has been in
   place since the autumn of 2015 is also mentioned. This is contrasted
   with the efforts of the majority of the Members of the European
   Parliament to tackle the acute challenge and with the Commission's
   action on specific breaches. A co-ordinated strategy is sorely needed.},

Abstract = {This article explores whether the concept of a global care chain is
   useful in understanding the migration of careworkers internationally. It
   examines how an affective approach to understanding migration could
   supplement the care chain analysis by accounting for the overlapping,
   shifting, contingent and non-linear networks of emotion that arise
   during migrations. Analyzing carework through the lens of an affective
   economy is more revealing of the multiple experiences of Filipino gay
   and transgender caregivers in Tel Aviv and New York, Peruvian
   careworkers in Spain and Polish careworkers in Germany, as but three
   brief, illustrative examples. First I will discuss what the care chain
   approach can illuminate about the multiple and varied stories of migrant
   careworkers and how it may also essentialize or oversimplify their
   experiences. I will then suggest that the model naturalizes the caring,
   biological mother and reinforces geographical and ideological binaries
   such as North/South, winner/loser and domination/dependency. Finally, I
   will discuss how the care chain model presents a linear conception of
   time and space, obscuring the overlapping and multi-directional routes
   of migration that careworkers travel. Ultimately I will argue that an
   affective approach creates the theoretical language that can help build
   what Chela Sandoval calls a coalitional consciousness.},

Abstract = {The Maidan protests provide us with insights into Ukrainian society and
   the dynamics of mobilisation more generally. Based on the EuroMaidan
   Protest Participant Survey, on-site rapid interviews with protesters,
   interviews with politicians, activists and journalists, and focus groups
   with ordinary citizens and activists, this essay maps the actors, claims
   and frames of each phase in the protest cycle. It highlights the
   diversity of actors and the inability of activists and party leaders to
   coordinate as the central features of the protests. Our analysis reveals
   the fluid and contingent nature of cleavages commonly portrayed as fixed
   and politically salient.},

Abstract = {In the growing field of research on the consequences of criminal justice
   contact for family life, a heavy emphasis has been placed on how
   imprisonment influences the emotional, physical, and socioeconomic
   well-being of prisoners' loved ones. In this article, I elaborate on and
   analyze the experiences of family members of people with frequent,
   low-level criminal justice involvement. I draw on ethnographic data
   collected in partnership with a clinical social worker over the course
   of a three-year study of an intensive case management intervention for
   HIV-positive individuals. Findings indicate that loved ones' brief jail
   stays and community supervision through probation and parole pose
   hardships for family members that are distinct from those hardships that
   arise during imprisonment. These experiences are uniquely destabilizing,
   may confer specific risks to family members' well-being, and merit
   further study to inform programs, social services, and public policy.},

Abstract = {Does the economy affect patterns of far-right party support across
   countries? This article reconceptualizes micro-level analyses that focus
   on the effect of unemployment through a framework of costs, risks and
   the mediating role of labour market institutions. It then derives
   several hypotheses and tests them on the results of the previous three
   EP elections in all EU Member States. Findings from multiple regression
   analyses indicate that unemployment, real GDP growth, debt and deficits
   have no statistically significant effect on far-right party support at
   the national level. By contrast, labour market institutions influence
   costs and risks: where unemployment benefits and dismissal regulations
   are high, unemployment has no effect, but where either one of them is
   low, unemployment leads to higher far-right party support. This explains
   why unemployment has not led to far-right party support in some European
   countries that experienced the severity of the 2008 eurozone crisis.},

Abstract = {In recent years, attention has been paid in scholarship and practice to
   the need for `victim-centeredness' in transitional justice (TJ)
   programming. Despite this, transitional mechanisms often underappreciate
   or obscure the critical dimensions of agency, the complexities within
   and between victim-centered mobilization and the experiences of such
   networks with TJ processes. Furthermore, they fail to capture victims'
   experiences as political actors, while promoting an understanding of
   this group as a single, indivisible whole. This article engages with
   contentious dynamics within the victim landscape through a case study of
   Nepal, raising critical questions about who constitutes the terrain of
   victims, who has a role in the design of TJ mechanisms and how
   international involvement has created opportunities and constraints in a
   diverse landscape of victims' networks. It also calls for a deeper
   examination of how, within a global context of norm dispersion, the
   persuasive power of transnational advocacy networks and the expansion of
   the TJ discourse, victim-centered advocacy remains largely ignored as a
   political force. The article argues that neglecting the complex
   realities of victimhood, compounded by the dominance of standardizing
   global norms, institutionalized structures such as truth commissions and
   the prominence of the `elite' local's concerns, can alienate and even
   delegitimize grassroots victim-centered activism or reduce consultations
   with such groups to a form of tokenism. In so doing, the elite drivers
   of TJ processes continue to define the parameters of victimhood.},

Abstract = {This article offers a practitioner's perspective on California's
   criminal justice Realignment. Drawing on my direct experience
   implementing Realignment as the chief probation officer in the city and
   county of San Francisco, I argue that the San Francisco case illustrates
   how decarceration can occur without compromising public safety, and I
   offer a set of lessons for practitioners and policy-makers about how to
   achieve decarceration despite local political, organizational, and
   cultural barriers. Specifically, I identify interagency collaboration,
   investment in community corrections and a commitment to alternatives to
   incarceration and community engagement with the families of both victims
   and offenders as key facilitators of decarceration at the local level. I
   urge observers not to dismiss these lessons as idiosyncratic to San
   Francisco's unique locale. Rather, my experience has been that even San
   Francisco's exceptionally hospitable local culture is not enough to
   successfully implement reform; structural arrangements that
   institutionalize the practical implementation of cultural commitments to
   reduce reliance on incarceration are required.},

Abstract = {To reverse the downturn in and develop EU-China relations requires
   mutual understanding. However, the opaque nature of Chinese politics
   makes it difficult to track China's expectations and its changing views
   of the EU and their relationship. This paper examines the official
   Chinese media discourse on the EU's actorness' and partnership with
   China. This helps to bridge the gap between international relations and
   media studies by linking government foreign relations to media
   discourse. It argues that China's relations with the EU should be
   characterized neither as a case of a Capability-Expectations Gap' (Hill,
   ) nor as an Expectation Deficit' (Tsuruoka, ), but should rather be seen
   as a matter of Reflexive Expectations' by China. The media analysis
   shows that China's changing national identity, interests and perception
   of the EU's capability at various times and in various situations
   influence expectations.},

Abstract = {This article looks at the application, in the anti-corruption realm, of
   the analytical framework developed for transnational human rights
   advocacy by Risse, Ropp, and Sikkink. Focusing on Azerbaijan,
   Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan, this article shows that the level of
   integration with Western actors on the state and corporate levels
   determined the degree to which the transnational anti-corruption regime
   has been accepted in the Caspian region. As the transnational regime
   does ultimately lack coercive powers, the tension between transnational
   demands and national political elites does not translate into serious
   conflict, as a broader formal acceptance of the transnational
   anti-corruption regime offers national actors only limited opportunities
   to genuinely promote the issue.},

Abstract = {A well-known approach to modeling international relations treats them as
   a two-level game played by national governments and international
   organizations, in which they negotiate with one another while coping
   with internal constraints on their action posed by domestic politics or
   organizational governance. Officials in these organizations can play a
   different two-level game, arising from their simultaneous negotiations
   within their personal transnational networks and their official duties
   in their host organizations. In each domain, they can act in ways that
   improves their outcomes in the other one - informal understandings
   facilitate subsequent formal agreement, while actions taken within their
   organizations implement and cement what had been negotiated informally.
   Multi-organizational innovation can thus be coordinated even in the
   absence of formal action to do so. This process is illustrated through
   an examination of the role of an informal transnational network in the
   shifting of the policies of the government of India and major aid donors
   in the 1960s.},

Abstract = {Recently, the United States Defense Advanced Project Agency (DARPA)
   hosted its ``Robotics Challenge.{''} The explicit goal of this challenge
   is to develop robots capable of ``executing complex tasks in dangerous,
   degraded, human engineered environments.{''} However, the competitors'
   choice to build humanoid robots tells a different narrative. In
   particular, through the physical design choices, the giving of names and
   the tasking of roles, the competing teams perpetuated a gendered
   narrative. This narrative in turn reifies gendered norms of warfighting,
   and ultimately leads to an accretion of gendered practices in
   militaries, politics and society, despite contemporary attempts at
   minimizing these practices through policies of inclusion. I argue that
   though much work on gender and technology exists, the autonomous
   humanoid robot - the one currently sought by DARPA - is something
   entirely new, and must be addressed on its own terms. In particular,
   this machine exceeds even Haraway's conception of the post-human cyborg,
   and rather than emancipating human beings from gender hierarchy, further
   reifies its practices. Masculine humanoid robots will be deemed ideal
   warfighters, while feminine humanoid robots will be tasked with research
   or humanitarian efforts, thereby reinstituting gendered roles.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},

Pages = {327-344},
Abstract = {A number of researchers have advocated the use of explicit numeric
   probabilities in the drafting and presentation of intelligence
   assessments. A trial of this methodology by a Canadian assessment unit
   has demonstrated that numeric probabilities can be used effectively in
   the preparation of intelligence reports. The practice leads analysts to
   pay greater attention to the estimative judgments they make and allows
   for greater transparency in understanding the degree of certainty that
   they attach to their conclusions. The use of numeric probabilities
   highlights the need for a consistent mapping standard for verbal
   probability terms. However, implementing the methodology requires
   overcoming a widely shared aversion among analysts and intelligence
   managers to thinking in numeric terms.},

Journal = {POST-SOVIET AFFAIRS},

Volume = {32},

Pages = {299-337},
Abstract = {This article argues that Vladimir Putin's regime launched support
   programs for the leading Russian universities in 2005 because of a
   perceived threat of the political mobilization of youth, similar to the
   one that triggered ``color revolutions{''} in Serbia, Georgia, and
   Ukraine. The support programs created cleavages in the university
   community, covered an attack on university autonomy, and made the
   containment of possible anti-regime student mobilization a part of an
   implicit agreement between the regime and the universities. The
   historical coincidence of the ``demographic hole,{''} which caused a
   shrinkage of the higher education market, and high oil prices, which
   provided the necessary resources for the regime, made this implicit
   agreement possible. The article contributes to the research on
   authoritarianism, youth mobilization, authoritarian backlash after the
   color revolutions, and the development of research universities in
   Russia.},

Abstract = {The essay investigates how Russian veterans' organisations represent the
   concerns of their constituency vis-a-vis the Russian state. An interest
   group approach is applied to investigate the `brokering' function
   exercised by veterans' organisations to lobby on behalf of their
   constituency. The analysis is based on the study of selected veterans'
   organisations in Karelia and St Petersburg. The research finds that
   veterans' organisations operate in a restricted environment, though our
   analysis shows that their agency has mattered, largely due to their
   political connections. The investigation reveals those mechanisms
   through which Russian veterans' organisations act as brokers.},

Abstract = {Over the last decade, intelligence has become one of the most widely
   taught subjects in higher education. In response to this, a
   sub-discipline has emerged within Intelligence Studies devoted to
   thinking about how the subject is actually taught. One of the most
   common arguments to come out of this literature is that there should be
   more practitioner involvement in the university teaching of
   intelligence. However, it is rarely specified what exactly intelligence
   professionals bring to the classroom, save the largely self-evident
   point that because they have `walked the walk', they are uniquely
   qualified to teach the subject. Drawing on student questionnaires, as
   well as interviews with serving and retired intelligence officers, this
   article attempts to probe a little deeper and identify the specific
   benefits of incorporating practitioners into the university teaching of
   intelligence. It is argued that practitioners `put a face on the
   profession' and help to remove some of the mystique and misperceptions
   that surround intelligence work. It is claimed that practitioners,
   especially with their `inside stories', give added meaning to academic
   theories and make the subject more exciting. Finally, it is argued that
   practitioners enrich the broader `student experience'. In UK higher
   education, now under a new fees regime, students are looking for
   departments to go the extra mile not only in terms of their teaching,
   but also in areas like careers advice and support. In this context,
   intelligence professionals are enormously valuable.},

Abstract = {This chapter describes a civic engagement project aimed at connecting
   first semester community college students more meaningfully to their
   college community in an effort to promote greater student persistence.
   Using college inquiry as a frame through which to help students develop
   the knowledge and skills they need to flourish in college, this project
   sought to engage students in the college community as the site of civic
   engagement. This chapter considers both the successes and limits of
   curricular and pedagogical innovations to ameliorate the challenges
   community college students face to reaching graduation. The author
   further considers how civic engagement efforts in community colleges
   might honor students' commitments to their home communities while
   building their bonds to college and argues in favor of a new
   conceptualization of civic engagement that positions community college
   students' academic success as part of an expanded definition of what it
   means to be an engaged student, community member, and citizen.},

Abstract = {Using social media and other Internet-based communication platforms,
   groups such as ISIS have become effective at influencing vulnerable,
   disaffected young people who are in search of some sense of social
   connection and greater life purpose and encouraging them to commit acts
   of violence on behalf of their extremist cause. Traditional
   counterterrorism-related investigative strategies are insufficient to
   prevent these acts of targeted violence by lone offenders. Accordingly,
   we must expand the use of behavioral risk assessment methodologies as
   part of investigative protocols. We must empower local partnerships
   among law enforcement; the communities they serve; and others such as
   mental health professionals, educators, and faith leaders. Countering
   the terrorist narrative is not enough; we must adapt our efforts and
   prioritize holistic and collaborative ways to detect, assess, and
   intervene in situations where individuals may exhibit the behaviors and
   indicators of violent extremism in order to prevent a violent attack.},

Abstract = {The monetary dialogue between the European Parliament and the European
   Central Bank (ECB) is a key component for the democratic accountability
   of the independent central bank. We provide new evidence for the
   efficiency of the dialogue and present the results of a survey conducted
   amongst the members of the parliament's ECON (economic and monetary
   affairs) committee. We find that while the monetary dialogue may have
   had little or even a negative impact on financial markets, it plays a
   significant role in informing and involving members of parliament and
   their constituencies. Amidst an intensifying debate about the
   communication and transparency of the ECB, these findings shed new light
   on the current state of affairs of ECB accountability and its alleged
   need for enhancement.},

Abstract = {The Peer to Peer (P2P): Challenging Extremism initiative, which counters
   violent extremism through youth engagement, is a partnership between an
   interagency government team and EdVenture Partners, a private
   organization that manages experiential learning initiatives using a
   peer-to-peer approach. The initiative tasks university students across
   the globe to counter extremism among their peers and in their
   communities, by creating and implementing, over the course of a school
   term, a social or digital initiative, product, or tool designed to
   empower their peers and counter hate. At the time of writing, more than
   two thousand students from more than ninety-five universities in more
   than thirty countries have been involved in the initiative, which is
   specifically designed to capitalize on public-private partnerships.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes how the apparently merely technical introduction of
   reversed qualified majority voting for the excessive deficit procedure
   included in the Six Pack and the Fiscal Compact shifts not only the
   institutional balance between the European Commission and the Member
   States but also the relationship between liberalization and social
   regulation in the EU. In bringing together institutional analysis and a
   political economy perspective, the paper shows how the strengthening of
   the Commission's discretionary decision-making authority in a context of
   intergovernmental power imbalances between debtor and creditor states
   extends the asymmetry between market-making and market-correction to the
   area of political decision-making. In consequence, economic and social
   policies are subordinated to the primacy of austerity.},

Abstract = {This article assesses recent claims that international courts and
   tribunals can enhance their legitimacy through public reason. Section
   one argues that international legal scholars attribute a wide range of
   meanings to public reason, and goes on to provide clarification of how
   this range of conceptions, or ideas and ideals, referred to as public
   reason fits into the dominant and broadly Rawlsian tradition. Section
   two analyses properties and features of international courts that make
   public reason normatively relevant. Section three then sketches an ideal
   of public reason for ICs that suggests guidelines and principles to
   limit the discretion of judges when reasoning about morally and
   politically contentious issues. This ideal is designed to address a
   particular legitimacy concern raised against many new international
   courts, namely, that they engage in judicial activism, passing judgments
   on contentious moral and political issues without being sufficiently
   authorized and accountable. This ideal does not encourage the judges to
   engage in more judicial review, rather it seeks to restrict the judges'
   reasoning and judicial discretion when engaging in review and judicial
   development of the law. The final section compares and contrasts the
   proposed account of public reason to other adjudicative ideals, both
   from the general adjudicative accounts of Ronald Dworkin and Cass
   Sunstein, as well as the more ambitious and cosmopolitan accounts of
   public reason for ICs offered by the legal scholars Kumm, Sadurski, and
   Petersmann.},

   standards, best practices and norms. Research often frames these efforts
   as solutions to perceived problems arising from globalization. Yet the
   narrow focus on the rulemaking process - coordination, distributive
   implications and implementation - misses second-order political
   repercussions. Giving special attention to the interaction between
   international soft law and the political landscape of business advocacy,
   this article offers an alternative account of the relationship between
   transnational rules and powerful actors. We argue that transnational
   informal institutions are not only sites of cooperation that resolve the
   economic policy concerns of the day, but are also sources of policy
   feedback that can transform the political landscape. To illustrate the
   potential empirical traction of these arguments, we examine the critical
   case of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Institute of
   International Finance (IIF). The IIF went from being a struggling
   organization with no regulatory agenda or lobbying skills to the world's
   most influential financial industry advocate directly engaging
   transnational forums. We find that second-order effects of soft law were
   a primary cause of the IIF's transformation. Our study has major
   implications for research on global governance as we highlight the
   political ramifications and temporal effects of informal institutions
   for business representation.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the successes and setbacks of Moscow's policy of
   counterinsurgency and beyond. It challenges the general consensus in
   scholarship positing that military successes associated with
   Chechenisation have been obtained against the backdrop of Chechnya's
   increasingly autonomous status within Russia, considered by some as a
   case of systemic separatism'. The article tracks how four key mechanisms
   (Chechnya's institutional design, internal opposition to the Kadyrov
   clan, the tradition of blood feud among kadyrovtsyinitially Chechen
   paramilitary forces named after both Kadyrovs, gradually transformed
   into seemingly regular Ministry of Interior (MVD) unitsand Chechnya's
   economic dependency on Moscow) have enabled Moscow to maintain control
   over Chechnya while simultaneously allowing its elites to consolidate
   power within the republic.},

Abstract = {Why do some WTO trade disputes endure and recur while others do not?
   States have difficulty resolving trade conflicts when they involve
   certain types of trade-restrictive domestic regulations. While such
   regulations vary in their extent of legitimacy-fulfilling non-trade
   domestic regulatory objectives and availability of less
   trade-restrictive options-complainant states cannot always distinguish
   legitimate barriers from illegitimate ones. In such scenarios of
   disguised protectionism, which I argue is most prevalent with policies
   involving WTO's Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement, disputants
   confront difficulties concluding their disputes. Disputes last longer
   and are more likely to recur. I test the argument against a data set of
   WTO disputes structured in an innovative manner-one that links together
   related and recurring disputes into single conflicts. Both an event
   history analysis of conflict duration and a count analysis of conflict
   recurrence using this data strongly support this argument.},

Abstract = {The new own-initiative report the European Parliament is preparing has
   three aims: to provide a formal evaluation of the recent initiatives by
   the Commission and the Council; to present a viable alternative; and to
   do so in the form of a legislative report, so as to obtain a formal
   reaction from the Commission. The institutions have proposed several
   possible solutions to the crisis of the Rule of Law in the EU. It is
   time to put them into a coherent system. The report will focus on five
   issues: the body for a permanent country-by-country monitoring of
   democracy, the Rule of Law and fundamental rights in the EU; the role of
   the Agency for Fundamental Rights; whether and how infringement
   procedures should be revisited in this context; what a proper
   pre-Article 7 Treaty on European Union (TEU) procedure should look like;
   and what a valid legal basis for the proposed changes should be.},

Abstract = {In a world of `Big Data', data visualization allows the viewer to
   explore curated data; the creator to quickly convey complex information;
   and advocates to vividly display their view of a better world. Fields as
   disparate as journalism, environmental advocacy, and development
   assistance are taking advantage of these data-filled times. A similar
   movement can be described for the realm of human rights
   advocacy-although at a much smaller scale. Human rights advocates have
   been increasingly using data to better understand rights violations and
   to communicate their inot signndings and messages to targeted audiences,
   from the general public to policymakers and judicial bodies. While the
   use of data and visualization among human rights advocates is becoming
   more common, innovations are being taken up unevenly, and advocates
   admit that choices about approaches and techniques are largely based on
   anecdotal evidence. This article introduces the results of preliminary
   research into some of these questions that are the product of
   collaboration between researchers from a school of engineering and a
   school of law. It provides an initial assessment of the field,
   presenting the results of a study examining the use of data
   visualization and other visual features by Amnesty International and
   Human Rights Watch through content coding and expert interviews. It then
   offers the findings of two crowdsourced user studies into pressing
   questions in the visualization field which hold promise for human rights
   advocates seeking to communicate their messages through data
   visualization, and concludes by suggesting further areas for research.},

Abstract = {This paper develops an analytical approach to comparative political
   economy that focuses on the relative importance of different components
   of aggregate demandin the first instance, exports and household
   consumption-and dynamic relations among the ``demand drivers{''} of
   growth. We illustrate this approach by comparing patterns of economic
   growth in Germany, Italy, Sweden, and the United Kingdom over the period
   1994-2007. Our discussion emphasizes that export-led growth and
   consumption-led growth have different implications for distributive
   conflict.},

Title = {Drinking Alone? The Effect of an Alcohol Treatment Program on
   Relationship Stability for Convicted Drunk Drivers in Denmark},
Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {665},
Number = {1},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article tests whether an alcohol treatment program for drunk
   drivers in Denmark increased the stability of their relationships with
   spouses or cohabiting partners. The treatment program, implemented in
   1990, allowed a group of offenders to avoid prison and participate in a
   rehabilitation program. I use it here as a natural experiment,
   exploiting a rich administrative dataset to show that the program
   marginally increases offenders' relationship stability. I also test
   whether increased relationship stability observed among the treated
   offenders results from their pardon from prison or from their
   participation in the rehabilitation program. Results suggest that the
   rehabilitation program drives the effect. These findings contribute to
   the literature on what alternative sanctions could be offered to
   offenders to improve their long-term social outcomes.},

Title = {Why do some international institutions contain strong dispute settlement
   provisions? New evidence from preferential trade agreements},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {89-120},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {To understand why some international institutions have stronger dispute
   settlement mechanisms (DSMs) than others, we investigate the dispute
   settlement provisions of nearly 600 preferential trade agreements
   (PTAs), which possess several desirable case-selection features and are
   evoked more than is realized. We broaden the study of dispute settlement
   design beyond ``legalization{''} and instead reorient theorizing around
   a multi-faceted conceptualization of the strength of DSMs. We posit that
   strong DSMs are first and foremost a rational response to features of
   agreements that require stronger dispute settlement, such as depth and
   large memberships. Multivariate empirical tests using a new data set on
   PTA design confirm these expectations and reveal that depth - the amount
   of policy change specified in an agreement - is the most powerful and
   consistent predictor of DSM strength, providing empirical support to a
   long-posited but controversial conjecture. Yet power also plays a
   sizeable role, since agreements among asymmetric members are more likely
   to have strong DSMs due to their mutual appeal, as are those involving
   the United States. Important regional differences also emerge, as PTAs
   across the Americas are designed with strong dispute settlement, as are
   Asian PTAs, which contradicts the conventional wisdom about Asian values
   and legalization. Our findings demonstrate that rationalism explains
   much of international institutional design, yet it can be enhanced by
   also incorporating power-based and regional explanations.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the possible business cycle linkages between
   CEECs (Central and Eastern European countries) that were candidates to
   enter the EMU and the euro area for the period 1993 to 2014. We analyse
   business cycle (a)symmetries for these countries by using Markov
   switching autoregressive models and synchronization tests. By analysing
   the correlations between the cyclical fluctuations for these countries,
   we examine the existence of common features between the individual
   cycles. By distinguishing between different regimes, we show that the
   indications of business cycle synchronization are quite high in the
   recession regime, but lower in the normal and high growth regimes, with
   the exceptions of Hungary and Poland.},

Title = {Truth Commission Archives as `New Democratic Spaces'},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {6-24},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The significant increase in the number of truth commissions created and
   implemented in recent years has been accompanied by a growing number of
   debates over popular ownership of, and citizen participation in, such
   initiatives, with particular reference to enhancing the best impact
   possible in terms of `never again' for the human rights abuses of the
   past. Using a combination of data collected through desk-based research
   and semi-structured interviews conducted with researchers and
   professionals of truth commission archives, this article takes a new
   approach to the question of the social and political impact of truth
   commissions by firstly suggesting that the archives of truth commissions
   need to be included in any consideration of long-term impact on
   democracy and human rights, and secondly by asking whether we could
   think of such archives as a form of `new democratic space' similar to
   those proposed by Cornwall (2004). Such spaces would be designed and
   implemented in a manner that invites and includes the population in the
   decision-making process of shaping the future, and as such would
   represent an enhancement of the role which truth commission archives can
   play in the deepening of democratic processes and the protection of
   human rights.},

Abstract = {While many feminist and postcolonial scholars have analyzed the
   post-9/11 politic in the United States, few have focused on the anthrax
   ``attacks{''} that followed the 11 September 2001 World Trade Center
   disaster. The FBI search for the perpetrator of the 2001 anthrax
   mailings was an important node in US national security discourse making
   - it culminated in the fingering of a white male government biodefense
   scientist and cast doubt on the role of scientific expertise in
   provisioning national security. This article argues that while ``white
   scientific masculinity{''} was put into question, it was simultaneously
   shored up as a nationalist symbol of protection against bioterrorism.
   This article traces shifts across the three FBI-led profiles of the
   anthrax perpetrator, along with concomitant news media coverage: the
   white male ``loner{''} nonscientist, the white male ``loner{''} amateur
   scientist and finally the white male biodefense scientist. Using a
   cultural studies approach, this article details how at each successive
   investigatory stage profilers mobilized hegemonic discourses to
   re-instantiate the authoritative status of white scientific masculinity
   in US national security. This analysis offers an important dimension to
   feminist and postcolonial critiques of the symbolic and institutional
   investment in white masculinity during the War on Terror.},

Abstract = {While a significant literature on women's participation in armed rebel
   groups exists, much of this work is focused on individual cases or
   regional comparisons among movements. This has led to a lack of
   cross-national work on women in insurgencies, and a limited
   understanding of the extent to which women are engaged in civil conflict
   internationally. This article introduces new data on women's involvement
   in seventy-two insurgencies active since 1990, and assesses the validity
   of several assumptions about women and rebellion drawn from existing
   literature on women in conflict and on civil wars generally. I show that
   women are active in rebel groups much more often than current
   scholarship acknowledges. This involvement includes frequent service in
   combat and leadership roles, where male participants are often presumed
   to be the default. Finally, while forced recruitment tactics are
   frequently used to bring women into service, much of their participation
   appears to be voluntary in nature.},

Abstract = {Local human rights organizations (LHROs) are key domestic and
   transnational actors, modifying, diffusing, and promoting liberal norms;
   mobilizing citizens; networking with the media and activists; and
   pressuring governments to implement international commitments. These
   groups, however, are reliant on international funds. This makes sense in
   politically repressive environments, where potential donors fear
   government retaliation, but is puzzling elsewhere. We interviewed 263
   LHRO leaders and key informants from 60 countries, and conducted
   statistically representative surveys of 6180 respondents in India,
   Mexico, Morocco, and Nigeria. Based on these data, we believe LHRO
   funding in non-repressive environments is shaped by philanthropic logics
   of appropriateness. In the late 1990s, transnational activists
   successfully mainstreamed human rights throughout the international
   donor assistance community, freeing up development money for LHROs.
   Domestic activists in the global South have not promoted similar
   philanthropic transformations at home, where charitable giving still
   focuses on traditional institutions. Instead, domestic rights activists
   have followed the path of least resistance toward international aid, a
   logic of outcomes produced by variations in global logics of
   (philanthropic) appropriateness.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the implications of Thomas Frank's
   conservative backlash thesis that cultural cleavages have become much
   more important in contemporary American political life relative to
   traditional socioeconomic bases for political differentiation. We frame
   our research within the recent literature on the polarization of the
   electorate with respect to social and cultural issues. Using Hunter's
   culture war imagery, we examine the extent to which opposing cultural
   forces on issues of abortion, gay rights, women's extra-familial labor
   force participation, and child-rearing have become more important in
   shaping political identities and party preferences. We use data from
   twenty-six nationally representative surveys of the General Social
   Survey (GSS) from 1974 through 2010, and we find evidence of
   polarization in the liberal-conservative identities of respondents. We
   find that occupational class had a clear and consistent relationship to
   political views, which is relatively stable over time. We also find that
   cultural views are related to political identities, and that most
   features of the cultural component in our analysis are increasingly
   associated with liberal political views. Our results favor an
   interpretation of a changing role of cultural orientations in shaping
   political identities and provide tentative support for Frank's Kansas
   hypothesis as revealed in the GSS data.},
