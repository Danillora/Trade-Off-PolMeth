Abstract = {Thinkers with Jewish backgrounds contributed powerfully to our
   understanding of nationalism. We examine the different Jewish conditions
   in East Central Europe and Russia at the end of the nineteenth and at
   the start of the twentieth century so as to map the theories of
   nationalism that resulted. Four such theories are identified, each
   illustrated with reference to particular thinkers.},

Abstract = {Are emerging markets undermining private environmental governance? In
   the past, most trade in agricultural commodities occurred between
   developed and developing countries, but in recent years the volume of
   South-South trade has increased significantly. The booming demand from
   emerging markets for food, feed, and fiber is now a key driver behind
   agricultural expansion, causing large-scale deforestation and
   biodiversity loss in the tropics. By examining the case of palm oil,
   this article argues that existing private governance institutions are
   not well equipped to deal with this crisis. They continue to operate on
   the basis of a North-South trade model, trying to leverage the market
   power of big-brand companies to achieve their sustainability goals.
   However, the effectiveness of this mechanism is increasingly undermined
   by the rise of South-South trade and the different structure and
   institutional context of emerging market value chains.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the impact mobilized publics have had on Yemen's
   domestic political environment by examining two case studies initiating
   collective action, with autonomous agency, yet with distinct differences
   in access to resources. The first case is the Marib Cause, a
   semi-organized, non-registered community group that protests corruption
   and demands basic services, employment opportunities and resource
   redistribution for the benefit of a marginalized region. The second is
   al-Watan (Homeland), a registered political party established by youth
   activists who had been involved in the 2011 movement. Both groups
   emerged as a result of the transformation period, which resulted in an
   opening up of the political sphere allowing these actors the opportunity
   to engage in collective action with the goal of impacting policy. The
   role of these two mobilized publics is analysed by examining their
   resources and strategies within the political context and tactical
   interactions between them and the PRE. The two cases represent levels of
   popular mobilization specific to an exceptional time. Although they were
   not able to directly influence Yemen's transformation process, their
   potential impact on the long-term political, social and cultural
   environment is significant.},

Abstract = {Arguably, the identity and political ambition of a female head of state
   or government is transformative of the views of politics held by women
   throughout the polity. In fact, if one considers the visibility and
   status of national executive office, the symbolic effects of a female
   head of state or head of government could trump that of an increase in
   the number of women in legislative bodies. This chapter therefore
   examines whether a recent or current female head of state or government
   improves support for female leaders and political engagement. Working
   with the most recent public-opinion data, covering years 2011 to 2014,
   the authors look cross-sectionally at fifty-six countries to evaluate
   the influence of the presence of a female head of state or head of
   government on acceptance of female leaders, as well as citizen interest
   in politics, and on the level of voting in national and local elections.},

   discourse on military humanitarian intervention},

Pages = {49-71},
Abstract = {The civil war in Syria began approximately four years ago and has
   resulted in the murder of thousands by the Assad regime and the flight
   of millions to neighbouring countries. The international community's
   reluctance to intervene to halt the ongoing massive human rights
   violations has been explained in geopolitical, military-strategic,
   diplomatic, and legal terms. Yet, what does this imply normatively? And
   does the weakening of the military humanitarian intervention (MHI) norm
   support arguments regarding the poverty of constructivist security
   studies? This article examines these two questions and demonstrates the
   weakness of the MHI norm, especially in light of the new interpretations
   and meanings which authoritative agents ascribe to its key conceptual
   components in changing strategic, social and political contexts. Yet,
   the article employs constructivist tools to explore the endogenous
   challenges to the MHI norm while proving the added value of
   constructivist security research, not only for explaining ``norm
   evolution{''} but also ``norm decline{''}. Taking discourse as a
   reflection of social norms and an arena for encouraging new
   intersubjective interpretations of concepts, it examines the above
   assertions by analysing the discourse of NATO Secretaries General from
   1999 (Kosovo crisis) to today.},

Abstract = {This article tracks the European Union's efforts at the Association of
   Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum (ARF), from 2004 to 2008,
   to encourage Myanmar directly or indirectly to engage in security
   cooperation. It, then, explores Myanmar and ASEAN's reactions to the
   devastation caused by Cyclone Nargis to Myanmar's Irrawaddy delta in
   2008. It focuses on ARF as a forum whereby interactions take place. It
   examines whether the complementary of the analytical variables provided
   by the logic of consequences and appropriateness {[}March, J.G. and
   Olsen, J.P., 1998. The institutional dynamics of international political
   orders. Oslo, Arena Working Paper No. 5; 2004. The logic of
   appropriateness. Oslo, Arena Working Paper No. 9], social mechanisms
   {[}Checkel, J., 1999. Social construction and integration. Journal of
   European public policy, 6 (4), 545-560.] and observations derived from
   interviews (Southeast Asia and Brussels) can explain ASEAN and Myanmar's
   reactions and, also, the EU's behaviour in relation to the
   Myanmar-Nargis event. The EU's role is explored through the co-chair's
   summary reports of the meetings that the EU co-chaired with ASEAN. The
   article uncovers the EU's efforts to encourage ASEAN to take up
   responsibilities and Myanmar to accept multilateral security options. It
   argues that, as the EU tried to inspire Myanmar to connect with
   cooperation, ``Myanmar hit by Cyclone Nargis{''} motivated the EU
   Council to include the ``responsibility to protect{''} as a new goal of
   the European foreign and security policy of December 2008.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},

Pages = {442-460},
Abstract = {If a European organisation decides to deploy a military force in Mali or
   a police mission in Afghanistan, member states probably believe that
   collective security is a public good that benefits them all. But who
   will lead the mission? Who will staff it? Who will pay for it? Who will
   risk casualties? While rational-choice theorists expect little burden
   sharing, constructivists expect a great deal more insofar as normative
   pressures are brought to bear on governments. The problem is that it is
   hard to find countries that systematically eschew their responsibilities
   or, contrariwise, systematically contribute their fair share out of a
   sense of moral obligation. In this article, we analyse burden sharing as
   an anchoring practice, shedding light on the social logic of burden
   sharing rather than abstract interests or norms. Established after the
   end of the Second World War, the field of European security has given
   birth to a ``community of security practice{''} around the more or less
   routine task of determining national contributions to crisis management
   operations. Based on interviews with practitioners from the UK, France,
   Germany, Norway and Ireland, we analyse the impact of intersubjectivity,
   power and strategic culture on the practice of burden sharing.},

Abstract = {In this chapter, the question over the admission or rejection of
   children born in Hong Kong to Mainland parents will be examined with
   reference to three major moral considerations: (i) consequential
   calculation of utilities; (ii) liberal commitment to the elimination of
   undeserved inequalities; and (iii) communitarian concern over the
   preservation of integrity of the community. It will be argued that
   contrary to our intuition, utilitarian calculation would not necessarily
   in favor of rejection of outsiders as long as our calculation is
   impartial and the utilities of all parties concerned are taken into
   consideration. And the communitarian argument against admission of
   Mainlanders would not be as compelling as it appears if we could adopt a
   broader understanding of ``our{''} culture and pay attention to the fact
   that ``their{''} social and political dispositions are getting closer,
   but not farther, to the mainstream in Hong Kong. However, the liberal
   commitment, though undoubtedly in favor of admission of Mainland
   immigrants, would only justify our (limited) obligation to admit but not
   their unconditional right to enter.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},

Volume = {25},

Pages = {326-345},
Abstract = {This article examines the little explored issue of non-state actor (NSA)
   participation in the European Union's (EU) Common Security and Defence
   Policy (CSDP). Despite the fact that NGOs and civil society are shielded
   from formal access to CSDP, EU staff in both Brussels and the missions
   engage with them informally. Drawing on interviews with policy-makers
   and NSA representatives, the article analyses the practices of the EU in
   its engagement with NSAs, focusing on civilian missions in Georgia and
   Palestine. It shows that such engagement is more intense during
   implementation at the level of CSDP missions rather than during
   policy-making in Brussels. It argues that a combination of rational
   choice-based (functional needs of policy-makers and intensity of NSA
   advocacy) and constructivist (organisational and individual cultures)
   explanations helps us better understand why CSDP structures open up to
   NSAs. The article contributes to the nascent academic and policy debate
   on EU-civil society cooperation in CSDP and, more broadly, to the
   studies of informal governance in the EU and NSA participation in
   international organisations.},

Title = {CHEATING ON POLITICAL KNOWLEDGE QUESTIONS IN ONLINE SURVEYS AN
   ASSESSMENT OF THE PROBLEM AND SOLUTIONS},

Abstract = {Survey researchers worry about the quality of data produced by online
   surveys. One concern is that respondents might cheat on performance
   questions, such as political knowledge, invalidating their responses.
   Yet, existing evidence is unclear about the prevalence of cheating, and
   scholars lack a validated method for coping with the problem. In this
   paper, we demonstrate that such cheating behavior varies considerably by
   sample and provide some evidence that it is motivated by self-deceptive
   enhancement. We experimentally test a variety of methods for reducing
   cheating and find that common methods, such as timers, are not the most
   effective approach. By contrast, a commitment mechanism, in which
   respondents affirm their choice not to cheat, is more efficacious.
   Although cheating in online surveys can distort estimates of knowledge
   and decrease the validity of the measure, there are methods for coping
   with this problem.},

Abstract = {Although multiple theories suggest that economic development and
   inequality somehow affect democratization, these claims have received
   only limited empirical support. I contend that much of the confusion
   stems from the implicit assumption held by the literature that
   development and inequality affect democratization independently of one
   another. In this paper, I argue that the effect of income distribution
   on democratization is in fact contingent on the income level: in
   middle-income countries inequality fosters democratization; in rich
   countries, however, it harms democratization. Using a data set covering
   almost all autocracies between 1960 and 2007, I find evidence consistent
   with my hypothesis.},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen African militaries attempt coups in virtually
   every geographic region, from Egypt to Lesotho and Guinea to Madagascar.
   They have targeted established democracies, infantile democratic
   experiments, increasingly authoritarian executives, power vacuums
   brought on by leader death, and-most recently in Burundi-leaders
   attempting to circumvent constitutional limitations on their tenure.
   These continuing acts perpetrated against regimes with such varied
   backdrops suggests that coups still afflict a wide range of states and
   remain a continuing threat to leader tenure. This is in contrast to the
   African Union's emphasis on curbing the practice. This paper explores
   the African Union's effectiveness to combat military coups, primarily
   focusing on the potential for sanctions to act as a deterrent to
   would-be coup plotters. The paper also considers potential limitations
   on the African Union's (AU's) ability to project power against certain

   witnessed a meaningful decline in coup activity, an impact even more

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {543-559},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This article hypothesizes that the material incentives associated with
   the clean development mechanism (CDM) have contributed to the
   internalization of climate protection norms in China. In current
   academic research, the CDM has both been extolled as a cost-effective
   and vilified as an environmentally and ethically inadequate climate
   mitigation instrument. Few studies so far, however, have looked into the
   CDM's potential contribution to socialization-related phenomena such as
   raising climate change awareness in emerging economies. The relationship
   with the EU is highly relevant in this context, as the emission
   reduction credits (CERs) resulting from CDM projects would not have had
   any meaningful prices without the European Union's Emissions Trading
   System (EU ETS). This article aims to fill the current research gap by
   studying the socialization potential of the CDM in EU-China climate
   relations in four periods, namely initiation (2001-2005), improvement
   (2005-2007), consolidation (2008-2010) and habit formation (2010-2014).
   We argue that there is at least a discernible effect and that the
   underlying causal mechanism involves the emergence and activities of
   norm entrepreneurs and habit formation through a process of legal
   institutionalization.},

Abstract = {Affective Intelligence Theory (AIT) asserts that anxiety reduces the
   effect of party identification on candidate preferences (Marcus, Neuman,
   and MacKuen 2000), but recent studies have raised doubts about this
   causal claim. Rather than functioning as a moderator of party
   identification, perhaps anxiety has a direct effect on preferences, or
   perhaps the relationship is reversed and preferences drive emotions
   (Ladd and Lenz 2008). Alternatively, Marcus et al.'s measure of anxiety
   may simply be capturing partisan ambivalence, so the posited
   relationship is spurious (Lavine, Johnston, and Steenbergen 2012). This
   paper addresses each of these questions by examining the effect of
   experimentally induced emotions on the types of considerations that came
   to mind when a national sample of adult Americans was asked what they
   liked and disliked about Barack Obama. By directly manipulating anxiety,
   this experiment avoids the causal ambiguity plaguing this debate and
   ascertains the true nature of the relationship between anxiety and
   ambivalence. Consistent with AIT, anxiety led respondents to recall more
   contemporary considerations, whereas enthusiasm brought to mind more
   long-standing considerations. Because the political context at the time
   of the study (fall 2013) was a very tumultuous time for the Obama

Abstract = {This article analyzes the increasing institutional and organizational
   complexity and fragmentation surrounding the international financing
   mechanism REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest
   degradation in developing countries and related forest activities), now
   being negotiated within the UNFCCC. We focus, in particular, on
   critically assessing the prospects of managing such fragmentation. We do
   so by analyzing whether and how (what we conceptualize here as) a
   ``bridge organization{''}-the voluntary, multi-stakeholder REDD+
   Partnership bringing together state and non-state actors from global to
   local scales-has aided in managing fragmentation in this realm, through
   exercising four enabling functions (enhancing transparency,
   participation, knowledge sharing, and coordination). Our analysis shows
   that the REDD+ Partnership has partially succeeded in furthering such
   procedural aims, but that this has not resulted in a ``scaling up of
   REDD+ action and finance,{''} its overarching substantive aim. In
   contrast to dominant views of a bridge organization's modus operandi, we
   conclude, based on our analysis, that its value lies not in overcoming
   persisting geopolitical conflicts around climate mitigation and
   providing a ``depoliticized{''} context within which to manage
   fragmentation. Instead, its success lies in permitting dialogue and
   exchange even in the face of persisting political conflicts over its
   raison d'tre and functions. In making these arguments, the article
   extends recent debates on the prospects to manage fragmentation in
   global environmental governance and provides a critical assessment of
   the role therein for bridge organizations.},

Abstract = {Scholars of international relations have actively debated the
   consequences of globalization. Among this literature is the growing
   attention to the status of women. While scholars have largely treated
   globalization as either improving or degrading women's rights, we point
   to a conditional relationship. In contrast to assuming that the
   influence of globalization is invariably ``good{''} or ``bad,{''} we
   suggest that the character of the norms that will be diffused and
   adopted is dependent on the domestic norms of those a state is
   ``globalized with.{''} We offer two expectations. First, states that
   tend to trade more with democracies should see a domestic improvement in
   the status of women. Second, we expect women's status to improve when
   states trade more heavily with other states with high levels of women's
   rights. An analysis of 184 countries from 1981 to 2008 provides strong
   support for the theory. Total trade flows and trade dependence only have
   negative associations with women's status when conducted
   disproportionately with states that are autocratic or have low levels of
   women's status.},

Abstract = {The study of political development over the past half century has been
   heavily influenced by the ebb and flow of democracy in the global South.
   The global experience has demonstrated that the geographic, economic,
   and cultural range of democratic regimes is far more expansive than
   often assumed half a century ago, forcing major theoretical
   reassessments of democracy's political origins and social correlates. At
   the same time, the challenges of constructing effective representative
   and participatory institutions to stabilize democracy and make it more
   ``consequential{''} have become increasingly apparent. The tensions
   between democracy's rapid spread and its oftentimes shallow reach have
   fostered a wide range of experiments with new representative and
   participatory channels, creating a fluid democratic landscape in much of
   the developing world.},

Abstract = {The African Group of Negotiators (AGN) has become a much more
   significant bargaining coalition in the global climate change
   negotiations. It has been participating more proactively and on a much
   more significant scale, and, as a result, it has had a greater impact on
   bargaining outcomes, notably in Nairobi, Copenhagen and Durban. Yet, at
   present, the group remains poorly understood by both scholars and
   policymakers. Compared to other groups in the climate negotiations, such
   as the Group of 77 and Alliance of Small Island States, it has received
   relatively little attention. This paper fills this gap by tracking the
   evolution of the AGN over the course of the climate change negotiations.
   In the early years after the Earth Summit, it shows that the AGN faced
   tremendous difficulties pursing regional objectives effectively, largely
   due to a number of ``internal'' barriers to participation, which
   compounded the structural barriers that the continent faced by making it
   difficult to use ``low-power'' negotiating strategies such as coalition
   building, agenda-setting and persuasion. However, in recent years, the
   group has become much more pro-active as a result of greater access to
   material, ideational and institutional resources. These have relieved,
   somewhat, the internal barriers that the group faced, making it possible
   for the AGN to negotiate much more confidently and effectively than
   before.},

Abstract = {In Australia after World War II, sports associations saw their returning
   players as having gone through the test of battle and again proven
   themselves. The Korean War confirmed the belief that sport could create
   `soldier sportsmen' who were perceived as superior fighters. But
   conscription during the Vietnam War challenged the notion that there
   existed an Anzac `soldier sportsman' who volunteered when he heard the
   `call of duty' to take up the `greater game'. Throughout the post-war
   period increasingly the relationship between Anzac and sport became even
   closer as the playing of sport on Anzac Day was adopted by all
   Australian States. By the twenty-first century sports associations had
   invented rituals and ceremonies for the sport played on the day.},

Abstract = {It is widely thought that news organizations exhibit ideological bias,
   but rigorously quantifying such slant has proven methodologically
   challenging. Through a combination of machine-learning and crowdsourcing
   techniques, we investigate the selection and framing of political issues
   in fifteen major US news outlets. Starting with 803,146 news stories
   published over twelve months, we first used supervised learning
   algorithms to identify the 14 percent of articles pertaining to
   political events. We then recruited 749 online human judges to classify
   a random subset of 10,502 of these political articles according to topic
   and ideological position. Our analysis yields an ideological ordering of
   outlets consistent with prior work. However, news outlets are
   considerably more similar than generally believed. Specifically, with
   the exception of political scandals, major news organizations present
   topics in a largely nonpartisan manner, casting neither Democrats nor
   Republicans in a particularly favorable or unfavorable light. Moreover,
   again with the exception of political scandals, little evidence exists
   of systematic differences in story selection, with all major news
   outlets covering a wide variety of topics with frequency largely
   unrelated to the outlet's ideological position. Finally, news
   organizations express their ideological bias not by directly advocating
   for a preferred political party, but rather by disproportionately
   criticizing one side, a convention that further moderates overall
   differences.},

Abstract = {Bearing the promise of triple win for sending and receiving countries as
   well as migrants, circular migration has been taken up by the EU as a
   policy instrument to better manage migratory movements of third country
   nationals. Within the context of the EU-Moldova Mobility Partnership
   this approach has yielded only few results as both conceptual and policy
   ambiguity continues to exist about the meaning and rationale of circular
   migration. Moreover, regulated circular migration schemes have not yet
   been fully implemented while their shortcomings are gradually recognized
   by different stakeholders. The paper argues that the focus should
   therefore be on improving the legal framework and conditions to allow
   Moldovan migrants to go back and forth between their country of origin
   and destination. It also recommends to make more use of the Mobility
   Partnership as ``regional approach{''} towards migration and to enable
   the conclusion of multilateral agreements between Moldova and different
   EU Member States.},

Abstract = {In 2015, a center-left government introduced an electoral reform that
   replaced the binomial electoral system governing parliamentary elections
   since 1989 with a more proportional system. This article provides an
   account of the reform process, describes the new electoral law, and
   discusses the factors explaining the reform. We argue, first, that it
   was possible, due to the incentives the government provided, to secure
   the support of an ample majority of parliamentarians; also, a new and
   favorable political scenario had emerged, in which the support of the
   main right-wing parties was not necessary for the reform to pass.
   Second, we maintain that the reform sought mainly to resolve problems
   affecting the parties of the governing coalition related to negotiations
   of coalition lists for elections. As a complementary objective, the
   reform promoted a general interest by establishing rules that allowed a
   fairer system of representation and improved competitive conditions.},

Abstract = {Despite a considerable amount of research over the last three decades,
   an unequivocal conclusion regarding democracy's impact on social
   outcomes has not been reached. This paper attempts to enhance
   understanding of the impact of political regimes on social outcomes by
   applying a dimensional approach. Unlike previous studies, which have
   focused on the overall effect of democracy, this paper separates the
   dimension of elite competition from the dimension of popular
   participation and tests their relative effects on the satisfaction of
   basic needs. Cross-national statistical tests demonstrate that effective
   participation has a positive effect on need satisfaction, whereas
   excessive competition has a negative impact. Theoretical explanations of
   these different impacts are provided. It is argued that the best way to
   understand the relationship between democracy and social outcomes is to
   realize that democracy's overall effect might conceal the existence of
   opposing effects of its component parts. This finding suggests more
   nuanced ways of reforming political systems that bypass the possible
   trade-off between democratization and social development.},

Volume = {16},

Abstract = {This article explores competing interpretive frames regarding shale gas
   in Bulgaria, Poland, and Romania. These countries face the choice of
   embracing shale gas as a potential revolutionizing domestic source of
   energy, against the backdrop of Russia serving as the dominant gas
   supplier. This makes them interesting cases for studying how policy
   narratives and discourses coalesce around a novel technology. The
   findings, which are based on sixty-six semistructured research
   interviews, point to differing and indeed competing frames, ranging from
   national security, environmental boons to economic sellout and
   authoritarianism, with different sets of institutions sharing those
   frames. This suggests that enhancing energy security by way of deploying
   novel energy technologies such as shale gas fracking is not simply a
   function of resource endowments and technological progress. Instead, it
   is the result of complex dynamics unfolding among social stakeholders
   and the related discursive processes, which eventually will determine
   whetheror notshale gas will go global.},

Abstract = {What explains the persistent growth of public employment in reform-era
   China despite repeated and forceful downsizing campaigns? Why do some
   provinces retain more public employees and experience higher rates of
   bureaucratic expansion than others? Among electoral regimes, the
   creation and distribution of public jobs is typically attributed to the
   politics of vote buying and multi-party competition. Electoral factors,
   however, cannot explain the patterns observed in China's single-party
   dictatorship. This study highlights two nested factors that influence
   public employment in China: party co-optation and personal clientelism.
   As a collective body, the ruling party seeks to co-opt restive ethnic
   minorities by expanding cadre recruitment in hinterland provinces.
   Within the party, individual elites seek to expand their own networks of
   power by appointing clients to office. The central government's
   professed objective of streamlining bureaucracy is in conflict with the
   party's co-optation goal and individual elites' clientelist interest. As
   a result, the size of public employment has inflated during the reform
   period despite top-down mandates to downsize bureaucracy.},

Abstract = {In many post-election surveys, the proportion of respondents who claim
   to have voted is greater than government-reported turnout rates. These
   differences have often been attributed to respondent lying (e.g., Burden
   2000). In a search for greater accuracy, scholars have replaced
   respondent self-reports of turnout with government records of their
   turnout (a.k.a. turnout validation). Some scholars have interpreted
   ``validated{''} turnout estimates as more accurate than respondent
   self-reports because ``validated{''} rates tend to be lower than
   aggregate self-reported rates and tend to be closer to
   government-reported rates. We explore the viability of turnout
   validation efforts. We find that several apparently viable methods of
   matching survey respondents to government records severely underestimate
   the proportion of Americans who were registered to vote. Matching errors
   that severely underestimate registration rates also drive down
   ``validated{''} turnout estimates. As a result, when ``validated{''}
   turnout estimates appear to be more accurate than self-reports because
   they produce lower turnout estimates, the apparent accuracy is likely an
   illusion. Also, among respondents whose self-reports can be validated
   against government records, the accuracy of self-reports is extremely
   high. This would not occur if lying was the primary explanation for
   differences between reported and official turnout rates. These findings
   challenge the notion that the practice of ``turnout validation{''}
   offers a means of measuring turnout that is more accurate than survey
   respondents' self-reports.},

Abstract = {Numeric political appeals represent a prevalent but overlooked domain of
   public opinion research. When can quantitative information change
   political attitudes, and is this change trumped by partisan effects? We
   analyze how numeracy-or individual differences in citizens' ability to
   process and apply numeric policy information-moderates the effectiveness
   of numeric political appeals on a moderately salient policy issue.
   Results show that those low in numeracy exhibit a strong party-cue
   effect, treating numeric information in a superficial and heuristic
   fashion. Conversely, those high in numeracy are persuaded by numeric
   information, even when it is sponsored by the opposing party, overcoming
   the party-cue effect. Our results make clear that overlooking numeric
   ability when analyzing quantitative political appeals can mask
   significant persuasion effects, and we build on recent work advancing
   the understanding of individual differences in public opinion.},

Abstract = {The rise of transnational nonstate certification programs has
   contributed to complex accountability relations surrounding efforts to
   hold companies accountable for their environmental and social impacts.
   Using the analytical lenses of internal and external accountability, we
   examine the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)a fisheries certification
   programto assess how its decisions about goals, engagement of
   stakeholders, and accountability mechanisms have affected the
   controversies facing the program and how it has sought to address them.
   We reveal a misalignment between environmental groups and the MSC. Both
   seek to advance sustainable fisheries, and the market campaigns of
   environmental groups have supported certification. However, the MSC has
   provided these groups limited influence over its governance; it has
   responded to external demands for accountability by focusing on internal
   accountability, and reforming its assessment and objection procedures.
   Environmental groups have responded by working to decouple their
   campaigns from supporting the MSC. Tracing the consequences of this
   misalignment therefore highlights the need to assess rival processes
   such as market and information campaigns to understand attempts to hold
   nonstate certification programs to account.},

Abstract = {Although many policy-makers and scholars maintain that international
   norms have altered the motivations underlying state behaviour, this
   article argues that states continue to pursue national self-interest,
   but in ways that remain understudied. While traditional realist
   assumptions explain a great deal of state behaviour, they have not been
   widely used to account for important alternative tools of state
   intervention, such as economic and normative strategies. Focusing on the
   case of Russia's 2014 intervention in Ukraine, this article offers
   insights into how, and under what circumstances, these tools are used to
   accomplish traditional state objectives. Guided by the tenets of
   neoclassical realism, the article argues that in the case of Russia,
   military force is no longer the sole, or even the primary, means used to
   accomplish traditional security goals. Such dynamics have significant
   theoretical and policy implications for contemporary international
   relations.},

Abstract = {This article shows how the existence of a community of European
   practitioners in the Jerusalem area gives substance to the European
   stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The often-stated European
   Union (EU) support for a two-state solution could appear meaningless in
   the absence of peace negotiations. However, European diplomats (i.e.
   diplomats of EU member states and EU officials) in the East
   Jerusalem-Ramallah area are committed to specific practices of political
   resistance to Israeli occupation and recognition of Palestinian
   institutions. These practices have led not only to a specific political
   geography of diplomacy, but also to a community of practice, composed of
   European diplomats and based on their daily experience of resisting
   occupation and bestowing recognition. It is this group of officials who
   represent and actively ``do{''} Europe's position and under occupation.},

Abstract = {In this gender analysis of the U.S. presidency, the gender identity of
   two vice presidential running mates contributes to an understanding of
   political ambition. The Republican Party nominated its first woman vice
   presidential candidate, Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska, in 2008. Four
   years later, the party reverted to the established practice of
   nominating a man for the vice presidency, selecting U.S. Representative
   Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. Both Palin and Ryan were white, claimed
   middle-class families of origin, presented themselves as self-made,
   signaled a generational shift in leadership, and had strong ideological
   alliances throughout the Republican Party. Yet Palin was a Washington
   outsider and one of the few Republican women in elected office across
   the country, while Ryan was a Washington insider and among the
   gender-race majority in his party and in government. These complex
   identities confronted Palin and Ryan with distinctive challenges and
   opportunities, as individual candidates and as running mates. This
   chapter provides a close study of the Palin and Ryan nomination
   acceptance speeches delivered at the 2008 and 2012 Republican National
   Conventions. These speeches reveal how these candidates and this party
   connected gender to leadership, throughout the campaign, in anticipation
   of elective office.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to show how (new) modes of governance emerge
   in EU politics. It seeks to find out how European institutions manage to
   define new policy tools and modes of governance when their legitimacy is
   not only contested but it also reveals a regulatory gap. By examining
   recent debates concerning the ability of the EU to safeguard the rule of
   law at the supranational level, this article shows that in a field in
   which politicization raises the pressure to act at the EU level but
   member states do not delegate more hierarchical powers, the European
   Commission applies a network approach that spans beyond the EU. This
   article shows that, in order to strengthen the EU's input, output, and
   throughput legitimacy, the Commission is creating a complex
   multi-institutional framework and has introduced a `division of labour'
   between several international bodies and organizations. The article
   focuses not only on the emergence of this network, but also on its
   evolution and expansion.},

Abstract = {This chapter on identity politics argues that President Obama's own
   gender-race performance, as a biracial man who identifies as black, is
   intrinsic to his presidential politics. As candidate and as president,
   through innumerable actions and statements, Barack Obama consistently
   defines black masculinity in terms of personal responsibility, as
   performed in the family, profession, community, and society. This
   principle, which has profound consequences for politics and policy, is
   perhaps most fully expressed in the president's 2013 Morehouse College
   commencement address. Setting Obama's gender-race ideology in
   context-examining it as a statement of African American political
   thought and politics made by a president whose realization of his
   political ambitions depended on a majority white electorate-reveals some
   of the challenges confronting the men and women whose identities will
   redefine the U.S. presidency so that it is no longer exclusively white
   or exclusively male.},

Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {80},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {351-377},
Abstract = {Although anecdotal stories of political anger and enthusiasm appear to
   be provoked largely by issues such as gay marriage or healthcare reform,
   social sorting is capable of playing a powerful role in driving anger
   and enthusiasm, undercutting the perception that only practical
   disagreements are driving higher levels of political rancor. Because a
   highly aligned set of social identities increases an individual's
   perceived differences between groups, the emotions that result from
   group conflict are likely to be heightened among well-sorted partisans.
   An experimental design in a national online survey manipulates political
   threats and reassurances, including a threat to a party and a threat to
   distinct policy goals. Issue positions are found to drive anger and
   enthusiasm in the presence of issue-based messages, but not all
   party-based messages. Partisan identity drives anger and enthusiasm in
   the presence of party-based threats and reassurances, but not all
   issue-based messages. Social sorting, however, drives anger and
   enthusiasm in response to all threats and reassurances, suggesting that
   well-sorted partisans are more reliably emotionally reactive to
   political messages. Finally, these results are driven not by the
   most-sorted partisans, but by the emotional dampening effect that occurs
   among those with the most cross-cutting identities. As social sorting
   increases in the American electorate, the cooler heads inspired by
   cross-cutting identities are likely to be taking up a smaller portion of
   the electorate.},

   ``Baltic factor{''}},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {237-255},
Abstract = {Contrary to some expectations, the Baltic states' accession to the EU in
   2004 was not followed by an improvement in their relations with Russia.
   Instead, the Baltic states became known as the ``troublemakers{''} of
   EU-Russia relations. This was commonly explained by their history and
   national identity, which contributed to an understanding of the Baltic
   concerns as marginal. The Ukraine crisis brought a reaction of ``I told
   you so{''} by the Baltic states that for many years had been warning the
   West about Russia's expansionist ambitions. This article explores the
   ideational underpinnings of the gap between the Baltic states'
   perceptions of and relations with Russia on the one hand and mainstream
   views in Europe on the other. It identifies liberal interdependence,
   democratic peace, and realist geopolitics as key ideas that have framed
   the EU's and Baltic states' perceptions of Russia. In the vein of
   constructivist foreign policy analysis, these ideational structures are
   seen to condition the EU's and Baltic states' interests and policies
   vis-a-vis Russia. An analysis of the ``Baltic factor{''} helps to
   illuminate the contradictions and shortcomings in the EU's Russia policy
   and review its ideational basis which is now in need of a strategic
   rethink.},

Abstract = {Cointegration was introduced to our discipline by Renee Smith and
   Charles Ostrom Jr. and by Robert Durr more than two decades ago at
   political methodology meetings in Washington University-St. Louis and
   Florida State University. Their articles, along with comments by Neal
   Beck and John T. Williams, were published in a symposium like this one
   in the fourth volume of Political Analysis. Keele, Lin, and Webb (2016;
   hereafter KLW) and Grant and Lebo (2016; hereafter GL) show how, in the
   years that followed, cointegration was further evaluated by political
   scientists, and the related idea of error correction subsequently was
   applied.
   Have the last twenty-plus years witnessed significant progress in
   modeling nonstationary political time series? In some respects, the
   answer is yes. The present symposium represents progress in
   understanding equation balance, analyzing bounded variables, and
   decomposing short-and long-term causal effects. In these respects KLW's
   and GL's articles deserve wide dissemination. But KLW and GL leave
   important methodological issues unresolved. They do not address some
   critical methodological challenges. From a historical perspective, the
   present symposium shows that we have made relatively little progress in
   modeling nonstationary political time series.},

Abstract = {The appropriateness of experiments for studying causal mechanisms is
   well established. However, the ability of an experiment to isolate the
   effect of emotion has received less attention, and in this letter we lay
   out a guide to manipulating and tracing the impact of emotions. Some
   experimental manipulations are straightforward. Manipulating an emotion
   like anxiety is less obvious. There is no magic ``political anxiety
   pill{''} and placebo that can be randomly assigned to participants.
   While the magic political anxiety pill is still elusive, we advocate
   using multiple manipulations, extensive pretesting, and mediation
   models. These approaches have allowed us to situate a discrete emotional
   experience in a complex political environment.},

Abstract = {We assess the fairness and ambition level of the EU's Intended
   Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) of reducing domestic
   greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 \% relative to 1990. For this,
   we calculate which reduction targets for other major emitting economies
   are comparable to the EU target, given widely diverging effort-sharing
   approaches. We introduce a novel approach in which the EU target is
   taken as starting point for allocating emission reductions to other
   regions. Under this approach, the global emission level is an outcome of
   the analysis, contrary to standard effort-sharing approaches in which
   the global climate goal is specified. We find that the INDC of the EU,
   if other regions take on comparable targets based on a differentiated
   convergence per-capita approach, could be sufficient for a global 2 A
   degrees C pathway. However, if emissions are allocated according to a
   historical responsibility approach, the global emission level in 2030 is
   much higher than the level of 2 A degrees C pathways. Furthermore, we
   conclude that India, Mexico, and Brazil have more ambitious INDCs than
   the EU according to both a differentiated convergence per-capita
   approach and a historical responsibility approach.},

Abstract = {Since the 1930s, US politicians have argued about whether healthcare
   should be the responsibility of the federal government. Both major
   political parties have cited public opinion concerning Americans'
   support for or rejection of government provision of healthcare to
   support their position. With the passage of the Patient Protection and
   Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010, however, the political debate has
   changed. Where it had been about the government provision of healthcare
   as an abstract principle, it became a debate imbued with evaluations of
   the implementation of the ACA itself. This spawned a new line of
   research examining the consequences of the ACA's implementation on
   public attitudes toward government provision of healthcare. The change
   in support for government provision of healthcare and the new post-ACA
   research highlight a need for a long-term examination of trends in
   support over the past two decades that will provide context for the new
   studies. This study provides that examination.},

Abstract = {We show how to use multilevel modeling and post-stratification to
   estimate legislative outcomes under counterfactual representation
   schemes that, for example, boost the representation of women or
   translate votes into seats differently. We apply this technique to two
   research questions: (1) Would the U.S. Congress be less polarized if
   state delegations were formed according to the principle of party
   proportional representation? (2) Would there have been stronger support
   for legalizing same-sex marriage in the U.K. House of Commons if
   Parliament more closely reflected the population in gender and age?},

Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {80},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {225-249},
Abstract = {Who do legislators best represent? This paper addresses this question by
   investigating the degree of ideological congruence between senators and
   constituents on a unified scale. Specifically, I measure congruence
   between legislators and four constituent subsets-donors, co-partisans,
   supporters, and registered voters. To estimate the preferences of these
   groups, I use a large survey of voters and an original survey of
   campaign contributors that samples both in- and out-of-state
   contributors in the 2012 election cycle. I find that senators'
   preferences reflect the preferences of the average donor better than any
   other group. Senators from both parties are slightly more ideologically
   extreme than the average co-partisan in their state and those who voted
   for them in 2012. Finally, senators' preferences diverge dramatically
   from the preference of the average voter in their state. The degree of
   divergence is nearly as large as if voters were randomly assigned to a
   senator. These results show that in the case of the Senate, there is a
   dearth of congruence between constituents and senators-unless these
   constituents are those who write checks and attend fund-raisers.},

Abstract = {This article examines the performances of the \#DANSwithme protests in
   Bulgaria in the summer and early autumn of 2013, and asks questions
   about the role of carnival and the everyday as a resource for the
   elaboration of protest idiom for popular movements. I complement the
   implications of recent work on carnivalesque protests and politics and
   argue that in appropriating the sites, tropes, and practices of the
   everyday and the ordinary in order to parade daily discontent with the
   political establishment in Bulgaria, the political message of the
   protest can also lose its exceptionality and become too routine to make
   a difference.},

Abstract = {The classical approaches on skilled migration focus on the negative
   effects of the phenomenon through concepts such as brain drain.
   Geopolitical, economic, social and technological changes occurred in the
   last decades allow the development of new theoretical tools that enable
   a better understanding of the skilled migration processes. From this
   perspective, the chapter aims to review the main concepts provided by
   the literature on skilled migration and to highlight the potential of
   the brain networking perspective as a theoretical and political tool.
   The second objective of the chapter is to present the main findings of
   the survey conducted in 2010 to a sample of 217 skilled Romanian
   immigrants that are part of the international brain network GRASP
   (Global Romanian Society of Young Professionals).},

Abstract = {In this paper, I analyze the moral problems in relation to the practice
   of compensated dating in Hong Kong. I identify three features which are
   often involved in the activity of compensated dating. The first is
   prostitution. If the trade of compensated dating involves an exchange of
   money for sex, then people may rightly question the moral permissibility
   of this practice. Secondly, the actions of compensated dating may
   involve sex activities between teenagers and adults. Thirdly, critics
   claim that the workers of compensated dating may be motivated by a
   mistaken view of the worth of things. In this paper, I have explained
   why these three criticisms are indefensible. I believe that the
   government's policy in regard to the education of the teenagers, youth
   development, and the support it provides for workers of compensated
   dating should be reviewed.},

Abstract = {The occurrence and outcomes of the Cod Wars defy both popular and
   academic expectations. Iceland, a microstate, essentially won four
   disputes against the UK, a great power. The two states furthermore
   belonged to a Western security community, sharing significant
   institutional, economic and cultural ties. This article reviews the
   history and international relations literature on the Cod Wars to
   explain and evaluate why the Cod Wars occurred and why Iceland won them.
   This article also explains what lessons international relations
   scholarship has learned from the Cod Wars for liberal international
   relations theory, realism and asymmetric bargaining.},

Abstract = {This article argues that geography is essential to explain subnational
   variation in extractive power. To exercise power over the expanse of
   their realm, governments need an infrastructure to access even more
   peripheral communities. But as rulers overcome the problems of distance,
   they discover the challenges of proximity, because locals influence
   state agents and undermine state autonomy. Studying the uneven reach of
   Chinese local governments within their jurisdictions, we demonstrate
   that micro-variation of extraction in rural China, including monetary
   and non-monetary levies, provides a rare window onto the micro-geography
   of power. Physical distance still obstructs extractive power projection
   into extremely remote places, but physical proximity has become a
   greater constraint for the exercise of power. Local governments are
   pressured by their immediate neighborhood, at the expense of less
   fortunate citizens, who live at intermediate distances: still within the
   reach of the state, but already too far away to turn the state to their
   favor. The effect of organizational distance, which in China is mediated
   primarily through the Communist Party, is similarly dualistic: Party
   networks alleviate asymmetric information problems, which hamper rural
   taxation around the world, but party networks are sustained by patronage
   and therefore jeopardize state autonomy.},

Abstract = {Climate clubs have been suggested as a gateway to substantial reductions
   in global emissions. The club approach begins with a small number of
   enthusiastic countries. This paper asks under what conditions such clubs
   are likely to evolve into effective cooperation through side-payments to
   new members. The question is addressed through a range of formal thought
   experiments using numerical simulations. The model is calibrated using
   empirical data on countries' emissions, GDP, populations, and
   vulnerabilities. It is simple and stylized, but allows for complex and
   dynamic interactions between actors. Basic equity considerations can be
   accommodated. The results indicate that side-payments' theoretical
   potential for facilitating effective clubs is large. One or two large
   emitters can initiate a club that grows to cover a substantial share of
   global emissions if the global benefit-cost ratio for mitigation is
   around 3 or larger. The size of stable clubs is larger if new members
   contribute to making side-payments, and somewhat lower if equity
   considerations constrain the set of possible transfers. Side-payments'
   effect is enabled by the large asymmetries between countries. Total
   side-payment flows range from tens to hundreds of billions of US dollars
   annually.},

Abstract = {Drawing upon Littler and Naidoo's white past, multicultural present'
   alignment, this article examines English newspaper coverage of two
   British' events held in 2012 (the Diamond Jubilee and the London Olympic
   Games). In light of recent work on English nationalism, national
   identity and multiculturalism, this article argues that representations
   of Britain oscillated between lamentations for an English/British past -
   marred by decline - and a present that, while being portrayed as both
   confident and progressive, was beset by latent anxieties. In doing so,
   past' reflections of England/Britain were presented as a safe' and
   legitimate source of belonging that had subsequently been lost and
   undermined amidst the diversity of the present'. As a result, feelings
   of discontent, anxiety and nostalgia were dialectically constructed
   alongside traditional' understandings of England/Britain. Indeed, this
   draws attention to the ways in which particular versions' of the past
   are engaged with and the impact that this can have on discussions
   related to multiculturalism and the multiethnic history of
   England/Britain.},

Abstract = {Most agree that large sums of money should be transferred to the most
   vulnerable countries in order to help them adapt to climate change. But
   how should that money be allocated within those countries? A popular and
   intuitively plausible answer, in line with the strong standing of the
   norm of ownership in development aid circles, is that this is for the
   recipient country to decide. The paper investigates the three most
   important types of ethical arguments for such `recipient control': the
   epistemic argument, the entitlement argument, and the legitimacy
   argument. It is argued that there is a good case for recipient control
   in democratic countries, because such countries can be expected to act
   in the name of the people to whom adaptation finance is ultimately owed.
   However, the three arguments do not support, even if taken jointly,
   recipient control in nondemocratic countries. This is a significant
   result seeing as the majority of the most vulnerable countries are
   nondemocratic.},

Abstract = {Time of vote decision research has shaped our understanding of the
   nature and influence of campaigns. Traditionally, time of decision has
   been viewed primarily as a reflection of individual-level
   characteristics, especially political interest or attentiveness. We use
   eight waves of panel survey data to evaluate how campaign context
   interacts with attentiveness to affect time of decision in the 2008 US
   presidential election. Our data show that less politically interested
   respondents living in locations where campaigning was most intense made
   up their minds earlier than those living elsewhere, but there is no such
   difference among the most interested. Rather than time of decision
   simply constraining campaign effects, these results suggest that
   campaigns structure the time of decision.},

Abstract = {The ``right to health{''} is increasingly enshrined in national
   constitutions around the world-present today in a slight majority of
   written constitutions. Whether this trend is good, bad, or meaningless
   is considerably debated. Contrary to skeptics' worries, this study finds
   empirical evidence of a positive role of the right to health in the
   production of population health. Estimating the most widely promulgated
   theories of the economic and social determinants of health, and the role
   of electoral democracy, provides a foundation from which to evaluate the
   effect of the right to health. This study assembles and analyzes data
   for 144 countries between 1970 and 2010 and finds that, controlling for
   these factors, a constitutional right to health contributes
   significantly to wellbeing. Assembled quantitative and case-study
   evidence both support the idea that institutional environments shaped by
   a right to health encourage more and better delivery of health services,
   which in part account for positive impact on health outcomes. These
   results suggest that focusing research on political institutions
   primarily on democratic participation rights ignores important impacts
   of ``entitlement{''} rights on norms and actors in health policy-making.
   Overall, the right to health is both an important contextual factor for
   health research and meaningful institutional innovation.},

Abstract = {The analysis of necessary conditions for some outcome of interest has
   long been one of the main preoccupations of scholars in all disciplines
   of the social sciences. In this connection, the introduction of
   Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) in the late 1980s has
   revolutionized the way research on necessary conditions has been carried
   out. Standards of good practice for QCA have long demanded that the
   results of preceding tests for necessity constrain QCA's core process of
   Boolean minimization so as to enhance the quality of parsimonious and
   intermediate solutions. Schneider and Wagemann's Theory-Guided/Enhanced
   Standard Analysis (T/ESA) is currently being adopted by applied
   researchers as the new state-of-the-art procedure in this respect. In
   drawing on Schneider and Wagemann's own illustrative data example and a
   meta-analysis of thirty-six truth tables across twenty-one published
   studies that have adhered to current standards of good practice in QCA,
   I demonstrate that, once bias against compound conditions in necessity
   tests is accounted for, T/ESA will produce conservative solutions, and
   not enhanced parsimonious or intermediate ones.},

Title = {Minilateralism or the UNFCCC? The Political Feasibility of Climate Clubs},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {62-88},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Climate clubs, or minilateralism, are increasingly advocated as a way to
   move global climate governance forward. Minilateralism supposedly
   carries structural advantages that facilitate effective climate
   governance. Some have cautioned, however, that climate clubs lack
   political legitimacy, commanding little domestic public support.
   Consequently, small coalitions might not always be politically feasible,
   even if they could deliver substantial mitigation. Design features like
   the emission share regulated, commitment structure, club goods, and
   sanctions against nonmembers could help mitigate this deficit. I report
   results from conjoint experiments testing these propositions that were
   conducted with nationally representative samples in the United States
   and India. The findings indicate that minilateral approaches per se tend
   to receive low public support, but that support can be increased by
   certain configurations of design elements, especially through a
   combination of club goods for members and sanctions against nonmember
   countries. Climate clubs therefore need careful institutional design to
   be politically feasible.},

Abstract = {In the analysis of causal effects in non-experimental studies,
   conditioning on observable covariates is one way to try to reduce
   unobserved confounder bias. However, a developing literature has shown
   that conditioning on certain covariates may increase bias, and the
   mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been fully explored. We
   add to the literature on bias-increasing covariates by first introducing
   a way to decompose omitted variable bias into three constituent parts:
   bias due to an unobserved confounder, bias due to excluding observed
   covariates, and bias due to amplification. This leads to two important
   findings. Although instruments have been the primary focus of the bias
   amplification literature to date, we identify the fact that the popular
   approach of adding group fixed effects can lead to bias amplification as
   well. This is an important finding because many practitioners think that
   fixed effects are a convenient way to account for any and all
   group-level confounding and are at worst harmless. The second finding
   introduces the concept of bias unmasking and shows how it can be even
   more insidious than bias amplification in some cases. After introducing
   these new results analytically, we use constructed observational placebo
   studies to illustrate bias amplification and bias unmasking with real
   data. Finally, we propose a way to add bias decomposition information to
   graphical displays for sensitivity analysis to help practitioners think
   through the potential for bias amplification and bias unmasking in
   actual applications.},

Abstract = {Sensitive survey techniques (SSTs) are frequently used to study
   sensitive behaviors. However, existing strategies for employing SSTs
   lead to highly variable prevalence estimates and do not permit analysts
   to address the question of whether the use of an SST is actually
   necessary. The current article presents a survey questioning strategy
   and corresponding statistical framework that fills this gap. By jointly
   analyzing survey responses generated by an SST (the crosswise model)
   along with direct responses about the sensitive behavior, the article's
   framework addresses the question of whether the use of an SST is
   required to study a given sensitive behavior, provides an efficient
   estimate of the prevalence of the sensitive behavior, and, in its
   extended form, efficiently estimates how individual characteristics
   relate to the likelihood of engaging in the behavior. The utility of the
   approach is demonstrated through an examination of gender differences in
   proclivities towards corruption in Costa Rica.},

Abstract = {Globalization processes have rendered non-state actors an integral part
   of global governance. The body of literature that has examined non-state
   actor involvement in global governance has focused mainly on whether and
   how non-state actors can influence states. Less attention has been paid
   to the comparative advantages of non-state actors to answer questions
   about agency across categories of non-state actors, and more precisely
   what governance activities non-state actors are perceived to fulfil.
   Using unique survey material from two climate change conferences, we
   propose that different categories of non-state actors have distinct
   governance profiles. We further suggest that the different governance
   profiles are derived from particular power sources and that agency is a
   function of these profiles. The study thereby contributes to a strand in
   the literature focusing on the authority of non-state actors in climate
   governance and broadens the methodological toolkit for studying the
   ``governors'' of global governance.},

Abstract = {Soon after the Gallipoli landing on 25 April1915, the Australian
   soldiers were described as a `race of athletes' in the first despatch to
   make it back to Australia. The use of this sports metaphor by British
   journalist Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett reflected the prevalence in both
   Britain and Australia of the late Victorian and Edwardian idea of
   masculinity which decreed that proving one's manhood on the sports field
   was preparation for the `greater game' of proving manhood on the
   battlefield. The notion that Australian men, who excelled at sports
   before World War I, had at Gallipoli proven themselves and upheld the
   manhood of their nation found its way into Australian national identity},

Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {72-91},
Abstract = {This article analyses French executives' and lawmakers' legitimisations
   of the intervention in Libya with the aim of understanding the
   discursive construction of intervention. It investigates the arguments
   in favour of intervention and the oppositions they were confronted with.
   To these arguments belong a re-evaluated democratic legacy of France, an
   identification with the Libyan people, and a debate on Responsibility to
   Protect and the rule of law in world politics, which have a broader
   relevance for French actorness abroad. The article applies the Essex
   School discourse theory and techniques from Interpretive Policy Analysis
   on executive speeches and parliamentary documents for structuring the
   debate and for estimating the strength of ideas in their interdiscursive
   configuration. An ideal-typical explanation of the legitimisation of
   intervention and of the choice of one policy over another is made. The
   article argues that going to war in Libya equated to a question of
   cultural appropriateness.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the problem of the present-day historical
   discourse in Poland by taking under scrutiny one specific event: the
   historical re-enactment of the ethnic cleansing of Polish villagers by
   the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, staged in a small town in southeastern
   Poland, Radymno, in the summer of 2013. It is based on research, carried
   out by the author and a group of students in Radymno and its
   surroundings in the period preceding and following the performance, as
   well as on content analysis of the press. The comparison of the top-down
   political and mass media discourse with local responses to the idea of
   re-enactment and, more broadly, local understandings of Polish-Ukrainian
   relations, reveal many contradictions. In attempting to understand them,
   the article discusses broader ramifications of the `democratization of
   history': the political contestation, class rhetoric and societal
   tensions that are tangled up in historical debates.},

Abstract = {Photo scandal of Edison Chen has been a hot issue not only in Hong Kong,
   but also in Mainland China and other countries because of the
   involvement of a number of celebrities. On public policy level, this
   raised questions and discussions about (1) the right to privacy, (2) the
   right to free speech, especially on the Internet, and (3) the ethical
   dilemma caused by the inevitable conflict between these two social
   values. On the other hand, the relevant discussions also reflect how
   sexual morality has a bearing on Internet policy and policy concerning
   privacy. In this chapter, the investigation would be conducted under the
   following topics: (1) Is there anything wrong with taking and keeping
   sexually explicit photographs of oneself and one's sexual partner when
   there is mutual consent? (2) Has Edison Chen done anything wrong? (3)
   What exactly are the issues involved in the case of photo scandal of
   Edison Chen? (4) Is there anything wrong in viewing and transmitting
   personal photographs that are illegitimately obtained? (5) Did the
   government and the court handle the case properly? Why?},

Abstract = {This article utilizes the elements of leadership, political performance
   and national interests to understand China's foreign policy decision
   making process. In contrast to a state-centred analysis, this article
   assumes that the supreme leadership's view of political performance is
   the most important factor when it comes to foreign policy decision
   making. It contends that so-called national interests are often
   manipulated to serve particular political agendas. Specifically, this
   article explores whether the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative or
   advancing China's interests in the South China Sea can be better
   utilized to improve Chinese President Xi Jinping's political
   performance. The comparison between the two issues incorporates the
   dimensions of feasibility, significance and morality. In the final
   analysis, this article finds that the OBOR is likely to be better
   utilized to enhance Xi's political performance, which yields some
   salient implications for future trends in China's foreign policy.},

Abstract = {Time series techniques see widespread use in political science. In De
   Boef and Keele (2008) we outlined a set of statistical methods for
   stationary data. Those methods have come to be widely used. Grant and
   Lebo (2015) contend that one of the methods we discussed, the error
   correction model, should generally not be used with political data. They
   argue that the error correction model leads to both interpretational and
   inferential mistakes by applied analysts. While we agree with their
   statements about equation balance, we show that the error correction
   model leads to the same inferences as the autoregressive distributed lag
   model when the data are stationary. We also demonstrate that careful use
   of an error correction model can help diagnose model misspecification
   when the equation is unbalanced. Such techniques are useful since
   pretesting for integration and fractional integration is often a highly
   uncertain process, which we demonstrate through a simulation exercise.
   We also highlight two related but often ignored complications in time
   series: low power and overfitting. We argue that the statistical tests
   used in time series analyses have little power to detect differences in
   many of the sample sizes typical in political science. Moreover, given
   small sample sizes, many analysts overfit their time series models. We
   argue that the results in the Grant and Lebo replications stem from
   inadequate sample sizes that make it difficult to conclusively use any
   time series model.{*}},

   that there are significant differences in their respective views on the
   transformation and the role that they can play in it, and hence the
   approaches to activism that they chose. Three case studies of mobilized
   publics - in the field of gender justice, socio-economic justice and
   transitional justice- are examined according to their different degrees
   of institutionalization, resources and strategies. The analysis shows
   how struggles for socio-economic justice and transitional justice have
   been marginalized and discredited as disruptive by a political elite
   that wagered on increasing polarization.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the confrontations and compromises for domination
   of the political arena and its rules that are going on in Tunisia since
   the 2011 revolution between the Islamists of Ennahda party and the
   networks of so-called secularists and old regime elites - in particular,
   Nidaa Tounes.On the contrary to accounts that claim that the taming of
   ideological conflicts between religious and secular parties has given
   birth to a new democratic society, I argue that the new Tunisian order
   is the result of a particular type of post-authoritarian political
   culture that I call bargained competition. It consists in Islamists and
   old regime elites bargaining on their mutual reintegration and their
   monopolization of the post-revolutionary political scene while fiercely
   competing over political resources through various (often informal)
   power-sharing arrangements.},

Abstract = {The paper explores Turkey-EU relations from a Bakhtinian perspective.
   Nykanen (2011), also using a Bakhtinian perspective, has argued that the
   EU's stance in the accession process, particularly that of Turkey, has
   been monologic, which stymies the process by not allowing Turkey to
   `answer back'. This paper argues, in contrast, that, albeit in the
   context of a lack of dialogue, Turkey has indeed attempted to answer
   back to the EU through informal means, using a form of discourse that
   resembles Bakhtin's concept of the carnivalesque, characterised by a
   reversal of roles and hierarchies, parodies, laughter and the grotesque,
   which challenges the status quo by creating a `world upside-down'. In
   recent Turkish discourse, then, particularly that of leading members of
   the governing AKP, the traditional hierarchy of the `superior' EU and
   the `inferior' candidate country is broken own and reversed.},

Abstract = {Since the beginning of the Northern Ireland conflict in the late 1960s,
   Irish nationalism has been identified as a prominent force in the
   political culture of the state. Recent studies have suggested, however,
   that the `Nationalist' population has become increasingly content within
   the new political framework created by the peace process and the
   aspiration for Irish unity diminished. In placing the Northern Ireland
   situation within the theoretical framework of nationalism, this paper
   will analyse how these changing priorities have been possible. Through
   an analysis of Irish language study in Northern Ireland's schools, the
   paper will examine how the political ideals espoused by the nationalist
   Sinn Fein Party reflected the priorities of the `nationalist community'.
   It will be contended that the relationship between the ideology and `the
   people' is much more complex than is often allowed for and that
   educational inequalities are a significant contributing factor to this.},

Abstract = {Circular migration (CM) is not a trendy concept in Southern Africa. This
   is in spite of over a century of circular labour migration to the South
   African mining and agricultural sectors strictly regulated by bilateral
   agreements. In the post-apartheid period, outsourcing of the core
   industrial sectors (mining) and liberalisation in agriculture and
   services have resulted in a structural shift in labour demand. Drawing
   on a range of ecumenical data (recent statistics releases, interviews,
   and empirical research), this paper examines existing policy and
   management contradictions in the facilitation of regional labour
   movement towards South Africa. The paper sets out on a critical
   examination of existing statistics before turning to a review of South
   African policy instruments showing the use of deportation and
   regularisation schemes as unofficial but de facto CM mechanisms. The
   paper then examines regulatory frameworks for skilled migration from the
   region showing the barriers to facilitated movement. It then closes on
   an analysis of the protracted deadlock at sub-regional level. The paper
   finds that CM is only beginning to be considered as a policy option by
   Southern African policy-makers as a labour instrument. The paper
   concludes that South African policy-makers have protected the vested
   interests of the mining sector and commercial agriculture about fifteen
   years into the post-apartheid period and have no yet fully embraced a
   regional approach to labour migration.},

Abstract = {In a theoretical analysis, we use a common agency model to show that
   lobbying by energy-intensive sectors covered under an emissions trading
   scheme (ETS) shifts the regulatory burden of an economy-wide emission
   constraint to sectors outside the ETS. The emission tax on the latter
   becomes inefficiently high such that lobbying does not only induce
   burden shifting but also efficiency losses. A complementary empirical
   analysis for a cross section of German firms under the EU emissions
   trading scheme supports our theoretical result on the role of lobbying
   on allowance allocation.},

Abstract = {The impact of popular mobilization and social movements against the
   advance of neoliberal policies has been well documented and theorized.
   Their concrete impact on the process of social policy reform in the
   post-neoliberal era is still under debate, however. This article
   theorizes about the conditions linking disparate new movements to each
   other and to old, class-based social movements in the defense of a
   concrete policy reform, Bolivia's non-contributory pension, the Renta
   Dignidad. Using a case study research design built on content analysis
   of newspaper coverage, we identify the necessary, though not sufficient,
   conditions facilitating alignment of interests and coordinated
   mobilization-a context of adversity (as confronting a highly mobilized
   opposition) and the universalistic characteristics of the policy. Under
   those conditions, social movements allied with Bolivia's governing
   Movement Towards Socialism (MAS) were critical in the passage of Renta
   Dignidad by counterbalancing the pressure from a highly mobilized
   opposition backed by strong economic elites.},

Abstract = {Critical engagement with the case of Chavismo in Venezuela can offer
   valuable insights for a fuller understanding of contemporary populism in
   Latin America. While for some scholars Chavez's populism has fostered
   popular empowerment, others dwell on the newly confirmed tensions
   between populism, liberal rights, and democratic proceduralism. This
   article embraces both positions but moves beyond their one-sidedness to
   cast Chavista populism as an inherently contradictory phenomenon that
   has constituted an ambivalent and transitory process in response to the
   gradual closure of liberal (post)democracy. Chavista caesaro-plebeian
   populism is construed as a site of tension and contention, which entails
   both promises and dangers for democracy. To make these points, the
   article draws on the discursive analysis of populism and on a new,
   productive shift in the study of populism in Venezuela, which pursues
   ethnographic field research on social movements instead of focusing
   exclusively on the figure of the leader.},

Abstract = {The recent shift from the Millennium Development Goals to the much
   broader Sustainable Development Goals has given further impetus to the
   debate on the nexus between the multiple sectors of policy-making that
   the Goals are to cover. The key message in this debate is that different
   domains-for instance, water, energy and food-are interconnected and can
   thus not be effectively resolved unless they are addressed as being
   fully interrelated and interdependent. Yet while this overall narrative
   is forcefully supported in the new UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
   Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals that are the main
   part of this agenda, many Goals still remain sectoral in their basic
   outlook. This now requires, we argue, a new focus in both policy and
   research on the nexus between different Sustainable Development Goals,
   especially with a view to reforms in the overall institutional setting
   that is required to sufficiently support such a nexus approach. This
   article thus examines the nexus approach in the context of the
   Sustainable Development Goals and identifies multiple avenues for its
   institutionalisation in global governance.},

Abstract = {Why do some countries redistribute more to poorer regions than others?
   This paper explores which factors explain variation in the degree of
   interregional redistribution among countries between 1983 and 2010. The
   main argument is that interregional redistribution increases with the
   need and capacity of strong presidents to build territorial coalitions
   with governors from poorer regions and, by implication, decreases with
   the ability of strong governors in rich districts to resist pressures to
   extract resources from their units. Using a multilevel structural
   equation model (the Generalized Linear Latent Multilevel Model, GLLAMM),
   the study analyzes these and competing claims on the determinants of
   interregional redistribution using original data from the subnational
   units of four types of cases, ranging from decentralized and federal to
   centralized, unitary countries. Empirical results indicate that the type
   of redistributive coalition between presidents and governors complement
   purely structural and institutional models to explain fiscal
   redistributive outcomes in the context of sharp regional inequality.},

Abstract = {Why did China and India, despite their similar natural factor endowments
   and growth trajectories, attract different types of FDI? This article
   shows that microlevel institutions in China and India, particularly a
   set of regulations governing labor and land markets, shape their
   domestic labor mobility and consequently affect their FDI patterns and
   development paths. China's high labor mobility motivates foreign firms
   to concentrate in labor-intensive manufacturing and exploit the benefits
   of scale economies. India's low labor mobility motivates foreign firms
   to move away from unskilled-labor-intensive manufacturing and invest in
   the modern service sector where the demand for skilled labor is
   relatively high.},

Abstract = {The existence of ``tipping points{''} in human-environmental systems at
   multiple scales-such as abrupt negative changes in coral reef
   ecosystems, ``runaway{''} climate change, and interacting nonlinear
   ``planetary boundaries{''}aEuro{''}is often viewed as a substantial
   challenge for governance due to their inherent uncertainty, potential
   for rapid and large system change, and possible cascading effects on
   human well-being. Despite an increased scholarly and policy interest in
   the dynamics of these perceived ``tipping points,{''} institutional and
   governance scholars have yet to make progress on how to analyze in which
   ways state and non-state actors attempt to anticipate, respond, and
   prevent the transgression of ``tipping points{''} at large scales. In
   this article, we use three cases of global network responses to what we
   denote as global change-induced ``tipping points{''}aEuro{''}ocean
   acidification, fisheries collapse, and infectious disease outbreaks.
   Based on the commonalities in several research streams, we develop four
   working propositions: information processing and early warning,
   multilevel and multinetwork responses, diversity in response capacity,
   and the balance between efficiency and legitimacy. We conclude by
   proposing a simple framework for the analysis of the interplay between
   perceived global change-induced ``tipping points,{''} global networks,
   and international institutions.},

Abstract = {One of the most robust findings on political institutions is that
   compulsory voting (CV) reduces the participation gap between poorer and
   wealthier voters. We present evidence that in Brazil, the largest
   country to use such a rule, CV increases inequality in turnout. We use
   individual-level data on 140 million Brazilian citizens and two
   age-based discontinuities to estimate the heterogeneous effects of CV by
   educational achievement, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status.
   Evidence from both thresholds shows that the causal effect of CV on
   turnout among the more educated is at least twice the size of the effect
   among those with less education. To explain this result, which is the
   opposite of what is predicted by the existing literature, we argue that
   nonmonetary penalties for abstention primarily affect middle-and
   upper-class voters and thus increase their turnout disproportionately.
   Survey evidence from a national sample provides evidence for the
   mechanism. Our results show that studies of CV should consider
   nonmonetary sanctions, as their effects can reverse standard
   predictions.},

Abstract = {Liberal democracy has been difficult to institute and sustain in
   developing countries. This has to do both with ideational factors-the
   absence of a liberal tradition prior to electoral mobilization-and
   structural conditions-the prevalence of mass mobilization along identity
   rather than class cleavages. This paper considers the conditions under
   which liberal democracy emerges and speculates about its future in
   developing countries.},

Abstract = {This chapter begins with the story of ``Bun Zai,{''} a quadriplegic
   person who openly demanded the legalization of euthanasia in Hong Kong
   in 2003, triggering off widespread media coverage and public attention.
   The controversy about the legalization stems from the conflict among the
   rival views on value of life, pain and sufferings, and the meaning of
   death. After a discussion of these views, the moral arguments for and
   against euthanasia are examined, which shows that the moral disagreement
   in regard to euthanasia arises from the set of conflicting values and
   moral considerations, including the intrinsic value of life, autonomy,
   wellbeing of the patient, and the social consequence of legalizing
   euthanasia. As this moral disagreement cannot be settled, the latter
   part of the chapter discusses public policy alternatives to the
   legalization of euthanasia based on a compromise among the conflicting
   values and moral considerations.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},

Volume = {25},

Pages = {181-196},
Abstract = {In early 2012, NATO's then-Secretary General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen,
   unveiled the Connected Forces Initiative (CFI), an effort designed to
   increase allied interoperability and readiness. Through three lines of
   effort - training and education, exercises, and better use of technology
   - the CFI is intended to help the alliance maintain the operational and
   tactical interoperability it developed in Afghanistan. At first glance,
   the CFI appears to represent an example of the claims of some
   neo-institutionalist scholars that there is a shift in the locus of
   governance from member states to NATO. However, this article takes a
   deeper look and concludes that in fact the locus of security governance
   is not shifting, at least not in this instance. Member states of the
   alliance retain several means of controlling and influencing NATO,
   thereby preventing it from developing a significant degree of autonomy,
   in contrast to the European Union or United Nations.},

   a changing global environment: a systematic analysis},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {281-303},
Abstract = {In June 2015 High Representative Mogherini presented her strategic
   assessment The European Union in a changing global environment as the
   express point of reference for the new EU Global Strategy. Grounded in
   the premise that this assessment is not simply a description of the
   state of the world but plays into the construction of social reality,
   this article sets out to understand the openings and closings of
   possibilities that it holds. My analysis generates a number of concrete
   insights, ranging from insights into the distinct nature of the
   challenges the EU is facing, to the discovery that there is no
   ``existential threat{''} and the importance of ``regions{''} as a
   guiding category. Grounded in an understanding of the world as being
   reflexive modern, I interpret these findings as displaying an intriguing
   and paradoxical interpretive disposition. On the one side, there is a
   notable opening towards unconventional conceptions of the world; on the
   other side, there is a symbolic conservation of existing EU institutions
   and programmes and a reproduction of modern premises. I argue that it is
   the first aspect that makes the document significant: Mogherini's
   strategic assessment opens an important discursive space to think
   (European) security anew.},

Title = {Unpacking Brazil's Leadership in the Global Biofuels Arena: Brazilian
   Ethanol Diplomacy in Africa},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {127-150},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Biofuels represent an opportunity for Brazil to exert global leadership
   by substantially scaling up the production, consumption, and
   international trade of bioethanol. Africa represents an ideal venue in
   which to do this, given its suitable agro-climatic conditions and
   extensive land area. Brazil has consequently sought to establish
   bilateral partnerships with African countries, as well as
   North-South-South trilateral partnerships involving the EU and US.
   However, empirically grounded assessments of how Brazil's leadership
   aspirations have unfolded in practice through these partnerships are
   limited. In this article, we examine Brazil's potential to exert global
   political leadership, by analyzing its policy-based, structural, and
   instrumental qualities in making bilateral and trilateral inroads
   regarding bioethanol production in Africa. Interviews in Brazil, Africa,
   and Europe suggest that both the bilateral and trilateral avenues have
   produced meager results. Lack of domestic strategy and vision, economic
   recession, and a fragmented alliance network have reduced Brazil's
   capacity to achieve its ethanol diplomacy objectives.},

Abstract = {Existing approaches to measuring political disagreement from text data
   perform poorly except when applied to narrowly selected texts discussing
   the same issues and written in the same style. We demonstrate the first
   viable approach for estimating legislator-specific scores from the
   entire speech corpus of a legislature, while also producing extensive
   information about the evolution of speech polarization and politically
   loaded language. In the Irish Dail, we show that the dominant dimension
   of speech variation is government-opposition, with ministers more
   extreme on this dimension than backbenchers, and a second dimension
   distinguishing between the establishment and anti-establishment
   opposition parties. In the U.S. Senate, we estimate a dimension that has
   moderate within-party correlations with scales based on roll-call votes
   and campaign donation patterns; however, we observe greater overlap
   across parties in speech positions than roll-call positions and partisan
   polarization in speeches varies more clearly in response to major
   political events.},

Abstract = {How should we understand current debates in development studies? More
   specifically, how should we understand the way in which these debates
   have been seen through the eyes of scholars from a range of disciplines
   who have been associated with Studies in Comparative International
   Development (SCID)? Building on an analysis of the distribution of
   topics, disciplines, and regions covered by articles in SCID over the
   past 50 years, this essay coveys a vision of development studies as seen
   through the lens of SCID. The four articles that follow this one help us
   interrogate a series of substantive issues central to development
   studies and their interrelationships - democracy, inequality, and the
   effects of the international context. We also explore two topics not
   covered in the articles - the role of the state in the economy and
   broader aspects of the international context. We conclude by speculating
   on how these arenas of development studies might evolve in the future.},

Abstract = {What is the relationship between party polarization, media
   fragmentation, and partisan-ideological sorting? The growth and
   availability of partisan media-afforded through the expansion of cable,
   satellite, and Internet penetration-is often linked to the consistency
   and extremity of individuals' political attitudes and partisan
   identities. At the same time, the literature on mass audiences and media
   choice suggests that the effects of choice and partisan media should be
   differential according to levels of political interest. This debate has
   yet to fully articulate a role for elite party polarization, which has
   been identified as a primary cue to facilitate mass partisanship and
   sorting. Synthesizing these bodies of scholarship, we utilize a variety
   of data to assess the influence of elite polarization, media
   fragmentation, and political interest on partisan-ideological sorting.
   We find that sorting is consistently connected to perceptions of
   polarization and qualified evidence that media fragmentation is related
   to partisan-ideological sorting. The expansion of cable and satellite
   programming is positively related to sorting, but this effect is
   isolated to individuals highly interested in news and politics.},

   Rights Regime},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},

Abstract = {Minority regulation in the EU has come under attack as ineffective and
   problematic. With the rise of nationalism, racism and xenophobia in
   Europe and the challenged role of Europeanization, minority/majority
   relations in the EU may become increasingly problematic. This article
   argues an inherent incompatibility between what is held as a European
   standard of minority rights and the dynamics of integration. On the
   basis of a historical and discursive analysis of the EU minority regime
   and its normative relationship to integration this article demonstrates
   how a reifying, state-centric, security-bound conceptualization of
   national minorities deeply influenced by the theory and practice of
   nationalism reinforces the logic of nationalism from within the European
   project. It suggests that a lack of imagination in the study and
   practice of national minority regulation has prevented the conception of
   minority policies compatible with the unique normative context of
   integration as supranational governance and a shared community. Instead
   of attempting to reproduce the best practices of minority protection
   invented within the logic of nationalism, Europeanization should
   categorically move away from them. This would enable it to re-affirm
   itself as a project of post-national belonging that acknowledges and
   accommodates the complex dynamics of identity maintenance of
   post-modernity.},

Title = {Still focused on the Atlantic: accounting for the limited
   Europeanization of Portuguese security policy},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {134-158},
Abstract = {This article examines the limited Europeanization of contemporary
   Portuguese security policy and highlights how the persistence of North
   Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the emergence of the Lusophone
   world have shaped Portuguese participation in the European Union's
   (EU's) Common Foreign and Security Policy in recent years, particularly
   in Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions in Africa and in
   the European Defence Agency's co-operation activities. Europeanization's
   conceptual weaknesses, combined with the mutually reinforcing nature of
   transatlantic, EU and Lusophone security co-operation, have reinforced
   the ambiguous nature of what a ``Europeanized{''} vision for European
   security might look like, especially given long-standing loyalties to
   NATO. This affords states considerable margin for manoeuvrability in
   defining their security priorities, so long as they are seen as being
   broadly consistent. This article reassesses the appropriateness of the
   Europeanization concept and shows how Portugal has approached this
   strategic balancing act, supporting the development of the EU's CSDP
   whilst remaining loyal to NATO and seeking to develop security relations
   in the Lusophone world, achieving legitimacy by stressing
   complementarity and multilateralization in security co-operation.},

Abstract = {What is the role of the government in the provision of healthcare
   services to its people? Should the government shoulder a lion's share in
   the funding of healthcare services or should it be left to individuals'
   responsibility? What are the arguments in favor of a largely publicly
   funded and public provision of healthcare services? Perhaps these issues
   can never be settled in the abstract and can only be evaluated in the
   contexts of specific social, economic, and political conditions. This
   paper addresses these issues through a critical discussion of the
   Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme recently put forward by the Hong Kong
   Special Administrative Region government. It analyzes the government's
   arguments for the need of reform as well as the rationale for this
   Scheme and further argues that the major shortcoming of Hong Kong's
   healthcare policy-and indeed most of Hong Kong's social policies both
   before and after 1997-is a characteristic lack of moral vision. Its
   apparent unwillingness if not inability to articulate a set of moral
   objectives and principles upon which a particular piece of social policy
   is or could be founded lies at the heart of the government's
   difficulties in mustering social support in its policy initiatives.},

Abstract = {The present research investigates how definitions of national in-group
   boundaries predict inter-group attitudes in Turkey. In Study 1, we
   explore definitions of Turkish in-group boundaries as well as
   perceptions of the Turkish in-group's relations with other groups among
   64 university students. In Study 2, conducted among 324 university
   students, exploratory factor analyses reveal two dimensions of Turkish
   in-group boundaries: national participation (a more civic definition)
   and national essentialism (a more ethnic definition). They also reveal
   four dimensions of the relations with others. Regression analyses show
   that national participation predicts more negative inter-group
   attitudes. However, national essentialism is not found to predict the
   inter-group attitudes. These results are compared with those of previous
   studies, mostly conducted in Western countries. The comparison suggests
   that conclusions about the positive role of Civic and the negative role
   of Ethnic/Cultural definitions in intergroup relations may be less
   general than is previously thought.},

Abstract = {In December 2010, the 16th Conference of Parties (COP) of the United
   Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ended with adopting
   Cancun Agreements as official decisions under the UN process. The
   international community determined the meeting a success. This was a
   substantial change compared to the previous year's Copenhagen climate
   conference, which failed to reach consensus at the official level and
   thus having come under severe criticism as ``diplomatic failure.{''}
   This article aims to explain the stark contrast between the two
   consecutive COP meetings and argues that the leadership style of the
   president of the conference is one important factor propelling
   negotiations forward. While the current literature scarcely addresses
   the role of the president, this article explores multiple variables that
   condition the president's effectiveness in moving negotiations forward.
   This article concludes that the Mexican government successfully chaired
   the negotiations with excellent agenda management and process management
   capability, which the Danish government lacked. In particular, its
   transparent and embracing manner in handling subgroup meetings and the
   production of a single negotiation text facilitated trust among
   negotiators, which in turn made the parties tend to cooperate better.
   More importantly, the case study reveals that the Mexican government had
   a significant influence on given conditions of the negotiation process,
   such as the international environment surrounding the negotiation and
   the decision-making rules.},

Abstract = {The right-wing drift in Israeli public opinion that brought Benjamin
   Netanyahu to power for the fourth time has deepened the existing
   political stalemate, sharpened internal Palestinian discontent with the
   Palestinian Authority (PA), and further undermined its legitimacy. After
   nearly a quarter of a century of negotiations, since the Madrid
   conference in late 1991, the PA appears to have reached the end of the
   line. Its attempt to internationalize the conflict by seeking
   recognition as a state by the UN Security Council and the General
   Assembly is meant in part to gain time and fill the political gap.
   Palestinian civil society groups perceive Boycott, Divestment, and
   Sanctions (BDS) as an alternative strategy to the failed negotiated
   process to end occupation even if it is a long term effort. A stable and
   just peace does not appear possible in the near future, and in the long
   run the nature of the solution need not be the one deemed at present as
   the only possible one.},

Title = {Global carbon pricing and the ``Common But Differentiated

Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes whether using carbon pricing as the major mitigation
   policy instrument is compatible with the implementation of the ``common
   but differentiated responsibility{''} principle in a global climate
   agreement. We focus more specifically on China, a key player in climate
   negotiations. This is done by adopting the Imaclim-R model to assess the
   economic effect of carbon pricing on the Chinese economy in different
   climate architectures which, despite aiming at the same stabilization
   target, differ in terms of the temporal profile of emission reductions
   and the regional distribution of efforts (different quota allocation
   schemes). Model outcomes prove that neither temporal nor regional
   flexibilities provides a satisfactory answer since the Chinese economy
   remains significantly hurt at certain time periods. This suggests the
   recourse to complementary measures to carbon pricing in order to help
   smoothing the necessary shift toward a low-carbon society. This means in
   particular that, to build a climate policy architecture that could be
   compatible with the ``common but differentiated responsibility{''}
   principle, climate negotiations must go beyond global top-down systems
   relying on cap-and-trade to include bottom-up measures likely to
   complement the carbon price and make carbon mitigation acceptable in
   countries like China.},

Abstract = {How do elections affect citizens? This paper shows that elections can
   have an impact in an area where researchers least expect it: an
   individual's religious life. It does so by drawing on psychologists'
   theory of compensatory control and testing whether individuals' reported
   religious behaviors and beliefs fluctuate with their chosen political
   party's fortunes. Both an originally collected panel data set and
   over-time cross-sectional data reveal that Democrats (Republicans) are
   more likely to report attending religious services and praying when
   Republicans (Democrats) control the White House. Rates of reported
   religious behaviors then decline when a copartisan is president. The
   results demonstrate political identities' strength and ability to
   influence nonpolitical behaviors, even those thought to be stable and
   impervious to politics.},

Abstract = {Academic research on contemporary Dutch nationalism has mainly focused
   on its overt, xenophobic and chauvinist manifestations, which have
   become normalised since the early 2000s. As a result, less radical, more
   nuanced versions of Dutch nationalism have been overlooked. This article
   attempts to fill this gap by drawing attention to a peculiar self-image
   among Dutch progressive intellectuals we call anti-nationalist
   nationalism. Whereas this self-image has had a long history as banal
   nationalism, it has come to be employed more explicitly for political
   positioning in an intensified nationalist climate. By dissecting it into
   its three constitutive dimensions constructivism, lightness and
   essentialism - we show how this image of Dutchness is evoked precisely
   through the simultaneous rejection of `bad' and enactment of `good'
   nationalism. More generally, this article provides a nuanced
   understanding of contemporary Dutch nationalism. It also challenges
   prevalent assumptions in nationalism studies by showing that post-modern
   anti-nationalism does not exclude but rather constitutes essentialist
   nationalism.},

   people define themselves. Changing one's nationality thus is a salient
   event/social process in today's society; therefore, people's nationality
   conversion deserves more academic attention. Treating the convert as a
   social type and regarding people's self-reports (or converts' accounts)
   as topics for analysis, this article examines the Taiwan case to
   illuminate how people tell their stories of converting nationality.
   `Converts' usually employed an awakening narrative to leave their former
   national-identity behind: For example, the `awakening' plot is readily
   apparent, a huge contrast between a previous `wrong' self and a current
   `correct' self is mentioned, and the `awakening' is delineated as an
   achievement. The symbolic awakening is harnessed as a strategic tool to
   create discontinuity autobiographically, to justify one's major change,
   to ensure that one's cognitive security remains intact, and to call for
   more awakenings. This article further notes that, since narrative itself
   is a practice, people always have `a self in the making' which
   determines (and is determined by) how people (re)tell their life
   stories. Moreover, in Taiwan's case, we see that `awakeners' usually
   admired early awakeners but blamed late awakeners (which constitutes an
   interesting triadic group relationship); people may also describe their
   experience of having multiple awakenings before the `grand' awakening
   ('Awakening').},

Abstract = {Democratic responsiveness concerns the degree to which government
   policies match public preferences. Responsiveness studies typically use
   national surveys to characterize public opinion, but whether poll
   questions overlap with the policy agenda is unknown. The first of two
   empirical analyses presented here, with hundreds of issues on the
   national agenda in the United States from 1947 to 2000, reveals that
   public opinion is mostly unrelated to policy outcomes. The picture
   appears to be even more ominous-that is, opinion and policy are
   negatively related-on highly salient issues that attract media
   attention. A second study revisiting published work confirms that
   responsiveness patterns look different depending upon whether studies of
   opinion-policy connections (a) begin with survey data and then examine
   policy developments, or (b) begin with national legislative agenda
   issues and then examine survey data. Thus, conclusions about democratic
   responsiveness depend upon the issues that are examined, and often
   opinion surveys do not include questions about tangible public policy
   options. In that sense, future changes in democratic responsiveness
   might go undetected because scholars often lack data on what goes into
   the denominator of democracy.},

Abstract = {To what extent can crowdsourcing help members of civil society overcome
   the democratic deficit in global environmental governance? In this
   paper, I evaluate the utility of crowdsourcing as a tool for
   participatory agenda-setting in the realm of post-2015 sustainable
   development policy. In particular, I analyze the descriptive
   representativeness (e.g., the degree to which participation mirrors the
   demographic attributes of non-state actors comprising global civil
   society) of participants in two United Nations orchestrated
   crowdsourcing processes-the MY World survey and e-discussions regarding
   environmental sustainability. I find that there exists a perceptible
   demographic imbalance among contributors to the MY World survey and
   considerable dissonance between the characteristics of participants in
   the e-discussions and those whose voices were included in the resulting
   summary report. The results suggest that although crowdsourcing may
   present an attractive technological approach to expand participation in
   global governance, ultimately the representativeness of that
   participation and the legitimacy of policy outputs depend on the manner
   in which contributions are solicited and filtered by international
   institutions.},

Abstract = {Real-time response (RTR) measurement is an important technique for
   analyzing human processing of electronic media stimuli. Although it has
   been demonstrated that RTR data are reliable and internally valid, some
   argue that they lack external validity/The reason for this is that RTR
   measurement is restricted to a laboratory environment due to its
   technical requirements/This paper introduces a smartphone app that 1)
   captures real-time responses using the dial technique and 2) provides a
   solution for one of the most important problems in RTR measurement, the
   (automatic) synchronization of RTR data/In addition, it explores the
   reliability and validity of mobile RTR measurement by comparing the
   real-time reactions of two samples of young and well-educated voters to
   the 2013 German televised debate/Whereas the first sample participated
   in a classical laboratory study, the second sample was equipped with our
   mobile RTR system and watched the debate at home/Results indicate that
   the mobile RTR system yields similar results to the lab-based RTR
   measurement, providing evidence that laboratory studies using RTR are
   externally valid/In particular, the argument that the artificial
   reception situation creates artificial results has to be questioned. In
   addition, we conclude that RTR measurement outside the lab is possible.
   Hence, mobile RTR opens the door for large-scale studies to better
   understand the processing and impact of electronic media content.},

   Evidence from Latin America},

Pages = {74-99},

Abstract = {Do conditional cash transfer programs reduce voters' incentives to hold
   their government accountable for its performance? Studies show that
   these programs generate considerable electoral returns for the
   governments responsible for them. One important and unexplored question
   is whether these popular programs have also changed the landscape of
   accountability in Latin America. Survey data from 16 Latin American
   countries that have adopted CCT programs do not offer support for the
   claim that such programs have a detrimental effect on electoral
   accountability for corruption and for the economy. Only in countries
   where CCT programs do not follow strict rules do beneficiaries attribute
   relatively less weight to the government's economic performance, but
   this effect is marginal. These findings fill an important gap in the
   literature and offer reassuring evidence that cash transfers can
   alleviate poverty while preserving voters' incentives to exercise
   electoral accountability in crucial areas of government performance.},

Abstract = {Global environmental governance (GEG) is characterized by fragmentation,
   duplication, dispersed authority, and weak regulations. The gap between
   the need for action and existing responses has led to demands for
   accountability. This has created a paradox: accountability mechanisms to
   improve GEG have proliferated while the environment deteriorates. We
   offer a two-tier explanation for this paradox. First, actors
   establishing GEG are not held to account for the design of their
   environmental interventions. Biases in public, private, voluntary, and
   hybrid institutions, which shape goals and determine what to account for
   and to whom, remain unexamined. Second, efforts to establish
   accountability focus on functional requirements like monitoring and
   compliance, leading accountability to be viewed as an end in itself.
   Thus, complying with accountability may not mitigate negative
   environmental impacts. The utility of accountability hinges on improving
   governance at both tiers. Turning the accountability lens to the goals
   of those designing environmental institutions can overcome the focus of
   justifying institutions over environmental problems.},

Abstract = {The Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) has the capacity
   to incentivize the international transfer of environmentally sound
   technologies. Given that both countries are expected to have similar
   incentives when managing the distribution of technology transfer within
   the country, why do sub-national patterns in the allocation of projects
   with technology transfer differ? Using comparable political-economic
   data compiled for China and India, we offer an explanation for these
   differences. In China, where the government regards the CDM as a tool
   for achieving sustainable development, technology transfer is
   concentrated in provinces that need it the most and that are most
   conducive to receiving transfers (i.e., economically less developed, yet
   heavily industrialized provinces). In India, where the government takes
   on a ``laissez-faire{''} approach to the CDM, neither level of economic
   development nor that of industrialization affects clean technology
   transfer. In this regard, although the incentives are similar, the
   capacity to pursue them is not comparable. We test these hypotheses
   using data on CDM technology transfer across Chinese provinces and
   Indian states during the 6-year period from 2004 to 2010.},

Abstract = {International rivers create complex relationships between their riparian
   states, which can contribute to economic, political, and social losses.
   Treaties provide a means for states to coordinate their actions in
   managing international river disputes to minimize these losses. However,
   there is little knowledge about treaty content and the factors
   influencing treaty design. We test whether a relationship exists between
   the challenges of negotiating, complying, and distributing the gains in
   bilateral, multilateral, and basin-wide negotiation contexts and the
   depth of cooperation along with the degree of institutionalization.
   While the great challenges confronting multilateral or basin-wide
   negotiations can produce treaties that focus on joint gains and shallow
   cooperation to secure the signature of riparians, we find that they can
   also provide opportunities for deeper, more behavior-altering,
   cooperation. To manage the difficulties of maintaining multilateral
   cooperation, we find a higher degree of institutionalization. We also
   find that bilateral negotiations provide states with opportunities for
   deeper cooperation, but a lower degree of institutionalization.},

Abstract = {Existing methods for estimating ideal points of legislators that are
   comparable across time and chambers make restrictive assumptions
   regarding how legislators' ideal points can move over time, either by
   fixing some legislators' ideal points or by constraining their movement
   over time. These assumptions are clearly contradictory to some theories
   of congressional responsiveness to election dynamics and changes in
   constituency. Instead of using legislators as anchors, our approach
   relies on matching roll calls in one chamber and session with roll calls
   or cosponsorship decisions on identical bills introduced in a different
   chamber or session. By using these ``bridge decisions{''} to achieve
   comparability, we can remove any assumptions about the movement of
   legislators' ideal points. We produce these estimates for both chambers
   from the 102nd (1991-92) to 111th (2009-11) Congresses, and we show that
   our estimates provide interesting insights into the nature of
   legislative behavior change.},

Abstract = {Desirable responses to global environmental challenges are increasingly
   being characterized as requiring transformational social change. Keeping
   pace with this growing imperative, discourses of resilience are shifting
   away from an emphasis on durability toward more progressive themes.
   After briefly revisiting the interdisciplinary origin of
   social-ecological resilience, some lingering concerns about its
   theoretical underpinnings and practical implications are raised. With
   the theme of transformational change in mind, two sets of questions are
   posed-aiming to stimulate discussion of resilience as a boundary object,
   and resilience in practice. The first set of questions is intended to
   draw attention to differences between analysis and normativity in
   resilience discourses, as well as to how this plays out across different
   scales. The latter questions problematize the predominance of localism
   in resilience discourses and seek to advance the critique of its
   inherent neoliberalism.},

Abstract = {This article aims to explain why market-based climate policies (carbon
   levies and emissions trading) have had limited success at the national
   level in ``liberal-market economies{''} like Australia, Canada, and the
   United States. This situation is paradoxical to the extent that market
   environmentalism is often thought to be a concept tailored to the
   political traditions and policy paradigms in these states. I argue this
   occurs because precisely in such economies, workers have been the least
   protected from the market and the effects of globalization, leading to a
   squeeze on incomes and public services, and providing fertile ground for
   a virulently antitax politics. When coupled with the disproportionately
   carbon-intensive lifestyles in these states and the strength of fossil
   fuel interests, it becomes extremely easy and effective for opponents of
   climate policy to frame carbon prices as an onerous tax on workers and
   families. The article explores how this strategy has functioned at a
   discursive level and considers what this situation implies for climate
   policy advocates in carbon-intensive, neoliberal polities.},

   tradition which Australian soldiers of World War II should uphold. There

Abstract = {Since the goods-and-services tax (GST) is a consumption tax, those with
   the same level of consumption will need to pay the same amount of GST,
   regardless how rich they are. To tax people according to their levels of
   consumption is to treat unequals (rich and poor with the same level of
   consumption) equally, thus unjust according to Aristotelian conception
   of justice. The GST reform intended primarily to broaden the tax base,
   yet to the detriment of tax justice, involving great administrative cost
   and discouraging consumption generally should not be an early step to
   take. Other more just and viable alternatives to GST should more
   justifiably be implemented before any discussion of the introduction of
   GST should be seriously considered. The issue of tax justice cannot be
   assessed by merely considering one specific tax, but must be evaluated
   in the context of other taxes in the tax system. From a broader
   perspective, justice in a tax system should not be isolated from how the
   tax revenue is to be used by the government. Justice, as a social value
   in public policy, is an indispensible consideration in the design of any
   tax system. Yet, it is far from the only one. In fact, there may be
   trade-offs among justice and other important considerations in tax
   design which leads to tax policy dilemmas. A delicate balance should be
   maintained among various conflicting considerations as a way out of such
   dilemmas.},

Abstract = {Many scholars argue that democratization is conducive to the development
   of social welfare policies and that democracy brings about
   redistributive reform due to demands from the newly enfranchised poor.
   In reality, however, democratization does not necessarily bring about
   comprehensive social welfare reform. If not democratization, what
   explains social welfare expansion in developing countries? This article
   examines Indonesia, which began the process of democratization in 1998
   following the fall of President Soeharto, and which has since become a
   stable democracy with a consistently growing economy. More than a decade
   after Soeharto's resignation, Indonesia started to implement a
   comprehensive healthcare policy. What explains the gap between the
   enactment and the implementation of this social policy reform? In
   answering this question, I argue that electoral competition alone does
   not shape social policy reform. Instead, social reform has institutional
   prerequisites, such as the broad based organization of its advocates. A
   broad-based organization goes beyond its narrow interests, builds
   cross-class alliance and pressures the government. Without this
   prerequisite, democratization does not necessarily result in
   comprehensive social reforms.},

Abstract = {Until recently there has been relatively little attention paid to the
   question of how the relationship between the state, its citizens and the
   nation is articulated in constitutional texts. This paper seeks to
   address this gap through an examination of how the rules of belonging to
   the nation are discussed by the political elite and how these
   discussions find their final formulation in the constitutional texts.
   The analysis focuses on the Turkish case at two constitution-writing
   moments (1924 and 1961). While such moments have conventionally been
   assumed to be revolutionary', the data on Turkey highlights continuities
   rather than radical changes over time. More particularly, it underscores
   the resilience and salience of the principle of nationalism over time.},

Abstract = {What is driving Russian climate policy? This article focuses on the veto
   player approach developed by George Tsebelis and its applicability for
   examining the power relations in climate change policy-making in Russia.
   It makes two original contributions: veto players analysis on Russian
   climate policy and proposals how to adjust to theory to be applied to
   non-democracies for comparison with democracies. After identifying the
   veto players and their preferences, and determining their equivalence in
   the decision-making process, two case studies are examined: the
   ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and the establishment of one of the
   Kyoto flexible mechanisms, Joint Implementation, in Russia. Regarding
   the power play between actors, the latter emerges as far more accessible
   than the former, where scholars can generally observe only the domestic
   debate-which, due to the absorption of democratic decision-making
   institutions by the president, is detached from the actual
   decision-making process. Three proposals are made for adjusting the veto
   players approach to facilitate qualitative analysis of Russian
   decision-making: (1) select cases which involve also lower-level actors
   in charge of policy implementation; (2) due to implementation problems,
   changes in the status quo must be sought deeper than in statute-level
   changes; and (3) note that motivations of actors beyond the actual
   policy substance can facilitate explanations of puzzling outcomes in the
   process .},

Abstract = {Institutions that have been set up by riparian states to internationally
   govern shared water resources-international River Basin Organizations
   (RBOs)-play a key role in river basin governance. Despite an increased
   attention paid to RBOs in international relations and water scholarship,
   there has been little focus on defining and conceptualizing RBOs and,
   subsequently, on comprehensively identifying the RBOs that exist around
   the world. This has challenged research around RBOs in both
   methodological and theoretical ways. This paper aims to meet this
   challenge by offering a theoretically grounded definition of an
   international RBO and crafting a comprehensive list of international
   RBOs. We do so deductively, building from the larger
   neo-institutionalist research and international water resources
   governance literature. Our definition identifies three broad categories
   of constitutive elements: internationalization, institutionalization and
   governance. We apply this definition to potential cases to better
   identify the extent of RBOs around the world today and outline which
   cases qualify as RBOs and which cases fail to meet our constitutive
   criteria. This allows us to compile a comprehensive list of all existing
   international RBOs, including the identification of RBOs with specific
   characteristics. The article concludes by crafting an agenda for future
   research around RBOs that builds on this more complete understanding of
   RBOs.},

Abstract = {This paper evaluates the influence of online news consumption on
   attitudes toward the European Union in a context of protracted economic
   crisis. Using data from the 2011 Irish National Election Study, we
   combine location-specific information on broadband availability with
   respondent geo-location data, which facilitates causal inference about
   the effects of online news consumption via instrumental variable models.
   Results show that Irish citizens who source political information online
   are more prone to blame the EU for the poor state of the economy than
   those who do not. There is evidence of preference reinforcement among
   those with negative predispositions toward the EU, but not among pro-EU
   citizens. We complement this analysis with a study of voting behavior in
   the European Fiscal Compact Referendum, employing a similar
   methodological approach. The results from this second survey confirm the
   anti-EU influence of online news consumption among Irish citizens,
   although evidence suggests a pro-EU effect among voters who browsed the
   website of the politically neutral Irish Referendum Commission. Our
   paper contributes to the literature on public opinion, the EU, and
   political attitudes in times of crisis.},

Abstract = {Participants in the Open Working Group (OWG) on Sustainable Development
   Goals (SDGs) were reminded time and again that there is no model for the
   process to develop the SDGs. They resolved to not repeat the closed
   process used to develop the Millennium Development Goals, but the OWG
   began work when failures to reach consensus and fatigue with
   multilateral environmental negotiations dominated delegates' minds,
   rather than examples of successfully negotiated outcomes. The OWG
   Co-Chairs were faced with the daunting task of guiding delegates'
   efforts to develop a proposed set of crisp SDGs and targets that all
   could agree to, and thus, had to accomplish the following goals: (1)
   reduce delegation rigidity, both of individual Member States and within
   coalitions; (2) maximize the sense of participation, transparency, and
   ownership to get the most buy-in at the end; and (3) develop a sense of
   trust that would change the relationship between Member States. To do
   this, the OWG Co-Chairs broke the mold of UN multilateral negotiations
   that Member States and observers had become familiar with and created a
   different approach. This article examines how the OWG accomplished these
   goals and overcame the shortcomings of other multilateral negotiating
   processes on sustainable development to produce a widely supported
   consensus outcome at a time when governments have struggled to achieve
   agreement in many multilateral negotiation tracks.},

Abstract = {Who supports secession in a multiethnic country? What factors lead to
   secessionist or separatist attitudes? Despite the substantial interest
   in secessionist movements, the micro-level factors and dynamics behind
   mass support for secession have been understudied. Using original and
   comprehensive data derived from two public opinion surveys, conducted in
   2011 and 2013 with nationwide, representative samples, this study
   investigates the determinants of separatist attitudes among Turkey's
   Kurds. The empirical results show that perceptions of discrimination,
   ideological factors (i.e. a left-right division and partisanship),
   region and religious sect do affect support for secession. Our findings
   provide strong support for the grievance theory and, further, show that
   ideology is an important factor. However, the results call into question
   arguments drawing attention to the role of modernisation (i.e.
   socio-economic status) and of religiosity. The study also discusses some
   practical implications of the empirical findings.},

Abstract = {Models of ideal point estimation usually build on the assumption of
   spatial preferences. This ignores legislators' non-policy incentives and
   is thus likely to produce implausible results for many legislatures. We
   study this problem in parliamentary systems and develop a model of roll
   call voting that considers both the policy and the non-policy, tactical
   incentives of legislators. We go on to show how the relative weight of
   these policy and tactical incentives is influenced by the identity of
   the mover and characteristics of the motion. Analyses of two data sets
   of 2174 roll call votes in German state legislatures and 3295 roll call
   votes in the British House of Commons result in three main findings.
   First, we show that tactical incentives may be more important than
   policy incentives, and second, that the importance of tactical
   incentives varies with the importance of motions. Third, there are
   interesting twists: backbench private members' bills may reverse
   tactical incentives whereas proposals from anti-system parties are
   virtually always rejected by moderate parties, rendering these votes
   uninformative. Our findings have implications for ideal point estimation
   in parliamentary systems, as well as for research on separation of power
   systems.},

Abstract = {Since 2002, government nationalizations and contractual breaches in
   general around the world have surged. South America has witnessed a wave
   of nationalizations of private enterprises, mostly foreign. Some
   analysts contend that this trend is shaped by the left-wing ideological
   orientation of the governments, whereas others argue that a more robust
   explanation is the combination of economic pressure and constraint
   factors. This article contributes to the debate by using a nuanced
   institutional analytical framework based on the concept of company
   versus government opportunism, applied to the recent nationalization of
   previously privatized companies. It examines Argentina, a country that
   in the last two decades has seen radical policy reversals, from sweeping
   privatization of state-owned enterprises in the 1990s to a
   renationalization effort with some of the same companies in the early
   2000s.},

Abstract = {In this study, we seek to explain a growing divergence between the US
   and EU regulatory policies over nanotechnology environmental, health,
   and safety risks. Faced with significant scientific and regulatory
   uncertainties, incremental approaches have been taken in both regulatory
   systems, but substantial differences are evident in terms of both policy
   processes and stringency. While the EU exhibits a regulatory integration
   process with stringent adjustments of existing legislative frameworks,
   the US is far less engaged in regulatory adaptations. We have carried
   out a comparative analysis of the EU and US regulatory policies. We
   suggest that literature perspectives that focus on differing public
   attitudes, economic interests, and advocacy pressure groups do not
   suffice to explain the regulatory policy divergence. We argue that a
   combined effect of domestic politics and policy styles provides the most
   powerful explanation of why the US and EU currently differ with respect
   to their regulatory responses to nanotechnology risks and uncertainties.},

Abstract = {In post-revolutionary Libya, the collapse of central authority and the
   fragmentation of territorial control have produced a fundamental change
   in the political elite. Local elites emerged as the leading actors and
   held the key to whether central authority would be re-established. These
   local elites faced strategic choices in building alliances among
   themselves: they could seek to enter and back the central government;
   build an anti-government coalition to exert veto power; or focus on
   consolidating control over their local turf. What determines local elite
   strategies? This article charts the rise of local elites in Libya and
   examines their attempts at alliance building until autumn 2014. Based on
   five weeks of field research conducted in 2014, the article analyses
   elite strategies in three Libyan cities: Misrata, Bani Walid and Tobruk.},

Abstract = {This study uncovers strong evidence that polarization has developed in
   presidential candidate trait evaluations. Unlike for ideology or policy
   preferences, the distribution of trait evaluations has become
   increasingly bimodal and clustered toward the poles. This change stems
   in part from a more polarized choice set, but perceptions of candidate
   extremeness are asymmetric, with partisans perceiving the other party's
   candidate, but not their own, as extreme. In addition, the increased
   salience of racial and moral issues helps explain trait polarization.
   Racial attitudes among Republicans have become both more conservative
   over time and more potent in explaining trait evaluations; among
   Democrats, racial attitudes have neither changed over time nor become
   more potent. Moral values among Democrats have grown more liberal over
   time and more potent in explaining trait evaluations. Among Republicans,
   however, moral values have not become more conservative, but have become
   a more potent predictor of trait evaluations. We discuss the
   implications of the emergence of trait polarization for understanding
   problematic features of contemporary American politics.},

Title = {Polarization without radicalization: political radicalism in Albania in
   a comparative perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},

Pages = {280-299},
Abstract = {Since the collapse of communism, political radicalism has been an
   important part of the political scene in Europe. The 2008 financial
   crisis furthered this trend, giving rise to new waves of radicalization.
   Albania appears to be a curious exception to this trend. Unlike most
   other countries in Eastern Europe, there have been no successful radical
   parties in Albania since the collapse of communism in 1991. In the same
   fashion, social protests in Albania in recent years have been fleeting
   and far less radical than other protest movements in other countries in
   the region (Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey). This article argues that the
   relative lack of political radicalization in Albania is due to its
   traumatic communist past combined with a high level of bipolarization.
   The bitter experience with national-communism reduced the attractiveness
   of both far right and far left discourses in Albania. The high levels of
   political bipolarization, on the other hand, divided the Albanian
   political sphere into two antagonistic camps. Such a deep division
   subsumed other possible cleavages.},

Abstract = {This chapter focuses on the substantive representation provided by U.S.
   presidents. As the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)
   movement has gained traction in the United States, it has called on
   presidents to advocate for the protections necessary for LGBT people to
   become fully incorporated into society. Yet multiple and layered
   tensions within the LGBT community have complicated this policy making.
   Presidents have, moreover, encountered a strong conservative backlash to
   LGBT rights since 1977. In response to these cross-cutting pressures,
   Democrats have largely embraced a civil rights/equality frame, while
   Republicans have either embraced or mediated a morality frame. The
   result has been wide swings in presidential responsiveness to the LGBT
   community, arguably undermining the well-being of LGBT people throughout
   the United States.},

Title = {This radicalisation which is not one: contentious politics against the
   backdrop of the Greek crisis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Pages = {223-239},
Abstract = {Since the eruption of the Greek economic crisis in 2010 and the
   introduction of austerity policies, Greece's public space has become a
   theatre of intense political conflict in the form of social unrest, mass
   mobilisations, symbolic and physical clashes and political instability.
   This paper suggests that these developments can be understood in a
   productive way by drawing on a psychoanalytic understanding of loss and
   trauma. This framework can help us understand the transformation of a
   popular subject previously loyal to the political establishment into a
   disenchanted one, and also address the question of emotional intensities
   at play in this detachment. But in addition, psychoanalysis highlights
   the possibility of different responses to loss and the different ethical
   implications that these can have, which stands in contrast to accounts
   that see radicalisation as inherently dangerous. Far-right and left-wing
   responses are examined and characterised through this lens. The paper
   concludes that there are nuances in the left-wing responses that can
   meet the ethical criteria set by a psychoanalytic understanding of loss.},

Abstract = {Given the high costs of collecting survey data, adding supplemental
   questions to large, ongoing survey data collection efforts potentially
   offers a cost-effective way to collect additional information customized
   to the specific needs of users of a general survey. The Medicare
   Advantage Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (MA
   CAHPS) Surveys use mail with telephone follow-up to survey Medicare
   beneficiaries about their experiences with health plans. These surveys
   are administered by trained survey vendors, who were allowed to add any
   number of supplementary survey items to the core survey in 2012, as long
   as the items met content requirements. Vendors and health plans create
   these supplemental items for internal quality improvement efforts.
   Because the results of the core items from the surveys are publicly
   reported and used to calculate Medicare Quality Bonus Payments to health
   plans under the Affordable Care Act, concern arose that an excessive
   number of supplementary items might adversely affect response rates and
   the reliability of plan-level estimates. To estimate the effect of
   supplemental items on response rates, we used logistic regression,
   controlling for survey vendor and characteristics of beneficiaries and
   plans. Response rates were lower in both telephone and mail modes with
   more supplemental items (p < 0.001). The use of 12 supplemental items
   was associated with response rates 2.5 percentage points lower, compared
   with surveys with no supplemental items. These results were used to
   develop new guidelines suggesting that supplemental items be limited to
   a maximum of 12.},

Abstract = {Achieving sustainable development has been hampered by trade-offs in
   favour of economic growth over social well-being and ecological
   viability, which may also affect the sustainable development goals
   (SDGs) adopted by the member states of the United Nations. In contrast,
   the concept of inclusive development emphasizes the social, ecological
   and political dimensions of development. In this context, this paper
   addresses the question: What does inclusive development mean and to what
   extent is it taken into account in the framing of the SDGs? It presents
   inclusive development as having three key dimensions (social,
   ecological, and relational inclusiveness) with five principles each.
   This is applied to the 17 SDGs and their targets. The paper concludes
   that while the text on the SDGs fares quite well on social
   inclusiveness, it fares less well in respect to ecological and
   relational inclusiveness. This implies that there is a risk that
   implementation processes also focus more on social inclusiveness rather
   than on ecological and relational inclusiveness. Moreover, in order to
   de facto achieve social inclusiveness in the Anthropocene, it is
   critical that the latter two are given equal weight in the actual
   implementation process.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates how the discursive battle for the Flemish nation
   is waged in the Flemish mass media by politicians of the Flemish
   nationalist party, the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA). I focus on the `new
   nationalism' that N-VA politicians advocate as a means to `banalise' a
   hot Flemish nationalism. I establish that N-VA spokespeople and
   especially their chairman Bart De Wever invoke discursive alliances with
   established scholars such as Anderson, Hroch, Calhoun and Billig. On the
   one hand, these alliances are used to sell their nationalism as a
   non-ideological or non-discursive project. On the other hand, the
   analyses of these intellectuals are used as manuals to `banalise' a hot
   nationalism. The concept of `scientific' nationalism refers to the
   entextualisation of scientific discourses in order to legitimate and
   banalise the nationalist project of the party as `in line with science'.},

Abstract = {Measures of diversity and disparity within a population are used for
   investigating a range of developmental outcomes, but often by employing
   ``off-the-shelf{''} indicators that may not be theoretically appropriate
   for the hypotheses under investigation. In this article, we proposed a
   general class of social distance measures that both enables us to see
   the conceptual relationship between different existing measures of
   heterogeneity more clearly and is sufficiently flexible to allow for the
   development of tailored hypothesis-specific measures. We show how a
   range of existing aggregate measures of diversity and disparity fit
   within the general class and demonstrate illustratively how the measure
   can be used to develop more precise hypothesis-specific measures.},

Abstract = {Egypt's military has been the real winner of the country's political
   transformation. It was not only successful in preserving the overall
   power structure, which was challenged by young revolutionaries and
   Islamist opposition between 2011 and 2013. It also expanded its power
   within the political relevant elite. The article argues that the gradual
   approach chosen by the Generals in managing change as well as their
   ability to maintain a cohesive corporate structure and act therefore as
   a strong institutional player explain this outcome. However the
   military's dominance will hinder socio-economic progress and makes the
   political order unsustainable over the long run.},

Title = {Making sense of the EU's response to the Arab uprisings: foreign policy
   practice at times of crisis},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {423-441},
Abstract = {The Arab uprisings of 2011 put into question previously held
   understandings about the stability of authoritarian regimes in North
   Africa as well as the European Union's (EU's) relations with countries
   in its southern neighbourhood. Despite early calls on behalf of the EU
   to change its policies, the Union's responses in the early stages seemed
   mostly characterised by continuity. This article claims that certain
   dispositions and background knowledge developed over several decades
   vis-a-vis EU's Mediterranean policies served as a baseline from which EU
   officials and diplomats acted. Drawing on insights from practice
   approaches, the article argues that the practical understandings on what
   the EU can (and cannot) do vis-a-vis partner countries in North Africa
   create a kind of power politics of practical dispositions. The article
   focuses on the European Neighbourhood Policy - the EU's flagship
   initiative - and builds on a unique set of data that combine policy
   documents and interviews with about 30 EU officials and national
   diplomats from before and after the Arab uprisings. In this way, it
   illustrates how practice relates to change in that even though the EU's
   responses drew on an established repertoire of practice, enacting it in
   a new context opened up new possibilities for action.},

Abstract = {The building of Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link (XRL),
   which will link Hong Kong and the Mainland, has stirred a huge
   controversy. In this chapter, we will consider the arguments for the
   building of it, such as whether it is cost-effective and in accord with
   public interest. The in-depth analysis of these terms will expose the
   inadequacies of these concepts and highlights the importance of social
   justice as policy justification. On the other hand, moral arguments
   against the building of it will also be evaluated. For example, whether
   it is procedurally and substantively just or unjust to build XRL will be
   discussed. The role of government in a just society is also the focus of
   this chapter. Nozick and Rawls' views will be discussed and applied to
   the understanding of the building of XRL. Through illumination of the
   role of government and important concepts such as justice, readers can
   determine whether the building of XRL fulfills the requirement of social
   justice. This discussion may act as stimulus for reflection concerning
   the rights and duties of citizenship.},

Abstract = {Self-rated health (SRH)-for example, ``in general would you say your
   health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?{''} -is the most
   widely used measure of health across a range of survey research studies.
   This paper synthesizes extant research and provides a framework for
   future research on the measurement of health using SRH, focusing on four
   interrelated topics: the factors that influence respondents' health
   ratings, the survey measurement features of SRH, how SRH answers are
   analyzed, and the stated purpose of SRH as a proxy for more objective
   health or as a perception of health.
   Extant research on the health, psychological, and social factors
   influencing respondents' SRH answers is reviewed, as is research
   concerned with the survey measurement features of SRH that influence how
   respondents rate their health. The synthesis proposes a framework for
   future research that focuses on further explicating the factors that
   underlie respondents' SRH answers and improving features of SRH
   measurement and analysis in ways that are consistent with the various
   goals of the researchers who both collect and analyze the data.},

Abstract = {Conventional emphasis on basin-wide water management has often resulted
   in the formation of transboundary water law on the basin or near basin
   scale. In Central Asia, however, the Syr Darya Basin possesses an
   abundance of tributary-level cooperative agreements that guide and
   codify water sharing and management on the sub-basin scale. To
   understand the volume and nature of this cooperation, this paper
   compiled and analyzed a set of agreements that apply to small
   transboundary tributaries (STTs) in the Syr Darya Basin. The paper
   assembled the largest collection of STT water agreements-123 in
   total-and classified such documents according to a range of criteria
   including: purpose and objectives, water management issues, and
   operational mechanisms. Results of this work highlight a rise in
   sub-basin-scale cooperation in the first decade of the twenty-first
   century, a time when large-scale cooperation appeared tenuous; a
   practical orientation to transboundary water management at a small
   scale; and an abundance of treaties of short time duration. These
   findings present options related to scale, time duration and focus of
   transboundary water law that can help inform future treaty development.},

Title = {Imagining the borderlands: managing (to prolong) conflict in Tibet},

Abstract = {The current phase of political conflict in Tibet began with
   pro-independence protests in the late 1980s and saw a significant surge
   of unrest in 2008. But that unrest was not continuous and for much of
   the last 25years was at a low level of intensity. Yet the Chinese
   authorities have categorised the situation in Tibet as a life-and-death
   struggle' against pro-independence forces throughout this period. This
   paper notes earlier debates in Chinese history about political
   strategies for managing borderland peoples, including late imperial era
   attempts by Chinese officials to forcibly change Tibetan culture that
   provoked rather than assuaged conflict. It suggests that this happened
   again in the 1990s when a group of Chinese officials proposed policies
   that sought directly to change core cultural practices among Tibetans.
   These policies of selective cultural intervention, unprecedented in the
   post-Mao era in Tibet, fuelled long-term resentment, leading to the
   violence and unrest of 2008. The paper argues that these policies were
   inseparable from the institutional interests of the agency within the
   Chinese Communist Party, the United Front, which had promoted them, to
   the extent that its status and influence within the state bureaucracy
   depended on it preventing them from being challenged or reversed. It
   made cultural intervention in Tibet seem normative to the Chinese policy
   elite by invoking three interlocked imaginings about ways of managing
   borderland peoples - the perception of perpetual war, Han expertise at
   borderland management, and latent threat within borderland cultures.
   That these have led to the prolonging of conflict in Tibet for over a
   quarter-century is a reminder of the importance of considering
   institutional dynamics in the analysis of ethnic conflict.},

Abstract = {This paper is a preliminary comparative analysis of three polity-seeking
   nationalisms that emerged in the contiguous peripheral areas - the
   overlapping spheres of influence' of three contending imperial centres:
   Taiwan, Okinawa and Hong Kong. Specifically, it examines and compares
   the pattern of nation-formation and the form, ideology and politics of
   nationalism in each case, and in doing so it tries to suggest a possible
   explanatory framework for the rise of these nationalisms. Its tentative
   conclusion is that the rise of nationalism in Taiwan, Okinawa and Hong
   Kong should be understood as a macro-historical sociological phenomenon
   caused by both the short-term penetration from centralizing colonial and
   geopolitical centre(s) that triggered nationalist mobilization in the
   periphery and the long-term process of peripheral nation-formation that
   created the social basis for mobilization. The three cases also
   demonstrate some other traits of anti-centre peripheral nationalism:
   they all adopted a similar ideological strategy of indigeneity, and all
   developed a differentiation between radical and pragmatic lines
   characteristic of minority or peripheral nationalisms. A final
   observation is that while the geopolitics of states in the region is
   powerfully shaping the development of the three nationalisms,
   interactions on the societal level may over time create a counterforce

Abstract = {Violence in Rakhine State of Myanmar in 2012 and 2013 caused up to 1,000
   deaths and forced the long-term displacement of entire communities.
   Using evidence from interviews, media coverage and secondary literature,
   this article explores recent events and considers contextual factors
   behind the unrest. The conflict is a symptom of long-term historical
   tensions between Rakhine Buddhists and Muslims, and contemporary
   political changes that reinvigorated anti-Muslim sentiment across
   Myanmar. Rigid ethnic classifications that are enshrined in Myanmar's
   laws and political system have encouraged territorial attitudes and
   furthered discrimination against Muslims and others perceived as
   migrants. This environment generates incentives for local politicians to
   strengthen group identity and present themselves as the guardians of
   their electorate. Raised tensions and a background of violence made it
   easier for Rakhine politicians to promote identity based voting and to
   ensure that most Muslim voters in Rakhine State were disenfranchised,
   paving the way for some local success in the national elections of
   November 2015. Following the elections, flung San Suu Kyi's new
   government indicated that past policies would continue, disappointing
   those hoping for rapid change and demonstrating the entrenched nature of
   Rakhine State's problems.},

Abstract = {The nature of religious change and the future of religion have been
   central questions of social science since its inception. But empirical
   research on this question has been quite American-centric, encouraged by
   the conventional wisdom that the United States is an outlier of
   religiosity in the developed world, and, more pragmatically, by the
   availability of survey data. The dramatic growth in the number and reach
   of cross-national surveys over the past two decades has offered a
   corrective. These data have allowed research on religious trends in the
   United States, Canada, and Europe, putting American trends into
   comparative relief. This research synthesis reviews the past quarter
   century of cross-national comparative survey research on religious
   behavior, focusing on religious service attendance as a commonly
   measured behavior that is arguably more equivalent across societies and
   cultures than other measures of religiosity. The lack of evidence for
   religious revival is highlighted, noting instead declining rates of
   attendance in the United States and Canada, and either declining rates
   or low ``bottomed-out{''} stability in Western Europe, most of Eastern
   Europe, and Australia and New Zealand. Finally, countries in Latin
   America, Africa, and Asia are discussed to the extent that research
   allows, before a call for future research-in these places in
   particular-is made in order to correct for the Western and Christian
   focus of much of the research on cross-national religious trends.},

Title = {Women and Development, Not Gender and Politics: Explaining ASEAN's
   Failure to Engage with the Women, Peace and Security Agenda},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SOUTHEAST ASIA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {While questions have been asked about whether ASEAN could, or even
   should, adopt the United Nation's Women Peace and Security (WPS) agenda,
   this article is the first to ask why it has not done so already. ASEAN's
   strong engagement with gender issues beyond the WPS agenda, together
   with the pressing need to address conflict and security concerns within
   Southeast Asia, make this an absence that requires an explanation. I
   argue that the usual explanatory framework deployed to account for ASEAN
   ``not doing{''} - something the weaknesses caused by consensus,
   unanimity and the ``ASEAN Way{''} - do not explain the absence of the
   WPS agenda; ASEAN's engagement with gender is too advanced for the ``it
   does not want to{''} explanation to hold. Instead, I locate the failure
   to engage with the WPS agenda in a particular elite understanding of
   women as both non-political and vehicles for the realization of economic
   and social well-being. This elite mindset, which both differs from that
   found within the ASEAN institutions dedicated to gender issues and which
   serves as the key driver of ASEAN's institutional design, has retarded
   engagement with WPS because it stands at odds with the active political
   agency of women that WPS promotes. Revealing this reason for ASEAN's
   failure to institutionalize WPS provides a way to consider the future of
   this important set of norms. I argue that efforts to mainstream WPS must
   take account of this ingrained framing of women as apolitical if they
   are to be successful.},

Abstract = {In post-violence Kyrgyzstan, a small group of civic-minded nationalists
   are fighting to tame extremist voices by formulating their own
   reconciliation policies. These moderates have adopted several
   strategies, including persuasion and bargaining with nationalistic
   elites. This process is not without its limitations. Important issues,
   such as forging a civic identity for the majority ethnic group, remain
   unaddressed. Still, moderates' policy achievements and concrete actions
   are likely to continue to undercut nationalist rhetoric. The case of
   Kyrgyzstan offers one possible alternative to the Soviet paradigm of
   framing nationhood alongside citizenship.},

Abstract = {The accumulated research on youth movements in general, and on Egyptian
   ones in particular, analyses the characteristics of the youths who
   triggered the Arab Spring as well as the particular forms of activism
   and structures they adopted. Academic work focused on youth activism in
   Egypt, however, thus far lacks research on how the youth movements
   modified their strategies according to the political context and the
   repercussions this had on the transformation process. Hence, through the
   analysis of the strategies pursued by four youth movements during the
   course of the Egyptian transformation, this article will show that on
   one hand, the choice of a certain strategy could be successful in one
   political context but could fail to yield influence in another. On the
   other hand, it will show that the choice of a certain strategy can
   enable the movements to induce political change in the short term, but
   it can be liable to become ineffective in the longer term and vice
   versa.},

Pages = {40-64},
Abstract = {During World War I, sport became integral to not just military life, but
   to the marking of Anzac Day. On the day, the Anzacs would have a
   memorial service in the morning and celebrate the testing of their
   manhood in the afternoon by playing sport. This sporting tradition
   continued in the interwar years, but was considerably curtailed when
   half of the Australian States banned sport on Anzac Day because the day
   began to increasingly be seen as a `sacred day' that was incompatible
   with the playing of sport. Despite the ban on Anzac Day sport, the
   language that had linked Anzac to sport persisted during the interwar
   years and the notion that the Anzacs were `soldier sportsmen' grew more
   common when they were described on Anzac Day.},

   Border Area. Data on the last 9 years of circularity through the US
   Mexico Border is presented in several tables and graphs. As section is
   also included on Central American Immigration and US politics of
   Immigration. This last part ends with a discussion on the

Abstract = {Many modern European nations can trace their heritage back to one of the
   large multinational empires that once encompassed much of the European
   landscape, and nationalising elites often refer back to their place in
   these empires for the materials upon which their nation was purportedly
   built. In this article we examine some Belarusian nationalising elites
   and their references to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in order to
   demonstrate a recent trend in East European small-state national
   identity construction, which we refer to as `small state imperialism.'
   Small state imperialism exhibits realist characteristics and paints the
   small nation's place in empires of the past as privileged and
   aggressive, and in this way deviates from the oppressed but morally
   superior image one typically expects of a small nation. This
   interpretation is not limited to Belarus; in a number of East European
   states a similar imperialist turn has taken root in nationalist
   discourses.},

Title = {Mediating the German Ideology: Ordoliberal Framing in European Press
   Coverage of the Eurozone Crisis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {414-430},
Abstract = {The German Government has played a leading role in the Eurozone crisis
   management, largely characterised by a commitment to fiscal austerity
   and supply-side structural reforms. The legitimation of these measures
   in the European policy arenas as well as in the public domain has partly
   rested on an ordoliberal economic policy framing, which has presented
   the Eurozone crisis as one of public indebtedness and loss of
   competitiveness. To study the public legitimation of the crisis
   management, we analyse the press coverage of the crisis in 8 Eurozone
   member states, with a total of 7986 newspaper articles included in the
   sample. Focusing on `problem definitions' and `treatment
   recommendations' as two key elements of issue framing, we find that an
   ordoliberal framing of the crisis prevails in all the studied countries,
   while a competing Keynesian policy frame is mostly undermined.
   Significant variation between the countries emerges, however, on the
   question of EU federalisation and on the framing of the sovereign
   bailout loans. We discuss the implications of these findings for the
   success of the German Government to maintain the austerity orthodoxy
   across the Eurozone and crowd out economic policy alternatives.},

Abstract = {While traditionally considered for non-stationary and cointegrated data,
   DeBoef and Keele suggest applying a General Error Correction Model
   (GECM) to stationary data with or without cointegration. The GECM has
   since become extremely popular in political science but practitioners
   have confused essential points. For one, the model is treated as
   perfectly flexible when, in fact, the opposite is true. Time series of
   various orders of integration-stationary, non-stationary, explosive,
   near-and fractionally integrated-should not be analyzed together but
   researchers consistently make this mistake. That is, without equation
   balance the model is misspecified and hypothesis tests and
   long-run-multipliers are unreliable. Another problem is that the error
   correction term's sampling distribution moves dramatically depending
   upon the order of integration, sample size, number of covariates, and
   the boundedness of Y-t. This means that practitioners are likely to
   overstate evidence of error correction, especially when using a
   traditional t-test. We evaluate common GECM practices with six types of
   data, 746 simulations, and five paper replications.},

Abstract = {Guatemala has one of the highest levels of killings of women and
   impunity for violence against women in the world. Despite laws created
   to protect women, Guatemala, like other countries, generally fails at
   implementation. This article examines justice system obstacles in
   contemporary Guatemala to processing cases of feminicidekillings of
   women because they are women in a context of impunitycomparing two
   recent feminicide cases. It argues that the sociopolitical context in
   Guatemala, including structural violence, widespread poverty,
   inequality, corruption, and normalization of gender violence against
   women, generates penalties, or legal tolls, that are imposed on victims'
   families and contribute to impunity through undermining victims'
   attempts to navigate the justice system. The analysis focuses on the
   tolls of fear and time: the need to overcome fear of retaliation and the
   extraordinary time and effort it takes to do so in a corrupt and broken
   system.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {International investment agreements (IIAs) give conflicts between mining
   companies and communities a transnational dimension, allowing investors
   to sue a state before an IIA tribunal. While investor-state disputes
   related to extractive industries arise from a wide range of state
   actions, an important subset are triggered by domestic conflicts between
   anti-mining groups and foreign companies. How does arbitration affect
   anti-mining movements? I argue that IIAs limit the government's
   responsiveness to domestic pressure, reducing the ability of domestic
   nonstate actors to influence policies governing the extractive industry.
   However, it cannot be assumed that states would support these groups
   even without investor pressure; IIAs only have this effect when
   anti-mining groups are able to change the state's preference toward the
   investment.},

Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},

Number = {4},
Pages = {457-477},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Many political processes consist of a series of theoretically meaningful
   transitions across discrete phases that occur through time. Yet
   political scientists are often theoretically interested in studying not
   just individual transitions between phases, but also the duration that
   subjects spend within phases, as well as the effect of covariates on
   subjects' trajectories through the process's multiple phases. We
   introduce the multistate survival model to political scientists, which
   is capable of modeling precisely this type of situation. The model is
   appealing because of its ability to accommodate multiple forms of causal
   complexity that unfold over time. In particular, we highlight three
   attractive features of multistate models: transition-specific baseline
   hazards, transition-specific covariate effects, and the ability to
   estimate transition probabilities. We provide two applications to
   illustrate these features.},

Abstract = {Cities are increasingly seen as essential components of the global
   response to climate change: setting targets, taking action, and
   rendering themselves accountable to global audiences for their efforts.
   Why cities are making themselves globally accountable in the absence of
   compulsion or obligation, and what it means for cities to operate
   simultaneously as global and locally accountable actors, constitute
   important puzzles for scholars of global climate politics. In this
   article I set out the basic parameters of this phenomenon, and offer a
   conceptual framework with which to parse the politics of accountability
   in networked urban climate governance. I apply this framework to
   identify three distinct forms of accountability present in the C40
   Cities Climate Leadership Group: an external politics of recognition; a
   network politics of ordering, and; an internal politics of translation.
   The article explores each for their distinct political processes,
   orientation, and power dynamics, and offers some propositions with
   respect to how they interact, and what it means both locally and
   globally when cities make themselves globally accountable.},

Abstract = {Abortion presents a moral dilemma from the perspectives of both Western
   and Confucian traditions. This chapter will examine how the law of Hong
   Kong compromises the conflicting rights and values involved in abortion.
   In Hong Kong, although abortion is legally permissible under certain
   conditions, abortion on demand is outlawed. We argue that, in order to
   justify this legal restriction, the law has to consider the fetus as a
   potential person, who has a right to life, which is close to, but not up
   to, that of a full-blown person. However, such restriction is
   incongruent with Confucian ethics, which emphasizes the harmony of the
   family and the community. At least, Confucian ethics would allow
   abortion based on social or economic reasons.},

Title = {War Games redux? Cyberthreats, US-Russian strategic stability,
   and new challenges for nuclear security and arms control},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {163-180},
Abstract = {Some 30 years since the release of the Hollywood blockbuster War Games,
   the possibility that hackers might break into nuclear command and
   control facilities, compromise early warning or firing systems, or even
   cause the launch of a nuclear weapon has become disturbingly real. While
   this challenge will impact all nuclear-armed states, it appears
   particularly acute for the USA and Russia given their large, diverse,
   and highly alerted nuclear forces. The fact that east-west relations
   have deteriorated to a nadir perhaps not seen since the 1980s, strategic
   instability has increased - particularly in the wake of the Ukraine and
   now Syria crises - and that the nuclear arms reductions agenda appears
   to have reached a standstill makes this challenge particularly pressing.
   In this discouraging milieu, new cyberthreats are both exacerbating the
   already strained US-Russia strategic balance particularly the perceived
   safety and security of nuclear forces and at the same time creating new
   vulnerabilities and problems that might be exploited by a third party.
   Taken together, these dynamics add another major complication for
   current arms control agreements and possible future nuclear cuts, and
   also seem likely to increase the possibility of accidents,
   miscalculation, and potential unauthorised nuclear use, especially given
   the large number of nuclear weapons that remain on ``hair-trigger{''}
   alert.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the migration of young, highly qualified Spaniards
   in the context of the current financial crisis. Various data sources are
   taken into account to show that the UK is currently the main destination
   country for young Spanish migrants. Drawing on qualitative interview
   data, the paper discusses the two main themes occurring in Spanish
   participants' narratives: a belief in progress and meritocratic ideals
   as well as a strong sense of political anger. Participants' belief in
   progress, the paper argues, constitutes an `attitudinal capital' that
   originates in the economic bonanza preceding the crisis. At the same
   time, the participants' interviews contain traces of political protest
   discourses that stem from Spanish pressure groups and alternative media
   who are critical of the current conservative government. The paper
   concludes by pointing out that while for the time being migration
   trajectories of young Spaniards in the UK seem to be rather positive and
   characterised by the acquisition of human capital, their sense of
   political anger could potentially become problematic if the upward
   social mobility they aspire to remains inaccessible.},

Abstract = {In this comparative analysis, the impact of women presidents is shown to
   facilitate the representation of women by contributing to women's
   increased political participation. While Latin America continues to
   exhibit significant gender inequality in citizens' political
   participation, women were elected president eight times between 1999 and
   2015 throughout the continent: twice in Chile, Brazil, and Argentina;
   and once in Costa Rica and Panama. Extant research predicts that the
   representation provided by women leaders will lead to increased
   political activity by women in the society. Using public-opinion data
   for seventeen countries, gathered from 2004 to 2012, analysis reveals
   that presidentas do augment three measures of women's political
   participation: vote intention, rates of campaigning, and attendance at
   local meetings. Furthermore, evidence is provided that presidentas
   challenge conventional notions of the appropriateness of political
   activity for women.},

   GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE},
Series = {United Nations University Series on Regionalism},

Abstract = {This chapter argues that circular migration may contribute to
   transformation in areas that have so far been rarely touched upon in the
   debate. Besides the transfer of financial remittances and professional
   skills, political and (un) democratic attitudes and practices may also
   be diffused through temporary or circular migration. Based on a survey
   among 1000 Philippine return migrants from six destinations and
   qualitative research, this chapter shows that at an individual level,
   the migration experience may have a positive or negative influence on
   the democratic attitudes of migrants. This effect might be enforced
   through circular migration, because it provides the migrant with a
   regular ``reality check{''} in comparing home and destination country.
   The findings are discussed with reference to a clearly democratic
   country (Japan), a clearly authoritarian state (Saudi Arabia) and the
   ``special case{''} of Hong Kong. For policy makers, the case studies
   allow to draw a conclusion that opens up new vistas: If circular
   migrants should contribute to the development in their home countries,
   it is of utmost importance to provide them with opportunities for
   organizing and political participation while being abroad.},

Pages = {375-396},
Abstract = {The dispute for regional influence between Russia and the European Union
   has resulted in dramatic events in Ukraine. Less visibly, a similar
   situation has developed in the southern Moldovan autonomous region of
   Gagauzia. In the context of Moldova's signing of an EU Association
   Agreement in June 2014, calls were made to take up arms and erect
   barricades. Independence was to be proclaimed one day after - and
   because of - that signing. This was avoided, but the crisis is far from
   coming to an end. Using the concept of failed frozen conflict, this
   article argues that tensions mainly are due to local leaders trying to
   take advantage of the new international situation in order to promote
   their own group and private interests. This endangers seriously the
   stability and security of both Gagauzia and the Republic of Moldova.},

Abstract = {By adopting a neorealist approach to alliance formation this paper
   examines the trilateral partnership of Israel, Cyprus and Greece. It
   argues that since its inception in 2011 it has developed into a
   (comfortable') quasi-alliance - a less formal and more flexible form of
   alliance than the traditional ones - driven by profit and threat-related
   individual and collective motivations. The primary motivations behind
   the formation of the quasi-alliance have been the common perceptions of
   Turkey as a security threat and energy-related interests. Moreover, it
   is suggested that the comfortable' and quasi nature of the alliance
   could allow the three states to manoeuvre politically so as not to
   exclude future and parallel relations with Turkey. This means that the
   transformation of the quasi-alliance into a more formal alliance is a
   rather unlikely scenario and that it could fade out should
   TurkishIsraeli relations improve.},

Abstract = {In 2015, Chile fundamentally reformed the electoral system it had used
   since 1989. The old system was characterized by high levels of
   malapportionment, or differences across districts in the ratios of
   voters to representatives. In the first elections after
   redemocratization, malapportionment favored the ideological right, but
   elections since 2000 have yielded no evidence that malapportionment
   produced ideological bias. The new, postreform electoral system reduces
   malapportionment in the lower chamber, although it remains pronounced in
   both chambers. Nevertheless, analysis of results from previous
   elections, coupled with information about the new districts, suggests
   that, consistent with recent experience, malapportionment will not
   produce ideological bias in elections to either chamber.},

Abstract = {Surveys conducted in new democracies generally demonstrate
   supermajoritarian support for democracy as a system of government. This
   consistent finding has led many to argue that standard questions
   overstate actual support for liberal democratic institutions and should
   be abandoned. However, such contentions have not been subject to
   systematic analysis, leaving it unclear whether ``democracy{''}
   questions provide useful information for researchers. This study tests
   three main arguments advanced against standard questions using data from
   original survey experiments implemented in Honduras and from LAPOP
   surveys conducted in nineteen Latin American countries. The analysis
   demonstrates that support for democracy is overstated, and that the
   prime factor accounting for artificially high support is that
   respondents tend to focus on regimes in the abstract rather than in
   practice. In contrast, differential understandings of what
   ``democracy{''} means and social desirability pressures are less likely
   to explain exaggerated support. Although the abstraction problem leads
   to substantively large and statistically significant aggregate-level
   biases with important implications for studies of mass attitudes and
   regime outcomes, broad conclusions from multivariate analyses predicting
   democratic support at the individual level remain largely unaffected,
   suggesting that the standard items remain useful to researchers.},

   international transactions with genetic resources can be achieved and
   how Norway contributes to their realization. Regarding the first
   question, progress on the ground has been slow, but important principles
   have been agreed within the convention on biological diversity (CBD) and
   its Nagoya Protocol (NP). Although domestic legislation is adopted, key
   user countries remain reluctant. They argue that the ABS regime needs to
   be supplemented with sector approaches within forums such as the Food
   and Agriculture Organization. In principle, this may sound logical, but
   sector approaches may risk undermining the ABS regime of the CBD/NP. The
   principle of access is more user-oriented and benefit sharing is weaker
   in the relevant FAO negotiations. Against this background, the future
   practical significance of the ABS regime remains uncertain. Norway has
   played an important leadership role in ABS within the CBD/NP framework.
   This stems in part from `fortunate circumstances', as Norway has
   relatively few stakes in this issue area, but also includes strong
   normative elements: Norway's inclination to support weaker part, the
   South. The Norwegian position has also been solidified by good
   coordination and strong institutional capacity among the actors
   involved. However, there are indications of a growing split in the
   Norwegian position along sector lines. We do not yet have sufficient
   empirical evidence that this is the case-but if it is, achieving an
   effective ABS regime may be even more difficult.},

Abstract = {Guessing on closed-ended knowledge items is common. Under likely-to-hold
   assumptions, in the presence of guessing, the most common estimator of
   learning, difference between pre- and postprocess scores, is negatively
   biased. To account for guessing-related error, we develop a latent class
   model of how people respond to knowledge questions and identify the
   model with the mild assumption that people do not lose knowledge over
   short periods of time. A Monte Carlo simulation over a broad range of
   informative processes and knowledge items shows that the simple
   difference score is negatively biased and the method we develop here is
   unbiased. To demonstrate its use, we apply our model to data from
   Deliberative Polls. We find that estimates of learning, once adjusted
   for guessing, are about 13\% higher. Adjusting for guessing also
   eliminates the gender gap in learning, and halves the pre-deliberation
   gender gap on political knowledge.},

Abstract = {Illegal immigration is a contentious issue on the American policy
   agenda. To understand the sources of public attitudes toward
   immigration, social scientists have focused attention on political
   factors such as party identification; they have also drawn on theories
   of intergroup contact to argue that contact with immigrants shapes
   immigration attitudes. Absent direct measures, contextual measures such
   as respondents' ethnic milieu or proximity to salient geographic
   features (such as borders) have been used as proxies of contact. Such a
   research strategy still leaves the question unanswered - is it contact
   or context that really matters? Further, which context, and for whom?
   This article evaluates the effects of party identification, personal
   contact with undocumented immigrants, and contextual measures (county
   Hispanic population and proximity to the US-Mexico border) on American
   attitudes toward illegal immigration. It finds that contextual factors
   moderate the effects of political party identification on attitudes
   toward illegal immigration; personal contact has no effect. These
   findings challenge the assumption that contextual measures act as
   proxies for interpersonal contact.},

Abstract = {Why have some Mexican states proceeded faster than others in the
   revolutionary transformation of overhauling criminal procedure?
   Contributing an original index of criminal procedure reform across
   Mexico's 32 states from 2002 to 2011 and building on existing research
   on policy diffusion, this article seeks to answer this question. It
   finds that the 2008 constitutional reform at the federal level exerts a
   strong positive effect (federal mandate); being situated in a
   neighborhood of states that have reformed has a counterintuitive
   negative effect (spatial proximity); and having a governor from the same
   party as governors of other states that have reformed has a positive
   influence (network affinity). These findings yield a better
   understanding of the vertical, cross-level and horizontal, cross-unit
   diffusion of reform, with implications for understanding how to overcome
   challenges to criminal justice reform in Mexico, Latin America, and
   elsewhere.},

Abstract = {There is strong evidence linking skin complexion to negative stereotypes
   and adverse real-world outcomes. We extend these findings to political
   ad campaigns, in which skin complexion can be easily manipulated in ways
   that are difficult to detect. Devising a method to measure how dark a
   candidate appears in an image, this paper examines how complexion varied
   with ad content during the 2008 presidential election campaign (study
   1). Findings show that darker images were more frequent in negative
   ads-especially those linking Obama to crime-which aired more frequently
   as Election Day approached. We then conduct an experiment to document
   how these darker images can activate stereotypes, and show that a subtle
   darkness manipulation is sufficient to activate the most negative
   stereotypes about Blacks-even when the candidate is a famous
   counter-stereotypical exemplar-Barack Obama (study 2). Further evidence
   of an evaluative penalty for darker skin comes from an observational
   study measuring affective responses to depictions of Obama with varying
   skin complexion, presented via the Affect Misattribution Procedure in
   the 2008 American National Election Study (study 3). This study
   demonstrates that darker images are used in a way that complements ad
   content, and shows that doing so can negatively affect how individuals
   evaluate candidates and think about politics.},

Title = {Radicalised citizens vs. radicalised governments? Greece and Turkey in a
   comparative perspective from the December 2008 uprising to the 2013 Gezi
   Park protests},

Abstract = {This paper examines the semantic contestation between radicalisation as
   hope/fear by exploring, in a comparative perspective, two significant
   events in Greece and Turkey that paved the way for a series of
   transformative processes in both societies and the wider region: the
   December 2008 uprising and the 2013 Gezi Park protests. Making the case
   for the value of such comparison, the paper argues that Greece and
   Turkey between the years of 2008 and 2014 represent paradigmatic cases
   of the radicalisation processes of both governments and citizens within
   the context of contemporary liberal democracies. However, in contrast to
   the constant use of `radicalisation' as an accusation addressed by those
   governments and media against the dissenting segments of their
   societies, radicalisation, the paper argues, appears more as a growing
   intensification of the illiberal/conservative traits of state
   apparatuses during the same period. The paper concludes by assessing the
   effects, predicaments and prospects of the above processes in relation
   to democratic politics in both countries, also taking into account the
   latest electoral developments in 2015.},

Abstract = {Equal Opportunities Commission v Director of Education marks an
   important milestone in the history of Hong Kong's anti-discrimination
   movement. Prompted by a decades-old public policy allocating secondary
   school places to primary six students it believed to be discriminatory
   against girls, the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) successfully
   challenged the now defunct government practice under the Sex
   Discrimination Ordinance (SDO). Based on this symbolic and educational
   decision, this chapter will begin by summarising the fact of the case,
   followed by an analysis of the claims in question and the meaning of sex
   discrimination. It will then discuss the value of equality, including
   its various rationales including ``formal equality{''}, ``treating like
   alike{''}, and ``equal opportunities{''}. It will argue that, despite
   its universal appeal, equality as a policy justification can be both
   elusive and politically sensitive. Citing examples from Hong Kong and
   overseas jurisdictions, this chapter argues that an apparently benign
   anti-discrimination measure can in some cases generate difficult ethical
   dilemmas and controversies. Drawing on the plights of ethnic minority
   students in Hong Kong, this chapter will end with an observation that
   substantive equality requires proactive measures to help those whose
   existing disadvantages prevent them from competing fairly in society.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the European Union (EU)'s engagement with the
   Israeli-Palestinian conflict and highlights the unintended consequences
   of the policies pursued by Brussels on this matter. While stressing that
   Palestinians and Israelis interested in peace face the danger of the
   banalization of the conflict, the article argues that the current status
   quo is unacceptable and unstainable in the long run, and this demands
   new policies from the actors involved with the conflict or its
   resolution. The EU policies' overall rationale must be to treat the
   IsraeliPalestinian dispute as a normal, non-exceptional conflict, in
   which economic and legal tools can be employed to create new legal facts
   on the ground. An alternative EU approach to the conflict must recognize
   the insufficiency of recent initiatives and should be built upon two
   pillars: the legalization of the main contending issues and the
   empowerment of the civil society actors and initiatives that foster
   dialogue between Palestinians and Israelis.},

Volume = {22},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In the case of Taiwan, experts have debated whether passionate national
   loyalties (Taiwanese or Chinese) facilitated or stymied democratization.
   This paper argues that nationalism facilitated political change in
   Taiwan. In fact, democratization during the 1980s and the 1990s was
   spurred in part by the pursuit of two conflicting national destinies.
   The Chinese Nationalist Party legitimized reform as the end of a
   century-long process for the reconstruction of the Chinese nation. To
   many Nationalists, particularly those born on the mainland, Taiwan was
   the fulfilment of Sun Yat-sen's vision of China known as the Three
   Principles of the People. At the same time, many opponents of the regime
   saw successful reform as one step towards the realization of a Taiwanese
   nation. Dominated by those who identified themselves as Taiwanese,
   generally those of Chinese descent whose ancestors had lived on Taiwan
   prior to 1945, these activists hoped to take power through the ballot
   box, then implement a series of policies to strengthen an island-wide
   identity.},

Abstract = {We present new methods to estimate causal effects retrospectively from
   micro data with the assistance of a machine learning ensemble. This
   approach overcomes two important limitations in conventional methods
   like regression modeling or matching: (i) ambiguity about the pertinent
   retrospective counterfactuals and (ii) potential misspecification,
   overfitting, and otherwise bias-prone or inefficient use of a large
   identifying covariate set in the estimation of causal effects. Our
   method targets the analysis toward a well-defined ``retrospective
   intervention effect{''} based on hypothetical population interventions
   and applies a machine learning ensemble that allows data to guide us, in
   a controlled fashion, on how to use a large identifying covariate set.
   We illustrate with an analysis of policy options for reducing
   ex-combatant recidivism in Colombia.},

Abstract = {This article explores strategies in consensus-making processes in
   international climate diplomacy. Specifically, it examines the
   consensus-making politics, in the case of negotiating historical
   responsibility within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. In
   doing so, analytical concepts from the discourse theory of Laclau and
   Mouffe are utilized to look for rationales that underpin discursive
   structures as well as agreement. To conclude, three rationales have
   dealt with conflicts over historical responsibility. While the first
   rationale hid conflict behind interpretative flexibility, the second
   reverted to ``reasoned consensus,{''} excluding perspectives commonly
   understood as political rather than scientific. The third rationale has
   enabled equivocal use of the concept of historical responsibility in
   several parallel discourses, yet negotiators still stumble on how to
   synthesize these with a potential to foster future, more
   policy-detailed, consensuses with higher legitimacy. Understanding the
   history and current situation of negotiations on historical
   responsibility from this perspective can help guide policy makers toward
   decisions that avoid old pitfalls and construct new rationales that
   generate a higher sense of legitimacy.},

Abstract = {We study the effects of treaty design and domestic institutional hurdles
   on the ratification behavior of states with respect to multilateral
   environmental agreements (MEAs). Specifically, we examine whether (1)
   strong legality mandated by a treaty such as precisely stated
   obligations, strong monitoring/enforcement mechanisms, and dispute
   resolution procedures, and (2) high domestic constitutional hurdles such
   as requirements for explicit legislative approval deter countries from
   ratifying a treaty. To test our theoretical claim, we use a new
   time-series-cross-sectional dataset that includes information on the
   ratification behavior of 162 countries with respect to 220 MEAs in
   1950-2000. We find that treaties that are characterized as `hard' indeed
   deter ratification. Furthermore, explicit legislative approval requiring
   supermajority also makes treaty ratification less likely.},

Abstract = {Scholars concur that conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs have a
   strong proincumbent effect among beneficiaries. Although no study has
   properly focused on the overall effect of cash transfers on incumbents'
   national vote shares, most scholars have deduced that this effect is
   positive; i.e., that cash transfers lead to the expansion of incumbents'
   electoral bases. This article analyzes survey data from nearly all Latin
   American countries and confirms that beneficiaries of CCT programs are
   more likely to support incumbents. However, it also shows that CCT
   programs may induce many voters who were previously incumbent supporters
   to vote for the opposition. As a consequence, the overall impact of cash
   transfers on incumbents' vote shares is indeterminate; it depends on the
   balance between both patterns of behavioral changes among voters. This
   study is the first to report evidence that cash transfer programs may
   have significant anti-incumbent effects.},

Abstract = {The stability of abortion opinions suggests that pre-adult factors
   influence these attitudes more than contemporaneous political events.
   Surprisingly, however, we know little about the origins of abortion
   opinions, no doubt because the majority of research focuses on
   cross-sectional analyses of patterns across cohorts. We use a
   developmental model that links familial and contextual factors during
   adolescence to abortion attitudes years later when respondents are
   between 21 and 38 years old. Findings show that religious adherence and
   maternal gender role values are significant predictors of adult abortion
   opinions, even after controlling for contemporaneous religious adherence
   and the respondents' own views on gender roles. Adolescent religious
   adherence matters more than religious denomination for adult abortion
   attitudes. The results have important implications for future trends in
   abortion attitudes in light of declining religiosity among Americans.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the research presented by contributors to this special issue,
   this article assesses the analytic opportunities that emerge when the
   Arab uprisings are conceptualized as moments of transformation rather
   than as incipient, flawed or failed transitions to democracy.
   Highlighting critical issues that cut across and link the experiences of
   political relevant elites (PREs) and mobilized publics in the cases of
   Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, and Yemen, it identifies three sets of issues
   that warrant further comparative research: the effects of stateness and
   patterns of state-society relations on the trajectory of Arab uprisings;
   the role of identity politics and non-state forms of solidarity as
   drivers of political mobilization and collective action, and the impact
   of these forms of collective action on possibilities for establishing
   stable, legitimate forms of governance; and the limits of civil
   societies and civic sectors in influencing transformational processes.},

Abstract = {In this chapter the authors assess the application of the circular
   migration framework to the six Gulf Cooperation Council member states of
   Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Oman. By
   some estimations, the six GCC states comprise the third largest
   migratory destination in the contemporary world, and for decades these
   states have hosted large transient migrant populations that, in some
   manner or another, appear to fit the definition of circular migration.
   Through an analysis of migration to the Gulf States this chapter
   provides an empirical contribution to the expanding discussion of
   circular migration. In this chapter the nexus between the Gulf migration
   system and the circular migration framework is configured around two
   focal points. After an overview of migration in the Gulf States, the
   authors first examine the policy frameworks that regulate and govern
   migration to the GCC. Second, using an ethnographic lens, the authors
   explore the experiences of the migrants at work in the region. They
   conclude with a discussion of the implications of promoting the circular
   migration framework in the region.},

Abstract = {This chapter investigates the representation of Portuguese women through
   a study of executive politics, the women's movement, and gender policy
   making in Portugal since 1986, when the country became a member of the
   European Union (EU). Over the past three decades, the EU has gradually
   become a dynamic gender-policy actor, obliging member countries to align
   their policies and legislation with the European acquis communautaire,
   the ``body of common rights and obligations that is binding on all the
   EU member states,{''} on gender. In Portugal, this ``Europeanization{''}
   has led to the creation and institutionalization of governmental gender
   actors. This development, however, has been uneven. Conservative prime
   ministers have often adopted gender legislation in response to EU
   pressures, but policy implementation has sometimes not occurred until
   power shifted to the left. This chapter examines the interactions among
   the prime minister and cabinet (the center of executive power), the
   women's movement, and the parties to better understand why (and how)
   executive officials ostensibly provide women with representation,
   adopting policy congruent with the acquis communautaire, even as they
   resist implementing that same policy.},

Journal = {MEDITERRANEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {21},

Pages = {364-386},

Abstract = {This paper applies the Europeanization toolkit' to EU democratization
   policies in Morocco within the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP)
   framework. To this aim, the bottom-up and top-down dimensions of
   EUMorocco relations are analysed diachronically both before and after
   the Arab Spring. The analysis shows that the Moroccan ruling elite has
   used the anchor to the EU as a survival strategy and that the EU has
   merely responded to Moroccan political liberalization rather than having
   influenced it. Therefore, the paper debates the extent to which the very
   notion of Europeanization might be used with respect to democratization
   policies in Morocco, and it shows an overturning of the senderreceiver
   relationship proving that Europeanization has been used instrumentally
   rather than having any autonomous supportive effect on democratization.},

Abstract = {Upon assuming the leadership for the second time in December 2012,
   Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for the formation of a
   ``democratic security diamond (DSD){''} to safeguard the maritime
   commons stretching from the Indian Ocean region to the western Pacific
   with four of Asia's most prominent maritime democracies - Australia,
   India, the United States and Japan - forming the points of the diamond.
   The Japanese leader explicitly called on these states to join forces to
   oppose Chinese ``coercion{''} and to defend peace, stability and freedom
   of navigation within the diamond. The rehashed quadrilateral concept
   raises a number of interesting issues relevant to the future security
   environment of the Indo-Pacific, and for Southeast Asia in particular.
   This article looks at Abe's idea of the DSD, why Japan has recently
   advocated for its formation, and why the United States, India and
   Australia are targeted as the potential members. The article then looks
   at the Abe government's greater willingness and capacity to play a
   meaningful strategic role in East Asia, applied to a DSD context. This
   is followed by an examination of Japan's interest in deepening
   cooperation with India and possibly seeking Indian support for the
   quadrilateral idea. It then assesses what role India might play and New
   Delhi's likely level of interest in joining such a grouping. Finally,
   the article argues key players in Southeast Asia will remain ambivalent
   about the prospect of a DSD founded on a burgeoning Japan-India
   bilateral relationship.},

Abstract = {A good deal of scholarship examines the effects of prejudice against
   blacks on public opinion and vote choice in the United States. Despite
   producing valuable insights, this research largely ignores the attitudes
   of Latinos-a critical omission, since Latinos constitute a rapidly
   growing share of the population. Using two nationally representative
   survey data sets, we find that the level of racial prejudice is
   comparable for Latinos and non-Hispanic whites. Equally comparable are
   associations between prejudice and political preferences: policy opinion
   and support for Obama in the 2008 presidential election. Our findings
   suggest that despite demographic changes, efforts to enact policies
   intended to assist blacks and elect black candidates will continue to be
   undermined by prejudice. That said, Latinos are more likely than
   non-Hispanic whites to support policies intended to assist blacks,
   because Latinos are more Democratic than non-Hispanic whites, more
   egalitarian, and less committed to the value of limited government.},

Abstract = {Public opinion polls consistently show that a growing majority of
   Americans support same-sex marriage. Critics, however, raise the
   possibility that these polls are plagued by social desirability bias,
   and thereby may overstate public support for gay and lesbian rights. We
   test this proposition using a list experiment embedded in the 2013
   Cooperative Congressional Election Study. List experiments afford
   respondents an anonymity that allows them to provide more truthful
   answers to potentially sensitive survey items. Our experiment finds no
   evidence that social desirability is affecting overall survey results.
   If there is social desirability in polling on same-sex marriage, it
   pushes in both directions. Indeed, our efforts provide new evidence that
   a national opinion majority favors same-sex marriage. To evaluate the
   robustness of our findings, we analyze a second list experiment, this
   one focusing on the inclusion of sexual orientation in employment
   nondiscrimination laws. Again, we find no overall evidence of bias.},

Abstract = {This forum provides commentary on five accountability articles in this
   issue. In response to those pieces, it advances the argument that the
   study of accountability through the framework proposed by Kramarz and
   Park (and demonstrated by the empirical articles) can uncover key
   political dynamics that drive the design of global environmental
   governance initiatives. The utility of the practical application of
   accountability measures to ensure good design, rather than proper
   implementation, is less clear. Using the framework to study
   accountability does, however, provide an opening for debates over
   initiative design that may lead to improvements in global environmental
   governance outcomes.},

Abstract = {Democratic institutions, ranging from constitutional provisions and
   electoral rules to judiciaries, have been important in improving the
   rights of citizens across the world. If institutions matter for human
   rights, then it stands to reason that institutions built specifically to
   protect human rights, like the human rights ombudsman, should matter
   too. Using a comparative case study approach, this article examines the
   effect of the human rights ombudsman at the regional level on several
   human rights measures in Latin America between 1982 and 2011. The
   results suggest that the presence of an ombudsman, and some of its
   design features, have had effects on some social and economic rights, in
   keeping with the broad mandate given to this office.},

   agreement},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {145-159},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {To be effective, a post-Kyoto climate agreement must secure significant
   greenhouse gas emissions reductions by all (key) emitters. Potent
   participation and compliance enforcement will be required to make it in
   every key emitter's best interest to participate in, and comply with, an
   agreement which specifies deep emissions reductions for all its
   signatories. This article considers the conditions under which potent
   enforcement would likely be politically feasible. Based on assessments
   of the current political landscape, and on the sets of constraints that
   characterize negotiations over enforcement systems, the article firstly
   finds that neither type of enforcement would be politically feasible if
   agreement is sought among all key emitters. Secondly, because
   participation enforcement is perceived as less legitimate than
   compliance enforcement, the coalition of countries prepared to accept
   the former is likely smaller than the coalition prepared to accept the
   latter. Thirdly, participation enforcement likely places stricter
   requirements on the coalition's membership and size. Thus, while
   compliance enforcement should in principle always be politically
   feasible among some coalition, reaching agreement on participation
   enforcement is less likely. To the extent that participation enforcement
   is politically feasible, however, an agreement which enforces the
   cooperation of all key emitters may be attainable.},

Abstract = {The literature increasingly acknowledges that international institutions
   do not exist in isolation, but regularly interact with each other. This
   interplay might induce influence, affecting institutions' development
   and performance. The following research adds to this debate by
   systematically analyzing the quantitative evidence on how institutional
   interaction drives institutional design from a network perspective.
   Using dyadic cross-sectional data on international environmental
   agreements in 1952-2000, the authors find support for their theoretical
   argument that regimes' similarity in design as captured by their degree
   of legalization strongly depends on institutions' interaction. However,
   while ``soft law'' disseminates between regimes that are well connected
   through direct or indirect links, this does not apply to ``hard law.''
   The authors explain this divergence with states' concerns about
   binding-law commitments and sovereignty costs associated with the
   latter. This research may have important implications for studies of
   international institutions and of network analysis in general.},
