Abstract = {In this chapter, the primary research question of the e2d project, the
   applicability and validity of evaluation tools, is applied to six cases
   of public consultations. Following the general idea of a twofold
   relativity theory of evaluating (e)-participation as outlined in Chap.
   2, three pairs of similar cases are subjected to evaluation from an
   organizer's as well as from a participant's view by means of different
   tools. As a result, it is recommended that in every case a verbal
   assessment should be made by external observers based on a template,
   which has been demonstrated here. In addition, a quantitative assessment
   of the same success criteria can be achieved by interviewing organizers.
   Because we found a high level of variance in the views of different
   organizers in different departments on the same consultation process, as
   many organizers as possible should be interviewed. Their views can be
   complemented by surveying participants, which leads to partly different
   results. The votes of participants are also influenced by the point in
   time at which the assessment is undertaken. In most cases, it is only
   possible to get citizens to assess the process as well as its output and
   outcome, but not the impact at the time of their participation, as often
   it takes several months until impacts materialize and participants
   cannot be reached anymore as they have not registered.},

Abstract = {This chapter analyzes the Web sites of the environment departments of
   European local government signatories of the Aalborg+10 Commitments. It
   represents an example of evaluating a first category of e-participation,
   that is, electronic access to information. The aim is to establish the
   extent to which the signatories make use of the Internet to promote
   e-participation and environmentally friendly behaviors among their
   citizens. Our results show that the developments in e-participation are
   higher in those areas just giving information than in areas of
   interactive communication. The Internet, as a tool to revitalize the
   public sphere, is still limited to those countries with higher levels of
   transparency and a culture of citizen engagement.},

Abstract = {Intervention studies have shown that eco-feedback is a useful measure
   leading to a reduction in energy consumption. Eco-feedback is most
   powerful if it is combined with goal setting, action-relevant
   information, and social comparison and if it is behaviorally relevant.
   Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) calculators are eco-feedback systems
   that are suitable for measuring the carbon balance of individuals and
   households. They also make it possible to measure the impact of
   activities aiming to reduce the carbon emissions of individuals by
   influencing behavior and changes in everyday life routines. Citizens
   participating in the e2democracy (e2d) project used such a tool over a
   period of up to 2 years. This chapter reviews the criteria followed to
   select the CO2e calculator and to adjust it for continuous measurement
   with various feedback functionalities. The different categories of CO2e
   measurement are presented, and how consumption, such as kilowatt hours
   (kWh), is converted into CO2e emissions is explained. The chapter also
   describes the actual functioning of the calculator, how participants
   interacted with it and the feedback provided to them. Finally, some
   challenges, such as the lack of data about emission factors (EFs),
   interpolation, validation, and comparability, are also discussed.},

Abstract = {The objective of this chapter is to ascertain whether the cooperation of
   citizens as participants of citizen panels has had a positive impact at
   collective level by contributing to the achievement of a 2 \% annual
   reduction in the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions in their
   city or region. This chapter discusses several challenges that emerged
   in the course of the analysis. These challenges suggest that a
   combination of different methodological approaches is the best option to
   assess the ecological impact of the citizen panels on the collective
   level. Results show that, depending on the kind of calculation, some
   panels met the reduction targets completely, others partially, and one
   did not at all. However, reductions in CO2e are the general trend, even
   in those panels that fail to achieve the target. So, altogether,
   improvements of the CO2e balances on the collective level have been
   achieved. An important finding is that the results of the panels
   (improvements or deteriorations) are the same after 1 year of measuring
   and after 2 years. So learning results are obtained in a single year and
   longer climate participation processes do not seem to be suited to
   achieving further savings, but to preventing relapse.},

   participation through a quasi-experimental field study of a set of
   exercises in the area of local climate governance. For this reason, the
   chapter outlines the development of public participation in climate
   governance and provides an overview of theoretical frameworks and
   assumptions linking citizen engagement and change processes at the
   individual and societal level. A special focus is on behavior change
   interventions and rationales behind the participation format of the
   local climate initiatives studied in the e2democracy field study.},

Abstract = {Like de Sade, Wollstonecraft's political imagination was powerfully
   influenced by Enlightenment materialism and the pre-Revolutionary
   oppositional culture of sensibility. Because of her own social and
   subjective formation in the margin of the gentry and upper middle class,
   and her philosophical and political opposition to a property system that
   trivialized women, Wollstonecraft rejected marriage as an institution
   and saw female sexuality as an ideology and practice used by the
   hegemonic order to oppress women in all classes. Her personal life, like
   her works, was a succession of essays in reformulating female sexuality
   for a revolutionized society of the future, necessarily requiring of her
   the risky role of revolutionary vanguard. That the risk sometimes proved
   too great should not prevent us from valuing and learning from the
   endeavour.},

Abstract = {The e2democracy project applies an integrative framework including an
   assessment of process, outcome and impacts for a longitudinal evaluation
   of citizen-government collaboration on local climate targets. This
   chapter analyzes the relation between project outputs, that is, the
   supply side of the process such as the quantity and quality of devices
   and products offered to citizens for information, communication and
   engagement, and the project outcomes, that is, the immediate effects of
   the output such as the number and activities of participants and their
   contributions. The paper first sketches the evaluation framework and
   specifies the inputs and activities that provided the basic setup for
   seven local (e-)participation processes before it describes the process
   output. Against this background eventually the outcome of the
   citizen-government collaborations including the final evaluation of
   output and process are presented.},

Abstract = {This chapter presents an evaluation approach and its application in the
   assessment of a collaborative type of (e-)participation with a focus on
   outcome and impacts. The European research project e2democracy offered
   the unique opportunity for a comparative, quasi-experimental field study
   of a set of seven local exercises in three countries with largely
   identical design. In each region, citizen panels collaborated with local
   governments on achieving local climate targets over a period of up to 2
   years. Common core elements of the participation process characterized
   by a combination of individual and collective components are explained
   and their potential effects and impacts are outlined. Checks for
   alternative explanations of impacts and potential biases caused by
   Hawthorne effects are addressed as integral parts. It is argued that
   this evaluation approach, based on a combination of methods and tools,
   will contribute to closing the evaluation gap in the practice of public
   (e-)participation.},

Abstract = {This chapter points out the upswing of citizen participation, the
   emergence of a broad range of participation forms, and the high
   expectations of the potentials of e-participation. Against this
   background, a twofold evaluation gap is identified: a lack of
   acknowledged success criteria and indicators and a lack of empirical
   studies analyzing, differentiating, and comparing ecologies of
   e-participation instead of undertaking isolated case studies. The second
   part reviews major types of evaluation criteria and different conceptual
   frameworks for evaluating e-participation processes. It concludes with a
   twofold ``relativity theory{''} of evaluation and proposes an adapted
   Input-Activities-Output-Outcome-Impact model for the comparative
   evaluation of e-participation through a quasi-experimental field study
   design.},

Abstract = {An important category of government-citizen interactions comprises
   various forms of citizen participation that can be described as
   cooperation, collaboration, or coproduction. The essence of such
   relations between public agencies and citizens is a collaboration in
   policy-making and the implementing of policy decisions on shared goals.
   Prominent collaborative (e-) participation models are participatory
   budgeting, citizen assemblies, citizen panels, community councils, round
   tables, and similar procedures, especially in domains such as urban and
   regional planning and local governance. Electronic communication and an
   expanding repertoire of Internet-based applications play an essential
   role in facilitating collaborative participation. Possible impacts can
   be increased influence of citizens on public decision-making and
   positive effects on the implementation of policies, on transparency,
   political culture, and the competences of participants.},

   But an immortal soul, not restrained by mechanical laws and struggling
   to free itself from the shackles of matter, contributes to, instead of
   disturbing, the order of creation, when, co-operating with the Father of
   Spirits, it tries to govern itself by the invariable rule that, in a

Abstract = {There is hardly any valid empirical evidence on whether citizen
   participation has an impact on the desired objectives. This chapter
   provides an answer to this question, taking as example seven citizen
   panels on local climate targets in Austria, Germany, and Spain within
   the e2democracy (e2d) research project. The citizen panels were part of
   collaborative (e-) participation processes of citizens and businesses
   with local governments aimed at reducing carbon dioxide equivalents
   (CO2e) by at least 2 \% per annum over a period of up to 2 years. After
   the first year, the majority of panelists in the five Austro-German
   panels achieved or surpassed the target; in both Spanish panels, less
   than half did so; after the second year, the percentages of target
   achievers somewhat declined. So, even though many participants achieved
   their reduction target, a considerable number of participants did not
   reach it or reduced their efforts in the second year. Across all seven
   panels, savings could particularly be achieved in the heating energy and
   electricity sections. In the fields of nutrition and consumer goods,
   there were even cases where emissions increased. For the mobility fields
   of private and public transportation as well as flights, no homogeneous
   tendencies could be observed among the panels. Overall, even though the
   size of countable CO2e reductions was not that high, citizen panels were
   particularly successful in achieving a reconsideration of the panelists'
   lifestyles and habits and, to some extent, encouraged effective change
   processes.},

Abstract = {Expectations have been high that offering online, that is, electronic or
   ``e{''}-communication channels in public participation will improve its
   outreach and quality. However, so far, there is no empirical evidence
   that confirms these hopes. Applying a variety of research methods, this
   chapter presents empirical findings on the advantages and disadvantages
   of online communication compared to face-to-face communication in six
   consultation processes and seven collaborative citizen panels. To
   control for contextual differences, one of the consultation processes
   has been set up paralleling online and face-to-face meetings. In this
   case, organizers showed a preference for face-to-face meetings as
   regards the content of contributions and the style of discussion. For
   the citizen panels, collaborating with local governments to achieve
   climate targets, impacts in terms of carbon equivalents (CO2e) savings,
   and dropout rates have been compared for parallel processes online and
   via telephone. These comparisons do not, however, deliver clear
   performance profiles of the communication channels or a generalizable
   assessment of their appropriateness for particular objectives. The
   factors influencing the choice of communication channels are complex,
   and the analysis shows that assessments depend on the type of
   participation and the role of an actor in the process as well as on time
   frames and contexts in which the assessments are made. Showing that none
   of the channels offers clear advantages over the other, we conclude that
   practitioners are well advised to follow a multichannel strategy and
   offer a media mix of online and traditional modes of participation.},

Abstract = {In her Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution, Mary
   Wollstonecraft identified herself as the owner of ``a philosophical
   eye{''}. This paper traces Wollstonecraft's engagement with, and debt
   to, contemporary historical writing, particularly that of the Scottish
   Enlightenment. Her book reviews and the two Vindications show her
   familiarity with such work, and her interest in histories of
   ``civilisation{''} which could also incorporate progressive histories of
   improvement in the condition of women. Contemporaries noted her ambition
   to write as a historian in the View, and it was here that she explicitly
   discussed the complex relationship between commercial civilisation and
   its manners, and the pursuit of political liberty and political virtue.
   Her view of material progress was ambivalent, in the doubts she
   expressed on the progress of manufacture and industry, though her call
   for the development of an enlightened political science, as committed to
   the transformation of manners as of political institutions, was clearly
   expressed. Her recognition of the significance of this historical
   perspective was one which she shared with many middle-class British
   Whigs and radicals by 1793.},

Abstract = {In the decades following World War II, the city of Kitakyushu in
   southern Japan gained an international reputation for its steel
   production and industrial pollution. But in the early 1990s, the city
   government (hereafter, ``City{''}) began to change its industrial
   structure and pursue a course of sustainability through environmental
   conservation, the promotion of environmental business, and welfare for
   local citizens. The Kitakyushu Eco-town Project, an initiative aimed at
   promoting environmental business such as polyethylene terephthalate
   (PET) bottle recycling and home appliance recycling, was started in 1997
   to effectively utilise reclaimed land in Hibikinada, located in the
   northwestern part of the city. The concept for utilising reclaimed land
   was discussed within the public sector (Committee for Hibikinada Basic
   Development Plan), and specific contents were conceived by the private
   sector (study group and advisory committee). Pressure from incumbent
   personnel, namely insiders with new ideas in established private and
   public institutions, was important in facilitating the transition. In a
   short period of time, the Eco-town has expanded domestically, both
   geographically and in terms of the scope of sectors represented, and
   overseas to China. The Kitakyushu Eco-town Project can be viewed as a
   catalyst of Kitakyushu's transition from an industrial city to a green
   city. The public-private collaborative networks and individual expertise
   developed through this project have had a longstanding influence on the
   design of subsequent projects such as Environmental Model City and Smart
   Community projects.
   In this case study, the authors analyse, through document analysis and
   interview surveys, the transition process Kitakyushu followed from an
   industrial city with controlled pollution to a green city with a strong
   focus on the promotion of environmental industry and sustainability with
   multiple dimensions including environment, healthcare, and economic
   values.},

Abstract = {In both Europe and Japan, city networks have emerged aiming at
   supporting cities to collectively address sustainability challenges. In
   this chapter, we introduce four such city networks: the MUSIC network in
   Europe and the Eco-model City, the ``Future City{''} Initiative, and the
   Green and local autonomy model city in Japan. The numerous
   sustainability challenges of the networked cities include the reduction
   of CO2 emissions, the integration of sustainability in urban planning
   processes, or demographic change. Notwithstanding similar aims, these
   networks have a different setup and thereby illustrate different
   possibilities to address sustainability challenges on an urban scale
   through concerted action by a network of cities. The MUSIC network is a
   cooperation project among European cities and research institutes in
   Northwest Europe, with the aim to reduce CO2 emissions by 50 \% by 2030
   in the five European partner cities: Aberdeen, Montreuil, Ghent,
   Ludwigsburg, and Rotterdam. The Eco-model Cities, ``Future City{''}
   Initiative, and Green and local autonomy model city networks focus on
   innovating technologies, services, and business models as well as the
   socioeconomic and physical fabric of the cities to make them fit for
   addressing global developments. All four city networks systematically
   organise learning and exchange between the cities on their pathways to
   becoming more sustainable.},

   resulted in a new understanding of the city's persistent problems and a
   holistic perspective for future sustainability in the city. From our
   analysis, the successful output of the envisioning process was an
   integrative understanding of future aspirations that comply with
   sustainability values intergenerational justice, fairness, equity) and,
   in turn, created a momentum for inclusive social dialogue and mobilised
   networks to take the vision into practice.},

Abstract = {Our quickly changing world faces great challenges when it comes to the
   sustainable provision of energy, food, shelter, water and welfare to a
   growing urban population. These grand challenges are increasingly taken
   up by cities that become the places where sustainable futures are
   emerging. This chapter introduces the theoretical and practical
   transition perspective taken in this book and describes its structure
   and outline. It frames the dynamics in urban development from the
   perspective of sustainability transitions: deep systemic transformations
   that are the result of destabilising unsustainable `regimes' and
   emerging sustainable `niches,' driven by transformative agencies and
   networks. This perspective highlights on the one hand the complexities,
   uncertainties, and resistance that come along with urban transitions as
   well as the mechanisms and patterns that enable and accelerate them, and
   provides the basis for new types of governance. We then describe the
   structure of the book. It first elaborates upon the theoretical ideas
   and governance approaches related to sustainability transitions. It then
   draws upon empirical evidence from applied transition management in
   European and Japanese cities. In the final part of the book, the authors
   reflect upon these experiences, to what extent they are comparative, and
   what can be learnt in general with regard to implementing urban
   transition strategies.},

Abstract = {With increasing complexity, societal issues cannot be managed using the
   classical ``rules and regulations{''} associated with traditional
   government. Rather, they require more subtle, network-oriented
   arrangements such as transition management, in which policy makers are
   not the only partners, and not necessarily the leading partner either.
   This chapter takes stock of the experiences with five urban
   sustainability challenges from Japan and Europe to draft recommendations
   for practitioners to more effectively handle such issues. It also
   reflects on examples of when and why to use transition management
   specifically based on these experiences. These examples show the
   importance and potential of network hybridisation, in the broadest
   sense; network hybridisation has sectoral, administrative, niche/regime,
   and grassroots/incumbent dimensions, all of which can provide
   opportunities for transition. Regarding transition management, we learnt
   that information provided by scientists can act as a common starting
   point in arenas with diverse participants, who can use it to connect
   their own context and practice to the arena issue at hand. Furthermore,
   these cases suggested that striving for shared actions and connecting
   different problem orientations is more fruitful for transitions than
   striving for consensus.},

Abstract = {This chapter focusses on the dynamics of interactions among multiple
   niche-innovations and multi-regimes that occur under the pressure of
   slow but structural landscape changes. The energy transition, for
   example, is one of the core and broad changes that fundamentally impact
   not only the energy system but also systems of food, agriculture, and
   healthcare, as well as patterns of economic activity. Little work has
   been done on sustainability transitions that involve multiple
   niche-innovations, which may interact with each other as well as with
   regimes. This chapter investigates the case of the city of Higashiomi,
   Shiga, Japan, where a community business project called the ``Welfare
   Mall{''} clustered local production of food, energy, and elderly care in
   one shopping mall-like venue. The project is ongoing as of this writing.
   This chapter focuses on the common struggles and challenges of regimes
   in different domains under the pressure of fundamental landscape shifts.
   Using the concepts of multi-level and multi-regime, the central issue
   concerns how the bottom-up attempt of multi-niche innovations from a
   geographically local context interacts with multiple regimes. We
   identify the multi-niche as a nexus of geographic proximity and
   multi-domain interaction, and therefore as a typical example of urban
   transition. Furthermore, the case underscores the relevance of reflexive
   activities for urban transition management.},

Abstract = {Sustainability transitions pose novel challenges to cities that go
   beyond traditional planning and urban development policies. Such
   transitions require broader engagement, empowerment, and breakthrough
   strategies which enable, facilitate, and direct social innovation
   processes towards adaptive and innovative urban futures. The transition
   approach offers a set of principles, a framework, instruments, and
   process methodologies to analyse as well as systematically organise and
   facilitate such social learning and innovation processes. During the
   past decade, researchers and policy entrepreneurs around the world have
   been experimentally applying the transition perspective in practice
   under the label of `transition management'. This approach is based on
   bringing together frontrunners from policy, science, business, and
   society to develop a shared understanding of the joint complex
   transition challenge, to develop collective transition visions and
   strategies, and to start strategic experiments. In this chapter we zoom
   in on the different elements of transition management (i.e., principles,
   framework, instruments, process methodologies) and their heuristic and
   operational use in the urban context.},

Abstract = {In 2011, the city administration of Ghent started up the `climate arena'
   based on transition management (TM) to develop a plan and implement
   actions to work towards its ambition of climate neutrality by 2050 and
   to involve actors from the city in doing so. This chapter analyses the
   empowerment of the involved actors to discern long-term commitment to a
   transition to climate neutrality and draw lessons for TM. TM is found to
   yield initial `seeds of change' by creating new contacts and synergies,
   broadening problem perceptions, and contributing to intrinsic motivation
   to pursue the transition towards climate neutrality. There is a need to
   differentiate between the arena participants and involved policy
   officers: TM appears as effective tool to open up policy officers for
   more open and co-creative approaches as well as cross-departmental
   collaboration by broadened problem foci. Challenges regarding the
   longevity of empowerment effects on the arena participants point to
   lessons for TM, including the creation of space in the city
   administration before the process and facilitation `beyond the arena'.},

Abstract = {The French government addressed the question of sustainability
   transitions by organizing a national debate on energy transition at the
   end of 2012, driven by the Ministry of Ecology. The transition motif has
   also been taken up by local and grassroots actors and initiatives trying
   to converge in a cohesive society project. These two strands of
   transitions, one institutional, directed in a `top-down' manner, and
   another, a grassroots or `bottom-up' sort, question the potential for a
   dialogue to emerge between these two dynamics and their respective
   actors.
   This chapter draws on the case of Montreuil, the fourth most populous
   suburb of Paris, involved in a transition management process from 2011
   to 2014 as part of the elaboration of its Local Climate Plan. Based on a
   2-years' participant observation within the project team, the aim is to
   describe the adaptation of transition management to the French political
   context and to explore the possibility of `hybridisations' between
   `regime' and `niche' actors-between their roles, relations, and
   cultures.},

Abstract = {The principle of sustainable growth and development has influenced much
   of the environmental policies that have come into existence in the last
   three decades in the USA. Since the establishment of the U.S.
   Environment Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970, the regulations put in
   place have been increasingly stringent on the environmental standards
   they set over time. For instance, the Clean Air Act introduced in 1963
   and the Clean Water Act founded in 1948 have been amended multiple
   times, each time tightening the control on the type and amount of
   emission allowed into the environment. This has no doubt accrued much
   benefit to the society within the USA in the form of reduced morbidity,
   increased recreational opportunity, cleaner living environment,
   increased ecosystem vitality, and possible increased land values (Palmer
   et al. 1995). Such outcomes are essential for an environmentally
   sustainable future and are also the cornerstone of a society that holds
   itself accountable to future generations. However, at the same time
   concerns have also been raised as to whether these benefits are worth
   the cost of such regulations. In addition to the direct costs of
   pollution abatement, proponents of this view have blamed stifled
   economic growth, decline of labor and capital productivity, as well as
   loss of jobs on such increasingly stringent environmental regulations.},

   of fresh water and arable land, extreme weather, rising cost of relying
   on fossil fuels, and poverty and regional instability are drawing
   attention to the need for government intervention and policy instruments
   that encourage the development of sustainable alternatives.},

   on Policies for a Sustainable Future via Tablets in a Board of a Swedish

   OF BIG DATA AND OPEN GOVERNMENT},

Pages = {157-180},
Abstract = {Catering for sustainability concerns and enterprise mobility for
   administrations, handheld artifacts of Information and Communication
   Technology (e.g., tablets and smartphones) are making their way into
   organizational administration. Often such change is the result of
   decisions aimed at implementing policies for a more sustainable future,
   intending to support a shift from paper to digital. For this reason, a
   deeper understanding of tablets as the means to enable robust and
   efficient implementation of policies for sustainability is essential.
   This chapter examines how a decision made by one of the largest
   municipal boards in Sweden on reducing the use of paper in the
   municipality was implemented as an introduction of tablets in one of the
   municipal sub-boards, the board of one of the municipally owned housing
   corporations (HC), and how the decision prompted changes in the board
   work setup, raised issues concerning security and privacy of data while
   yet failing to implement most of the targeted sustainability policies.
   We adopt the Belief-Action-Outcome framework of Melville (MIS Q 31:
   1-21, 2010) as our theoretical lens on how the actual use of the tablets
   emanates from the social practices of the board, and how the
   implementation of the sustainability policy of the municipality thus
   affected the alignment of the board work and the organization's policies
   on sustainability. The empirical material consists of interviews and
   observations in the board of one of the municipally owned housing
   corporations. The contribution includes an account as to how a decision
   to implement policies for sustainability via new technology serve as a
   catalyst to establish and reproduce new setups and practices. However,
   in order to adopt the new technology, it may also partly or completely
   reinvent well-established practices without aligning it to the intended
   policies. Key highlights are the importance for decision makers to
   consider a broader context and to see the complexity of the practices of
   the organization, and the role this plays for the implications of making
   policies on organizational changes sustainable.},

Abstract = {As the impacts of climate change intensify, environmental scientists and
   earth system modelers are rapidly advancing our understanding of the
   complex dynamics of climate change. Although large quantities of
   high-quality climate data and climate science information are now
   publicly available, the usability of this information to policy-makers
   and other nonacademic decision-makers is limited. It is widely
   recognized that novel approaches to increasing the usability of climate
   science information and enhancing its influence in decision-making are
   needed. This chapter reports on a regional climate change impacts
   modeling project called BioEarth funded by the United States Department
   of Agriculture (USDA) and based at Washington State University, which is
   attempting to bridge the gap climate science usability gap. We consider
   the lessons learned in the course of BioEarth's stakeholder engagement
   efforts and reflect on how those insights may contribute to other
   initiatives seeking to develop and communicate useable climate science
   information. Lessons from BioEarth may be applicable to USDA's recently
   established Regional Climate Hubs, which are envisioned as
   internet-based centers that will deliver climate change data and
   analyses to farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners. This research
   contributes to the emerging field of policy informatics by exploring
   mechanisms by which climate science data and models can become more
   usable to decision-makers.},

Abstract = {Management of complex ecosystems is a difficult process that involves
   multiple factors and stakeholders. In most cases, the interactions of
   these factors and stakeholders' trade-offs are not considered
   quantitatively in the design and management of ecosystems. To address
   these issues mental modeling is useful for eliciting stakeholder
   objectives and preferences in order to evaluate preliminary knowledge
   about structure and function of complex ecosystems. This is advantageous
   for ecosystem analysis, modeling, and management.
   Here, we provide an assessment of stakeholder preferences and mental
   models for the case study of a large-scale watershed in Costa Rica
   composed by two rivers basins and one wetland. Trade-offs are related to
   water management in relation to ecological, agricultural, energy, and
   tourism endpoints that are affected by potential sets of dam and canal
   configurations. We apply and further develop a network-based model for
   stakeholder text analysis. Our innovation is the introduction of Network
   Complexity (NC) as a metric to characterize the inferred influenced
   diagram and to monitor the variation of such diagram under perturbations
   in socio-ecological factors provided by stakeholders and related to
   ecosystems. Perturbation effects-innovatively determined and assessed by
   global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses may reveal fundamental
   factor importance and interactions of ecosystem factors and ecosystem
   resilience. The derived influence diagram can be considered as the
   mental model of stakeholders because its construction is based on the
   direct elicitation of stakeholder preferences and objective in ad hoc
   workshops organized for this study.
   The decision analysis-based mental modeling approach allows a
   transparent and participatory decision-making concerning ecosystem
   management. The approach facilitates the identification and balance of
   trade-offs among stakeholder groups. Thus, it is coherent with the
   sustainability paradigm that includes social factors into the analysis,
   design, and management of complex systems.},

Abstract = {In this chapter, we explore the impacts of key characteristics of Supply
   Chain Governance Systems in the development and diffusion of technology
   innovations that promote supply chain transparency and sustainable
   consumption and production. The model presented in this chapter was
   developed following group model building methods. Our simulation
   experiments reveal that the market resists ``take-off{''} unless
   external financial support can be found. Additionally, ``take-off{''}
   dynamics of the system are dominated by marketing budgets and external
   support for infrastructure. Marketing budgets drive how fast users adopt
   the system, and without external sponsorship of system, the final market
   collapses. Finally, the quality of governance-reflected in information
   completeness, openness, relevance and reliability, and the resultant
   trustworthiness of information determines final sustainable market
   share.},

Abstract = {This research provides a comparative analysis of open budget portals in
   the context of budget transparency. Specifically, we examine open data
   portals in the Ministry of Planning, Budget, and Management in Brazil
   and the Finance Ministry in Kyrgyzstan. We utilize interviews with
   public administrators, archival information, and an analysis of the
   portals. Furthermore, we use Meijer's 2013 transparency theoretical
   framework to assess the relationship between budget portals and
   transparency in Brazil and Kyrgyzstan. The paper finds that both
   jurisdictions face similar challenges promoting online disclosure,
   including a lack of infrastructural development and a limited use of
   portals by the public. Although centralized online budget disclosures
   have not promoted a sense of transparency across the broader public, the
   media has used these disclosures effectively. This has led to a wider
   public discourse on budgeting in both countries. The authors highlight
   the specific roles played by the Open Budget Index and international
   players in advancing and sustaining budget transparency in these
   countries.},
